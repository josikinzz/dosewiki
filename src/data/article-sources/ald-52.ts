**1-Acetyl-N,N-diethyllysergamide** (also known as **ALD-52** , **1-Acetyl-LSD** , **1A-LSD** , **1A-LAD** , and mistakenly as **Orange Sunshine** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class that produces [LSD-like](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) psychedelic effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It's structurally related to psychedelic [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) and is reported to produce largely indistinguishable effects.

ALD-52 was originally discovered by [Albert Hofmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann) in his study of [LSD analogs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) , but it did not enter mainstream awareness until the 1960s through Western youth counterculture. ALD-52 gained public notoriety when it was supposedly distributed as LSD in the 1960s under the now-famous name "Orange Sunshine." This was later disproven ( [see section below](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ALD-52#History_and_Culture) ).

[Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) touches briefly on the subject of ALD-52 in the commentary section of [LSD-25](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) in the book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I have Known and Loved"). His writings are based on second-hand accounts which state that doses in the 50-175 µg range result in various effects that are not particularly distinct from LSD. His reports indicate that it produces less visual distortion than with LSD as well as less anxiety and tenseness, while also being somewhat less potent than LSD. Another report found the two substances to be indistinguishable.

As with LSD itself, ALD-52 does not meet the criteria to be considered addictive or toxic by the scientific community. Nevertheless, unpredictable adverse reactions such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) are always possible, particularly among those who are predisposed to psychiatric disorders. While these negative reactions or ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) can often be attributed to factors like user inexperience or improper preparation of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) , they are known to happen spontaneously among even highly experienced users as well. It is highly advised to approach this very potent, long-lasting [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) substance with the proper amount of preparation, and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction#Hallucinogens) if using it.

## History and culture

In 1968 and 1969, a famous batch of LSD known as "Orange Sunshine" was synthesized by Nick Sand and Tim Scully and made widely available in California. This "Orange Sunshine" was long held by the hippie generation to be ALD-52 until 2005, when it was revealed by Nick Sand that "Orange Sunshine" was just a particularly well made batch of LSD dosed at 300 micrograms per unit. This was confirmed by Tim Scully in a 2017 Reddit AMA, where Scully explained that the claim that "Orange Sunshine" was technically not LSD arose from an "ill-advised desperate defense strategy that failed miserably" during his trial for LSD manufacture.

## Chemistry

ALD-52, or 1-Acetyl-N,N-diethyllysergamide, is a semisynthethic molecule of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) chemical class. ALD-52 is a substituted derivative of lysergic acid. ALD-52's structure contains four rings, a bicyclic hexahydroindole fused to a bicyclic quinoline group. This core structure of ALD-52 is an ergoline derivative, and has [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) and [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) structures embedded within it. ALD-52 contains a N,N-diethylcarboxamide functional group bound to R 8 of the chemical structure. It is additionally substituted at carbon 6 with a methyl group.

ALD-52 is homologous to [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) , which contains a propionyl group bound to CH 3 CO- instead of the acetyl group bound to the same location. It is unknown how these differences account for differences in the two compound's activity.

## Pharmacology

ALD-52 through its metabolite [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) acts as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) at most [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) receptor subtypes, including the 5-HT 1A , [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor) , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 2C and 5-HT 6 receptors. It can also be expected to act as an agonist at dopamine receptors such as D 2 . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from ALD-52's efficacy at the [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor) , 5-HT 2C , and 5-HT 1A receptor subtypes.

ALD-52, alongside [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) and [1B-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1B-LSD) , act as [prodrugs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , though it is unclear as to whether it is capable of exerting its own effects as a parent substance. It has been found that ALD-52 metabolizes into two distinct metabolites, *N* -deethyl ALD-52 and *N 6* -demethyl ALD-52 (nor-ALD-52) in addition to its' primary metabolite [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . ALD-52 is metabolized by CYP3A4 which does the *N 6* -deallylation. Additionally, CYP2D6 is involved in the hydroxylation process.

## Subjective effects

Anecdotal reports from many users suggest that the effects of ALD-52 are virtually identical to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , ALD-52 is significantly more stimulating and fast-paced regarding the specific style of its physical and cognitive effects, as is the case with other [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) . [*clarification needed*]

Anecdotal reports from the community tend to report ALD-52 as being slightly less potent and visual, with a mellower, less [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) -provoking headspace that comes at the expense of less depth, giving it the reputation for being a more recreational variant of LSD. It has been speculated that this is due to a slightly extended, less jarring [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) period that allows the user to become more acclimated to the changes in head space. As one increases the dose, it is reported to lose this character and converge with the effects of a high-dose LSD experience.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, ALD-52 produces stimulating effects similar to LSD. This is in distinction to other, more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) which are more consistent in producing [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [relaxedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of ALD-52 can be characterized as proportionally very intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a euphoric, fast-moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different, unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most, it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. At moderate to high doses of ALD-52, this sensation often approaches its highest level and can become so overwhelming that people may find themselves writhing on the floor in pleasure. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - It should be noted that this effect is not as reliably induceable as it is with substances like [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , and can just as easily manifest as physical discomfort without any apparent reason.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensations are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most ALD-52 trips. If [level 8A geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) is reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person's entire body all at once is consistently present.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually occurs during and up to the peak of the experience or directly afterwards. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable in its sensations and even peaceful.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes instantly soon after the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This is generally mild in comparison to the stamina enhancement produced by traditional [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect is significantly less pronounced than it is with [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and its related compounds, the four-position [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine#List_of_substituted_tryptamines) .
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - Although no cases of ALD-52 induced seizures have been documented, it is likely to have a similar seizure risk as LSD. LSD is believed to lower the seizure threshold, although seizures are very rarely reported and believed to only be a risk to those who are predisposed to them, particularly in combination with physically taxing conditions such as dehydration, undernourishment, overheating, or general fatigue. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)** - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect is often reported to be brighter but not as varied in its character.
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed and cartoon-like in its appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in appearance.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry encountered on ALD-52 can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity.
 
In the case of higher level geometry, this substance is [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) dominant but is also capable of inducing [8B Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) under the right circumstances.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
ALD-52 is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics, specifically tryptamines like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) or [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Although ALD-52 is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) in its vividness and intensity, these effects are incredibly rare and inconsistent in comparison. While traditional psychedelics such as [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and above, ALD-52 will for most simply go straight into [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, ALD-52 is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics. On the rare occasion that they are induced, however, they can be comprehensively described in terms of their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in appearance.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of ALD-52 can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , ALD-52 is significantly more stimulating and fast-paced in terms of the specific style of thought streams produced and contains a large number of potential effects that is attributed to its binding activity at a wide range of [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) receptors other than [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , specifically [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) . The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - These effects are reported to be not as common at low to moderate doses and is less likely to occur when the basic rules of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are taken into account. It should be noted that this inconsistently induced effect is seemingly more likely to manifest when used with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . ALD-52 is often reported as producing less anxiety, particularly during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Come_up) phase, relative to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This component is, generally speaking less consistent and pronounced than it is with substances like [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . The mental euphoria experienced on LSD is usually simply due to an enhancement of the user’s current psychological and emotional state coupled with its more regularly occurring effect, [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) .
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Ego replacement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_replacement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This effect is experienced exclusively on low or [threshold](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#Threshold) dosages and feels less forced than it does with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - This can manifest prominently during a ALD-52 experience, particularly during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) phase, often resulting in bouts of uncontrollable giggles and laughter that can form a feedback loop if around others who are also under the influence.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Multiple thought streams](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Multiple_thought_streams)**

- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol's central depressant effects can counteract some of the anxiety and bodily tension produced by ALD-52. However, alcohol can cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively impact the tone of the trip. Users are advised to pace themselves and drink a portion of their usual amount.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines are highly effective at reducing the intensity of ALD-52's effects through the general suppression of brain activity.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis strongly intensifies the sensory and cognitive effects of ALD-52. Extreme caution is advised when using this combination as it can significantly increase the chances of a negative psychological reaction like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - ALD-52 enhances the cognitive, visual and general hallucinatory effects of dissociatives. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) and [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) become more vivid and intense on ALD-52. These effects correspond with an increased risk of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - ALD-52 and MDMA are highly synergistic and mutually enhance each other's physical, cognitive, and visual effects. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable so it is advised to start with markedly lower doses than one would take for each individually. There is some evidence that suggests that co-administration of LSD with MDMA increases the neurotoxicity of the latter, and this may extend to A and this may extend to ALD-52.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational ALD-52 use do not appear to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because ALD-52 is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a very limited history of human use.

Anecdotal evidence from people within the community who have tried ALD-52 suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be conducted to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

As with other psychedelic substances, there are relatively few physical side effects that have been reported associated with acute ALD-52 exposure. Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is likely that as with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) itself, ALD-52 is able to be considered non-addictive, with an extremely low toxicity relative to dose. It is also likely that as with LSD, there are little to no negative physical, cognitive, psychiatric or other toxic consequences associated with acute ALD-52 exposure.

However, as with LSD and psychedelics in general, it is possible that ALD-52 can act as a potential trigger for those with underlying psychiatric conditions. It is advised to be extremely cautious if it is known that a family member has bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder as those with a personal or family history of mental illness are generally advised not to use this substance, particularly outside of a supervised medical setting.

It is strongly recommended that one uses [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that like LSD itself, ALD-52 is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of ALD-52 is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). ALD-52 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the use of ALD-52 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

The LD 50 of ALD-52 is unknown. Adverse psychological reactions are common especially at higher doses. Some of these include [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and more rarely [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . Medical attention is usually only needed if suspected of severe psychotic episodes or “fake acid” (such as [25i-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25i-NBOMe) or [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) ). Administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) may help to relieve the negative cognitive effects.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of ALD-52. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

ALD-52 is currently a gray area compound within many parts of the world. This means that it is not known to be specifically illegal within most countries, but people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analog laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Austria** : ALD-52 is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD.
- **Denmark** : ALD-52 is not listed as an illegal substance in Denmark, and its chemical class 'lysergamide' is not banned under the Analogue Act (Some LSD analogues are, however, prohibited).
- **Germany** : ALD-52 is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Latvia** : ALD-52 is illegal in Latvia. Although it isn't officially scheduled, it is controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.
- **Poland** : ALD-52 is a NPS class drug in Poland, making it illegal to possess or distribute.
- **Singapore** : ALD-52 is a Class A controlled substance.
- **Switzerland** : ALD-52 is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** : As of January 7, 2015, ALD-52 is specifically named in the U.K. Misuse of Drugs Act as a Class A controlled substance..
- **United States** : ALD-52 is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or scientific research could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALD-52*

ALD-52, also known as 1-acetyl-LSD (1A-LSD) and falsely as "Orange Sunshine", is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a readily converted prodrug of LSD and hence has very similar properties to those of LSD, including in terms of onset, duration, and subjective psychedelic effects. LSD itself acts as a non-selective agonist of serotonin and dopamine receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, and this mediates its hallucinogenic effects. ALD-52 is a 1-acyllysergamide, specifically the 1-acetyl derivative of LSD, and is closely related to other 1-acyllysergamide LSD prodrugs, such as 1P-LSD, 1V-LSD, and 1cP-LSD. The drug has about 90 to 100% of the potency of LSD.
ALD-52 was first described in the literature by Albert Hofmann and colleagues at Sandoz in 1957. It was once claimed that the "Orange Sunshine" LSD distributed by Tim Scully and Nick Sand during the 1967 Summer of Love in the United States was actually ALD-52 rather than LSD, but this turned out to be untrue. ALD-52 was first definitely encountered as a novel designer drug in 2016. The drug is a key parent compound and inspiration for the 1-acyllysergamide prodrugs like 1P-LSD that were developed by Lizard Labs and emerged as designer drugs in the mid-2010s.

## Use and effects

ALD-52 was long thought to be a readily converted prodrug of LSD. However, this was not empirically confirmed until formal studies were finally done in the 2010s and 2020s.
ALD-52 was clinically studied and found to produce psychedelic effects similar to those of LSD itself and to closely match the time–course of LSD in terms of onset and duration. However, in one study, it was claimed that ALD-52 seemed to modify cognition and body image to a greater extent than LSD. Both LSD and ALD-52 were reported to be active at doses of 0.5 to 1 μg/kg orally (35–70 μg for a 70-kg person). Other sources found that ALD-52 was 91% as potent as LSD (with LSD notably having 88% of the molecular weight of ALD-52) or that the two drugs were equipotent.
In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin briefly discusses ALD-52, giving a dose range of 50 to 175 μg orally and no onset or duration mentioned. In other publications however, he gave a dose range of 100 to 200 μg orally. A few different individual accounts of the effects of ALD-52 were described by Shulgin. One account found that there was less visual distortion than with LSD, that there was seemingly less anxiety than with LSD, and that it was somewhat less potent than LSD. Another claimed that it was more effective than LSD in increasing blood pressure. One account could not tell ALD-52 and LSD apart. Per Shulgin, if ALD-52 is a readily converted prodrug of LSD, then they should be equivalent in all regards (aside from a slight difference potency).

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

ALD-52 is a readily converted prodrug of LSD and hence has similar pharmacology to LSD. This has been confirmed with human liver enzymes in vitro and in rodents in vivo, but still needs to be confirmed with a clinical study in humans in vivo.
In early studies, ALD-52 was found to have 19 or 20% of the toxicity of LSD in rabbits given intravenously, 12.5 or 13% of the pyretogenic effect of LSD in rabbits, and 2.0 to 2.1 times the antiserotonergic activity of LSD in the isolated rat uterus in vitro.
The receptor interactions of ALD-52 have been studied. The drug shows dramatically reduced affinities for the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors compared to LSD itself. It also showed markedly reduced activational potency and efficacy at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor relative to LSD, whereas agonistic activity at the serotonin 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors was lost entirely.
An early study reported that ALD-52 surprisingly did not produce the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in mice. It was subsequently suggested that this could be due to species differences in the metabolism of ALD-52. However, later research found that ALD-52 does indeed produce the head-twitch response in mice and that the earlier findings were erroneous. ALD-52 had about 45% of the molar potency of LSD in inducing the head-twitch response, whereas 1P-LSD had about 38%, 1V-LSD 36%, and 1cP-LSD 31% of the molar potency of LSD in this assay.

### Pharmacokinetics

The preclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of ALD-52 have been studied. A large percentage of the total dose of both ALD-52 and 1P-LSD is metabolized into LSD in rodents. Circulating levels of LSD following subcutaneous injection in rodents are virtually identical with administration of ALD-52 and 1P-LSD. The formation of LSD from ALD-52 could be largely blocked by the strong cytochrome P450 inhibitor ketoconazole in a human liver enzyme system in vitro, with CYP3A4 specifically appearing to be responsible for ALD-52 deacetylation into LSD.

## Chemistry

ALD-52, also known as 1-acetyl-N,N-diethyllysergamide or as 1-acetyl-LSD (1A-LSD), is a substituted lysergamide and a 1-acyl derivative of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; N,N-diethyllysergamide), more specifically the 1-acetyl analogue of LSD.

### Properties

The chemical stability of ALD-52 has been studied and described.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of ALD-52 has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of ALD-52 (1A-LSD) include MLD-41 (1-methyl-LSD), OML-632 (1-hydroxymethyl-LSD), ALA-10 (1A-LAE), 1-formyl-LSD, 1P-LSD, 1cP-LSD, 1V-LSD, 1B-LSD, 1S-LSD, 1T-LSD, 1P-ETH-LAD, and 1cP-AL-LAD, among others.

## History

ALD-52 was first synthesized and described in the scientific literature by Albert Hofmann and Franz Troxler at Sandoz in 1957. The properties and effects of ALD-52 were studied and reported in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It is said to be unclear whether ALD-52 ever circulated as a recreational drug similarly to LSD in the 1960s or subsequent decades.
The LSD manufacturers Tim Scully and Nick Sand once claimed that the "Orange Sunshine" LSD they distributed during the 1967 Summer of Love in the United States was actually ALD-52 rather than LSD. More specifically, they had been apprehended by law enforcement in 1973 and the pair argued in court that same year that they had distributed ALD-52 rather than LSD. This was notable as ALD-52 was not a controlled substance and hence was not technically illegal in contrast to LSD. However, the prosecution argued that ALD-52 readily converts into LSD and that the synthesis of ALD-52 requires going through LSD as an intermediate. In addition, they tested a sample of supposed ALD-52 that Sand and Scully provided to them via a friend which inadvertently turned out to be LSD. The pair were found guilty, including of lying in court, and Scully was sentenced to 20 years in prison while Sand received 15 years in prison. Later, in the 2000s and 2010s, Sand and Scully publicly admitted that they had never in fact manufactured or distributed ALD-52 and that "Orange Sunshine" was LSD all along. They disclosed that they had unsuccessfully lied to the court in an attempt to exploit a legal loophole and avoid conviction and prison time, which they regretted. The subject of the "Orange Sunshine" LSD was covered in the 2015 documentary The Sunshine Makers by Cosmo Feilding Mellen.
ALD-52 was one of the earliest 1-acyllysergamides to be described. It is a key parent compound of the 1-acyllysergamide LSD prodrugs and served as inspiration for development of subsequent compounds of this series such as 1P-LSD, 1V-LSD, and 1cP-LSD, among many others. These LSD prodrugs were developed by Lizard Labs and emerged as novel designer drugs starting in the mid-2010s. ALD-52 itself was first definitely encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2016. Soon thereafter, it was encountered in Japan and Brazil. The detection of 1P-LSD slightly preceded that of ALD-52, having been first encountered in 2015. ALD-52 was thought to act as a prodrug of LSD since at least the 1960s. However, this was not definitely confirmed until formal studies were done in the 2010s and 2020s.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Austria

ALD-52 is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD.

#### Denmark

ALD-52 is not listed as an illegal substance in Denmark as of April 2019, and its chemical class 'lysergamide' is not banned under the Analogue Act (some LSD analogues are, however, prohibited).

#### Finland

ALD-52 is labeled a controlled psychoactive substance in Finland as of 2014.

#### Germany

ALD-52 is controlled under the NpSG as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.

#### Latvia

ALD-52 is illegal in Latvia. Although it is not officially scheduled, it is controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.

#### Romania

ALD-52 is illegal to produce or sell in Romania. It is not included directly in the list of controlled substances, but it is included in an analogue act. However, it is not, as of yet, classified as illegal to use.

#### Singapore

ALD-52 is a class A controlled drug, and is illegal to traffic, manufacture, import, export, possess, or consume in Singapore as of December 1, 2019, punishable with a minimum of five years' imprisonment and five strokes of the cane.

#### Switzerland

Since March 2018, ALD-52 is illegal in Switzerland and has been put in the RS 812.121.11.

#### United Kingdom

On June 10, 2014, the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that ALD-52 be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying it as ever having been sold or any harm associated with its use. The UK Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015 as part of The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2014.

#### United States

ALD-52 is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of LSD, a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or scientific use could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act however could be legal for medical and research uses like a research chemical.
