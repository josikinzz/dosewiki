**Methylnaphthidate** (also known as **HDMP-28** ) is a novel synthetic [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the substituted [phenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenidate) chemical class. It is a structural analog of the commonly prescribed ADHD drug [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) (e.g. *Ritalin* , *Concerta* ) that produces moderately [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

Like members of the [phenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenidate) class, methylnaphthidate is believed to act as a [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] However, it has been reported to display distinct differences in its subjective effects by not behaving as a traditional [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopaminergic) [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) . This has been speculated to owe itself to its appreciable effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) reuptake inhibition that is not observed in typical methylphenidate analogs. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of methylnaphthidate, and it has little history of human usage. It is sometimes commercially distributed as a grey-area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors alongside other [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) analogs like [ethylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethylphenidate) , [isopropylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Isopropylphenidate) , and [4F-MPH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4F-MPH) . It is highly advised to approach this and poorly understood stimulant substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if choosing to use it.

## Chemistry

The main structural differences between methylnaphthidate and [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) in chemical substance is the replacement of the core phenyl ring with with a napthalene group.

## Pharmacology

Methylnaphthidate is thought to act primarily as a [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) triple [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , meaning it effectively elevates the levels of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) throughout the brain and CNS by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally clear out these monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows these molecules to accumulate throughout the brain, particularly within the reward pathways in the brain, resulting in stimulating and euphoric effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This component has been reported by some as being uniquely pronounced in the -phenidate family. These effects might owe themselves to increased free-circulating serotonin in the blood, which would lead to sustained agonism at Serotonin-2B receptors on the heart.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be present, but less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate dosages as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - The euphoric rush associated with methylnaphthidate use (as result of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibition) ) is very short-lived and compulsive, similar to that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) .
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)** - This component can occur during the offset of this compound as a rebound effect which is usually equal in its intensity to the enhancements which occurred before it.
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational methylnaphthidate use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic and lethal dosages are unknown. This is because methylnaphthidate is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried methylnaphthidate suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

In terms of its tolerance, methylnaphthidate can be used multiple days in a row for extended periods of time, but acute tolerance does exist and builds up gradually over repeated extended use. This results in the user requiring an increase in dosage to achieve the same effects.

While generally considered less recreational, methylnaphthidate has potential for abuse on par with that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) due to its lack of significant tolerance, euphoric effects and action upon [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) transporters.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Methylnaphthidate should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Methylnaphthidate may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as serotonin to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **MDMA** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.
- **Cocaine** - This combination may synergistically increase strain on the heart to dangerous degrees.
