Psilocybin Mushroom
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[Psilocybin Mushroom Images](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_images.shtml)
 
There are dozens of species of psilocybin or 'magic mushrooms' belonging primarily to the genuses psilocybe, panaeolus, and copelandia (unrelated to [psychoactive amanita](https://erowid.org/../amanitas/amanitas.shtml) species). The effects of their ingestion resemble a shorter acting LSD trip, producing significant physical, visual, and perceptual changes. 
 
 Nearly all of the psilocybin containing mushrooms are small brown or tan mushrooms easily mistakable for any number of non-psychoactive, inedible, or poisonous mushrooms in the wild. This makes them somewhat difficult, and potentially hazardous, to identify. The primary distinguishable feature of most psilocybin containing mushrooms is that they bruise blue when handled. 
 
[ [Main Mushroom Vault](https://erowid.org/mushrooms.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_dose.shtml) #
 
Recreational doses range from 0.1-5 grams of dry mushrooms depending on the species and individual strength of the specimens. Dosages for wet mushrooms will be approximately 10 times higher (1 - 50 grams). Because different species vary in size, the number of mushrooms per gram will also vary. There is a wide range of potencies between species and within a single species from batch to batch or individual fruiting body (mushroom) to another.
 
Price #
 
$20-$40 per 1/8 ounce. $100 - $250 per ounce.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law.shtml) #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in the United States because they contain psilocybin and psilocin which are specifically listed as illegal (Schedule I).
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_chemistry.shtml) #
 
The primary effects of mushrooms come from several active alkaloids they contain; the most common are psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. Psilocybin is a more stable compound than psilocin, but is broken down into psilocin after ingestion.
 
Pharmacology #
 
Pharmacology Summary Needed.
 
Production #
 
Psilocybin containing mushrooms grow wild across the United States and in many countries around the world. There are also several species which are easily cultivated with a fairly simple and inexpensive setup. Most recreationally used mushrooms are cultivated rather than picked wild.
 
[History](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_timeline.php) #
 
Psilocybe mushrooms have been used for thousands of years by Native Americans in Central and South America. The first european record of their use showed up in the 16th century writings of a Spanish priest who wrote about the Aztec's use of both mushrooms and peyote. In 1957, Wasson became the first in modern times to document and publish a description of his own experience (Life Magazine). The active ingredient of the mushrooms, psilocybin, was soon isolated and by the mid 60's mushrooms were being both studied and used recreationally. In 1968 possession of psilocybin mushrooms was made illegal in the United States.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Mushrooms; Magic Mushrooms; Shrooms; Mushies; Boomers; Psilocybes; Cubes (P. cubensis); Liberty Caps (P. semilanceata)
 
The Experience:
 
Shrooming; Tripping.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_effects.shtml) #
 
In the beginning stages of onset, Mushrooms are likely to cause a sort of undefineable feeling similar to anticipation or anxiety. There may be a feeling of energy in the body, and the sense that things are different than usual. As the effects intensify, a wide variety of perceptual changes may occur; pupil dilation, visuals, mental stimulation, new perspectives, feelings of insight, quickly changing emotions (lots of laughter), possible paranoia and confusion. More advanced users may seek spiritual awareness or a sense of universal understanding through their use of mushrooms. Closed-eye visuals are extremely common with psilocybin mushrooms. Open-eye visuals are common for some people and are more likely at higher doses.
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, Mushrooms generally takes 30-60 minutes (though sometimes as long as 2 hrs) to take effect.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of magic mushrooms last for 4-6 hours when taken orally. For many people there is an additional period of time (2-6 hrs) where it is difficult to go to sleep and there is definitely a noticeable difference from everyday reality, but which is not strong enough to be considered 'tripping'.
 
Visual Effects #
 
With eyes open, at low doses and as effects begin, pupils dilate making lights and colors seem brighter. After that, colors can shift, with a melting or smearing motion of the visual field. Patterns can begin to form and surfaces that are normally unremarkable can appear to have byzantine detail. The brighter the ambient lighting, the less apparent these effects are. With eyes closed, flashes of color, lights, and patterns can become very prominent. With eyes closed, complete scenes can form, with dream like visualizations, memories re-experienced in vivid detail, etc.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Many people experience nausea and/or vomiting during mushroom experiences, epecially with higher doses. Other possible negative effects include anxiety and unwanted or frightening thoughts and visions. Mushrooms, though perhaps to a lesser degree than LSD, can precipitate strong, temporary changes in an individual's experience of life and reality. It can be a powerful psychoactive experience, especially at higher doses, which is significantly affected by experiences, set and setting. Recent experiences, especially strong ones, can have a substantial effect on a trip. Physically or psychologically unsettling events in the days before a Mushroom trip can blossom into more serious distress and trauma while tripping. It is important to be prepared for the possibility of encountering difficult or frightening mental states. The [Psychedelic Crisis FAQ](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml) addresses some of the issues involved in dealing with a difficult trip.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Taking psyilocybin containing mushrooms while on an MAOI can dramatically increase the effects of the experience. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as mushrooms as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because mushrooms have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Mushrooms are neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. Many people actually find that their desire to use mushrooms goes down for a period of time after use. As with most substances, some people will use them more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after Mushroom use. Using Mushrooms two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Psilocybin-containing mushrooms produce unique mental states, which are greatly effected by dose and an individual's sensitivity to psilocybin. For some rare people 0.25 of a gram of *Psilocybe cubensis* (a very small amount) is enough to propel them into full visionary states, with open eye visuals, unpleasant stomach cramps or gas, and other high-dose effects. For others, the same amount would be barely (if at all) noticeable, possibly causing a slight cold feeling during the first hour and other "threshold" effects. Wise users gauge their individual reactions to all entheogens by testing their reaction by ingesting only a small dose the first time. 
 
 Some of the following effects may characterize the respective levels presented. Please note that the minimum dosage indicated for medium and high doses are extremely low and those who reach these states with less than 1.0 gram of *P. cubensis* are rare. However, you may be one of them, so be careful. 
 
 Threshold Effects: (from 0.25 grams - 0.75 grams *P. cubensis* ) 
 Slight cold feeling, mild gas or nausea, feelings of nervousness, slight pupil dilation, mild visual changes including lights seeming brighter, lights having a "starry" look, and noticing movement at the periphery of vision, giddiness, feeling more emotionally sensitive, and other light effects related to a change in neurochemistry. 
 
 Medium Effects: (0.75 grams - 2.5 grams *P. cubensis* ) 
 "Cold" feeling, gas and/or stomach discomfort, nausea, pupil dilation, open eye visual effects: lights exhibit auras, star-pattern effects, rainbowing around lighting, lights seem brighter and often "more beautiful", notice movement in periphery, sometimes increased ability to focus, sometimes reduced ability to focus, visual field "distracting", visual field "entertaining", closed eye visuals: normal closed eye "blobs" take on patterns, shapes, distinct forms, increased ability to visualize creatively, spontaneous detailed images, feelings of time dilation, feelings of "coming home again" (often more pronounced for those who have used mushrooms before), feelings of belonging and connection, increased emotional sensitivity, increased ability to focus on emotional problems or memories, chance of thoughts becoming "caught in a loop" / dwelling on a single thought or feeling (usually negative or painful), realizations about past feelings, realizations about how to live, gain a new perspective on current lifestyle and behaviors, feelings of connection with others, noticing things that are normally ignored or taken for granted, feelings of wonder, spirit, joy, sadness, despair, religious awakening, contentment and possibly latent psychological crises can come out. 
 
 High Dose Effects: (2.5 grams - 10 grams *P. cubensis* ) 
 All of the Medium Effects, usually with a significantly more uncomfortable coming up, more pronounced nausea (rarely resulting in vomiting), sometimes significant mental discomfort associated with feelings of fear and oftentimes accompanying a "What have I done to myself?" or "How far am I going?" thought, the unpleasant coming up effects usually lessen with familiarity and more knowledge about the safety and character of mushroom effects. High Dose Effects are usually characterized by the closed eye visualizations being significantly more elaborate and enfolding, religious revelation, spiritual awakening, near-death experiences, loss of self, talking to seemingly external, autonomous entities, extreme emotional responses, repressed memories coming to life, latent psychological crises can come to the surface, an increase in artistic sense, and intense feelings of wonder, connection, joy, fear. High Dose Effects can also include extreme time dilation, with experiences of wall-clock minutes taking an experientially large amount of time, watching clocks or digital counters where the seconds seem to take minutes to count off. One of the most interesting effects is the feeling of awakening for the first time ever from a previous state of sleep, the feeling of liberation from what is now seen as a life-long state of misunderstanding. Paradoxically, it is this new awareness that feels normal and natural and the previous fog is seen to have been unreal all along. The bemushroomed seeker can be convinced that, once gained, this awareness is impossible to lose, but inexplicably by the next day it is just a memory.

Psilocybin, Psilocin, and Magic Mushroom Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
PSILOCYBE CUBENSIS
 Psilocybe cubensis is a medium strength psilocybian mushroom consisting of approximately .63% psilocybin and .60% psilocin in dried wild mushrooms. Indoor cultivated mushrooms tend to have higher concentrations. Note that potency of mushrooms can vary greatly from one batch to the next and from one part of a single mushroom to another part (cap and stem can have different concentrations). Because of these natural variations, chopping or grinding up multiple mushrooms and homogeninizing the material can help reduce the risk of unexpectedly strong (or weak) doses of psilocybin. 
 
 The following chart shows approximate oral dosages for common (dried) Psilocybe cubensis in grams. P. cubensis and other psilocybin mushrooms can vary in potency by as much as 10x.

Psilocybin Mushrooms
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Psilocybin Mushrooms**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: ContainsSchedule I Chemical
- CLASSIFICATION: Hallucinogen
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are not specifically named in the U.S. federal scheduling system, however their two primary active chemicals Psilocybin and Psilocin are both Schedule I in the United States. This means they are illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license. Fresh and dried psilocybin mushrooms are considered containers of Psilocybin and Psilocin, making them illegal to possess as well. 
 
 Because spores contain no psilocybin or psilocin, they are legal to sell and possess (in all states except California, Georgia, and Idaho). But in most states, it is illegal to cultivate or propogate spores into mycelium since mycelium generally contains both psilocybin and psilocin. 
 
 Psilocybin and psilocin, the active chemicals in these mushrooms, are being studied for medical utility around the world including in the United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, and others. The medical research may eventually result in changes to the legal status of psilocybin and/or psilocin. However the bad design of the United Nations 1970 Single Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the United States' worse Controlled Substances Act will inhibit and hamstring moving psilocybin out of the class of drugs that have near-total prohibition. 
 
 Some countries have ruled that growing psilocybe mushrooms does not qualify as 'manufacturing' a controlled substance (psilocybin). In 2005, a New Mexico state appelate court ruled that growing mushrooms did not qualify as manufacturing psilocybin under state law (see [State of New Mexico v. Pratt](http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll/nmcases/15517/1614a?fn=document-frame.htm&f=templates&2.0) , 2005 or [http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nm-court-of-appeals/1401800.html](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nm-court-of-appeals/1401800.html) ). In Feb 2006, the FMRC's *TEO* journal reported that the Pratt ruling was overturned and that people have been prosecuted for growing psilocybin mushrooms in New Mexico.(TEO Feb 2006). However, Erowid has not been able to substantiate FMRC's claim and to the best of our understanding, the Pratt appelate ruling stands. (last updated Jun 28, 2013)
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in every state in the United States except Florida. A few states and localities have decriminalized possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms. (see below). 
 An Overview of case law for several states can be [accessed here](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law4.shtml) . 
 
 Psilocybin Mushroom spores are legal to possess in every state except California, Georgia, and Idaho. (see [details](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law8.shtml) ). 
 
 
California (Oakland) #
 
The SF-Bay Area city of Oakland de-prioritized / decriminalized the possession of "entheogenic plants" including psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline-containing cacti, iboga, and DMT-containing plants such as those used in ayahuasca on June 4 2019 at 23:12 (11:12pm) on a "unanimous vote" (although it appeared at least one councilperson abstained. This effort was lead by [Decriminalize Nature Oakland](https://www.decriminalizenature.org/) . The Oakland resolution did not decriminalize opiate-containing plants. Congratulations to those who worked this successful campaign! The text of the resolution included: "RESOLVED, That the Mayor and City Council hereby declare that it shall be the policy of the City of Oakland that no department, agency, board, commission, officer or employee of the city, including without limitation, Oakland Police Department personnel, shall use any city funds or resources to assist in the enforcement of laws imposing criminal penalties for the use and possession of Entheogenic Plants by adults; [... and ...] RESOLVED That the Mayor and City Council hereby declare that it shall be the policy of the City of Oakland that the investigation and arrest of adult persons for planting, cultivating, purchasing, transporting, distributing, engaging in practices with, and/or possessing Entheogenic Plants or plant compounds on the Federal Schedule 1 list shall be amongst the lowest law enforcement priority for the City of Oakland; [...]" (last updated June 4 2019)
 
California (Santa Cruz) #
 
The SF-Bay Area city of Santa Cruz City resolved "to not expend City resources in the investigation and arrest of persons twenty-one (21) years of age and older solely for the personal use, personal possession, and personal cultivation of Entheogenic Plants and Fungi listed on the Federal Schedule 1 list and that such activities should be considered among the lowest law enforcement priorities..." on Jan 28 2020. [ [Santa Cruz City Council Minutes, Jan 28 2020](http://scsire.cityofsantacruz.com/sirepub/mtgviewer.aspx?meetid=1356&doctype=SUMMARY) ]
 
Colorado (Denver) #
 
Denver Colorado passed an ordinance ( [Ordinance 301](https://ballotpedia.org/Denver,_Colorado,_Initiated_Ordinance_301,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Initiative_(May_2019)) ) for the city that prohibits local authorities from enforcing criminal penalties for possesion of psilocybin-containing mushrooms. It is the first we know of this type of decriminalization for psilocybin mushrooms. The ordinance was passed on May 8, 2019. See [https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-magic-mushroom-denver-decriminalization-20190508-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-magic-mushroom-denver-decriminalization-20190508-story.html) .
 
Florida #
 
Florida stands out because of a decision in 1978 in [Fiske v Florida](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law3.shtml) by the Florida Supreme Court which ruled that wild-picked psilocybin mushrooms could not be legally considered "containers" of psilocybin and thus would have to be specifically listed in Florida law by the legislature if they meant to make them illegal. Since the Florida legislature has not chosen to change the laws since then, the possession of wild Psilocybin mushrooms is presumptively not punishable under state law. This does not mean police won't arrest people for possession of even wild mushrooms, but this has been used as a successful defense against such charges.
 
New Mexico #
 
New Mexico appeals court ruled on June 14, 2005, that growing psilocybin mushrooms for personal consumption could not be considered "manufacturing a controlled substance" under state law. See [Opinion: State of New Mexico vs. David Ray Pratt](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=nm&vol=05ca-099&invol=2) - June 14 2005
 
Oregon #
 
Oregon's citizens passed two ballot measures in 2020: Oregon 109 and Oregon 110. Oregon Measure 109 creates a legal framework to allow for licensed production, distribution, and therapeutic application of psilocybin. Oregon Measure 110 decriminalizes small amounts of all Schedule I and II substances under a new "Class E violation" (a civil violation, not a true crime), with a maximum of penalty of $100. OR Measure 110 also reduces criminal penalties for larger quantity possession of controlled substances from felony-level to a Class A misdeamenor (not a civil violation, a criminal act). See [Ballotpedia: Oregon Measure 110 (2020)](https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_110,_Drug_Decriminalization_and_Addiction_Treatment_Initiative_(2020)) and [Ballotpedia: Oregon Measure 109 (2020)](https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_109,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Services_Program_Initiative_(2020)) . Note that it is not legal to sell psilocybin mushrooms in Oregon (it is still a felony). On December 8, 2022, a store in Portland that had been openly selling psilocybin mushrooms was raided and shut down by local police. See [Portland Police Raid Shroom House Overnight](https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2022/12/08/portland-police-raid-shroom-house-overnight/) . (thanks bcs) (last updated Dec 8 2022)
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are not specifically listed by the [United Nations International treaties](http://www.undcp.org/un_treaties_and_resolutions.html) and the laws regarding them vary quite a bit around the world. States which are party to the UN Drug Control Program are free to decide for themselves whether to control them. 
 
 See European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction [Legal Status of Hallucinogenic Mushrooms](http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index17341EN.html) in the EU. 
 See A. Schouten's overview of the [international legal status of Psilocybin Mushrooms](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law11.shtml) .
 
Australia #
 
Psilocine and psilocybine are illegal to possess or sell under the Criminal Code Act of 1995 (CCA). We have received a report that harvested psilocybin-containing mushrooms are considered illegal "preperations" throughout Australia, and growing psilocybin mushrooms consitutes "manufacturing illegal drugs" and carries even higher penalties. (thanks Torsten) The mushrooms themselves are subject to specific controls in some states or territories. 
 
 "Any plant of the genus Psilocybe" is restricted under the "Border controlled plant" provisions of the CCA (see section 314.5 of the [Criminal Code](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/australia/australia_law1.pdf) ). This makes Psilocbye mushrooms illegal to import and export, and illegal to possess if they have been imported. We have received an unconfirmed report that it is possible to import or export of psilocybin mushroom spore prints for purposes of microscopy, though this technically may be a violation of the CCA (thanks A Moffett).

Psilocybin/psilocin and the mushrooms themselves are reportedly controlled in Belgium. (thanks D) (last updated Feb 24 2011)
 
Brazil #
 
Although psilocybin and psilocin are controlled substance in Brazil, mushrooms are not listed, and we have some indication that they may not be considered illegal. We received a report from a Brazilian public lawyer that psilocybin-containing mushrooms cannot be considered vessels of psilocybin and psilocin under Brazilian law, and are therefore not illegal. The Brazilian constitution does not allow punishment for any act that is not specifically forbidden. In addition, there is a legal precedent for the religious use of ayahuasca tea in Brazil. The sacramental use of psilocybin mushrooms is considered to fall under the same protection. (thanks Roldan, P, FB)
 
Canada #
 
Both Psilocybin and Psilocin are schedule III in Canada. (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules). See [Psychoactive-Related Laws for Canada](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/law_canada.shtml)
 
Denmark #
 
The Danish Ministry of Health declared that is would make psilocybin mushrooms illegal to possess, buy, and sell as of July 1, 2001. [http://www.stiften.dk/artikel:aid=23734](http://www.stiften.dk/artikel:aid=23734) ( [English Translation](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law7.shtml) )
 
Finland #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal to cultivate, possess, or sell in Finland. (thanks VG)
 
France #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal to cultivate, possess, or sell in France. Legal status of spores is unknown. (thanks ms) (last updated June 17, 2010)
 
Germany #
 
Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are treated as a controlled substance in Germany. Illegal to possess, sell, grow, or distribute. See [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/anlage_i_59.html](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/anlage_i_59.html) . There had been some confusion for years when some retailers sold fresh mushrooms in Germany between the late 1990s and late 2000s, but the German authorities have now shut down and prosecuted sellers openly offering psilocybin containing mushrooms. (thanks dp) (last updated Jun 20 2013)
 
Hong Kong #
 
Psilocybin is a controlled substance and the Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau considers psilocybin-containing mushrooms to be controlled under Schedule I, Part I, of the Dangerous Drug Ordinance. [Magic Mushroom, a dangerous drug](http://www.info.gov.hk/police/offbeat/731/eng/bottom.htm) , July 2002.
 
India #
 
Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are illegal in India, but in some parts of the country they are ignored by authorities, places like Old Manali, Karela (Idiki), and Kodaikanal. (unconfirmed) (thanks C)
 
Indonesia #
 
Although Indonesia's drug laws are extremely harsh, the psilocybin-containing local mushrooms on Bali seem to be ignored by law enforcement. (unconfirmed) (thanks l) (last updated Aug 22, 2012)
 
Ireland #
 
Following Britain's 2005 ban of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, Ireland banned the sale and use of psilocybin mushrooms in January 2006. See [RTE.ie : 'sale and use of magic mushrooms banned'](http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0131/mushrooms.html) (last updated Jan 31, 2006).
 
Japan #
 
According to Japanese news, psilocybin mushrooms have been outlawed specifically in Japan as of June 2002. Several visitors have written in to erowid to confirm this and have said that there have been a few busts reported. Before June 2002, psilocybin mushrooms were readily available in large cities in Japan from street vendors and specialty shops.
 
Netherlands #
 
Effective Dec 1 2008, a large number of psilocybin-containing mushrooms in several genera (Psilocybe, Panaeolus, Gymnopilus, etc.) are illegal to buy, sell or possess in the Netherlands, dried or fresh. (see [Telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/3441105/Magic-mushrooms-banned-in-Netherlands.html) , for a complete list of banned mushrooms see [Dutch schedules](http://wetten.overheid.nl/cgi-bin/deeplink/law1/title=Opiumwet) ). Psilocybin and psilocin are seperately controlled. See also [PDF of bill](http://www.minvws.nl/includes/dl/openbestand.asp?File=/images/vgp-2844534-532-bij-brief-ek-en-tk-b-_tcm19-165976.pdf) . Dried mushrooms are now considered "hard drugs" and possession of more than 0.5 grams can be prosecuted; fresh mushrooms are now considered "soft drugs" and possesion of more than 5 grams can be prosecuted : see [http://juridischdagblad.nl/content/view/7606/53/](http://juridischdagblad.nl/content/view/7606/53/) . The Dutch department of public health, grow-kits, sclerotia, and spores are not illegal, and the minister has no plans to legislate against such products in the near future: see [minvws.nl](http://www.minvws.nl/kamerstukken/vgp/2009/antwoorden-op-kamervragen-van-joldersma-over-hallucinerende-truffels-en-kweeksets.asp) . (Last updated May 6, 2009)
 
Norway #
 
Mushrooms that are dried, planted or otherwise "tampered with" and contain Psilocybin are considered Schedule I, and are illegal to buy or possess without a license. Pure Psilocybin is also Schedule I. [See Norway Law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/countries.shtml#norway) . (thanks Y)
 
Poland #
 
Psilocybin is schedule I (I-P group) in Poland. (unconfirmed)
 
Switzerland #
 
Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are controlled. In 2006, the "Sacred Mushroom Church of Switzerland" was raided and shut down and its operator, David Schlesinger, was arrested. See [http://cannabisculture.com/articles/4788.html](http://cannabisculture.com/articles/4788.html) .
 
Thailand #
 
Psilocybe cubensis, or "Psilocybine" or "Psilocine"-containing plants "including all parts e.g. flower, stem, spore." are illegal to possess or sell in Thailand, as of October 1988. [See UNDCP's Excerpt of law.](http://www.undcp.org/odccp/legal_library/th/legal_library_1990-07-05_1989-36.html)
 
United Kingdom (U.K.) #
 
Psilocybin and psilocin are both illegal to possess and sell in Britain. As of July 18, 2005, fresh psilocybin mushrooms are now also controlled. See [U.K. Mushroom Law Timeline 2002+](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law14.shtml) . The law does not appear to cover spores, because the wording added to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Class A drugs) is: "Fungus (of any kind) which contains psilocin or an ester of psilocin." And no further wording is present in that section of the law regarding seeds or spores. However, the Home Office has published a FAQ that implies spores might be controlled: "Will it be illegal to supply grow kits? The law covers production so it applies to the sale and importation of kits." [Frequently Asked Questions about Magic Mushrooms](http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs-laws/drug-act-2005/faq/) . 
 
 
- 2005, Jul 18: Mushroom ban in U.K. began on July, 18, 2005 when the Home Office clarified that the accidental picking of psilocybin mushrooms or having them grow inadvertently on property would not be subject to the law. Fresh mushrooms are now considered a Class A drug under this new law.
- 2005, Apr 7: The British government has passed a new Drugs Bill expanding police powers and explicitly making fresh mushrooms illegal. [Drugs Bill Receives Royal Assent](http://www.drugs.gov.uk/News/1113312987) , Drugs.gov.uk, [Text of Drugs Bill](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldbills/032/2005032.htm) .
- 2005, Feb 19: U.K. government recently went ahead with prosecuting new cases against vendors of fresh mushrooms despite the previous court ruling that prosecution under the current law would be an "abuse of process" because the laws are too vague. [The Guardian : Magic mushroom dealers face new test cases](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1418029,00.html) , Feb 19, 2005
- See [British Mushroom Law Timeline 2002-2005](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law14.shtml)
 Dried magic mushrooms have a Class A drug status, which means that the prison sentence for possession and distribution could be similar to that of other Class A drugs such as L.S.D, Heroin, Cocaine & Crack, but even dried shrooms are not considered a police priority. It is uncommon for someone to be seriously prosecuted for simple possession, and 'accidentally dried' mushrooms have generally been overlooked.
