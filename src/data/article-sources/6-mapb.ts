6-MAPB (1-(benzofuran-6-yl)-N-methylpropan-2-amine) is an entactogen of the benzofuran family which is structurally related to 6-APB and MDMA. It is known to be a serotonin releasing agent and, unlike MDMA, a potent serotonin 5-HT1B receptor agonist. The drug is not known to have been widely sold as a "designer drug" but has been detected in analytical samples taken from individuals hospitalised after using drug combinations that included other benzofuran derivatives. 6-MAPB was first encountered as a novel designer drug in 2013 and described in the scientific literature in 2014. It was banned in the United Kingdom in June 2013, along with 9 other related compounds which were thought to produce similar effects.
