Apparently vendors are sending out samples for testing right now. Its supposed to be similar to ALD-52 and 1P-LSD. The exact chemical structure isnt out yet but it should be pretty easy to guess.


Is it even active ? I have a feeling its not but Id love for someone with more knowledge to correct me

Well, often butyl is futile but if 1P-LSD was acting as a prodrug then it may well work. I don't know much about the enzymes that attack these things.

^ wasn't this "butyl is futile" about chain lenght in amphetamine type compunds?


the compound proposed here would be similar to 1P-LSD but with a 4-carbon chain (butanoyl) instead of a 3-carbon chain (propanoyl) at the 1-position (indolic nitrogen). I guess if 1P and ALD-52 are active this should be as well.

I assume that it would be active considering its just a homologue of ALD-52 and 1P-LSD. It would be interesting if the longer chain made it metabolize more slowly, creating a longer lasting LSD trip. The makers of 1P-LSD made a small batch of 1-ortho-toluoyl-LSD and someone who tried it said it lasted about 24 hours.

"There's ethyl and propyl but butyl is futile". Nothing amphetamine-specific - it applies to many other substitutions (4-position for phenethylamines, amine of tryptamines, probably the 6-position N of LSD), not to mention that have nothing to do with psychedelics.

if your info is legit, this is very exciting.


to see if chain length of the 1-substitution changes duration, making 1-Formyl-LSD would be interesting as well.

I don't know what a ortho-toluoyl group would look like but sounds bulky, and that's really interesting that is was made, if what you say is true. 


I guess the chemistry for experimenting with different subs at the 1 position must be easy, cause I don't know why else the chemists would bother making all these different prodrugs. But it's really interesting that this ortho-toluoyl variant would make it last so long. I guess it metablolizes to LSD really slowly. 


This is interesting, but I'll be more excited when PRO-LAD gets synthed and released.

The guy who had 1-ot-lsd synthesized was involved with some major rc lysergamide vendors. He made some very interesting posts on reddit, but later deleted his account. He mentioned that he also had small batches of several other new tryptamines and lysergamides made. He didn't say much about them, except that ethyl-cyclopropyl-lysergamide has some similarities to LSZ.

I am shitting my pants for all these new lysergimides that are now being synthesized.


I've never even heard of 1-OT-LSD, or 1-Butyryl-LSD.

Ethyl-cyclopropyl-LSD??? 

Fuck m8.

Yeah, 1-Bu-LSD seems kind of pointless to me. Why make that and not something like O-butyryl-psilocin? 4-AcO-DMT seems to be active on its own, but something bulkier than an acetyl group might prevent it from having any activity. Then you would have something that acts purely as a prodrug for psilocin. And I think it would be an upside for a lot of people if it lasted a few hours longer than psilocin.


I'm curious why they keep making new prodrugs of LSD and not other chemicals. When 2c-b-an came out I had high hopes for more prodrugs but there haven't been any. 1-acetyl-DMT was announced but hasn't materialized.

This guy was legit. He talked about 1P-ETH-LAD and EPT long before they were publicly available. He was also the first person to announce a certain online shop that sells indole-based compounds, months before they opened up.

I emailed one of the vendors he was affiliated with asking if the new cyclopropyl tryptamine and lysergamide analogs mentioned on reddit would be sold and they acknowledged that they had been synthesized. If you don't believe me you can inquire about these chemicals yourself, if you're aware of any well-known lysergamide rc distributors.

I'd assume TheBlackPirate says that because the quicker they're released, the quicker they can be banned. I also hope they give it some time before releasing the next one. Let ALD-52 be the newest on the RC market for awhile longer.

I think that a very strict chemist might say that 1-Bu-LSD would only be a trivial abbreviation but not a technical one since the correct ones should be Ac for acetyl, Prop for propionyl and Buty for butyryl. This way there is no confusion with Pr being propyl (Probably not Pro, which too often stands for amino acid proline) and Bu being butyl...

1P-LSD is for these reasons probably also quite a trivial name, and you'd expect 1B-LSD to be consistent. But hey, 'trivial'? Who cares at the rumor stage, right?


Also I could be mistaken - technicalities, you know ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Also let there be no confusing 1-Bu-LSD / 1B-LSD / 1-Buty-LSD with BU-LAD which is also discussed right about now. Interesting timing ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I guess that 1-*o*-toluoyl-LSD would be so long lasting because there is terrible steric hindrance for enzymes to cleave the amide, or does the aromatic function resonate and stabilize it more? I guess the former would be the explanation for differences in the whole homological series but the question is, when does it become really relevant? I mean: it's possible going from a 2 to 5 carbon straight chain isn't really *that* interesting but isobutyryl might make a hell of a lot more difference (in duration - these are all expected to be pro-drugs, but kinetics can change the feel of a trip considerably I am convinced)

maybe we should just start calling it 6-BU-LAD to minimize confusion ?

6-BU-LAD is LSD with a butyl group substituted on the basic nitrogen, not the indole nitrogen. Just for everyone's information, 6-butyl-LSD has been synthesised, and it was about 10 times less potent than LSD in rat drug discrimination. 


"Lysergamides Revisited": [https://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/146.pdf](https://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/146.pdf)


Generally 1-substitution will attenuate activity but indolic amides get hydrolysed much easier than normal amides.

No not call 1B-LSD that, but call BU-LAD 6-BU-LAD to avoid confusion about where substitutions are. Kinda makes sense. However not necessary since the -LAD series already refers to the 6-substituted homologue series. Only reason I said avoid confusion is because of the Bu analogues being discussed right around the same time now. Just keep an eye on it being an 1x-LSD or a LAD compound to make the distinction.


6-butyl is not expected to be potent at all and even ones that are supposed to be better than it already fall short of economic justification, but some of these are still made by some enthousiasts if we are to believe some rumors.


AL-LAD is apparently highly effective in rats, but it's not more of a potent psychedelic than LSD in humans. I'd definitely try other things first like isopropyl or isobutyl on the 6-position if it were up to me... t-butyl even if the reaction is doable... just seems like they have a better shot.


1-isopropionyl is not possible.

I would think cyp-lad would be one of the best 6 position lysergamines. 

Regardless wherevere they go from now on they will become more and more exotic it seems.

CYP-LAD would undergo an intramolecular reaction I think... cyclopropylmethyl was tested in rats and found to be just about the worst one in the series.

Do you have a link for this info. Afaik cyclopropyl hasnt been tested yet.

About cyclopropyl itself (so not cyclopropylmethyl) I was probably thinking of things like a 6-haloethyl not being possible or safe because it could react into an aziridine (or aziridinium?) like nitrogen mustard compounds. Aziridinium confused with cyclopropyl.

I guess has nothing to do with CYP-LAD, and cyclopropyl tryptamines and other cyclopropylamines exist and seem fine, so my bad (it's not exactly an intramolecular reaction as I thought - that would be the above). However I'd still be careful since they are still known to involve ring opening to free radicals. The dose of lysergamides would be low so toxicity may not be an issue too quickly but it might not be good for activity either..


Just look around for 'cyclopropylamine free radical' for plenty of info. Even tertiary ones can do this.

the r6 butyl analogue of lsd is the one that would be weak (bu-lad, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BU-LAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BU-LAD) )


this  is the r1 sub which should be active (and probably feel similar to  1p/1a/lsd-25) and probably only slighly less potent than 1p or 1a lsd  (ald-52) or lsd


at least that's what one would be able to predict  from existing public info about lysergamide sar (modifying at r1 with  groups similar to acetyl (aka the carbon closest to the r1 nitrogen has  an oxygen bonded to it with a double bond) leads to substances which are  either lsd prodrugs or active on their own but with  similar effects as  lsd or both.... exactly how far this works and how complex the groups  you can use are is, as far as I'm aware not public knowledge, but i  strongly suspect some not so public research exists that explores the  subject further (think about 1p-lsd and 1p-eth-lad, do you think that  only these two were made and then sold or do you think many more were  made but haven't been released yet? i would bet on option 2 being right  since flooding the market with a bunch of very similar lysergamides  doesn't make much sense since a) it's more likely to result in some kind  of blanket ban and not in specific substances being banned b) once you  have the chemistry behind it figured out it does make sense to test as  many of such substances as you can make using the similar synths c) each  mass produced analog means that each is made in smaller batches which  would be more expensive due to how economies of scale work (i assume  that the total amount of lysergamides you can make and sell is limited  by market size, lab capacity, access to precursors, the amount of money  you have (lab capacity can be increased as can the access to precursors  but both requires a large investment and i have no idea how large are we  talking about, how much money the people behind this have and if it is  even a smart move since you would also drop the price per ug (well if  you want to sell them and not just store them in a freezer) and the  amount currently made might well be some sort of local optimum and even  if there is some higher optimum at a larger total amount of cheaper  lysergamides being sold reaching it might be too expensive for the  people (i wont be very specific here since for a bunch of reasons and  will only say that this might well be true) behind these  lysergamides))))... some such r1 subs might also produce compounds  different from lsd since the groups might make the compounds  inactive/unmetabolisable to lsd due to size/steric effects/... or they  might make them more active by increasing absorbtion speed/blood-brain  barrier  penetration/...).... r6 subs on the other hand are the ones  that have much more interesting effects on activity (just look at eth  and al lad for proof) however the chemistry behind them is much harder  which would make it a reasonable assumption that they haven't been  explored nearly as much as r1 subs... r2/3 subs look like a dead end  since the diethyl amide appears to be crucial for lysergamide magic  (look at lsz) and since the chemistry behind them is also much harder  than the chemistry behind r1 subs (nichols tried to make analogue of lsz  with a 3 carbon ring but failed... although i have since seen some  synths which might work... none have been tried so the question if they  would work doesn't have a definitive answer right now and since lsz was a  failure compared to every other lysergamide and nothing suggests that  it's 3 carbon analogue would be any better it will probably take a very  long time before they are tested.... if you are going to try to make  hard to make lysergamides r6 subs look much more attractive since all of  the ones that were released were very well received and are considered  by many to be as good or better than lsd (i'd pick eth lad over lsd  (more and prettier visuals, a friendlier headspace and no lack of  depth)  any time and while i love al lad i'd put it next to lsd not  above it (i'm a sucker for pretty visuals and al-lad is definitely a  winner (i'd hate to be forced to answer the question on which visuals  are prettier al-lad's or eth-lad's.... i think al-lad is slightly  prettier than eth-lad but eth-lad + ald-52/1p-lsd/lsd is  even  prettier... i wonder how is eth-lad + al-lad or al-lad +  ald-52/1p-lsd/lsd or eth-lad + al-lad+ ald-52/1p-lsd/lsd ...) in the  pretty visuals department, it's also definitely more  euphoric/positive/fun/whatever you want to call it, but it does lack  some depth which is desirable in some situations and undesirable in  others the same goes for it's lower duration.... sadly more people get  undesirable side effects from them as they do from lsd and not everyone )

you also have other possible lsd analogs (swapping the r1 nitrogen with an oxygen would likely lead to something active like it does with tryptamines (5-meo-dibf, 5-meo-bfe, ..) but the chemistry required to make them is not commercially viable and wont be for some time


and there's also ndtdi if you still consider that a lysergamide


i wont comment on 1-ortho-toluoyl-LSD and any other lysergamides which may or may not have been made beyond what i've posted above (although my refusal to comment might be comment enough)

Note the difference between cyclopropyl(amines) and cyclopropylmethyl(amines). The extra methylene spacer would make a big difference. Generally I'd expect it to be more stable thanks to it.


Allyls are also common (AL-LAD, 5-MeO-DALT etc), but vinyls don't work.. The difference again being the methylene spacer as a buffer for activation / reaction mechanisms, you might say. But idk about cyclopropyls really. Toxicity, instability, hard time to achieve the synth in the first place.. don't know, but there might be issues.

Can't say you don't have a point, but there are pharma drugs with a cyclopropyl without a methylene too - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cyclopropanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cyclopropanes)


Now I can't say that none of them aren't toxic, maybe they are just not as dangerous as the disease they are used to treat.


There's also McPT, EcPT and I think PcPT (methyl, cyclopropyl tryptamine, ethyl analog and propyl analog).

**1b-LSD  /  1-butyr-LSD**


This compound appeared on the market recently. All information is more than welcome. I drawn this molecule based on my limited chemistry skills. I would be more than happy if someone fluent in this sort of things could check it.  


![Ut1p3hH.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FUt1p3hH.jpg&hash=42186875833ba6461877f0b71a39d4a2)


1-butyr-lysergic acid diethylamide 


It differs from 1-propionyl-LSD (1p-LSD) by one additional carbon atom on the 1st position. 


Sample that i received was sent to the lab for confirmation. This batch is pure white powder.


![xxfOsUl.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FxxfOsUl.jpg&hash=a3964cd79f1d53e805fedc01ff3a3211)


Results from reagent testing: 


Marquis:  brownish

Mandelin: green

Mecke: green - blue 

Ehrlich: purple 

Simons: no reaction 

**UPDATE**: lab could not confirm that this sample is indeed 1b-LSD, so the upper information is not accurate. So far it looks like it's NDTDI.  


What i find odd here is, that if my sample is indeed 1b-LSD, it doesn't follow the no immediate reaction with ehrlich "trend" that can be observed with 1p-LSD or ALD-52, where the substitution prevents the immediate formation of purple color with ehrlichl. 


Source claims the dosage is around 1 - 2 mg. This is unconfirmed!!!  It might as well be 50 ug  


Any comments welcome!

I'm curious if anything is noticeably and reliably different about it compared to 1P or ALD, personally I doubt that anything but the kinetics is different and it seems slightly over the edge of being economically unviable if dosage is 1-2 mg...

making it pointless if this is true.

(With 1P and ALD, people do use them but at the same time I have yet to hear that they are really different from LSD. Usually if there are even slight differences people tend to anecdotally try and differentiate them which is doubtful. So to me, the lack of significant differences reported seems meaningful. On the other hand, the further we get removed from LSD by extending the 1 amide, the more the effects may actually become different just by dilation from the kinetics. Which I believe is the reason things like 4-AcO-DMT may produce particular effects. I may be wrong about that though, if the reason for that is 4-AcO-DMT being active itself undissociated, the same would not be true for 1-substituted LSD analogues which according to Nichols are not active themselves.)


Looks like you have quite a lot there... if it were an NBOMe nobody would bat an eye, but those aren't expensive to produce like lysergz.

Jeez that dose is high so its gotta be expensive if when it does pop up buy with those doses i doubt it. The precursor used could have yielded hundeds of hits of somthing stronger.         But please report back let us know if high dose lysergamines are and good.

Will do. First im waiting for the lab results. Hopefully i can run TLC on it tomorrow and also to see if it shines under UV. 


For me personally i find ALD-52 different from LSD. The same with 4-AcO-DMT and mushrooms. OFC not major differences, but i would say they have a distinct effect; but like you said ... it wasn't a blind trial and so on.  I haven't tried 1p-LSD so can't comment on that.


Also agree on the economic side, but hey, if there are people who are willing to sacrifice their precursors for research... i  find that great and respect that.  


Will let you know how it went! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well I tried to post this just a minute ago and it just dissipated so I'm gonna try one more time.


I received some of this a few months back. Tried up to 4mg oral and IM but nothing. Im guessing it decomposed while sitting at a hot warehouse at customs because they made me file a bunch of paperwork.  Since then I've received a new shipment from the same supplier and while the first one was clearly grey almost bluish, the new stuff is almost completely white.  Haven't had a chance to test it yet but I'll make another post when I do.  


Here is a pic showing the two samples:

Huh, interesting.  Is the texture/granulation different between the batches?  It looks like it but hard to tell.  It also looks a lot different than other lysergamides I have seen, which have been in crystal form.  Of course it could just be powderized.  If I were you I'd find some way to determine for sure it's what it's claimed to be.  Not sure if a testing lab would be able to tell or not though, don't they need a reference sample?


Strange that 1-butyr-LSD would be drastically less potent than 1-propionyl or 1-acetyl.  But maybe not strange, I'm no expert in chemistry.  Oh, just noticed you meant you've tried 4mg of the suspected decomposed sample, not the new white sample.  It is odd it's gray.


Don't want to price discuss, but just saying, the white sample looks like a large amount, if you didn't spend a crap ton of money on it, I would be hard-pressed to believe this is actually an LSD analogue as to my knowledge all the lysergamides are very difficult to make, with expensive precursors; all of the other ones I've seen cost a tremendous amount of money by weight.

As always, appearance doesn't tell you much. Lysergamides can easily be grey although I'd expect more of a purple or brown tinge personally, it doesn't have to be a big impurity and I think it can come from degradation or from the synth (also during the synth there may be degradation).


Unfortunately tryptamines also can appear that way. Especially so dull grey as pictured.


A lab would kind of need a reference sample but could also piece together that it is very likely an LSD analogue maybe? But I doubt they would tell in such uncertainties.


UV fluorescence doesn't tell you that it is not a tryptamine.


No I don't think this is really economical to make, if it is 1B i would probably try to deacylate it into regular LSD to get a lot more bang for your buck - unless it's really a different trip that is worth it.

I assume that a lab that has H-NMR and LC/MS and/or a infrared spectrometer could ID it with  quite some certainty - unfortunately I don't think any of the publicly available testing sites does. Some of them has LC/MS, but I don't know if it's enough to get a 100% sure answer. is it?


I agree with Xorkoth that something smells fishy about this whole thing. Without testing, I would only trust it was really 1-B-LSD, if it came from the vendor that originally brought all the lysergamides to the market, or one of his official resellers. **Not to start a vendor disussion!**


In all fairness, they did waste precursors to make LSM, but then again, that was a more promising compound. As long as 1-P-LSD is legal more or less everywere, then what's the point of 1-B-LSD?

Well the stuff came from a pretty trusted source and yes, it's definitely the most expensive compound I've ever gotten to say the least. Deacylation sounds interesting but I know nothing of the sort. Doubt there's any lab in this country that can test it but I have experimented with 1mg (yeah I know...) of the original so I don't see a problem. It will take a week or two to get the results so i'll keep you guys posted.

What did 1mg do?

Are you sure it is not ndtdi? Did it come from a chinese source?

I say this because 4 mgs is the suggested doseage for ndtdi oxolate. Which might just be that grey stuff. There is also a new synth of ndtdi succinate that just came out that has better potency and also better solubility. Its expensive a.f around 600$ a gram. And would not be at all suprised if it gturned a ehlich test purple.  

Good luck finding out if it is there is no referance sample. Lol

I was speaking of 1mg of LSD which was a bit rough for a minute but ended up being one of the most incredible experiences ever. It was during the 90s before the research chems so I'm sure it was the real stuff.  4mg of the grey stuff didnt produce any effects. $600 a gram is cheap compared to the 1B!

Actually, energy control has GC/MS and LC/MS, and a good chemist should be able to tell the difference between this and other lysergamides by the fractions it's broken down to in the MS. It'll just cost 60 euroe's. 


So the vendor hasn't had any testing done on it? Doesn't sound very reputable or proffessional imo, especiallly considering how expensive it apparently is.

Agreed you really need to trust the source involved with the synth or have some analysis that came with a custom synth - or possibly it's just made from illicit LSD by some random people and they're not really too worried about it being something else.


Pointless to speculate perhaps so apologies. But yeah mass spec would also identify NDTDI i guess.


Forget about the N-deacylation by the way, much too difficult it seems. And also problematic with regard to selectivity as you don't want to mess up the LSD amide.

For analytical chemists specializing in spectroscopy I imagine it is quite quantitative, however unless you want to pay out the ass for the test, you aren't always guaranteed accurate results. With that being said GC/QMS (quadropole mass spectrometer; one of the most selective MS used) can even separately identify 60+ compounds in a single mixture, of course computational analysis of the data makes it easier, comparisons of this with similar compounds should yield similar spectra, and I assume there's a database somewhere with the GC/MS spectrum for LSD, hell if I could even remember my SciFinder username I could look it up.

Also, why has no one attempted a simple ketone substitution using acetyl chloride or even an aldehyde substitution.

Not sure on the workup, you'd probably to add some carefully selective leaving groups, but if 1p-LSD and 1b-LSD can be synthesized I imagine the mechanism is nearly identical

First results from the lab came back as inconclusive, so they have to repeat it to be sure. With each day i think the source fucked up, and is selling NDTDI as 1-butyr-LSD. This fits with dosage, immeadiate ehrlich reaction and so on. If someone has some NDTDI lying around at home, could you react it with as many different drug id reagents, to se if it matches my results for "1b-LSD".

I've tried 1B-LSD (without mentioning vendors, this was from the same people who released 1P-LSD; I didn't get it independently tested but I'm very confident in the identity of the chemical) and the dose was in line or perhaps slightly higher than 1P-LSD. This was all under confidentiality agreements, but I don't imagine anyone involved would want misinformation out there that could result in confusion and people taking large overdoses of the stuff if it does show up on the market at some point. I agree with the above, the doses described in this thread are consistent with NDTDI and my very tentative assumption would be that this is what has been provided rather than a lysergamide active in the microgram range.


Edit: I did some reagent tests (on 1B-LSD blotter) - Marquis - pale-pink/brown darkening to purple after 10 minutes.  Improved Ehrlich - No reaction at first, but after 5 minutes a very pale purple showed up, darkening slightly to just pale purple after another 5 five minutes. No colour changes for Liebermann and Froehde. As you'd expect, these results are very similar to the reactions with 1P-LSD.

Whoa, cool!  I wonder if the duration will be increased since the carbon chain is longer?  I believe that was speculated in this thread, or maybe actually reported anecdotally.

It was speculated but I think the duration will be about the same. If the butanoyl group metabolized slowly then the potency would likely be reduced, which isn't the case.


Here's an interesting quote I found from someone who was part of the test group for these new lysergamides:


> If you draw out the resonance structures of, for example, the  1-o-tolyl-indole moiety, you see that such substituents are more stable  chemically. That coupled with the fact that o-tolyl is really quite  bulky means that enzymatic cleavage is likely inefficient. Over 15 of  these N-acyl-lysergamides were tested and only a handful were  particularly active. Even an 11 or 12 (I forget) carbon chain system was  tested and that was actually still quite active at 150mcg but the  duration was somewhat extended (15-18 hours if I remember correctly). It  seems to be a balance of increased lipophilicity vs steric bulk that  dictates the potency of these compounds in man.

^Is 1P really so much harsher than 1A? I find 1A indistinguishable from classic acid, but I've never tried 1P. I have a feeling if there's like 10% of people who can't cleave the P off well, I'm in that 10%. I already get weird reactions from my inability to process DXM and Codeine.

^ I've tried both, and to be honest, the only difference I've ever noticed between them is that 1P seems to have a less consistent come-up time. With ALD-52 I always feel the first hints upon 30 minutes of ingestion. I've had varying results with 1P, with the come-up taking from 20 minutes to 1.5 hours ... I'm starting to think  1P  is a little bit more affected by stomach contents.


BTW, cool to see a novel lysergamide, but I don't think the extra bucks are worth the possibly identical effect profile.

I think youd enjoy 1a more. To me 1p's headspace was just missing something. Also had a slight bodyload to it, 1a was indistinguishable to LSD in a blind test, I thought the two were one another and was able to distinguish the 1p, AL, and ETH

You really need to do more than one blind test to be able to say whether there is really a difference or not. If you thought you could tell the difference between LSD and ALD but you really couldn't, how do you know you aren't also mistaken about 1P? If you take 3 indistinguishable drugs in a blind test and guess at random what they are you have a 2/3 chance of getting at least one right. In my experience 1P is very deep and not missing any aspect of a typical LSD trip.

This stuffs punchy as. 


I lab tested 1 and 1/2 at once. And was fkn blown away. I went the extra half due to thinking I had a slight 1P tolerance. 


They were blank unlike the 1Ps. No writing or chemical structure on the back. So who knows really what dose it was. 


They promote 125 mics/blot. So I had around 182 mics all up. 


These days it usually takes 2-2 1/2 1Ps to get me where I was with this 1B. 


Very interesting stuff. I am an offical fan.

Could there be a different kind of tolerance build to these newer lysirges? 


Lab testing 1P, even after a month break, 300 mics is enough product to experiment with comfortably. 


Without a month break from lysirges (probably 2 weeks max), and first experiment with 1B, I was completely floored from 1 and a 1/2 @125 mics, the half reaching it to around 182 mics all up. 


I didnt notice any shorter duration as others have speculated. And was still way off baseline after a mate had gone home because we decided the peak had hit, and was slowly wearing thin. Once I went inside after he left, I was like ?fuck, I ain?t sleeping for another 6 hours?.


it was a big day though. And small experiments with 2-Fdck earlier in the day most likely affected this. But it was the first time in quiet a while where I was utterly worn from experimenting, which is good for me, I don?t end up reaching for other things to soften the return to reality. 


Thank god for etiz. Otherwise I wouldn?t have slept.


i may need to start a new thread about the tolerance question perhaps.

I'm literally in the come up of this substance right now. As far very reminiscent of 1-P only a little smoother. Will compare the 2 later in the day when this stuff is over the peak.

So i have no tried this today and gotta say pretty much what was said in this thread. Very similar to 1P only less intense and with a smoother come-up. Everything pretty much the same, or atleast i can't tell the difference not that im that experienced but still. Duration wise is also in the same ball-park. So yeah, if you can't get 1P or you wanna try something a little different you know what to expect from this.

Doesn't seem like it to me.  I think it's cool someone made it so we could see what lengthening the chain does on these.  But yeah I don't think I'm gonna bother.

they made 10+ r1 subs in small amounts, all with different chain lengths 


this one is just the simplest mod


a lot were better


should have made one of those


the best was like a combination of lsd and eth-lad (positive parts), basically no sides, 70 ug ~ 100 ug lsd

To me, 1P-LSD from the grey market is completely similar in effect to regular black market LSD. I therefore make an "educated guess" that the same will be true for 1A-LSD / ALD-52 (I still have something in my stash, but not tested yet), and also for 1-Bu-LSD - therefore I have no ambition in ordering some soon.

These 1a 1p 1b subs could be really valuable for therapists operating on the margins who really can't be working with actual LSD, people who don't have access to a black market LSD source, or anyone who is concerned with veracity and exact dosage of the substance on the blotter.

Why is it called 1Bu-LSD in Bluelight, actually? Most other places just call it 1B-LSD.

Good question, calling it 1Bu-LSD is I suppose somewhat more descriptive.  However I didn't name the thread.    You know I bet it's just because saying "1B" sounds a whole lot like saying "1P".  So it helps to differentiate them more so people don't think it's 1P-LSD.

I’ve got a whole fucking sheet of 1b that I bought while benzod out last year lol! I completely forgot!! I have extensive experience with al-lad, 1p & 1a if it’s anything like those gems, but have yet to get into the eth-lad or 1b! Will report back on this one! 

PS don’t do benzos I’m done with that shit.

The verdict seems to be it is less potent and takes longer to come on than LSD/ALD-52/1p-LSD.  Seems like lengthening the chain on the 1-position produces diminishing returns after a certain point.

It depends on how you metabolize it. Most people report it to be just like LSD/ALD-52/1P-LSD but some people find it to be a lot less potent. Probably the same people who find 1P to be less potent than LSD. It was tested on rats and was only 14% as potent as LSD while 1P was 38% as potent.

I still haven't seen that many reports on it, but I've some people say it's identical to 1P and some say it's not very strong even with several tabs. The reason they started selling it is because of it's legality in places where ALD-52 and 1P are illegal, but now that 1cP-LSD is out 1B-LSD seems pretty pointless.

Coulda sworn we had a megathread for it. Can't find it now though... Hmph.


Anyways, I haven't heard much about it other than that  is is markedly less potent that 1cP, 1P, and LSD. Otherwise it sounds similar to those three.

It's the title:


##### Lysergamides - The Small & Handy 1-Bu-LSD (1B-LSD) Thread

Apparently vendors are sending out samples for testing right now. Its supposed to be similar to ALD-52 and 1P-LSD. The exact chemical structure isnt out yet but it should be pretty easy to guess.  Is it even active ? I have a feeling its not but Id love for someone with more knowledge to correct me

I tried this one. Can only compare this to 1-P-LSD and ALD-52 since i have never had regular LSD. And i would say it's a lot less potent then 1-P and ALD. Not super visual or very intense mentally. Maybe for a introduction to lysergamides or after a really bad trip to get back into them. But i will not be ordering this one again, was fun to do but for that more expensive price and reduced potency i will not doing this one again. But i have read that others found this equally if not stronger to 1-P so ymmv

Ordered some of this in 125 ug blotters and I would say it feels quite a bit less potent than 1p and 1cp (125 feels weaker than 100 of these imo). It is also pretty long to come on.

Other than differences in potency is there a pronounced difference in character to these novel lysergamides from lsd-25? Or are they all kinda similar but some are just stronger/more stimulating?

The differences are minor other than onset time, potency and stuff like that but the nature of the experience is pretty equivalent in my opinion.

I took one hit after I took one hit of 1cp-lsd of which both didn't work squat. Although every other thing I bought worked perfectly. It is a mystery to me. Some of the dissociatives worked like a day atleast, later. What a great way to make yourself overdose. 


Is something wrong with me? Did the spirits prevent another bad trip?


Oh well, I'll just try again later. I've got to much other stuff to sort out right now.

I can tell ETH-LAD or AL-LAD from LSD but ALD 52, 1p-lsd and 1cp-lsd are all pretty much impossible for me to tell if I were blind test them, I have done a lot of acid before too. I do think ALD 52 may be weaker than 1cp-LSD, I haven't tried 1b-LSD  probably won't.

Yes, ETH-LAD is noticeably different from the rest of the pack, as is EIPLA. Can blind test these any day and pick from regular lsd/1p/ etc.

The ETH is so much crisper visually, with different types of patterns, for me at least.

Also, ETH is far more body-crushing for allot of users, while some claim none of that for any lysergamides.

I found ETH to be very self-analytical, compared with a more whimsical side to standard lsd or its close subs. But as always, ymmv.

The 1-alkyl LSD analogs (ALD, 1P, 1cP, etc) are all prodrugs for LSD. Drugs liek ETH-LAD, PRO-LAD, MiPLA are actually structurally different than LSD and active on their own, not as prodrugs

Is there any PRO-LAD on the market? It has been 13 years since I tasted that one and the supplier just mentioned that it was the last two hits because people just want the regular acid preferably.

Well....this one came on fast and strong... some muscle tremors but nothing too bad.

Visuals were nice but not spectacular and noticeably dropped off at the 6and half hour mark.

But I just could not sleep after....despite taking stupid and irresponsible amounts of clonazolam, etizolam and finally Flunitrazolam ( not all at once but spaced out over 12 hours.

 I just tossed and turned in bed....getting up every 6 hours to take something more to try to get to sleep).

The short duration is what intrigued me about this chemical but my God the lingering stimulation is like no other Lysergamide I've tried.

I wish they sold acid analogues at the gas station/drug store next to the cigarettes and energy drinks


Honestly low dose LSD just feels like a much more pleasant and less invasive caffeine/cannabis buzz in a lot of ways, I mean yeah the mind expanding factor is more pronounced but you get used to it.


I really don't think people would be having issues if they grew up around it, just like alcohol is remarkably well tolerated given how toxic it is thanks to culturally rooted lessons about how it should be used


The other side to this perspective is that sadly acid isnt the key to world peace and understanding a lot of old heads thought it was. Its just a relatively safe and potent intoxicant that can enhance creativity and help with depression.

At the gas station imo would be a bit over the top. 


But after dosing 75 mcg 1p-LSD yesterday. You might be right, half that, or a quarter dose would probably produce a nice clear buzz. But I never experimented with low doses. taking 1/ 2 a blotter last night was actually a exception. But the effects were about as strong as a whole one. 


And that's were the gas station problem starts. People driving under influence of Acid.

I've never had a problem driving on (low doses of) acid but most people do not enjoy/are not good at driving when sober so I suppose you have somewhat of a point.


 However they sell alcohol at the gas station and drinking and driving is at least the same risk. 


You're simply expected to not drink until you get to wherever you're going even tho you bought the alcohol at the gas station. 


What would the difference really be then other than we just accept alcohol already? 


Just have signs warning people not to drop acid and drive and make it a DUI

Honestly I think that's a perfectly reasonable system I'm just used to alcohol being available almost everywhere in the united states. In my state and indeed many southern states  certain gas stations have massive walk in refrigerated beer "cold rooms" that rival supermarkets and liquor stores selections at times.


Functional alcoholism is pretty common where I live and driving is the only way to get anywhere really so I kinda see how everyone was just like "fuck it just sell beer everywhere"

So its mainly the distance or reluctance ?


Without owning a car, or a drivers license, which was my decision. Why pollute anymore then possible when you have a expensive public transport system. 


But there are 3 shops selling liquor in a range of a km, walking range. So the need for a car is just un justify-able for me atm.

Many American cities including mine minimally invest in public transit. If at all. Additionally car dominated infrastructure is dangerous or almost impossible to traverse as a pedestrian or cyclist. I drive because it's the only actual way to get anywhere and it's just kinda been like that my whole life and for my parents lives before me.


It's really annoying. I dont like having to drive for every errand.


 Assumption that everyone drives results in large sprawling suburban oriented developments, making stores far away and everyone just kinda goes with it.


In downtown Atlanta (I live closest to Atlanta as far as major cities go) entire sections of the city are impossible to access without getting on the highway, historic neighborhoods were cut off from one another in the late 20th century to build massive chunks of interstate.


America wasn't built for the car, it was torn down and rebuilt for the car. So many places with lively and walkable city centers were gutted and re made to support drivers after world war 2.


And I actually like driving for the record. It's one of my favorite things to be honest. But enough is enough. It's just absurd and unsustainable how car dominated the infrastructure in so many American cities and towns is at this point in time.

Oh we may very well be switching to modified combustion engines (probably doing biofuels first and then hopefully hydrogen based  fuels) as well as more and more electric vehicles, we need petroleum fuel for airplanes and spacecraft and burning up all the oil with cars is not only pollution heavy but a really stupid use of that specific kind of resource.


You cant get off the planet without fossil fuels.


You can absolutely enjoy a nice drive without fossil fuels. I think in all the effort to demonize the oil industry people have accidentally made them seem all powerful and the situation feels more hopeless than it is.
