MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine) is an entactogenic drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine family. It was first synthesized in 1912 by the chemist Anton Köllisch as a potential medicine for the stopping of abnormal bleeding. Over the following 65 years, MDMA was largely forgotten about, with the first reports of it being used recreationally dating back to 1970. It was finally scheduled as a controlled substance in 1985 when its use began to spread out to mainstream society and rave culture.

MDMA acts as a releasing agent of the neurotransmitters known as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, the neurotransmitters in charge of pleasure, motivation and focus. It does this by inhibiting the reuptake and reabsorption of the neurotransmitters after they have performed their function of transmitting a neural impulse. Essentially allowing them to accumulate and be reused, causing physically stimulating and euphoric effects.

Many people across online psychedelic communities seem to think that reports of MDMA’s psychedelic effects are an outright myth but these are simply claims from people who have not experienced it for themselves. It does produce extremely powerful psychedelic effects and hallucinations under the right circumstances, particularly at high doses and especially when combined with marijuana. These effects are on par with Mushrooms and LSD and unlike anything found on commonly used psychedelics. Not presenting themselves consistently but just as readily induced within people even if they have no previous experience with tripping on traditional psychedelics. They can happen at any point throughout an MDMA buzz, but seem to be much more common during the comedown.

The MDMA experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of MDMA can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high of MDMA can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher dosages. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Enhancement of touch**
- **Stimulation** - in terms of its effects on the users physical energy levels, MDMA is commonly considered to be extremely stimulating and energetic. This encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing in a way that makes MDMA a popular choice for musical events such as festivals and raves. The particular style of stimulation which MDMA presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still, as jaw clenching and involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control.
- **Vibrating vision** - a person’s eyeballs may even begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus; a condition known as nystagmus.
- **Dehydration** - dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with MDMA and a product of increased heart rate and an extreme motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities that it induces. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated, especially when out dancing in a hot environment, there have been a number of users suffering from water intoxication through over drinking so it is advised that users simply sip at water and never over drink.
- **Difficulty urinating** - higher doses of MDMA result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination, an effect that is completely temporary and harmless, due to MDMA’s promotion of the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is responsible for regulating urination. This effect can be lessened by simply relaxing but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow.

**Cognitive effects:**

The cognitive effects of MDMA can be broken down into ten components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of MDMA is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation, feelings of love or empathy and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical Psychedelic, Entactogenic and Stimulant cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include,

- **Euphoria** - strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within MDMA and likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - this particular effect is the more pronounced, powerful and therapeutic with MDMA than any other known substance. It is the most obvious and noticeable effect within any MDMA experience and dominates the head space. With time and repeated use however, this effect becomes severely diminished as the perspective it instils becomes fully grounded and already in place, making people feel merely stimulated and euphoric with no new found urges to communicate with others. Some users report that MDMA ‘loses its magic’ with as few as 10 experiences, while others have reported hundreds of uses before the empathic qualities disappear. This does not appear to be true for all users, however, with many users reporting that they have not experienced any decrease in quality of the experience despite dozens or even hundreds of uses.
- **Mindfulness**
- **Time distortion** - strong feelings of time compression are common within MDMA and speed up the experience of time quite noticeable.
- **States of unity and interconnectedness** - experiences of unity, oneness and interconnectedness between level 2 - 3 are common within MDMA. This component most consistently manifests itself at high dosages within large crowds at raves and musical events in the form of “becoming one with crowd”.

**Visual effects:**

The visual effects of MDMA have an occurrence rating that is more selective and less consistent than any of the traditional psychedelics. This is to the point where many people disregard psychedelic experiences with MDMA as a “myth” or “rumour” but this is simply because they have not experienced it for themselves. The effects can never be guaranteed to manifest themselves but are more likely to occur with chemically pure high dose MDMA experiences, towards the end of the experience and if the user has been smoking marijuana. They are also more likely to occur if the user has prior experience with psychedelics but remain entirely possible within those who have never tried one for themselves.

*Enhancements*

MDMA presents an array of visual enhancements which are mild in comparison to traditional psychedelics but still distinctively present.

These generally include:

- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

MDMA presents a single visual enhancement:

- **Tracers** - this effect is rarely manifested beyond level 1 - 3.

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of psilocin than LSD. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, mostly blue and grey in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges and equal in rounded and angular corners. At higher dosages they are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7A visual geometry over Level 7B. Many users report an almost menacing feeling, following a sinister and ominous style with a colour scheme that generally consists of greys and blues.

*Hallucinatory states*

MDMA is capable of produces a unique range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelic.

These effects include:

- **Internal hallucinations** - the internal hallucinations which MDMA induces are only present as spontaneous breakthroughs at extremely high dosages. The most common way in which they manifest themselves are through hypnagogic scenarios which the user may experience as they are drifting off to sleep after a night of use, these can usually be described as memory replay from the previous several hours. These are short and fleeting but frequent and completely believable and convincing as they happen. In terms of the theme they often take the form of conversations with the people who were with you or instead manifest themselves as bizarre and extremely nonsensical plots.
- **External hallucinations** - these are similar to the effects found within Deliriants but usually follow themes of memory replays and semi realistic expected events. For example people could be casually holding objects or performing actions which you would expect them to in real life before disappearing and dissolving under further inspection. Common examples of this include seeing people wearing glasses when they are not and mistaking objects in the peripheral vision as human beings. At higher dosages however they are capable of becoming constant in their presence and almost entirely delirious in their nature.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of MDMA are common in their occurrence and exhibit a partial range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Hallucinations** - usually occurring at the end of the night, and almost always consisting of memory replays from the previous several hours. They are commonly manifested as spontaneous clips of the music that was played and garbled voices of the people that were spoken too. These can become as loud in volume as the level of noise heard at any rave or house party and can occasionally become complex enough to manifest themselves as intricate, previously unheard and completely coherent songs or symphonies of any style.

**Tips on inducing these effects:**

If you want to help induce these effects, I suggest you take whatever you consider to be a moderate-strong dose for your tolerance. For me this seems to be around 0.6g +. Make sure you have pure MDMA and not miscellaneous pills of an undetermined nature. If this is combined with a bong and a large amount weed psychedelic effects almost always occur. 
 This generally seems to do it for most people but since MDMA seems to be a strange sort of selective psychedelic it may not for others. Other people and I have tripped when we haven’t smoked weed just a few times but have consistently tripped when we have– every damn time.

**Conclusion:**

MDMA is an entactogen first and a psychedelic second. It is best used for resolving interpersonal problems, strengthening bonds and hard core recreational partying. Its psychedelic properties are extremely unique and interesting and something that I take advantage of and deliberately attempt to induce every time I happen to be taking this substance.

It’s important to keep in mind, however, that the over use of this substance can result in severe neurotransmitter depletion and serotonin syndrome. It is because of this that I recommend you do your research before even considering the use of this drug. Coming from personal experience, it should never be used more than once a month or preferably no more than a couple of times a year.

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzodioxoles. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to either isomers of dioxole. Dioxole is a five-membered unsaturated ring of two oxygen atoms and three carbon atoms.

### Background

An N-substituted amphetamine analog. It is a widely abused drug classified as a hallucinogen and causes marked, long-lasting changes in brain serotonergic systems. It is commonly referred to as MDMA or ecstasy. It is a widely abused drug classified as a hallucinogen and causes marked, long-lasting changes in brain serotonergic systems.

### Indication

Clinical trials are now testing the therapeutic potential of MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety associated with terminal cancer. MDMA is one of the four most widely used illicit drugs in the U.S.

### Pharmacodynamics

MDMA acts as a releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

### Metabolism

Midomafetamine, or MDMA, is reported to undergo extensive CYP-mediated hepatic metabolism, with CYP2D6 playing a major role in humans. Other CYP enzymes contributing to MDMA metabolism are CYP3A4 and COMT. 
MDMA is metabolized via two primary metabolic pathways. It may undergo O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation. In contrast, it may also undergo N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. Due to autoinhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2D8, MDMA displays a complex, nonlinear pharmacokinetics profile, with the zeroth order kinetics occurring at higher doses. It is thought that this can result in sustained and higher concentrations of MDMA if the user takes consecutive doses of the drug.

### Half-life

6–10 (though duration of effects is typically actually 3–5 hours)

### Mechanism of action

It enters neurons via carriage by the monoamine transporters. Once inside, MDMA inhibits the vesicular monoamine transporter, which results in increased concentrations of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine into the cytoplasm, and induces their release by reversing their respective transporters through a process known as phosphorylation. It also acts as a weak 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor agonist.
MDMA's unusual entactogenic effects have been hypothesized to be, at least partly, the result of indirect oxytocin secretion via activation of the serotonin system. Oxytocin is a hormone released following events like hugging, orgasm, and childbirth, and is thought to facilitate bonding and the establishment of trust. Based on studies in rats, MDMA is believed to cause the release of oxytocin, at least in part, by both directly and indirectly agonizing the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor.

### General Function

Serotonin transporter that cotransports serotonin with one Na(+) ion in exchange for one K(+) ion and possibly one proton in an overall electroneutral transport cycle. Transports serotonin across the plasma membrane from the extracellular compartment to the cytosol thus limiting serotonin intercellular signaling (PubMed:10407194, PubMed:12869649, PubMed:21730057, PubMed:27049939, PubMed:27756841, PubMed:34851672). Essential for serotonin homeostasis in the central nervous system. In the developing somatosensory cortex, acts in glutamatergic neurons to control serotonin uptake and its trophic functions accounting for proper spatial organization of cortical neurons and elaboration of sensory circuits. In the mature cortex, acts primarily in brainstem raphe neurons to mediate serotonin uptake from the synaptic cleft back into the pre-synaptic terminal thus terminating serotonin signaling at the synapse (By similarity). Modulates mucosal serotonin levels in the gastrointestinal tract through uptake and clearance of serotonin in enterocytes. Required for enteric neurogenesis and gastrointestinal reflexes (By similarity). Regulates blood serotonin levels by ensuring rapid high affinity uptake of serotonin from plasma to platelets, where it is further stored in dense granules via vesicular monoamine transporters and then released upon stimulation (PubMed:17506858, PubMed:18317590). Mechanistically, the transport cycle starts with an outward-open conformation having Na1(+) and Cl(-) sites occupied. The binding of a second extracellular Na2(+) ion and serotonin substrate leads to structural changes to outward-occluded to inward-occluded to inward-open, where the Na2(+) ion and serotonin are released into the cytosol. Binding of intracellular K(+) ion induces conformational transitions to inward-occluded to outward-open and completes the cycle by releasing K(+) possibly together with a proton bound to Asp-98 into the extracellular compartment. Na1(+) and Cl(-) ions remain bound throughout the transport cycle (PubMed:10407194, PubMed:12869649, PubMed:21730057, PubMed:27049939, PubMed:27756841, PubMed:34851672). Additionally, displays serotonin-induced channel-like conductance for monovalent cations, mainly Na(+) ions. The channel activity is uncoupled from the transport cycle and may contribute to the membrane resting potential or excitability (By similarity)

## Subjective Experience

Whilst it was first synthesised in 1912, and famously re-synthesised by Alexander
Shulgin in 1965, MDMA only emerged as a street drug in the late 1970s. It became
known by a variety of terms, including ecstasy and E, and was eventually to become
one of the most popular recreational drugs in the world.

I planned my own foray reasonably well, and consumed with fruit juice, as
recommended across a number of forums. I also ensured that I had water readily
available to reduce the frequently referenced risk of dehydration. I drank about half a
litre every hour or so, noting that over-hydration is also a serious matter.

Even though I was not in a hot environment, such as a club, I also kept an eye on
temperature to avoid overheating. I had earlier prepared for the adventure by
consuming some vitamin pills (including magnesium).

The pill itself weighed in at a hefty 220mg, so I broke this up, with the intention of
redosing into the experience at a gentle rate, assuming all was well.

\`\`\`
T+00 I swallow 80mg with fruit juice
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+30 I am coming-up: a definite headspace is emerging.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+40 The commonly stated 40 minute uptime is correct. It's coming on
strong, with an obvious mood lift.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+60 One hour in and I am significantly elevated, with my head in a positive
place. I am somewhat sweaty, but I am drinking a little water to compensate. I
am still able to respond sensibly to social cues if necessary. I pop another
30mg from the original pill.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 I am experiencing a happy pleasant buzz. This really is nice. I feel
confident and I am certainly rolling. I swallow another 55mg, bringing the
running total to 165mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:50 I am semi-euphoric; glowing with a dreamy high and a sensual edge. Is
there horn? There is, but certainly not on the scale of a stim binge. Capability
appears to be intact, but there is no compulsive interest, although I sense that
human interaction could well change this. This isn't commonly referred to as a
party drug for no reason, and I can understand how most forms of intimacy
would be vastly enhanced in this state of mind.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Common advice on redosing is not to do it, but if compelled to, to do it as
quickly after T+00 as possible. I therefore consume the final 55mg of the now
fully crushed pill.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:05 A meal unexpectedly arrives. This isn’t what I expected, but being
aware that food is sometimes recommended for safety reasons I eat it. It
seems fairly normal, so MDMA doesn't appear to enhance taste. Nor does it
completely suppress appetite, as many stimulants do.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:14 I'm flying: hot, sweaty, euphoric and struggling to stay functional. My
eyelids flicker of their own accord, and I strain to focus and stay with it. The
redosing was not a sensible move, particularly on a first-time experiment.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
At this point, which I believe and hope is the peak my debilitated state would
be obvious to any third party. The experience is now very intense. It is
extremely pleasurable but I feel that it is a little too close to the edge. This
unease is perhaps exacerbated by thinking in this way. If I was distracted by
my immediate environment I suspect that I might just be as high as a kite,
without the same degree of anxiety and self-awareness.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:56 My jaw clenching (bruxism) is now unmissable. I am just about
functional but badly impaired. I still bathe in a very nice and comfortable
headspace, I am still sweaty, and I am still drinking water.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+4:00 I am slowly on the way down. This remains pleasant, with a warm
glow, and I continue to sweat and drink water (in moderation).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:45 I am now riding on a lower plateau. I am still under the influence, but
I can now push this into the background if I absolutely need to. The waves of
euphoric well-being have dissipated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7:30 It is getting late, so I head to bed. I feel comfortable and fall into sleep
quite easily.
\`\`\`
Whilst I slept reasonably soundly, a headache emerged during the night, which
persisted into much of the morning. It had disappeared by lunch time, and I was left
with a slow and gradual comedown. This wasn’t particularly hard, but included a
strange offset feeling, and a general heady malaise. It wasn’t very pleasant.

The background depression and lack of general positivity lasted for several days,
which aligned with the general consensus amongst the user population.

Backtracking on the overall experience, I broke several of my own rules, the main one
being the size of the dose. 220mg was excessively large, particularly for a first
experience. This was extremely foolish. The primary cause of this was the redosing: I
failed to remove the residue from immediate accessibility. This no doubt contributed
to the overwhelming nature of parts of the trip, and to the subsequent headache and
discomfort.

The lesson here is a general one. Take it easy on the dose, especially if you are not a
seasoned user.

MDMA is not a drug to trifle with, and requires sensible consideration, including
with respect to aftercare. Entire websites are dedicated to safety, including
rollsafe.org and rollingpro.com. The advice given is usually sensible, and includes
the use of supplements, such as 5-HTP, to help restore serotonin levels. I followed
most of these measures fastidiously.

A decidedly sage piece of advice is to leave a significant gap between MDMA
experiences. Three months is commonly suggested, with six weeks stated as an
absolute minimum. It is hard to overstate the importance of this.

Finally, MDMA has attracted more than its fair share of dishonest and false media
reporting. This has tended to hide two of the most serious risks associated with its
use: relatively toxic chemicals (such as PMA/PMMA) being sold as MDMA, and
MDMA adulteration. Testing and appropriate pill research* is therefore of vital
importance, as are the other measures listed in the safety section of this book.

AN ANECDOTAL TALE (THE UNWANTED SWEETIE)
During the dark and seemingly endless years of the war on drugs era, some places
have earned a reputation for even greater brutality than the norm. One example is
Bangkok, in Thailand.

I have found myself stranded at Suvarnabhumi Airport a number of times, either
passing through, or having taken a short stopover as a tourist. On one of the latter
occasions, I hooked up with an Australian woman and her daughter. We eventually
made our way to customs, to proceed to our respective flights.

As we queued in line, we had almost reached the customs desk for our passport
checks, when I noticed the unmistakable sight of an ecstasy pill on the ground, just
inches from my foot. Someone had obviously found it in their possession as they
waited, and discreetly bailed it.

I did exactly what everyone in front of me had done. I pretended that I hadn’t noticed
it. To my shock and absolute horror, however, the elder of my female companions
made to pick it up, presumably to offer it around, and to find who might have
dropped it.

The scene raced in my mind. This was almost directly in front of a customs officer,
security cameras were clearly rolling, and the woman with me was about to take
possession of ecstasy, in Bangkok!

“Stop!” I squealed.

“Mum!” the daughter gasped. “Don’t even think about it!”

Fortunately, she did indeed stop in her tracks, and I was able to explain the folly of
trying to be helpful in this particular situation. I believe that it went along the lines of
“Aargh! Do you want to spend the next 20 years here, it’s a ****** drug!”

I suspect that one of my nine-lives was being traded, right there. The moral of the
story is never to pick up a brightly coloured sweetie in an airport.

DESCRIPTION #
 
[MDMA Images](https://erowid.org/mdma_images.shtml)
 
MDMA, or 'ecstasy' is a 'psychedelic amphetamine' that has gained popularity over the past 20 years because of its ability to produce strong feelings of comfort, empathy, and connection to others. It most frequently comes in tablet form, although it is also found in capsules or as powder. It is most frequently used orally and rarely snorted. MDMA use is closely tied to the underground rave (and dance club) scene throughout the world, but has also been widely used by therapists as an adjunct to psychotherapy. 
 
 Because MDMA is so popular and because it goes well with dance parties, the demand for it usually exceeds supply--especially at any given location on any given night. This creates an opening for unscrupulous individuals to sell virtually anything as 'ecstasy'. While 'ecstasy' is the popular name for MDMA, the functional definition of ecstasy is any pill represented as MDMA on the street. Ecstasy pills are notoriously unreliable in content, more so than most other street drugs, and commonly contain either [caffeine](https://erowid.org/../caffeine/caffeine.shtml) , [ephedrine](https://erowid.org/../ephedrine/ephedrine.shtml) , [amphetamines](https://erowid.org/../amphetamines/amphetamines.shtml) , [MDA](https://erowid.org/../mda/mda.shtml) , [MDE](https://erowid.org/../mde/mde.shtml) , [DXM](https://erowid.org/../dxm/dxm.shtml) , or--in rare cases-- [DOB](https://erowid.org/../dob/dob.shtml) , and don't necessarily contain MDMA or any psychoactive. This problem has led to the development of simple [MDMA testing kits](https://erowid.org/mdma_faq_testing_kits.shtml) that may help give the user a general sense of the content of a pill.

Effects Classification [#](https://erowid.org/effects-classification)
 
Euphoric Empathogen; Euphoric Stimulant; Entactogen; Phenethylamine
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/mdma_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of MDMA is between 80-150 mg. Most good quality pills contain somewhere in this range, generally 80-120 mg. A large percentage of users find that, unlike with many other psychoactives such as LSD or mushrooms, there is a 'sweet spot' in MDMA dosage. Once this spot is found, higher dosages are not particularly desirable as they don't increase the sought after effects or duration.
 
Price #
 
The price of MDMA varies wildly depending on where it's purchased and in what quantity. Prices are much higher in the United States and Canada than they are in Europe. In the U.S., a single tablet purchased at a commercial event can cost as much as \$50 though more commonly \$10-\$25. In the United States, purchased in higher quantities MDMA generally sells for \$80-\$200 per gram (about \$8-25 per dose), with wholesale prices as low as \$40 per gram. In Europe, in 2008 and 2009, prices were much lower at around 30-80 Euro per gram and 2-8 Euro per tablet.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/mdma_law.shtml) #
 
MDMA is illegal in the United States (Schedule I) and in most other countries. It is also listed as Schedule I in the International Convention on Psychotropic Substances, an international drug control treaty.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/mdma_chemistry.shtml) #
 
3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (MDMA) is a synthetic chemical that can be derived from an essential oil of the sassafras tree.

[History](https://erowid.org/mdma_timeline.php) #
 
MDMA was first synthesized in the 1890s and later patented by Merck pharmaceuticals on December 24, 1912, but it wasn't until the mid 1970s that articles related to its psychoactivity began showing up in scholarly journals. In the late '70s and early '80s MDMA was used as a psychotherapeutic tool and also started to become available on the street. Its growing popularity led to it being made illegal in the United States in 1985 and its popularity has continued to increase since then.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
MDMA; Ecstasy; X; XTC; E; M; Adam; Molly, Thizz, Beans (Tablets); Rolls.
 
The Experience:
 
Rolling; X-ing; Thizzing; Wigging; Tripping.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/mdma_effects.shtml) #
 
When the full effects of MDMA manifest, barring an uncommon negative reaction, users are likely to find that suddenly everything is right with the world. The primary effects sought by those using MDMA recreationally are the emotional openness, euphoria, stimulation, reduction of critical and cynical thoughts, and decrease of inhibitions that can accompany its use. MDMA is used by some individuals in a therapeutic setting to attempt to work through difficult interpersonal issues. Although MDMA can cause nystagmus (eye wiggles), most individuals experience few prominent open or closed eye visuals. A small percentage of users report significant visual distortions.
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, MDMA generally takes 30-60 minutes (although sometimes as long as 2 hours) to take effect. Unlike with many other psychoactives, the onset of MDMA is very quick. Often at the point one realizes that perhaps they are starting to notice effects, they are already 'launching' quickly towards the peak. This quick and extremely sharp 'launch' can be unnerving, feeling a bit like it's too quick and hard to know when it's going to end, but the feeling generally only lasts a few minutes until the full effects are reached.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of MDMA last approximately 3-4 hours when taken orally. For many people there is an additional period of time (2-6 hrs) where it is difficult to go to sleep and there is definitely a noticeable difference from everyday reality, but which is not strong enough to be considered 'tripping'. Many people also experience a noticeable shift in mood for several days after use; for some this is a period of depression while others experience lifted mood.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
The Crash #
 
Some users of MDMA experience a dramatic worsening of mood as the peak effects wear off, often called the "crash". This is often the result of coming down from a wonderful experience, not wanting the feelings to go away, and being sad, scared, or annoyed afterwards. Crashes do not happen after every experience and some users never experience them. One of the primary problems associated with crashing is that some users find themselves redosing in order to stave it off.
 
Hangover #
 
**[Hangover and the Week After](https://erowid.org/mdma_effects_hangover1.shtml)** 
 Many users report feeling extremely drained the day after MDMA use. This 'day after' effect means for many MDMA users that they need to plan 2 days for the experience: one for the peak experience and one recovery day, with very little planned. Many users also experience some level of post-MDMA depression, often starting on the second day after the experience and lasting for up to 5 days. A small percentage of users report depressive symptoms for weeks afterwards. Alternately, some users report feeling better than normal for a week or so after taking MDMA. The negative after-effects of taking MDMA appear to be worse with higher frequencies of use, higher dosages, and perhaps total lifetime usage.
 
[PROBLEMS](https://erowid.org/mdma_health.shtml) #
 
One of the primary problems with MDMA is the low quality of street ecstasy. Street ecstasy, especially pressed pills, is often mixed with a wide variety of adulterants that can cause a variety of negative side effects both unpleasant and dangerous. MDMA is a known neurotoxin, but how damaging it is to use is very controversial and [quite complex](https://erowid.org/mdma_journal.shtml#neurotoxicity) . 
 
 Negative effects can include overheating, nausea, vomiting, jaw-clenching, eye-twitching, and dizziness, as well as depression and fatigue in following days. After frequent or heavy use, some users report bouts of dizziness or vertigo which gradually subside after cessation of use. There have been problems with MDMA users experiencing [dehydration, hyperthermia, hyponatremia](https://erowid.org/mdma_health_water.shtml) , exhaustion, blackouts, and a few cases of death generally while using MDMA at clubs or raves. MDMA users would be wise to drink water and take occasional breaks. 
 
 Another possible difficult situation arising from MDMA use is the release of emotions which one may be unprepared to deal with. This could include confronting past episode of abuse, re-experiencing painful memories, encountering emotional crises, or unearthing previously unrecognized feelings either alone or while in conversation with friends and loved ones. In these situations, therapists suggest one should try to remain calm and avoid fighting the feelings. Find a supportive friend and a safe, comfortable space to sit while working through the feelings. If at all possible, try to find support among friends as emergency rooms are poorly equipped to handle emotional crises. 
 
 Many users report that their enjoyment of MDMA seems to decrease as total lifetime usage increases. Some users report that E 'loses its magic' with as few as 10 experiences, while others have reported hundreds of uses before the empathic qualities fades or disappears. Most users stop taking E because of either an increased awareness or an actual increase in negative side effects during use, a reduced quality of the high, and increases in the post-MDMA depression and day after hangover. Most users report that when using more than once a month, or merely over increased total lifetime use, they need to increase the dosage in order to get positive effects with MDMA. Increased dosage is associated with increased side effects, hangover, and week-after depression.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not take MDMA if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). MDMA and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Avoid taking MDMA if you are currently using the protease inhibitor Ritonavir. This may be a life-threatening combination. Individuals with a history of heart ailments, high blood pressure, aneurysm or stroke, glaucoma, hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) disorders, or hypoglycemia may be at higher risk. Avoid strong stimulants in combination with MDMA. Avoid high doses and frequent use. Recent studies suggest that the heavier and more frequent the use, the more concerning the long term after-effects may be. A small percentage (1-10% depending on race & family history) are "slow metabolizers", who have low levels of a liver enzyme (P450 2D6) which metabolizes many drugs, including MDMA (as well as Prozac, DXM, and many other pharmaceuticals). These people may be more sensitive to MDMA, might require lower doses, and should be cautious.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
MDMA has the potential to be psychologically addicting. Individuals who use it regularly may find they have an increased desire to continue using it. There is a short period of tolerance after MDMA use. Using MDMA two days in a row is likely to lead to a greatly diminished experience the second day, though spaced 7 or more days apart, this effect is lessened. Some users report noticing reduced effects for up to 2 or 3 weeks after initial use.
 
Long Term Health Problems #
 
There is an ongoing debate about the possible neurotoxicity of MDMA. Most experts now agree that MDMA is neurotoxic, but there is little agreement on what the consequences of this toxicity are. Alcohol is also a neurotoxin, for instance, as are many other medications. There is some evidence of changes to the brain in those who use MDMA heavily and/or frequently and a few studies have shown reductions in memory & increases in depression and anxiety, but these studies have not been completely verified and debate continues. This is a very complicated issue.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Some people are considerably more sensitive to MDMA than others. Those using MDMA for the first time or using material of an unknown purity and strength should be extremely careful. 
 
 Based on research from multiple labs, the effects of MDMA can increase non-linearly with increases in dosage. That is, increasing dosage from 100mg to 120mg (a 20% increase in dosage) can cause more than a 20% increase in experiential effects level. See [Harris DS, Baggott M, et al. 2002](https://erowid.org/references/1410) and [de la Torre R, Farre M, et al. 2000](https://erowid.org/references/382) . The current theory is that some metabolic pathway becomes saturated/overwhelmed somewhere around 1.5mg/kg and above, resulting in higher plasma levels and effects levels. The specific metabolic reason for this non-linearity [has not yet been proven](https://erowid.org/mdma_pharmacology1.shtml) .
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Erowid's effects information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of effects people report experiencing. Effects may vary dramatically from one person to another or one experience to another based on a variety of factors such as body chemistry, age, gender, physical health, dose, form of material, etc.

MDMA Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
MDMA generally comes in the form of small tablets, capsules, or white powder. When found in tablet form (often referred to as "ecstasy"), it is common for MDMA to be combined with any of the following substances : MDMA, Caffeine, MDA, Methamphetamine, DXM, MDE, Pseudo/Ephedrine, Ketamine, BZP, and TFMPP. Chemical analysis of ecstasy tablets has found from 0 - 120 mg of MDMA as well as a variety of the above substances. Trying to calculate dosages from tablets containing unknown quantities of MDMA can be difficult, but a high quality tablet of street ecstasy (those containing MDMA alone) generally contains between 80 and 120 mg of MDMA. Some unusual tablets (especially in Europe) [contain 150mg or more](http://drugsdata.org/results.php?high_dose_mdma=1) . The chart below shows what are considered recreational/therapeutic dosages for pure MDMA HCl (the most common crystalline form), measured in milligrams. Note that most Ecstasy and even crystalline MDMA is not 100% pure and may contain fillers or other drugs. See [DrugsData.org (formerly EcstasyData)](http://www.drugsdata.org/) . 
 
 
- Oral MDMA Dosages: Oral MDMA Dosages
**Oral MDMA Dosages**
- Threshold: 30 mg
- Light: 40 - 75 mg
- Common (small or sensitive people): 60 - 90 mg
- Common (most people): 75 - 125 mg
- Common (large or less sensitive people): 110 - 150 mg
- Strong: 150 - 200 mg
- Heavy: 200 + mg
 
 Onset : 20 - 70 minutes (depending on form and stomach contents) 
 Duration : 3 - 5 hours 
 Normal After Effects : up to 24 hours 
 
---
 
 **Overdose Effects:** 
 Vomiting, headaches and dizziness may result from too high a dose of MDMA. Some people are considerably more sensitive to MDMA than others. Be careful if you are using MDMA for the first time or using material of an unknown purity and strength. Always start low.
 
**Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. Know your Body - Know your Mind - Know your Substance - Know your Source. Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources and should not be construed as recommendations. Individuals can respond differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another. Start low with new substances. Have trusted companion/guide/sitter/friend present and/or available.**

MDMA
 
Health
 
by Erowid
 
**WARNINGS** : 
 
- Dangerous Interaction : MAOIs. Do not take MDMA if you are currently taking prescription MAOIs. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorix / Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). MDMA and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination.
- Dangerous Interaction: Protease Inhibitors. Avoid taking MDMA if you are currently using the protease inhibitor Ritonavir. This may be a life-threatening combination. See [Case Report: Interaction between MDMA and Ritonavir (Norvir)](https://erowid.org/mdma_info1.shtml) .
- Dangerous overheating. MDMA use can lead to hyperthermia (overheating) especially in those who are exerting themselves for long periods of time. It is important for users to pay attention to their bodies and make sure they aren't overheating. Take breaks from dancing. Step outside for a moment if the temperature in the room is high. Make sure to drink enough, but not too much, water.
- Individual sensitivity varies widely. A small percentage of users seem to react with extreme sensitivity to MDMA and experience overly strong effects at normal doses, including hyponatremia, unconsciousness, seizures, and other serious medical problems.
- Stimulant combinations can be dangerous. Avoid other strong stimulants in combination with MDMA, which can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature risks.
- Water Poisoning. Some ecstasy users overreact to the overheating and dehydration issue by obsessively over-drinking. When drinking large amounts of water it's important to mix in sports drinks or salty snacks to avoid the [very real dangers of water poisoning and hyponatremia](https://erowid.org/mdma_health_water.shtml) (low salt), which can cause serious health problems including death. MDMA can cause changes in the body's antidiuretic hormone, leading to much higher susceptibility to hyponatremia. Drink water, but don't drink too much.
- Seizures. A small number of MDMA users have reportedly had seizures after taking moderate amount of pure MDMA, more common in smaller women and with higher doses. See [References Search: MDMA Seizure](https://erowid.org/references/refs.php?A=SearchAdvanced&Abstract=mdma+seizure) and [Experience Search: MDMA & seizure](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?S1=3&Str=seizure) .
 
 
**CAUTIONS** : 
 
- Health Condition Contraindications. Individuals with a history of heart ailments, high blood pressure, aneurism or stroke, glaucoma, hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) disorders, or hypoglycemia may be at higher risk.
- Hyponatremia. Some users seem particularly sensitive to MDMA's effects on the antidiuretic hormone (ADH, aka Vasopressin) which can lead to serious or even fatal hyponatremia, even without ingesting too much water. See [References Search: MDMA & hyponatremia](https://erowid.org/references/refs.php?A=Search&Abstract=mdma+hyponatremia) .
- Neurotoxicity Risk of long term changes to serotonin increases with dose and frequency of use. Though complex, people who use very high doses, re-dose repeatedly, or take MDMA frequently could experience mild, but persisting reductions in certain types of verbal memory or a mild increase in depressive symptoms. See [MDMA Neurotoxicity](https://erowid.org/mdma_neurotoxicity.shtml) .
- May worsen depression. MDMA use can exacerbate depression in some users and cause depressions with heavy or frequent use.
- Crashing after peak. MDMA use can cause severe [crashes](https://erowid.org/mdma_effects2.shtml) after the peak effects wane, resulting in depressed mood, crying, and extreme lethargy in some users.
- Hangover. MDMA can cause [hangovers](https://erowid.org/mdma_effects_hangover1.shtml) in some users lasting between 1 and 7 days.
- Frequent use may worsen symptoms. Avoid high doses and frequent use. Over the last 15 years, many studies have shown that the higher the dose and more frequent the use, the worse the long term after-effects may be.
 
 
**PURITY ISSUES** : 
 One of the primary problems with MDMA is the low quality of the material sold on the street to recreational users. Tablets of street "ecstasy" frequently contain an assortment of psychoactive substances, either mixed with MDMA, or in place of it, or may contain no active ingredients at all. Other substances found in street ecstasy include MDA, MDE, PMA, caffeine, ephedrine, amphetamines, DXM, and occasionally DOB. 
 
 Caffeine, ephedrine, and amphetamines will produce less empathic effects than MDMA with more stimulation and feelings of restlessness. MDA and MDE are both similar in effects to MDMA and it may be difficult for even experienced users to distinguish between them. MDE is slightly shorter in duration than MDMA and generally has a lower peak and less euphoria than MDMA. MDA lasts longer and generally produces more visuals and psychedelic effects than MDMA. The effects of DXM, which has become more common in street ecstasy, can be extremely unpleasant if you're not expecting them: strong disorientation, dizziness, nausea, grogginess or strong sedation, and at high enough doses, dissociation from the body.

## SYNTHESIS
A solution of 7.7 g N-formyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine in 25 mL anhydrous THF was added dropwise to a well stirred and refluxing solution of 7.4 g LAH in 600 mL anhydrous THF under an inert atmosphere. The reaction mixture was held at reflux for 4 days. After being brought to room temperature, the excess hydride was destroyed with 7.4 mL H2O in an equal volume of THF, followed by 7.4 mL of 15% NaOH and then another 22 mL H2O. The solids were removed by filtration, and the filter cake washed with additional THF. The combined filtrate and washes were stripped of solvent under vacuum, and the residue dissolved in 200 mL CH2Cl2. This solution was extracted with 3Ã100 mL dilute HCl, and these extracts pooled and made basic with 25% NaOH. Extraction with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2 removed the product, and the pooled extracts were stripped of solvent under vacuum. There was obtained 6.5 g of a nearly white residue which was distilled at 100â110 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg to give 5.0 g of a colorless oil. This was dissolved in 25 mL IPA, neutralized with concentrated HCl, followed by the addition of sufficient anhydrous Et2O to produce a lasting turbidity. On continued stirring, there was the deposition of fine white crystals of 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine hydrochloride (MDMA) which were removed by filtration, washed with Et2O, and air dried, giving a final weight of 4.8 g.

(from 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone) This key intermediate to all of the MD-series can be made from either isosafrole, or from piperonal via 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene. To a well stirred solution of 34 g of 30% hydrogen peroxide in 150 g 80% formic acid there was added, dropwise, a solution of 32.4 g isosafrole in 120 mL acetone at a rate that kept the reaction mixture from exceeding 40 Â°C. This required a bit over 1 h, and external cooling was used as necessary. Stirring was continued for 16 h, and care was taken that the slow exothermic reaction did not cause excess heating. An external bath with running water worked well. During this time the solution progressed from an orange color to a deep red. All volatile components were removed under vacuum which yielded some 60 g of a very deep red residue. This was dissolved in 60 mL of MeOH, treated with 360 mL of 15% H2SO4, and heated for 3 h on the steam bath. After cooling, the reaction mixture was extracted with 3Ã75 mL Et2O, the pooled extracts washed first with H2O and then with dilute NaOH, and the solvent removed under vacuum The residue was distilled (at 2.0 mm/108â112 Â°C, or at about 160 Â°C at the water pump) to provide 20.6 g of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone as a pale yellow oil. The oxime (from hydroxylamine) had a mp of 85â88 Â°C. The semicarbazone had a mp of 162â163 Â°C.

An alternate synthesis of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone starts originally from piperonal. A suspension of 32 g electrolytic iron in 140 mL glacial acetic acid was gradually warmed on the steam bath. When quite hot but not yet with any white salts apparent, there was added, a bit at a time, a solution of 10.0 g of 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene in 75 mL acetic acid (see the synthesis of MDA for the preparation of this nitrostyrene intermediate from piperonal and nitroethane). This addition was conducted at a rate that permitted a vigorous reaction free from excessive frothing. The orange color of the reaction mixture became very reddish with the formation of white salts and a dark crust. After the addition was complete, the heating was continued for an additional 1.5 h during which time the body of the reaction mixture became quite white with the product appeared as a black oil climbing the sides of the beaker. This mixture was added to 2 L H2O, extracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2, and the pooled extracts washed with several portions of dilute NaOH. After the removal of the solvent under vacuum, the residue was distilled at reduced pressure (see above) to provide 8.0 g of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone as a pale yellow oil.

To 40 g of thin aluminum foil cut in 1 inch squares (in a 2 L wide mouth Erlenmeyer flask) there was added 1400 mL H2O containing 1 g mercuric chloride. Amalgamation was allowed to proceed until there was the evolution of fine bubbles, the formation of a light grey precipitate, and the appearance of occasional silvery spots on the surface of the aluminum. This takes between 15 and 30 min depending on the freshness of the surfaces, the temperature of the H2O, and the thickness of the aluminum foil.  (Aluminum foil thickness varies from country to country.)  The H2O was removed by decantation, and the aluminum was washed with 2Ã1400 mL of fresh H2O. The residual H2O from the final washing was removed as thoroughly as possible by shaking, and there was added, in succession and with swirling, 60 g methylamine hydrochloride dissolved in 60 mL warm H2O, 180 mL IPA, 145 mL 25% NaOH, 53 g 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone, and finally 350 mL IPA. If the available form of methylamine is the aqueous solution of the free base, the following sequence can be substituted: add, in succession, 76 mL 40% aqueous methylamine, 180 mL IPA, a suspension of 50 g NaCl in 140 mL H2O that contains 25 mL 25% NaOH, 53 g 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone, and finally 350 mL IPA. The exothermic reaction was kept below 60 Â°C with occasional immersion into cold water and, when it was thermally stable, it was allowed to stand until it had returned to room temperature with all the insolubles settled to the bottom as a grey sludge. The clear yellow overhead was decanted and the sludge removed by filtration and washed with MeOH. The combined decantation, mother liquors and washes, were stripped of solvent under vacuum, the residue suspended in 2400 mL of H2O, and sufficient HCl added to make the phase distinctly acidic. This was then washed with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2, made basic with 25% NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã100 mL of CH2Cl2. After removal of the solvent from the combined extracts, there remained 55 g of an amber oil which was distilled at 100â110 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg producing 41 g of an off-white liquid. This was dissolved in 200 mL IPA, neutralized with about 17 mL of concentrated HCl, and then treated with 400 mL anhydrous Et2O. After filtering off the white crystals, washing with an IPA/Et2O mixture, (2:1), with Et2O, and final air drying, there was obtained 42.0 g of 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) as a fine white crystal. The actual form that the final salt takes depends upon the temperature and concentration at the moment of the initial crystallization. It can be anhydrous, or it can be any of several hydrated forms. Only the anhydrous form has a sharp mp; the published reports describe all possible one degree melting point values over the range from 148â153 Â°C. The variously hydrated polymorphs have distinct infrared spectra, but have broad mps that depend on the rate of heating.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 100 mg) âBeforehand, I was aware of a dull, uncaring tiredness that might have reflected too little sleep, and I took a modest level of MDMA to see if it might serve me as a stimulant. I napped for a half hour or so, and woke up definitely not improved. The feeling of insufficient energy and lack of spark that Iâd felt before had become something quite strong, and might be characterized as a firm feeling of negativity about everything that had to be done and everything I had been looking forward to. So I set about my several tasks with no pleasure or enjoyment and I hummed a little tune to myself during these activities which had words that went: âI shouldnât have done that, oh yes, I shouldnât have done that, oh no, I shouldnât have done that; it was a mistake.â  Then I would start over again from the beginning. I was stuck in a gray space for quite a while, and there was nothing to do but keep doing what I had to do. After about 6 hours, I could see the whole mental state disintegrating and my pleasant feelings were coming back. But so was my plain, ornery tiredness. MDMA does not work like Dexedrine.â

(with 120 mg) âI feel absolutely clean inside, and there is nothing but pure euphoria. I have never felt so great, or believed this to be possible. The cleanliness, clarity, and marvelous feeling of solid inner strength continued throughout the rest of the day, and evening, and through the next day. I am overcome by the profundity of the experience, and how much more powerful it was than previous experiences, for no apparent reason, other than a continually improving state of being. All the next day I felt like âa citizen of the universeâ rather than a citizen of the planet, completely disconnecting time and flowing easily from one activity to the next.â

(with 120 mg) âAs the material came on I felt that I was being enveloped, and my attention had to be directed to it. I became quite fearful, and my face felt cold and ashen. I felt that I wanted to go back, but I knew there was no turning back. Then the fear started to leave me, and I could try taking little baby steps, like taking first steps after being reborn. The woodpile is so beautiful, about all the joy and beauty that I can stand. I am afraid to turn around and face the mountains, for fear they will overpower me. But I did look, and I am astounded. Everyone must get to experience a profound state like this. I feel totally peaceful. I have lived all my life to get here, and I feel I have come home. I am complete.â

(with 100 mg of the âRâ isomer) âThere were the slightest of effects noted at about an hour (a couple of paresthetic twinges) and then nothing at all.â

(with 160 mg of the âRâ isomer) âA disturbance of baseline at about forty minutes and this lasts for about another hour. Everything is clear by the third hour.â

(with 200 mg of the âRâ isomer) âA progression from an alert at thirty minutes to a soft and light intoxication that did not persist. This was a modest +, and I was at baseline in another hour.â

(with 60 mg of the âSâ isomer) âThe effects began developing in a smooth, friendly way at about a half-hour. My handwriting is OK but I am writing faster than usual. At the one hour point, I am quite certain that I could not drive, time is slowing down a bit, but I am mentally very active. My pupils are considerably dilated. The dropping is evident at two hours, and complete by the third hour. All afternoon I am peaceful and relaxed, but clear and alert, with no trace of physical residue at all. A very successful ++.â

(with 100 mg of the âSâ isomer) âI feel the onset is slower than with the racemate. Physically, I am excited, and my pulse and blood pressure are quite elevated. This does not have the âfireâ of the racemate, nor the rush of the development in getting to the plateau.â

(with 120 mg of the âSâ isomer) âA rapid development, and both writing and typing are impossible before the end of the first hour. Lying down with eyes closed eliminates all effects; the visual process is needed for any awareness of the drugâs effects. Some teeth clenching, but no nystagmus. Excellent sleep in the evening.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
With MDMA, the usual assignments of activity to optical isomers is reversed from all of the known psychedelic drugs. The more potent isomer is the âSâ isomer, which is the more potent form of amphetamine and methamphetamine. This was one of the first clear distinctions that was apparent between MDMA and the structurally related psychedelics (where the âRâ isomers are the more active). Tolerance studies also support differences in mechanisms of action. In one study, MDMA was consumed at 9:00 a.m. each day for almost a week (120 milligrams the first day and 160 milligrams each subsequent day) and by the fifth day there were no effects from the drug except for some mydriasis. And even this appeared to be lost on the sixth day. At this point of total tolerance, there was consumed (on day #7, at 9:00 a.m.) 120 milligrams of MDA and the response to it was substantially normal with proper chronology, teeth clench, and at most only a slight decrease in mental change. A complete holiday from any drug for another 6 days led to the reversal of this tolerance, in that 120 milligrams of MDMA had substantially the full expected effects. The fact that MDMA and MDA are not cross-tolerant strengthens the argument that they act in different ways, and at different sites in the brain.

A wide popularization of the social use of MDMA occurred in 1984â1985 and, with the reported observation of serotonin nerve changes in animal models resulting from the administration of the structurally similar drug MDA, an administrative move was launched to place it under legal control. The placement of MDMA into the most restrictive category of the Federal Controlled Substances Act has effectively removed it from the area of clinical experimentation and human research. The medical potential of this material will probably have to be developed through studies overseas.

A word of caution is in order concerning the intermediate 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone, which has also been called piperonylacetone. A devilish ambiguity appeared in the commercial market for this compound, centered about its name. The controversy focused on the meaning of the prefix, piperonyl, which has two separate chemical definitions. Let me try to explain this fascinating chaos in non-chemical terms. Piperonyl is a term that has been used for a two-ring system (the methylenedioxyphenyl group) either without, or with, an extra carbon atom sticking off of the side of it. Thus, piperonylacetone can be piperonyl (the two-ring thing without the extra carbon atom attached) plus acetone (a three carbon chain thing); the total number of carbons sticking out, three. Or, piperonylacetone can be piperonyl (the two-ring thing but with the extra carbon atom attached) plus acetone (a three carbon chain thing); the total number of carbons sticking out, four.

Does this make sense?

The three carbon sticking out job gives rise to MDA and to MDMA and to many homologues that are interesting materials discussed at length in these Book II comments. This is the usual item of commerce, available from both domestic and foreign suppliers. But the four-carbon sticking out job will produce totally weird stuff without any apparent relationship to psychedelics, psychoactives or psychotropics whatsoever. I know of one chemical supply house which supplied the weird compound, and they never did acknowledge their unusual use of the term piperonyl. There is a simple difference of properties which might be of value. The three carbon (correct) ketone is an oil with a sassafras smell that is always yellow colored. The four carbon (incorrect) ketone has a weak terpene smell and is white and crystalline. There should be no difficulties in distinguishing these two compounds. But unprincipled charlatans can always add mineral oil and butter yellow to otherwise white solids to make them into yellow oils. Caveat emptor.

**3,4- M ethylene d ioxy m eth a mphetamine** (also known as **ecstasy** , **E** , **XTC** , **emma** , **molly** , **mandy** , **pingers** , and **MDMA** ) is a classical [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. It is the most well-known and widely-used member of the [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , a diverse group that includes [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [4-MMC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-MMC) , and [6-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/6-APB) . It produces its effects by promoting the release of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) in the brain, particularly serotonin.

MDMA was first developed in 1912 by the pharmaceutical company [Merck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_Group) . However, human use was not reported until the 1970s, when it became known to underground psychotherapy circles in the United States. In the early 1980s, it spread into nightlife and rave culture, which eventually resulted in federal scheduling in 1985. By 2014, it was estimated to be one of the most popular recreational drugs in the world, alongside [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) and [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) .

Today, recreational MDMA use is widely associated with dance parties, electronic dance music, and the clubbing and raving scenes. Researchers are currently investigating whether MDMA may assist in treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) in autistic adults, and anxiety in those with life-threatening illness.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [enhanced empathy and sociability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement) , [relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It is classified as an entactogen due to how it facilitates feelings of closeness with one's self and others. A notable property of MDMA is that tolerance builds unusually quickly and many users report that it dramatically loses effectiveness if used on a frequent basis.

It is usually recommended to wait for one to three months between each use to give the brain adequate time to restore [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels and avoid toxicity. Additionally, using excessively high doses and multiple redosing is highly discouraged as this is thought to significantly increase the toxicity of MDMA.

MDMA has moderate to high abuse potential but a conversely low potential for a genuine psychological dependence or addiction which appears even lower than [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) (lower than 10%). Interestingly, MDMA’s potential for overuse and dependence or addiction can actually be greatly influenced by certain geographical components such as in other cultures or subcultures similarly to [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . Although ketamine‘s addiction potential is still notably higher across various cultures then compared to MDMA. Acute adverse effects of MDMA are usually the result of high amounts or multiple doses; either when done too frequently or excessively within a 24 hour period. Although single dose toxicity can still occur in susceptible individuals. The most serious short-term physical health risks of MDMA are [overheating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overheating) and [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , which has resulted in deaths. It has also been shown to be [neurotoxic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxic) at high doses; however, it is unclear how much this risk applies to typical recreational usage. MDMA may cause excessive thirst, and inability to urinate the water, which may cause water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance . MDMA has been shown to cause [sexual dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction) , including erectile dysfunction and delayed orgasm (see subjective effects ).

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

MDMA was first synthesized in 1912 by the German chemist Dr. Anton Köllisch while employed at the pharmaceutical company Merck. Köllisch was in the process of developing agents that would help manage excess bleeding and was interested in MDMA synthesis because it was an intermediate in the production of methylhydrastinin, the methylated analog of the hemostatic agent hydrastinine. There are no indications of interest in MDMA as an active agent itself.

It was not mentioned again until 1927, when Dr. Max Oberlin conducted the first proven pharmacological tests at Merck while searching for compounds with a similar action spectrum to adrenaline or ephetonine. Despite promising results, research was halted due to rising substance prices.

In 1965, the American chemist [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) synthesized MDMA as an academic exercise but did not test it for psychoactivity. Shulgin claims to have first heard about the effects of MDMA in 1967 from a student and decided to experiment with it himself. He was impressed with the effects of the substance and believed it could have therapeutic utility. He advertised it to therapists and psychiatrists which led it to gain some popularity as an adjunct treatment for various psychological disorders.

During this period, psychotherapist Dr. Leo Zeff came out of retirement and subsequently introduced the then-legal MDMA to over 4,000 patients. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s there was a growth of clinicians using MDMA (then known as "Adam") in California.

Recreational use of MDMA became popular at around the same time, particularly in nightclubs, eventually catching the attention of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). After several hearings, a US Federal Administrative Law Judge recommended that MDMA should be made a Schedule III controlled substance so that it could be used in the medical field. Despite this, the director of the DEA overruled this recommendation and classified MDMA as a Schedule I controlled substance.

In the United Kingdom, the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, which had already been altered in 1977 to include all ring-substituted amphetamines like MDMA, was further amended in 1985 to refer specifically to Ecstasy, placing it in the Class A category.

## Chemistry

MDMA, or 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine, is a synthetic molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Molecules of the amphetamine class all contain a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core comprised of a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain, with an additional methyl substitution at R α . In addition to this, MDMA contains a methyl substitution on R N , a feature it shares with [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . Critically, the MDMA molecule also contains substitutions at R 3 and R 4 of the phenyl ring with oxygen groups -- these oxygen groups are incorporated into a methylenedioxy ring through a methylene bridge. MDMA shares this methylenedioxy ring with other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) and [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , [MDEA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDEA) and [MDAI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDAI) .

## Pharmacology

MDMA acts primarily as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) of the three principal [monoamine neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitters) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) through its action at trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). MDMA is a monoamine transporter substrate (i.e. a substrate for the transporters for dopamine ( **DAT** ), norepinephrine ( **NET** ), and serotonin ( **SERT** )), enabling it to enter monoaminergic [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) via these neuronal membrane transport proteins. By acting as a monoamine transporter substrate, MDMA produces competitive [reuptake inhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibition) at the neuronal membrane transporters, competing for endogenous monoamines for reuptake.

MDMA inhibits both vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs), the second of which (VMAT2) is highly expressed within monoamine [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) vesicular membranes. Once inside a monoamine neuron, MDMA acts as a VMAT2 inhibitor and a TAAR1 agonist. The inhibition of VMAT2 by MDMA results in increased concentrations of the aforementioned monoamine neurotransmitters in the cytosol of the neuron. Activation of TAAR1 by MDMA triggers protein kinase signaling events which then phosphorylates the associated monoamine transporters of the neuron.

Subsequently, these phosphorylated monoamine transporters either reverse transport direction – i.e. move neurotransmitters from inside the cell to the [synaptic cleft](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaptic_cleft) – or withdraw into the neuron, respectively producing the inflow of neurotransmitters and noncompetitive [reuptake inhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibition) at the neuronal membrane transporters. MDMA has ten times more affinity for uptake at serotonin transporters compared to dopamine and norepinephrine transporters and consequently has mainly serotonergic effects.

MDMA also has weak agonist activity at postsynaptic serotonin receptors 5-HT 1 and 5-HT 2 receptors, and its more efficacious metabolite [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) likely augments this action. Cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin quantities in serum are increased by MDMA.

Additionally, MDMA is a ligand at both sigma receptor subtypes, though its efficacies at these receptors and the role that they play have yet to be elucidated.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** -- It is advised to avoid over-hydration from drinking excessive amounts of water, see the water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance section.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Like with other stimulants; this can happen to a mild or moderate degree and is once again a recommended reason to avoid drinking too much water, see the water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance section.
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)** - Avoid drinking too much water, see the water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance section. Chewing gum may help increase moisture and reverse dryness.
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - Occasional yawning is thought to occur as a result of serotoninergic activity which can make people more sedated or sleepy. It is more likely to occur with lower doses and/or due to purer MDMA. Therefore, it is sometimes used as an indicator of a batch's quality.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** - As MDMA is a [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) releasing agent, a rise in core body temperature tends to be a significant and consistent part of the experience. Caution must be taken as too high of a dose in a dangerously hot environment can result in serotonin toxicity and related oxidative stress, which can be fatal or very damaging if left untreated. Avoid drinking too much water, see the water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance section.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)** - Avoid drinking too much water, see the water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance section.
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect is most commonly present during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Come_up) phase of the experience, and at higher doses, but has been reported to occur spontaneously in those who seem to be susceptible to it. This is likely due to the large number of serotonin receptors occurring in the gut.
- **[Neurotoxicity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity)** - Long-term use can lead to a significant degree of neurotoxicity. Consequences like this are the primary reason the use of MDMA should be delegated to only several times a year at most. Protracted symptoms of [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) or anhedonia are fairly common with excessively frequent use.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - This effect is generally not as powerful as it is with [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** - This component can be very prominent compared to other stimulants and is oftentimes almost identical to that of genuine [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . Environments and level of lighting can factor in too however.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - Seizures are rare but may occur in those who are susceptible to them, especially when taking higher doses or redosing while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued, undernourished, or overheated. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)** & **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)**
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of MDMA can be characterized as a moderate to extreme euphoric and highly pleasurable tingling sensation of smoothness that encompasses the entire body. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak occurs. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Physical euphoria is a prominent aspect of the MDMA experience and occurs reliably when MDMA is used responsibly (i.e. reasonable dosing and spacing between experiences) and can lead to profound feelings of social and physical [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) and hyperactivity or a profoundly pleasure feeling in the body which can also be characterized by a lack of mobility but with a substantial level of comfort. However, euphoria is quick to fade as one builds tolerance to MDMA's effects, colloquially known as "losing the magic".
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - MDMA is popularly known for being stimulating and energetic. This encourages activities such as running, walking, climbing and dancing in a way that makes MDMA a popular choice for musical events such as festivals and raves or general nightlife activities. The distinct style of stimulation which MDMA presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily body shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control. Unlike most other stimulants, however, the stimulating effects of MDMA can also paradoxically be accompanied by persistent or wave-like feelings of deep [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , depending on the dose, with lower doses exemplifying a more relaxing or sedative quality. However in moderate to high doses it acts more similar to traditional stimulants; resulting in a nearly invariable desire to move around and engage in various kinds of mobile activities. This encouraged style of stimulation for some individuals is well reputed for resulting very physically active behaviors such as dancing if said user is inclined or open to such activities. However, it is also not uncommon for people with general social prejudices against dance behavior to suddenly become much more openminded to the idea once under the influence of a sufficient (moderate) dose of MDMA.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - MDMA produces distinct enhancements to tactile sensations. Users commonly report a sense of softness and fuzziness draping over their skin. Likewise, touching soft and fuzzy objects such as shag rugs can become irresistibly pleasurable and satisfying. MDMA-type tactile enhancement appears to be an effect unique to the entactogen class and may be a serotonin-related effect. Although it is also worth noting that many experimenters of the drug find that the tactile effects (especially in regards to pleasure) have often been notably exaggerated by other users, with some of these proponents even claiming borderline “orgasmic” sensations associated with physical touch.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This effect when experienced alongside the cognitive and physical [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) can often lead to users mildly or intensely clenching their jaw muscles, sometimes even to the point where the individual’s facial expression begins to change. This is sometimes colloquially called “gurning”. This particular effect is to be the reason that people take MDMA at raves use pacifiers or chew gum since intense gurning can lead to many users biting excessively hard on their lips. and is typically only experienced in moderate to high dosages. For other individuals, especially if they are prone to experience the paradoxical feelings of muscle relaxation, bruxism may not be as pronounced.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - Avoid drinking too much water, see the water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance section.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) . ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of MDMA occur more selectively and less consistently than any of the traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . This has resulted in many people disregarding the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) aspects of MDMA as a myth, rumor or negligible effect despite a large body of anecdotal reports suggesting otherwise. The (often mild) hallucinatory effects cannot be guaranteed to manifest themselves, but are the most likely to occur with chemically pure MDMA at high doses, as well as towards the end of the experience; particularly if the user has been smoking [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . The visuals during the offset are usually characterized by closed eye visuals (CEVs) such as typical psychedelic-like pattering. Whereas during the peak effects, the visuals tend to be more similar to the open eye distortions of standard psychedelics, albeit in much more mildly and less vivid form. They also seem more likely to occur if the user has prior experience with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . 
#### Enhancements
 
MDMA presents an array of sensory enhancements, with typically modest visual enhancements which are characteristically mild in comparison to standard psychedelics, but are still distinctly present unlike other classical stimulants. These generally include:
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)** - This is exceptionally intense for MDMA when exposed to the very bright or neon colors; particularly when viewing radiant or luminescent colors such as with glow sticks.
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)** - Although similar or associated compounds are noted for inducing pareidolia (ubiquitously perceiving patterns in random visual stimuli); MDMA rather just enhances the quality, sharpness and aesthetic appreciation for already patterned surfaces and designs.
 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by MDMA can be characterized as more similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in style, structured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, mostly monotone in colour with blues and greys, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, small in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in round and angular corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher doses, they are significantly more likely to give rise to states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) . Many users report that MDMA geometry presents itself with dark and menacing emotional vibes with a synthetic and nerve-racking feel to them.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
MDMA is capable of producing a unique range of low and high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of virtually all other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . These effects are far more common either during the peak effects or the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Offset) of the experience and commonly include:
 
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect shares many similarities to those produced by [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) substances, but does not manifest itself consistently and usually happens only at heavy, likely toxic doses and is therefore not considered a typical or healthy sign when experiencing MDMA’s visuals. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_External_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. They usually follow themes of memory replays and semi-realistic or expected events. For example, people could be casually holding objects or performing actions which one would expect them to be in real life before disappearing and dissolving under further inspection. Common examples of this include seeing people wearing glasses, or hats when they are not and mistaking objects for human beings or animals.
- **[Internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** - The internal hallucinations which MDMA induces are only present as spontaneous breakthroughs at extremely high doses. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This effect's [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) are delirious in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and solid in appearance. The most common way in which they manifest themselves is through [hypnagogic](/w/index.php?title=Hypnagogic&action=edit&redlink=1) scenarios which the user may experience as they are drifting off to sleep after a night of use; these can usually be described as memory replay from the previous several hours. These are brief and fleeting, but frequent and completely believable and convincing as they happen. In terms of the theme, they often are in the form of conversations with people or instead manifest as bizarre and extremely nonsensical plots.
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation) [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The general head space of MDMA is described by many as one of pronounced mental stimulation, feelings of love or platonic affection, empathy, talkativeness, openness to novel social interactions and a pronounced sense of invigoration, revitalization and euphoric pleasure. It is capable of producing a large number of cognitive effects that are typically associated with [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) and [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) . The most prominent of these effects include: 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Very high doses of MDMA can sometimes cause partial amnesia.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - Although the initial, but very brief coming-up stage can actually be characterized by mild or notable [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , this component is virtually always soon after replaced by a thoroughly well-rounded and/or major suppression of anxiety and feelings of worry.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong affective euphoria and feelings of happiness and significant increases in positive mood and optimism are nearly universally present with MDMA and are likely a direct result of the increased concentration of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) release, as well as [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) increases to a lesser extent. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)** - Although this is a very common effect, it evidently appears to be more prevalent amongst those with certain personality types or particular types of creative endeavors (such as music production rather than composing literary works for instance). It’s also usually regarded as being a less notable effect when compared to genuine psychedelic compounds.
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)** & **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - This effect typically only occurs with overly high doses, and is associated with temperature dysregulation and overheating, particularly when MDMA is taken in crowded, physically strenuous environments that leaves the user unable to cool off, rest, or rehydrate adequately.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)** - This effect can be extremely powerful and is exemplified by (sometimes unrestrained) degrees of increased sociability, loquaciousness and exceptional confidence in regards to amicability and willingness to communicate openly with strangers. It’s considered to be less “obnoxious“ and careless however than with acute [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) intoxication.
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)** - This can manifest in a number of ways (both positive and negative) but is often characterized by an increase in self-esteem and an exuberant sense of confidence. Individual personality type and a user’s natural neurochemistry can play a major role in the quality of this effect.
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)** - This effect typically is most heavily associated with the empathetic and affectionate aspects of MDMA although it tends to lack the sense of emotive sympathy and psycho-emotional vulnerability present in most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) or even [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) , with some users even reporting little to no meaningful change or augmentation in emotions. It is not uncommonly perceived as being more of an increase in *understanding* of others’ dispositions rather than deep heartfelt or visceral ‘feelings’ such as compassion or pity.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This particular and largely characteristic effect is usually more consistent, pronounced, functional, powerful and therapeutic with MDMA than with any other known substance. It is the most evident and noticeable effect within any MDMA experience and dominates the headspace. Over time and with repeated use, however, this effect becomes substantially diminished as the perspective it instills becomes fully grounded and already in place, making people feel merely stimulated and euphoric with no overtly newfound urges to communicate with others. Some users report that MDMA "loses its magic" with as few as ten experiences, while others have reported hundreds of uses before the empathic qualities disappear. This does not appear to be valid for all users. However, many users report that they have not experienced any decrease in the novel qualities of the experience despite dozens or even hundreds of uses.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - Focus enhancement only occurs at low to moderate doses. Higher doses will usually impair attention and concentration, particularly during the "come down" phase of the experience.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)** - This effect appears to be unusually pronounced in settings of exposure to music (especially formalized music-related events) or light-shows and similar types of visual or auditory displays.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** - This effect usually manifests itself through an increase in both the hedonic and thrillingly emotional impact of musical acoustic phenomena, often leading to a “hyped“ or adrenaline rush type of feeling. For some users, an enhanced comprehension of subtle details in the music or a feeling of deeper understanding with regards to composition and lyrics has been reported what is essentially less common compared to many other hallucinogenic compounds. The overall effect is, for the most part mainly indicative of an all-around increased enthusiasm towards hearing music in general. Rarely, one may find music to be annoying or distracting rather than enhanced - this seems to be largely set and setting based and happens rarely.
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Reinvigoration](/w/index.php?title=Reinvigoration&action=edit&redlink=1)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** - This component can very effectively complement the social interactions and verbal communication with others that takes place during the experience. This is especially advantageous since this effect seems notably less manic, scatterbrained, ‘speedy’ and turbulent than with other stimulants; with many even describing it as feeling “smooth” and uniquely manageable.
- **[Time compression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are commonly produced by MDMA and subjectively speed up the experience of time passage to an unusually substantial degree; possibly more than any other commonly used recreational substance.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Tinnitus](/w/index.php?title=Tinnitus&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Tinnitus is rarely reported, but typically manifests as a muffled roaring in the ears, affected by whether the user is upright or laying down. It is most commonly reported when using in conjunction with other substances but can manifest on its own at higher doses. This may be accompanied by partial or total, yet highly temporary (on the order of a minute), hearing loss, especially when standing. Some users have reported acquiring permanent tinnitus after abuse. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)** - Although relatively common, this effect is not as pronounced, convicting or as consistent when compared to [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) such as [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . This component has a unique quality within MDMA in that it almost always comes about in the form of self-affirmation, individual agency and a personal appreciation for one’s self as well as others.
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - Experiences of lower-level unity and interconnectedness are commonly produced by MDMA, although in a much less abstract or ‘metaphysical’ form than compounds like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This MDMA effect most consistently manifests itself within large crowds at raves and musical events in the form of "becoming one with the crowd." Music is said to consistently intensify this effect as well and can be considered very memorable and a defining feature of the experience’s peak. ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of an [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) or [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and is thought to occur because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Although, it has been more and more commonly recognized in recent years that the true “hangover” for MDMA, especially in regards to the [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) tends to actually ‘skip a day’ due to the brain supposedly still releasing substantial amounts of serotonin the day after which likely explains the “afterglow” effect which is eventually later replaced by a genuine hangover and uncomfortable emotional effects. These effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)** - Can be anywhere from mild to severe and is usually most severe during the initial comedown after the main effects abruptly end rather than during the following days. With that said however, the depression in the following days is still usually noticeable and can last up to a week.
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)** *or* **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - Although this substance have been known to suppress dreaming, some users note extremely strange and sometimes scary dreams for several nights after taking large doses of MDMA.
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)** - Some users report a higher incidence of experiencing sleep paralysis after consuming MDMA.
- **[Headache](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headache)** - Headaches the day after overuse are very commonly reported and result from a combination of electrolyte imbalance and physical strain
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Suicidal ideation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
 As stated above, individuals may experience an *afterglow* effect, especially when MDMA is used in a therapeutic context and harm reduction measures are properly adhered to. Some users have even utilized “recovery protocols” such as smoothies and other consumables made with certain ingredients to alleviate some of the symptoms present in shortages of neurotransmitter. That said, afterglows will often give-way to more frequent or even progressively worse comedowns if one's MDMA use becomes more frequent or excessive over time. It is a misconception however that some users experience either *only* afterglows or only comedowns/crashes when many, if not most users tend to experience both; just in a biphasic order. Such afterglow effects include: 
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)**
- **[Euthymia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euthymia)**
### Dose-effects relationship from analyzed samples

The optimal single oral dose for an average user may be around 90 mg going by this diagram. Note that the percentages at the bottom are too outdated to guide in estimating substance content in current pills: The average concentration of MDMA in ecstasy pills, tested in a drug checking program in Zurich, doubled between 2010 and 2018. The percentage of pills containing more than 120 mg MDMA rose from 4% to 73%. In the same period, the rate of pills containing other psychoactive compounds dropped from 53% to 7%.

## Names and forms

### Names

Since the 1980s, MDMA has become widely known as " **Ecstasy** " (shortened to " **E** ", " **X** ", or " **XTC** "), usually referring to its street forms as illicitly pressed pills or tablets. The American term " **Molly** " and the British equivalent term " **Mandy** " originally referred to crystal or powder MDMA that was purported to be of high purity and free of adulteration. However, it has since evolved into a generic street term for any number of euphoric [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) that are sold in powder or crystal form. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Forms

MDMA can be found in the following forms:

#### Crystals

**Crystals** or **powder** (commonly called **Molly** ) is a white to brownish substance which can be dissolved, crushed, put into gel capsules or edible paper ("parachutes"). It can be administered [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Oral) , [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Sublingual) , buccally or via [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Insufflation) ("snorting" or "sniffing").

#### Pills
**Do not trust underground brand names, they are easily falsified**
 
The previously good reputation of 'Mistubishi's' amongst ecstasy-users has been dealt a blow with the discovery of deadly batches ( [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) has been found in White Mitsubishi, [PMMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMMA) has been found in Red Mitsubishi )
**Pills** are the most common form in which MDMA is sold, and are commonly referred to as **Ecstasy** . They often contain other substances or adulterants that range from anything from [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , [MDEA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDEA) , [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or mCPP to synthesis by-products such as MDP2P, MDDM or [2C-H](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-H) . They can also contain an array random substances such as [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) , prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, poisons or nothing at all. It is strongly recommended to take [harm reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction) measures such as using a reagent testing kit when ingesting unknown pills. The average concentration of MDMA in ecstasy pills, tested in a drug checking program in Zurich, doubled between 2010 and 2018. The percentage of pills containing more than 120 mg MDMA rose from 4% to 73%. In the same period, the rate of pills containing other psychoactive compounds dropped from 53% to 7%.

## Research

### MDMA-assisted psychotherapy

#### Dosages

Common dosages for MDMA-assisted therapy:

- 1.1-1.7 mg/kg, or 80-120 mg for a 70 kg person.
- Kilo body weight + 50 in milligrams

#### MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD

In 2011, a pilot study on 20 patients demonstrated promising results in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After two or three MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions, 83% of the patients no longer met the criteria for PTSD, compared to only 25% in the control group where MDMA was replaced with a placebo. The results sustained at two and twelve months after the treatment. The MDMA and placebo group both received non-drug psychotherapy before and after the sessions. In the study, a dose of 125mg MDMA plus a 62.5mg supplemental dose after 2 hours have been administered. After completion of the study, the patients from the placebo group also received MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, and a long-term follow-up study of 19 patients published in 2013 shows that even after three years the positive results maintained.

In 2017, the FDA granted MDMA a breakthrough therapy designation for PTSD, meaning if studies show promise, a review for potential medical use could occur more quickly. Phase 3 clinical trials to look at effectiveness and safety have already begun, and are expected to be completed in 2021, meaning the FDA could approve treatment as early as 2022.

### R-MDMA

MDMA is typically produced and consumed in its [racemic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racemic) form (known as SR-MDMA) which consists of equal parts S-MDMA and R-MDMA. A 2017 study found that high doses of R-MDMA administered in mice increased prosocial behavior and facilitated fear-extinction learning but did not produce hyperthermia or signs of neurotoxicity. This is thought to owe itself to the lower dopamine release R-MDMA displays relative to SR-MDMA. This result suggests that R-MDMA may be a safer and more viable therapeutic than racemic MDMA. However, more research is needed to validate this finding.

## Reagent results

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The short-term physical health risks of MDMA consumption include [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , bruxism, [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) , and hyponatremia. MDMA generally does not cause any serious or life threatening effects by itself unless it is associated with other extraneous factors such as exposure to prolonged high ambient temperature and humidity, prolonged physical activities, poor intake of water and lack of acclimatization.

Continuous activity without sufficient rest or rehydration may cause the user's body temperature to rise to dangerous levels, and loss of fluid via excessive sweating puts the body at further risk as the stimulating and euphoric qualities of MDMA may cause the user to become oblivious to their physical condition.

Diuretics such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) may exacerbate these risks further due to causing excessive amounts of dehydration. Users are advised to pay close attention to their water intake, drinking neither too much nor too little, and to take care not to overexert themselves to avoid heat-stroke, which can be fatal.

### Toxic dose

The exact toxic dosage is unknown, but considered to be far greater than its effective dose. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance

Water intoxication symptoms typically show up when a person consumes more than about 3-4 liters of water within an hour. Also, an important cause of death following MDMA use is hyponatremia, low blood sodium levels as a result of drinking too much water.

Ecstasy users have reported that [xerostomia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia) (dry mouth) is common. The [excessive drinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydipsia) observed in case reports of MDMA use may be caused by [hyperpyrexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpyrexia) , a change in the primary drive to drink, and exposure to harm reduction messages that emphasize the need to drink water. Higher doses of MDMA result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination. Urinary retention is caused by MDMA’s promotion of the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH); ADH is responsible for regulating urination. This effect can be lessened by relaxing, but can also be relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to encourage blood flow. However, MDMA causes water retention and [dilution of electrolytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte_imbalance) . Consequently, overhydration has caused death from water intoxication. It was a main cause of the [Death of Leah Betts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Leah_Betts) who consumed an excstasy tablet followed by approximately 7 litres (1.8 US gal) of water in a 90 minute period, that resulted in water intoxication and hyponatremia, which in turn led to serious [swelling of the brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema) , irreparably damaging it.

Users may experience signs of dehydration such as dry mouth and sweating while dancing or in a hot environment.

#### Water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance prevention

It is advised that users have hydration available, drink to thirst and never over-drink. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

- Avoid consuming more than 3 liters of water within a few hours.
- Hyponatremia is preventable by drinking fluid containing sodium, such as that contained in sports drinks (typically ~20mM NaCl).

### Neurotoxicity

The neurotoxicity of MDMA use is the subject of considerable debate. Scientific study has resulted in the general agreement that, although it is physically safe to try in a responsible context, the administration of repeated or high dosages of MDMA is most certainly neurotoxic in some form.

Administration of MDMA causes subsequent down-regulation of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) reuptake transporters in the brain. The rate at which the brain recovers from serotonergic changes is unclear. One study demonstrated lasting serotonergic changes in some animals exposed to MDMA. Other studies have suggested that the brain may recover from serotonergic damage.

It is thought that MDMA's metabolites play a large role in the uncertain levels of neurotoxicity. For example, a metabolite of MDMA called [alpha-Methyldopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Methyldopamine) (α-Me-DA, which is known to be toxic to [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) ) was thought believed to be involved in the toxicity of MDMA to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) .

However, one study found this to not be the case as direct administration of α-Me-DA did not cause neurotoxicity. Additionally, MDMA injected directly into the brain was found to not be toxic, implying a metabolite is responsible for the toxicity when MDMA is administered via insufflation or oral consumption.

This study found that although α-Me-DA is involved, it is a further metabolite of α-Me-DA involving glutathione that is primarily responsible for the selective damage to [5-HT receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-HT_receptors) triggered by MDMA/ [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) . This metabolite forms in higher concentrations when core temperature is elevated. It is taken up into [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) by its transporters and metabolized by [MAO-B](/w/index.php?title=MAO-B&action=edit&redlink=1) into a reactive oxygen species which can cause neurological damage.

#### Retracted article on dopaminergic neurotoxicity of MDMA

[“Severe dopaminergic neurotoxicity in primates after a common recreational dose regimen of MDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retracted_article_on_dopaminergic_neurotoxicity_of_MDMA) ” is an article by George A. Ricaurte which was published in September 2002 in the peer-reviewed journal *Science* , one of the world's top academic journals. It was later retracted; instead of using MDMA, [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) had been used in the test.

### Cardiotoxicity

Long-term heavy use of MDMA has been shown to be cardiotoxic and may lead to valvulopathy (heart valve damage) through its actions on the 5-HT 2B receptor.

In one study, 28% of long-term users (2-3 doses per week for a mean of 6 years, mean of age 24.3 years) had developed clinically evident valvular heart disease.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of MDMA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if one suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of MDMA develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly larger doses to achieve the same effects.

Upon a single administration, it takes about 1 month for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2.5 months to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

MDMA exhibits cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopaminergic) and [serotonergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of MDMA all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **SSRIs** and **SNRIs** - may dampen the the desired psychological effects of MDMA while retaining the same level of undesirable physiological side-effects. But unlike common belief it doesn't cause serotonin syndrome. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **25x-NBOMe** - Due to the highly unpredictable and physically straining effects of 25x-NBOMe, combinations with MDMA are strongly discouraged.
- **Protease Inhibitors** - Certain HIV medications like Ritonavir or Cobicistat contain protease inhibitors, that cause the liver to process MDMA slower resulting in longer and stronger effects, which causes more harm to the liver and might cause overdosing. A lower dose is recommended.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - 5-MeO tryptamines are considered to be unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care.
- **Alcohol** - Both MDMA and alcohol cause dehydration and bodily strain. Approach this combination with caution, moderation and sufficient hydration. More than a small amount of alcohol will dull the euphoria of MDMA.
- **Cocaine** - Cocaine blocks some of the desirable effects of MDMA while increasing the risk of heart attack. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **DOx** - The combined stimulating effects of DOx and MDMA can become overbearing, particularly during the come-up phase. Additionally, coming down on the MDMA while the DOx is still active can produce significant anxiety and bodily discomfort.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Large amounts of GHB/GBL may overwhelm the effects of MDMA on the comedown and place the user at risk of sudden loss of consciousness.
- **MXE** - There have been reports of concerning serotonergic interactions when the two are taken at the same time, but MXE taken to the end of an MDMA experience does not appear to cause the same issues.
- **PCP** - PCP with MDMA may increase the risk of excessive stimulation, [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and this risk is especially elevated when tramadol is taken with MDMA.

### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can lead to dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. Serotonin syndrome requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** such as **[syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue)** , **[banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi)** , **phenelzine** , **selegiline** , and **moclobemide** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with MDMA will lead to hypertensive crises.
- **Serotonin releasers** such as **MDMA** , **[4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA)** , **[methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine)** , **[methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone)** and **[αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT)**
- **AMT**
- **2C-T-x**
- **DXM**
- **5-HTP** - 5-HTP is a supplement that acts as a precursor for serotonin. It is sometimes recommended to be used after MDMA experiences to try to restore depleted serotonin reserves. However, taking 5-HTP shortly before or with MDMA may cause excessive serotonin levels in the brain, which can lead to serotonin syndrome. As a result, it is advised to wait until the day after the MDMA has been used before consuming 5-HTP.

## Effects
MDMA mainly causes an increased release of the body's own messenger substance serotonin. At the recommended dosage, about 80% of the available serotonin at that time is released. This release triggers a feeling of euphoria, lightness and light-heartedness. Sight and hearing change, touch and music are felt more intensely, inhibitions are reduced and the need for contact is increased. The effect is described as empathogenic (triggering a feeling of closeness and connection to other people) and entactogenic (touching the inner self, intensifying emotional perception). The simultaneous release of the neurotransmitters noradrenalin and dopamine has a stimulating effect. This reduces the feeling of hunger and thirst as well as tiredness and increases alertness. Body temperature and blood pressure also rise.

## Dosage
Swallowed max. 1.5 mg MDMA per kg body weight for men, max. 1.3 mg per kg body weight for women. Lower doses are recommended for rectal and nasal use.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Side effects are jaw spasms, muscle tremors, urinary retention, headache, nausea/vomiting, increased pulse and blood pressure. The heart, liver and kidneys are particularly stressed. There is also a risk of life-threatening overheating as body temperature rises and the body becomes dehydrated. In the case of an overdose, hallucinations are possible. When the effect wears off or on the days afterwards, depressive moods may occur.

### Long-term Risks
After a consumption experience, the body needs at least 4 weeks to regenerate the serotonin balance. If one does not allow oneself this break in the long term and consumes repeatedly after short breaks, the probability of a permanent restriction of spatial awareness increases. This risk also exists after repeated high doses. Intense and prolonged use of ecstasy can also lead to a change in the serotonin system. A form of dependence with psychological symptoms can develop, especially if ecstasy use is linked to a certain activity, for example if it is always used at parties and partying without ecstasy afterwards is no longer possible. In the case of snorting, the nasal mucous membranes and the nasal wall are damaged. Rectal use can cause irritation in the rectum.

## Safer Use
- If you want to be sure that your pill really contains MDMA and know the dose, use drug checking. If this is not possible, first consume only one third of the pill.
- Do not add more right away, but wait two hours for the full effect and then decide.
- Avoid mixed use with other substances.
- Avoid alcohol and drink enough non-alcoholic beverages. Approx. 3 dl per hour is enough. Isotonic drinks are best to avoid hyponatremia ("water intoxication").
- Take breaks from dancing at parties and get some fresh air.
- Do not wear headgear, except in strong sun (danger of overheating!).
- Do not take ecstasy immediately after a meal, but also not on an empty stomach. It is advisable to have a light, healthy meal a few hours before.
- Accept when the effect runs out. "Re-spiking" increases the toxicity (poisonousness) of MDMA.
- Give yourself time to recover and take regular breaks (at least 4-6 weeks) to restore serotonin levels.
- If you use MDMA nasally, follow the safe-sniffing rules. If consuming rectally, use lubricant to minimise the risk of rectal irritation.
- If you are taking medication, ask your doctor about possible interactions. If you are taking psychotropic drugs, the use of MDMA is strongly discouraged (risk of serotonin syndrome)!
- Ecstasy can cause asthma attacks in asthmatics and epileptic seizures in epileptics.
- People with high blood pressure, heart problems, hyperthyroidism, liver and kidney diseases or circulatory problems should refrain from using MDMA.

## Adulterants & Extenders

In addition to the side effects typical of MDMA, there is a risk of taking misdeclared substances, pharmacologically active extenders and high-dose tablets when consuming ecstasy tablets. Even ecstasy tablets with the same logo or appearance can differ greatly in terms of composition. In 2020, a warning was issued for 90.8 % of the ecstasy tablets analysed due to a high MDMA content (> 120 mg MDMA). 41.7 % of the tablets contained more than 200 mg MDMA in 2020. Such high doses can lead to health problems.

### Common Adulterants

**MBDB**

**MDA**

**MDEA**

**Synthesis by-products MDMA**
In addition to DPIA (bis-amphetamine or di(beta-phenylisopropyl)amines), MDP2P and 1-benzyl-3-methylnaphthalene were analysed in ecstasy tablets. Little information is available on the risks of these synthetic by-products, and the interaction potential between these synthetic by-products and MDMA is completely unknown. MDP2P(3,4-methylenedioxy-phenylpropan-2-one) is a precursor substance for the synthesis (production) of MDMA. This is an indication of an incomplete synthesis process. The risks and side effects of this substance are unknown and there is no information on mixed use with MDMA. Whether and how MDP2P influences the risk of consumption cannot be assessed.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/34-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-mdma/*

MDMA is a stimulant with strong entactogen effects. Unlike regular stimulants, a key aspect of entactogens is their impact on emotions and their ability to enhance “inner awareness,” which gives them a wide array of applications.

It’s the most popular entactogen by far. MDMA has shown promise in psychotherapy, particularly in the treatment of PTSD, though it’s most often used in recreational settings.

The substance is heavily associated with music events, but it’s also taken at house parties, in small social gatherings, and with friends or partners.

Since the MDMA market is affected by adulterants, drug checking is vital.

PubChem: 1615

Molecular formula: C11H15NO2

Molecular weight: 193.246 g/mol

IUPAC: 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-2-amine

---

## Dose

#### Oral

Light: 75 – 100 mg

Common: 100 – 150 mg

Strong: 150 – 175 mg

**Best:** Weight (kg) + 50 mg *[Using a weight-associated formula for dosing is wise.]*

When used in tablet form, the average dose is 1-4 tablets over the course of a use session. The average tablet contains 75 to 150 mg, but they can contain over 200-300 mg. You should stick with .5-1 tablets as your initial dose.

Redosing is discouraged, though it’s a very common practice since it may be able to extend the effect period. The safest way to redose is to take 50% of your original dose around 2 – 2.5 hours after your first dose.

---

## Timeline

#### Oral

Total: 3 – 5 hours

Onset: 00:30 – 00:60

People sometimes report the onset is 90-120 minutes. This isn’t nearly as common, but sometimes the onset is delayed.

## Effects

#### Positive

- Euphoria
- Increased empathy
- Sense of well-being
- Stimulation
- Talkativeness
- Personal insight
- Anxiolysis
- Music enhancement

#### Negative

- Jaw clenching
- Appetite reduction
- Dry mouth
- Sweating
- Difficulty concentration
- Anxiety
- Panic
- Greater sensitivity to cold
- Impaired balance

#### Recreational

The core effects of MDMA differ from stimulants and hallucinogens because it acts on the emotional sphere and doesn’t heavily affect other cognitive processes or perception.

People use the drug because it offers improved mood, euphoria, feelings of love, increased sociability, increased empathy, and decreased inhibition. Those effects contribute to prosocial activity, which can be good in small groups, between couples, and even in a large music festival. Part of the prosocial activity comes from decreased defensiveness (feeling as though you can lower your inhibitions.)

Not only do people feel happier, they may feel at ease in the world and pleased with anyone they’re surrounded by. MDMA can also make people happier with themselves. It tends to break down inhibitions that’d typically stand in the way of communication, acceptance, and appreciation.

The happy, carefree, sociable, and even relaxed mental state offered by the drug is considered very enjoyable in most cases.

Although tiredness is reduced, a lot of people find it’s less clearly stimulating than amphetamine or methamphetamine. In fact, a lot of people feel relaxed and calm on the drug. If you’re in a calm setting, you probably won’t feel like you have to move around a lot.

**Sensory**

No true hallucinations are produced by the drug and it doesn’t even offer psychedelic-like perceptual effects.

It can lead to slight visual changes, such as brightness changes, color alterations, seeing things as farther/closer away, and simple visual distortions. Your vision may be a little blurry or have a “soft” overlay.

Often there’s an enhancement and shift in the meaning or significance of the things you perceive.

Increased/enhanced tactile perception is common, as is music enhancement.

**Reasons for use & settings**

The reasons for use can vary quite a bit and the setting typically changes as a result.

Among the primary reasons are:

- Recreational (music enhancement, euphoria, prosocial, stimulation)
- Interpersonal (partner, friend, small group)
- Therapy
- Solo (self-therapy, creativity, personal development)

The settings include festivals, clubs, house parties, social gatherings, small groups of friends, with partners, and therapy/personal development.

#### Progression

**Onset**

**Coming up**

**Peak and Plateau**

#### Negatives

Even though the average MDMA experience is positive, there can be some negatives that either take up the entire effect period or a portion of it.

Two of the primary negatives are anxiety and occasionally panic. Those feelings are most common during the onset and come-up, but they could persist throughout the experience. More often the drug is anxiolytic rather than anxiety-causing.

Some of the anxiety people report may come from concerns or hesitations about losing control. Racing thoughts are another contributing factor.

When people experience anxiety or panic, they may end up with dysphoria instead of euphoria.

It’s also possible for someone to be too disinhibited, which could lead to unwise statements or actions in social settings. Typically, however, people refrain from doing things that are truly unwise.

#### Physical

MDMA leads to a rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, elevated heart rate, increased myocardial oxygen consumption, increased temperature, and pupil dilation.

Often people will encounter bruxism (excessive jaw clenching or teeth grinding), so chewing gum is common.

The cardiovascular effects usually peak around 1-2 hours and are gone within 6 hours.

#### Gender and phenotype differences

(Liechti, 2000) – Reviewing three studies involving 54 males and 20 females

- Mean dose across studies: 120, 113, and 102 mg. Corresponding to 1.7 mg/kg, 1.64 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg.
- More in females 
- Feelings of “carefree,” “free of worries and obligations,” “boundless joy,” and “comprehensive love”
- More thought disturbances, with greater impairment of decision making, accelerated thinking, and losing track of one’s thoughts.
- Fear of loss of body control.
- Greatest differences 
- More perceptual changes, such as “objects had a new and unfamiliar meaning” and that “minor things carried a particular meaning”
- Elementary hallucinations
- Higher doses in the 1.35-1.8 mg/kg range led to more hallucinogen-like perceptual changes.
- Only women had increased anxiety and depression 
- Attributable to feelings of helplessness, defenselessness, and an increased need for protection.
- Jaw clenching, increased tension in maxillary muscles, dry mouth, loss of appetite.
- More in males 
- Activated more by the drug, reporting greater activeness and energy.
- Rise in blood pressure
- Greater HR in both, but only statistically significant in men.
- Peripheral body temperature only reached significance in men.
- Sweating and nausea

(Sumnall, 2006) – Survey of subjective experiences

- Males had a higher lifetime use of MDMA.

(Pardo-Lozano, 2012) – Investigating the role of gender and genetics.

- 27 participants (12 female, 15 male)
- 1.4 mg/kg MDMA
- Results 
- Physiological 
- Gender 
- Women had higher values than men in heart rate and oral temperature (AUC and Emax).
- COMT val158met genotype 
- The val/val allele carriers had higher SBP and DBP compared to met/* (AUC and Emax).
- 5-HTTLPR genotype 
- The l/* allele carriers had higher SBP (AUC and Emax), DBP (AUC and Emax), and HR (AUC, with a trend towards significance in Emax).
- Subjective 
- Gender 
- Women had higher scores in dizziness, depression/sadness, and sedation scores.
- COMT val158met genotype 
- The met/* carriers had higher dizziness.
- 5-HTTLPR genotype 
- The s/s carriers had higher sedation values, but only for AUC0-4.
- Pharmacokinetics 
- Women and men receiving 1.4 mg/kg had similar plasma concentrations of MDMA and their metabolites.
- Author interpretation 
- There are marked gender differences in the effects of MDMA. 
- Females experience higher cardiovascular effects and more dizziness, depression/sadness, and sedation.
- The differences didn’t come from different levels of MDMA or MDA.

#### Comedown & after effects

During the initial comedown period, some users have an afterglow feeling while others feel depleted/exhausted and prone to anxiety. This is likely influenced by environment and dose.

In the days following MDMA use, a portion of users experience 1-3 days of negatives like depressed mood, insomnia, anhedonia, irritability, decreased alertness, fatigue, decreased appetite, muscle aches, and jaw tension.

Usually those negative after effects are absent or minor with common doses in low-activity settings. In fact, some people actually feel an afterglow for a couple days after taking the drug.

#### Studies on effects

(Hysek, 2013) – Enhancement of emotional empathy and prosocial behavior

- 32 people, mean age of 25 
- Excluded those with smoking, a lifetime history using illicit drug over 5 times (exception of cannabis use), use of non-cannabis illicit drugs in past 2 months.
- 22/32 had never used MDMA and 10/32 had less than five experiences with MDMA.
- Double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design 
- MDMA at 125 mg and then placebo
- Washout period of at least 10 days
- Subjective effects 
- Significant effect on VAS scores of: happy, open, close to others
- Significant effect on AMRS scores of: activity, inactivity, extroversion, introversion, well-being, emotional excitation, and dreaminess.
- No significant effect on anxiety.
- Empathy 
- Significantly raised explicit and implicit emotional empathy ratings. 
- For both kinds, the MDMA-induced increase was significant for positive valence stimuli, but not for negative valence stimuli.
- Post hoc analysis found it only increased explicit and implicit emotional empathy ratings in men. 
- MDMA raised the empathy ratings in men to the levels of empathy in women after placebo administration.
- Social value orientation 
- Increased prosociality 
- Post hoc analysis found it significant increased prosocial behavior in men, not women. 
- It led to levels of prosocial behavior that were comparable to the level in placebo-treated women.
- Facial emotion recognition 
- Impaired the accuracy of emotion recognition 
- Differential effects on men and women 
- Women performed much worse after MDMA treatment, while men didn’t.
- Valence-specific analyses 
- MDMA significantly impaired the correct recognition of fearful, angry, disgusted, and surprised faces.
- It didn’t alter the correct identification of happy faces.
- Significant impairments in the accuracy for fearful, angry, and sad faces were only found in women.
- Fear recognition accuracy in women was inversely correlated with the Cmax.
- Increased the detection threshold for fearful faces.
- Endocrine effects 
- Significantly raised plasma levels of oxytocin, cortisol, and prolactin
- Didn’t alter plasma levels of copeptin or testosterone
- No correlation was found between neuroendocrine and entactogenic or prosocial effects.
- Pharmacokinetics 
- The Cmax and AUC (0-6 h hours) was higher in women
- Mean Cmax in males: 209 ng/mL
- Mean Cmax in females: 269.9 ng/mL
- This is from relative doses of 1.68 mg/kg for men and 2.09 mg/kg for women.
- Tmax average was: 2.44 hours 
- 2.10 in males
- 2.75 in females

#### Medical

MDMA has primarily been studied for its ability to enhance therapy sessions, especially in the context of treating PTSD. Some of the relevant mechanisms may be increased oxytocin, increased serotonin, and increased norepinephrine.

The available data indicates the drug is useful as an adjunct to psychotherapy.

It appears to improve the therapeutic alliance and help patients remain engaged with emotional material in an optimal way (not underengaged, but also not hyper-activated).

Therapists have noticed the potential benefits of MDMA since the 1970s. For decades, basically all of the efficacy information was anecdotal, which is no longer the case.

#### Interactions with other drugs

---

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

MDMA is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine. It has structural similarities to amphetamine, methamphetamine, and mescaline.

Compared to methamphetamine, MDMA’s methylenedioxy moiety offers increased serotonin release and lower dopamine release.

It is sold as a racemic mixture of S- and R-MDMA. S-MDMA is more potent as a monoamine release.

#### Pharmacology

The core effects of the drug can be tied back to monoamine release, particularly of serotonin, but also of norepinephrine and dopamine. Those monoamines activate presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors. In the case of dopamine, much of the release may be coming indirectly from serotonergic activity.

It also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin.

MDMA increases the active concentrations of serotonin in a transporter-mediated way (reversal of transporter function). It appears to have an action at VMAT2, which leads to more serotonin in the cytosol, thereby contributing to higher serotonin concentrations. This means it increases serotonin via reversal of SERT function as well as through an impact on vesicular storage via VMAT2.

A rise in serotonin is the key source of the drug’s effects, though norepinephrine may contribute to the cardiostimulant and psychostimulant effects.

Most global brain effects likely come indirectly from serotonin release. For example, MDMA may cause acetylcholine release and changes in the GABAergic system via serotonin activating 5-HT4 receptors.

EC50 (rat brain synaptosomes)

Serotonin release

- Racemate: 74.3 nM
- S-MDMA: 70.8 nM
- R-MDMA: 337 nM

Norepinephrine release

- Racemate: 136 nM
- S-MDMA: 110 nM
- R-MDMA: 564 nM

Dopamine release

- Racemate: 278 nM
- S-MDMA: 142 nM
- R-MDMA: 3682 nM

**Other**

Direct binding

There’s a relatively high affinity for 5-HT2 receptors, with some apparent agonist properties at 5-HT2C, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B. However, the direct receptor binding-mediated effects are likely much lower than the effects arising from serotonin release.

Only low affinity for D1 and D2 dopamine receptors is seen. Under 50% binding is present at 0.5 mM (Battaglia, 1988).

Some affinity exists for adrenergic receptors, primarily at a2-adrenergic rather than a1- or b-adrenergic receptors.

In vitro results from (Hondenrink, 2011) suggest there could be inhibition of a1b2y2 GABAa receptors, leading to less inhibitory input on serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons.

**Animal studies**

(Baumann, 2006)

- Rats given IV 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg MDMA
- Peak rise in serotonin was 10-fold, peak rise in dopamine was 2-fold.

**Endocrine**

It causes a rise in cortisol, oxytocin, prolactin, ACTH, and possibly vasopressin.

Oxytocin

MDMA has been found to activate the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus, which is where the cell bodies of the brain’s oxytocinergic neurons are located.

The magnitude of SON activation appears to be greater with a high ambient temperature in animals.

Elevations of oxytocin in peripheral blood is present, which indicates higher brain levels.

This action appears to occur through a serotonergic mechanism, specifically at 5-HT1A.

Increased oxytocin may partly account for the social and empathy effects.

Studies

*Human*

(Parrott, 2007)

- 800% higher saliva cortisol levels 4 hours after MDMA at a house party compared to baseline values at.

(Parrott, 2008)

- 800% higher saliva cortisol levels 2.5 hours after MDMA compared to baseline value.

(Dumont, 2009)

- 15 participants 
- Partly missing data from 2 people due to mild psychological discomfort (mild anxiety resolving within 60 min) after MDMA administration.
- Single 100 mg dose
- Results 
- MDMA kinetics 
- Mean Cmax was 222.7 ug/L reached 105 min after administration
- Showed a decline to 174.6 ug/L by 300 min after administration
- Oxytocin kinetics 
- Plasma oxytocin levels significantly increased after MDMA 
- Rising from a basal 0.8 pmol/L to an average max of 34.3 pmol/L at 110 min after drug administration
- Declined to 4.0 pmol/L by 300 minutes
- Subjective 
- Subjective amicability and subjective gregariousness showed a significant rise under MDMA.
- Both had a significant positive correlation with oxytocin.
- Subjective amicability was significantly correlated with MDMA, but gregariousness wasn’t.
- Author interpretation 
- Oxytocin may be involved in prosocial activity from MDMA based on the rise in both and their correlation.
- This fits with (Thompson, 2007) which found the oxytocin antagonist tocinoic acid blocked prosocial effects in rats
- And it appears the rise in oxytocin was mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor since a 5-HT1A antagonist blocked the rise (Thompson, 2007)
- Possible role for oxytocin in prosocial action 
- Oxytocin attenuates the amygdala response to novel social encounters (Baumgartner, 2008) and the amygdala attenuation inhibits excitatory flow from the amygdala to brain stem sites mediated peripheral fear response (Huber, 2005)
- Oxytocin may therefore be prosocial based on reducing anxiety surrounding social interaction.

Animal

(Thompson, 2007) – Role of 5-HT1A and oxytocin

- Rats
- Results 
- 5 mg/kg MDMA led to a rise in SON/PVN activity and oxytocin labeling
- 5 mg/kg also led to significantly higher plasma oxytocin levels
- Tocinoic acid attenuated the effects of MDMA on prosocial activity 
- The same was seen with attenuating 8-OH-DPAT

(Morley, 2005) – Role of 5-HT1A receptor in social activity

- Rats
- Results 
- MDMA at 5 mg/kg significantly increased the duration of social interaction in pairs of rats meeting for the first time; it also led to higher anxiety-related behavior in the emergence test.
- Pretreatment with various serotonin antagonists failed to block anxiogenic activity.
- Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 or the 5-HT2B/2C antagonist SB 206553 blocked MDMA-induced increase in social behavior. 
- Though SB 206533 led to pronounced thigmotaxis (hyperactivity at the periphery of the testing chamber)
- Pretreatment with ketanserin (5-HT2A antagonist) or GR 55562 (5-HT1B antagonist) failed to block pro-social action
- Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 was also found to significantly reverse all markers of serotonin syndrome
- Author interpretation 
- Anxiety from MDMA appears unrelated to 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, or 5-HT2C.
- Pro-social action may involve 5-HT1A and possibly 5-HT2A/2B.
- Serotonin syndrome is connected to 5-HT1A agonism.

**Preadministration studies**

SSRIs

SSRIs have been found to block most of the psychological and some of the physiological effects in humans.

(Liechti, 2000)

- 12 males and 4 females
- Double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject
- Conditions 
- Placebo-placebo
- Citalopram-placebo
- Placebo-MDMA
- Citalopram-MDMA
- Doses 
- 40 mg citalopram (IV)
- 1.5 mg/kg MDMA (oral)
- Citalopram infused over a 90 min period, followed by oral use of MDMA or placebo.
- Psychometric measurements were performed at 120 min post-MDMA/placebo.
- Results 
- Citalopram pretreatment markedly reduced overall effects, though it prolonged the duration to 5 hours.
- Citalopram pretreatment markedly reduced scores on: positive mood, mania-like experience, derealization, depersonalization, alterations of the sense of time, thought disorder, loss of thought control, loss of body control, changed meaning of percepts, and facilitated imagination.
- It also significantly reduced self-confidence and extroversion scores comparable of citalopram alone.
- Reduction in “heightened mood” failed to reach significance
- MDMA’s rise in emotional excitability and sensitivity were not blocked by citalopram at all.

(Farre, 2007)

- 12 participants
- Double-blind, randomized, crossover, controlled.
- Each subject participants in two 3-day sessions, with a washout of at least 15 days.
- Dosing 
- Either 20 mg per day of paroxetine on days 1, 2, and 3 or placebo.
- MDMA 100 mg on Day 3.
- Paroxetine given 3 hours before MDMA on Day 3.
- Results 
- Physiological 
- Paroxetine significantly reduced many of the effects. 
- It significantly decreased SBP, DBP, and heart rate.
- SBP Emax was down 12 mm Hg, DBP was down 5 mm Hg, and heart rate was down 14 bpm
- Mydriasis was also much lower, dropping from 3.33 to 1.23 mm
- Significant decrease in the rise in oral temperature, with a peak difference of 0.3°C
- Psychomotor 
- Paroxetine reduced the slight deterioration of performance from MDMA, but no significant difference except for Emax in reaction time errors and a few time points in DSST correct responses and Pauli test.
- Subjective 
- Paroxetine significantly decreased many of the subjective effects.
- Significant drop in ARCI and VESSPA scales.
- Significantly lower VAS scores for: stimulation, high, any effect, good effects, liking, changing in lights, different/changed/unreal body feeling, and different/unreal surroundings
- Plasma concentrations 
- MDMA plasma concentration was 22% (AUC) and 16% (Cmax) higher with paroxetine 
- While HMMA was 39% (AUC) and 49% (Cmax) lower.
- Author interpretation 
- Despite paroxetine’s CYP2D6 inhibition leading to a significant rise in plasma concentration for MDMA, the effects of MDMA were significantly attenuated.
- Paroxetine could significantly reduce euphoric, pleasurable, and dysphoric effects of MDMA
- MDMA’s dopamine release could be partly mediated via 5-HT2 activation, which would explain the decline in effect from both SSRIs and from a D2 antagonist haloperidol (Liechti, 2000)

Haloperidol (D2 antagonist)

(Liechti, 2000) – Only reduced MDMA-induced positive mood. This could be from D2 receptors playing a role in the amphetamine-like action of MDMA. Results are tentative given haloperidol may lead to a somewhat dysphoric mood on its own.

Methylphenidate

(Hysek, 2014) – Showed methylphenidate didn’t alter the subjective effects of MDMA in humans, which is consistent with dopamine playing a minor role.

Ketanserin (5-HT2A antagonist)

(Liechti, 2000)

In humans, ketanserin given 2 hours pre-MDMA reduced the effects on body temperature and diastolic blood pressure. This might be explained by ketanserin’s a1-adrenergic antagonism.

It also significantly reduced sensory and perceptual effects, while not affecting other aspects of the drug’s activity.

(Nash, 1998) – Might block hyperthermia in rats.

Bupropion

(Schmid, 2015)

- Background 
- Bupropion is known to inhibit the amphetamine and methamphetamine-induced release of dopamine in vitro.
- The role of DA in MDMA isn’t clear, while we know more about the role of serotonin and norepinephrine.
- Because it largely lacks recreational effects of its own, bupropion may be more useful for preadministration than methylphenidate.
- Bupropion is thought to bind to the substrate recognition site on DAT, similarly to MDMA, while methylphenidate and cocaine might interact elsewhere.
- Design 
- 16 participants
- CYP2D6 phenotyping showed 13 extensive, 3 intermediate, and 0 poor metabolizers.
- Bupropion or placebo given daily for 7 days.
- Bupropion (300 mg oral) given on test day two hours pre-MDMA (125 mg oral).
- Results 
- Autonomic 
- Bupropion significantly reduced the MDMA-induced heart rate increase, but it failed to significantly affect BP or temperature.
- It didn’t reduce the mydriatic effect.
- Endocrine 
- Lack of impact on plasma prolactin, cortisol, oxytocin, or epinephrine.
- Norepinephrine and dopamine 
- Bupropion significantly reduced the MDMA-induced rise in plasma norepinephrine.
- No treatment altered plasma dopamine.
- Adverse 
- Bupropion failed to alter the acute of subacute adverse effects, such as lack of appetite, perspiration, tremor, restlessness, dry mouth, or bruxism.
- Subjective 
- MDMA increased VAS vatings for any drug effect, good drug effect, drug high, drug liking, and stimulated.
- Bupropion enhanced the positive mood effects of MDMA, as seen with a prolonged action.
- Bupropion didn’t alter “stimulation.”
- Pharmacokinetics 
- Bupropion pretreatment significantly increased the Cmax and AUC of MDMA and prolonged its half-life.
- Bupropion pretreatment significantly decreased the plasma concentrations of MDA and prolonged the half-life and Tmax of HMMA.
- Author interpretation 
- Bupropion could reduce the heart rate increase from MDMA and prolong its subjective effects.
- Bupropion reduced circulating norepinephrine and the cardiostimulant effects of MDMA.
- Findings indicate norepinephrine mediates the cardiostimulant effects of MDMA.
- Blocking the DAT with bupropion failed to reduce the positive mood effects of MDMA, indicating dopamine isn’t a critical mediator of subjective MDMA effects.
- How bupropion could prolong the subjective response isn’t clear 
- This has also been shown in terms of effect enhancement with cocaine.
- A partial pharmacokinetic contribution may exist, but it doesn’t seem to fully be responsible.

#### Pharmacokinetics

Half-life: 7 – 9 hours

MDA half-life: 16 – 38 hours

The primarily metabolic route of MDMA is demethylenation to HHMA.

MDA is only a minor metabolite, with plasma concentrations usually under 5-10% of MDMA’s in humans.

**Routes**

MDMA -> HHMA -> HMMA

MDMA -> MDA -> HHA -> HMA

CYP2D6 is the most important enzyme for clearance. Other contributors throughout its metabolism are CYP2B6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19,

COMT is important as it’s responsible for HHA -> HMA and HHMA -> HMMA. HHA and HHMA are both sources of problematic metabolites.

(Vizeli, 2017) – Investigating the pharmacogenetics of MDMA response

- Looking at the role of CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP1A2 in MDMA’s conversion to MDA. 
- CYP1A2 was investigated based on it being inducible by tobacco use in rs762551 A/A vs. the C/A and C/C genotypes. 
- Therefore, MDA formation was examined in tobacco smokers with A/A vs. others.
- 142 participants
- MDMA given at 75 mg or 125 mg
- Results 
- CYP2C19 
- MDMA plasma levels increased faster in the two CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, but it was a nonsignificant effect.
- CYP2C19 genotype significantly influenced AUC (0-6 h) of MDA and the MDMA/MDA ration, but not HMMA levels.
- The genotypes had no impact on body temperature or subjective effects.
- CYP2B6 
- CYP2B6 genotype significantly affected MDMA Cmax, with a higher concentration in T/T vs. G/G genotype.
- Significant effect on MDMA/MDA AUC (0-6 h) ration, with higher ratio in T/T vs. G/T or G/G.
- No significant effects on plasma levels of MDA or HMMA.
- No significant effect o autonomic or subjective effects.
- CYP1A2 and smoking interactions 
- Smoking status interaction with 1A2 genotype (inducible A/A vs. non-inducible A/C and C/C) on MDA Cmax and AUC6 levels. 
- Higher MDA levels in the inducible vs. non-inducible genotypes and compared to nonsmokers.
- Smoking status only affected MDA formation in inducible A/A genotype (no effect in the A/C or C/C genotypes) 
- Higher MDA formation in light smokers (6-10 cigarettes per day) vs nonsmokers and very light smokers (1-5 cigarettes per day)
- No effect on genotype or smoking or an interaction of the two on plasma levels of MDMA or HMMA
- No effect on autonomic or subjective effects.
- Effect of dose and dose normalization 
- Cmax of MDMA was greater with 125 mg than 75 mg 
- 230 ng/mL vs. 125 ng/mL
- After dose normalization, the subjective and cardiovascular effects didn’t differ betwen dose groups. 
- Though, dose-normalized Cmax values of MDMA were near-significantly greater at 125 mg than 75 mg, indicating a trend towards nonlinear kinetics by that dose.
- Subjects with CYP2C19 poor metabolizer genotype had a more rapid and greater cardiovascular response to MDMA, though only two CYP2C19 PM individuals were studied.
- Unlike CYP2C19 genotype, the CYP2B6 genotype influenced MDMA concentration later in time (3-4 hours after administration), possibly meaning that CYP2B6 becomes more important when CYP2D6 function decreases over time from auto-inhibition by MDMA.
- Author interpretation 
- Showed role of CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 on MDMA to MDA conversion humans, which validates in vitro studies.
- MDMA/MDA AUC6 ratio was greater in low CYP2C19 and low CYP2B6 participants, indicating role for both in the N-demethylation of MDMA to MDA.
- Greater cardiovascular effects from subjects with slower MDMA to MDA conversion suggests MDMA contributes more to the cardiovascular effects of the drug than MDA.

**CYP2D6**

MDMA interacts with CYP2D6 as a substrate and inhibitor. The inhibition is believed to come from an interaction between the enzyme and an MDMA metabolite.

The inhibition leads to non-linear pharmacokinetics. With repeated doses in humans, there’s a 30% AUC (0-24 hour) increase with a dose of MDMA given 24 hours after the first.

That 30% figure also appeared in (Segura, 2005), which found paroxetine preadministration led to a 30% AUC increase.

Because of the non-linear kinetics, there can be an accumulation of MDMA that could lead to higher acute toxicity. Those with a preexisting CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype could be more vulnerable.

Studies

(de la Torre, 2005)

- 10 males – 9 extensive metabolizers (1/1 or 1/4), 1 poor metabolizer
- Given 100 mg MDMA or placebo in two successive doses 25 hours apart
- Results 
- 4/4 poor metabolizer 
- Compared to 1/1 
- 3.25x greater AUC value for MDMA
- AUC for HHMA was only 51%
- Cmax for HHMA was only 40%
- Largest difference was for HMMA, which had just 12% of the AUC.
- In 1/1 subjects, the Tmax for HHMA preceded that of MDMA, but that wasn’t found in the 4/4 subject.
- There was a lack of prolactin response after both doses.
- 1/4 vs 1/1 subjects 
- AUC for MDMA was 2.5x greater; 79% of that in the 4/4 subjects
- AUC for HHMA was 80%
- Cmax for HHMA was 51%
- Temperature increased slightly in all subjects, but the rise was greater in the 4/4 subject vs. 1/1.
- After the second dose, the differences were no longer apparent, suggesting there was a phenocopying effect from the first dose’s CYP2D6 inhibition.

**Enzyme differences between populations**

CYP2D6

- Blacks 
- 1.4% are poor metabolizers
- 4.5% are ultrarapid metabolizers
- Whites 
- 5 – 10% are poor metabolizers
- Under 5% are ultrarapid metabolizers

COMT

- Blacks 
- 55% high
- 38% intermediate
- 7% low
- White 
- 23% high
- 50% intermediate
- 27% low

**Non-linear kinetics**

**Metabolism auto-inhibition**

Auto-inhibition has been shown for CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and possibly CYP1A2. The proposed potency is CYP2D6 > CYP3A4 > CYP1A2

It’s possible 2D6 inhibition could make 3A4 more important due to metabolic compensation.

CYP1A2 might be induced/upregulated

(Yubero-Lahoz, 2012)

- Showing changes in humans with caffeine as the probe drug.
- 21 participants, all of whom were 2D6 extensive metabolizers.
- Design 
- First test – 100 mg caffeine
- Washout of at least 3 days
- Second test – 1.5 mg/kg (min of 75 mg, max of 100 mg) for MDMA 
- With 100 mg caffeine dose at the 4 hour mark
- Results 
- Studying caffeine and the main paraxanthine metabolite 
- Modest but significant rise in CYP1A2 activity post-MDMA, with it being more significant in females.
- Author interpretation 
- Perhaps there’s a compensatory mechanism after 2D6 inhibition that leads to 1A2 upregulation, at least acutely, and potentially followed by inhibition of 1A2 at a later time point.

## History

#### 1912 – 1914

A related drug, MDA, was synthesized in 1910 and it was used in a notable way in humans before MDMA.

MDMA was synthesized in 1912 at Merck. It was made by a German chemist, Anton Kollisch. While there were rumors about it being created as an anorectic or psychotherapy aid, it was actually made as a precursor to methylhydrastinin.

Merck wanted to find pathways leading to antihemorrhagic (hemostatic) substances. It was trying to evade a patent from Bayer, a competitor, for a drug called “hydrastinin.” This goal was explicitly stated by Merck’s laboratory head Dr. Walter Beckh in the company’s 1912 annual report.

Beckh and a coworker, Dr. Otto Wolfes, felt the methylated analog of hydrastinin could be similarly effective. They requested a third lab member, Dr. Anton Kollisch, develop syntheses for methylhydrastinin as well as new patentable syntheses for hydrastinin.

Results from some tests with methylhydrastinin were positive, leading Merck to secure a patent for higher yield syntheses. Kollisch worked on those syntheses. They were described in German patent 274350, the subject of which was: “Procedure for the manufacturing of alkyloxyaryl-, dialkyloxyarl-, and alkylenedioxyarylaminopropanes and their at the nitrogen monoalkylated derivatives.”

Patent 274350 was assigned “to the company E. Merck in Darmstadt” by the German Imperial Patent Office in Berlin. The application for that patent was filed on December 24, 1912 and made available on May 16, 1914. Patent 274350 described multiple chemical reactions, one of which included MDMA. MDMA was mentioned without a name and listed as little more than a chemical intermediate.

Some properties were described in patent 274350: “colourless oil, boiling point 155°C at 20 mm pressure, its salt forms white crystals which boil at 148-150°C.”

There was no clear interest in using MDMA as anything more than an intermediate. While methylhydrastinin was tested at a Berlin hospital, MDMA wasn’t.

The patent mentioned the synthesis products were “important intermediates for the manufacturing of therapeutically effective compounds.”

In Merck’s Annual Report for 1912, MDMA was called “methylsafrylamin.”

#### 1927

This was the first time in 15 years that Merck again returned to mentioning MDMA. A lab at the company was interested in epinephrine and ephedrine-like substances that’d be based on safrole.

Dr. Max Oberlin, a Merck chemist, noted MDMA’s structural similarity to ephedrine and epinephrine. He had probably rediscovered patent 274350, which mentioned safrole as a starting material.

He ended up comparing MDMA (under the name “safryl-methyl-amin”) and two analogs (eugenyl-methyl-amin and methyl-eugenyl-methyl-amin) to ephedrine, according to the Annual Report for 1927.

Those investigations by Oberlin involved the first pharmacological tests with MDMA. The tests used MDMA.HCL.

MDMA was found to have comparable effects on blood glucose levels to ephedrine. It was as effective as ephedrine at vascular smooth muscle tissue and stronger at the uterus, but devoid of a “local effect at the eye.”

It also had the highest toxicity of the investigated materials.

Oberlin concluded the substance didn’t have “pure sympathetic effects” and he described his work as yielding “partly remarkable results.” The work was halted, however, “particularly due to a strong price increase of safryl-methyl-amin (MDMA).” Oberlin recommended to “keep an eye on the field.”

#### 1952

The next post-Oberlin records regarding the drug were from Dr. Albert van Schoor, a chemist. Schoor conducted simple toxicological experiments that were only documented briefly in his personal lab book.

- “After 30′ 6 flies [die]”
- “Flies lie in supine position, then death.”

He referred to it as “methylsafrylamin” or “IT61.”

#### September 2, 1952

A confidential substance data card from Merck referred to MDMA as “1-(2-methylaminpropyl)-3,4-methylendioxybenzol” and some chemical properties were given.

#### 1950s

The first formal animal study was conducted in 1953/1954. MDMA was tested alongside some other psychoactive drugs.

The US Army’s Chemical Center sponsored the research and it was carried out at the University of Michigan.

Guinea pigs, monkeys, mice, rats, and dogs were given the drug as part of toxicological assays. There was no reference to human experimentation at this time.

MDMA was found to be less toxic than MDA, but more toxic than mescaline. This was work was unpublished until 1973.

It may have been examined with the possibility of moving into development as a chemical incapacitant or interrogation aide.

#### 1959

Dr. Wolfgang Fruhstorfer, a Merck chemist, worked with MDMA and similar substances according to another “confidential” substance data card.

Fruhstorfer was interested in the production of new stimulants. There were some insinuations of him working with an institute for aviation medicine, but no documents clearly stated it was tested in humans.

#### 1960

A regular scientific paper in Polish described the synthesis of MDMA.

#### Late 1960s – 1970

The use of MDMA in the street market may have begun around this time. A detection was reported in Chicago around 1970 and the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs picked up on its presence.

It wasn’t until the late 1970s that scientific publications about its pharmacology began to appear.

#### 1960s – 1970s (The Shulgin Period)

A major individual in the history of MDMA is Alexander Shulgin. Even though he definitely wasn’t the first person to work with it or use it, he did help to popularize the drug.

1961

Shulgin synthesized MDA in May 1961, probably after Alles described its effects in humans in 1959.

He also tried it in May 1961 at a small inactive dose of 4.5 mg and at an inactive dose of 15-35 mg in August 1965 without effect.

1962

He synthesized MMDA in 1962 and published about its psychoactive effects in 1964. His lab books support the existence of trials with MMDA in 1962 and in 1965 as part of an exploration of MDA-like drugs.

Mid-1960s

Shulgin initiated tests on the psychotherapeutic potential of MDA and MMDA with Claudio Naranjo (Chile). The results were favorable, with publications about MDA in 1967 and MMDA in 1973.

1965

According to Shulgin, he first synthesized MDMA in 1965.

In fact I had synthesized it back at Dole in 1965.

He didn’t try it and basically nothing was done with it until the 1970s.

1970

Shulgin sent a letter to a chemist who had formed a chemical company in Los Angeles. The chemist asked for instructions on how to prepare N-methylated MDA (MDMA).

That information was then also given to “clients” of the chemist in the Midwest.

Although it’s only speculation, this could have been the way MDMA ended up on the street in the Midwest in the early 1970s.

~1970s

Before he personally tried the drug, Shulgin encountered multiple people who had used it. Some emphasized its stimulant effects, others emphasized its emotional/entactogen effects.

**“Marty” – Young student**

Claimed to have taken MDMA and that it had an “amphetamine-like content.”

**“Merrie Kleinman” (~ mid 1976) – Female student of “Noel Chestnut,” a professor of chemistry. Shulgin was filling it for Chestnut for a short time at a school in San Francisco.**

Kleinman’s experience with the drug was mentioned in PiHKAL.

One of these was a dear, dear sprite appropriately named Merrie Kleinman, who told me that she had done an experiment with two close friends of hers, and that they had used 100 milligrams of N-methylated MDA (MDMA). She shared very little about her experience, but implied that it was quite emotional, and that there had been a basically good reaction from all three of them.

**“Flip” – Colleague from the University of San Francisco who had synthesized and taken MDMA.**

Tried 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 100, and 150 mg.

Up to 60 mg had “no effect.”

75 mg made him “fuzzy.”

100 mg and 150 mg both made him “active.”

**“C.B.”**

Took either 75 or 175 mg and the result as “fine control.”

1976

Shulgin took the drug himself beginning in 1976.

His dose escalation test began in September.

September 8 – 16 mg with no effect

September 9 – 25 mg with no effect

September 12 – 40 mg with no effect

September 17 – 60 mg with no effect

September 27 – 81 mg

- 00:53 “Smooth shift into light intox”
- 01:16 “distinct–almost early alcohol-like intox”
- 01:38 “am I past the peak coming down already? yes!”
- 03:00 “out”

October 5 – 100 mg

- 00:35 “first awareness–smooth–very nice–I will be attentive to sensory changes (there are none)–looking forward with interest. I can an do quickly accommodate to this ASC.
- 00:45 “Still developing–but I can easily assimilate it as it comes. Under excellent control.
- 00:50 “Getting quite deep but I am keeping a pace
- 01:00 “Well into it–but I am accommodated–piano went well–lots of time to search out correct notes–no mydriasis–no physical tox”
- 01:30 “100 -> 50% starting to clear”
- 01:45 “Trial erot., ejac. Fine–rapid recovery”
- 02:15 “5% I am substantially out”
- 03:00 “All out. I will try 125.”

October 23 – 100 mg

- 00:30 “Start”
- 00:35 “Roll of eyes with a bit of erotic init. 15%–I might have said ‘I feel that drink'”
- 00:45 “At 40% I don’t think I am suppressing it–a real 40%”
- 00:49 “Time slowed?”
- 00:57 “Largely window (80%?)”
- 01:00 “A little dilation”
- 01:03 “Complete window–complete control nonetheless”
- 01:12 “Holding steady”
- 01:25 “Easy erotic–no need (ability?) of erection”
- 01:50 “Dropping?”
- 02:10 “Down to 50% sex with Nina (6 p.m.!) extraordinarily pleasant–she turned on too! (this was my return day from Washington)”
- 02:49 “A few % left”
- 03:00 “Out”

1976 – 1977

He introduced the drug to a retired psychologist named Leo Zeff (pseudonym Adam Fisher) in Oakland, CA. Zeff was impressed by the effects of MDMA to such a degree that he abandoned retirement and introduced the drug to many psychotherapists around the US.

Initially the drug spread among therapists in northern California, but it didn’t take long for it to reach both coasts of the US.

According to a 1990 paper from Shulgin, it was introduced into clinical practice (no names given in the paper) on the West Coast in the latter part of 1976 and it was used on the East Coast a few months later.

Because of their work in this area, Shulgin has been called the “Godfather of Ecstasy” and Zeff has been called the “Johnny Appleseed of MDMA.”

1978

Shulgin, along with David Nichols, published a paper about MDMA’s effect in humans.

They noted, based on a paper from Gaston as well as personal communication with C. Helisten from the PharmChem Foundation in Palo Alto, CA, that MDMA made an occasional appearance on the illicit street market in 1970.

The 1978 paper gave this description of MDMA:

Qualitatively, the drug appears to evoke an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones. It can be compared in its effects to marijuana, to psilocybin devoid of the hallucinatory component, or to low levels of MDA.

This paper stemmed from a presentation Shulgin gave in December 1976 during a conference called “The Psychopharmacology of Hallucinogens” in Bethesda, MD.

Investigations by university and industry-based chemists were triggered by the 1978 publication.

#### Mid to late 1970s

In the 1970s and early 1980s, the drug was widely used in therapeutic and personal growth settings, often under the name “Adam.”

Tests found it was less “harsh” than MDA and had some preferable qualities over both MDA and traditional psychedelics.

It was found the drug could increase acceptance of the self and others, increase tolerance to emotionally difficult material, and help people address issues without significant disorientation or ego loss.

Some people referred to it as a “penicillin for the soul.”

Formal controlled studies weren’t conducted at this time, but it was potentially given to thousands of people, with over 100,000 doses allegedly administered in therapeutic settings. Leo Zeff alone may have introduced 4,000 people to the therapeutic use of MDMA.

MDMA was utilized in the treatment of various psychological disorders, including psychosis, anxiety, PTSD, and depression. It was also taken for couples therapy and group therapy.

Even in these early years, it was recognized to be a particularly good treatment for people with disorders originating from trauma like war and childhood abuse.

Some early uncontrolled data from George Greer found people could receive psychological benefits from MDMA during and after a session.

#### 1981

One of the first promotional mentions of MDMA was in an underground magazine called “Wet.” The name “ecstasy” was used, though it’s not clear where that name originated.

#### 1980s – 2010s (History Of MAPS)

1982

Rick Doblin learned about MDMA’s use as an adjunct to psychotherapy.

Early 1984

Doblin started the Earth Metabolic Design Lab (EMDL) to coordinate a response to the DEA’s attempt to prohibit MDMA. The EMDL aimed to introduce people in psychiatry, religion, and public policy to the drug, with the hope that some would testify against prohibition attempts.

Other individuals involved in the project were Debby Harlow and Alise Agar.

April 1986

When it was clear the government was going to push forward with Schedule 1 status despite the EMDL’s efforts, Doblin formed the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).

MAPS would work through the government’s own approval process to make drugs like MDMA available in certain settings.

Preclinical animal toxicity studies were transferred from the EMDL to MAPS, which were used to open a Drug Master File (DMF).

1980s

To move forward, MAPS would need access to pure MDMA. Doblin knew David Nichols and was able to get a kilogram of the drug from him. He funded that purchase at a cost of \$4,000 (\$4 per gram). The Nichols-sourced supply has been used by MAPS throughout its research.

1986 – 1988

After opening the DMF, five applications to study MDMA in humans were submitted to the FDA. All were rejected.

The FDA’s decision was based on concerns about the hypothetical functional consequences of possible neurotoxicity.

MAPS began funding animal toxicity studies to gain a better understanding of the drug.

1992

The investigational new drug (IND) for MDMA was filed with the FDA.

The FDA reviewed a protocol from Charles Grob for a study that’d use MDMA in the treatment of pain, anxiety, and depression in cancer patients. The FDA’s Drug Abuse Advisory Committee decided the cancer patient study should be postponed and that a Phase 1 dose-response safety study should take place first.

Human research was allowed to begin after the FDA accepted the Drug Abuse Advisory Committee’s recommendation.

1994

Using a redesigned protocol, the first double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 1 study began. It was found MDMA could lead to a transient and generally tolerable rise in heart rate and body temperature in healthy volunteers.

Charles Grob published the results in 1996.

Based on these results, MAPS continued pursuing approval for clinical studies.

1997

Charles Grob submitted a protocol for a study in cancer patients. Negotiations with the FDA moved slowly, but eventually opposition to the research lessened.

July 24, 1999

A teleconference with the FDA regarding MDMA psychotherapy research to treat anxiety, depression, and pain in cancer patients went well.

The FDA indicated a willingness to approve this kind of study, though Grob eventually opted to work on psilocybin rather than MDMA.

March 18, 2000

Doblin met Michael Mithoefer at an ayahuasca conference in San Francisco and they discussed conducting MDMA psychotherapy research in the US.

2000

MAPS launched an international Phase 2 Clinical Development Program to gain FDA approval for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in those with chronic and moderate to severe PTSD.

2000

Research into the use of MDMA for psychotherapy finally began, though it was taking place in Spain rather than the US.

The first MAPS-sponsored clinical study involved female survivors of sexual assault.

The first subject was treated in Madrid on November 9, 2000. By May 13, 2002, the study was halted due to political pressure from the Madrid Anti-Drug Authority. Only partial treatment data was available as a result.

2001

MAPS received approval from the FDA for an MDMA-assisted psychotherapy protocol on November 2, 2001. The study would involve people with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. This research would be led by Michael Mithoefer.

It’d take another couple years for approval to come from the DEA and an IRB.

June 2003

MAPS began working with John Halpern at McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School on a design for a study that’d give MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to end-stage cancer patients.

November 26, 2004

Halpern submitted a protocol for a study in 12 patients who’d have anxiety secondary to advanced stage cancer.

One subject was ultimately treated successfully as part of the research, but the study was closed due to enrollment challenges.

2004

Michael Mithoefer and his wife, Annie Mithoefer, began conducting the first FDA-approved Phase 2 study of MDMA for chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD.

The study was carried out in Charleston, South Carolina. It mainly involved female survivors of sexual assault or childhood sexual abuse.

The results indicated MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was much superior to non-drug therapy.

2006

A second Phase 2 study was conducted in Switzerland by Peter Oehen with 12 patients. Although the results appeared to be clinically significant, they weren’t statistically significant.

Late 2000s – 2010s

Some changes to the research were approved by the FDA and IRB, allowing the number of sessions to increase from 2 to 3. Permission was also given to administer a supplemental (half the initial) dose to prolong the effects.

Permission was given to let placebo subjects enroll in the study again to receive MDMA in an open-label manner.

MAPS had invested \$1.5 million in its research and 25 years of effort by the early 2010s. It was able to show with two studies that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was a useful treatment option for PTSD.

2010

Another study from the Mithoefer team began, this time focusing on veterans. There were 24 participants.

Approval to begin the study was received quickly.

2016

MAPS completed an ITT analysis of primary efficacy and safety data from multiple Phase 2 clinical trials in the US, Switzerland, Israel, and Canada. Based on that data, which involved 105 participants, MDMA was superior to placebo and 75 – 125 mg was superior to low doses.

Michael Mithoefer and Candice Monson began a pilot study of MDMA-assisted Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy in couples. This study involves one member of a couple who has chronic PTSD and a significant other without PTSD. Both individuals are experiencing relationship strain due to the PTSD symptoms.

Current (as of April 2017)

MAPS is targeting the legalization of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy by the early 2020s, specifically 2021.

---

#### Late 1970s – 1980s

MDMA expanded beyond the therapeutic community and it was quite popular in some areas by 1983, such as in Dallas and Austin, Texas. The DEA claimed 30,000 doses were being sold each month just to one local dealer.

In the early days of its recreational use, there seemed to be fewer problems with excessive dosing (heavy redosing or large doses). There also wasn’t an issue with adulterants.

#### 1985

Various popular magazines, including Time, Newsweek, and Life covered MDMA. This brought the drug to the attention of many additional people.

Newsweek said MDMA had “become popular over the last two years on college campuses, where it is considered an aphrodisiac.”

#### 1980s (Scheduling of MDMA)

The DEA filed its intent to prohibit MDMA on July 27, 1984. This opened up a 30 day comment period, giving the Earth Metabolic Design Lab (formed by Rick Doblin and affiliated with others) time to respond.

In early August 1984, Doblin went to the DEA headquarters in Washington DC to file papers requesting a DEA administrative law judge (ALJ) hearing on the matter.

An entry in December 1984 confirmed hearings would take place. They were eventually held in 1985 and presided over by judge Francis Young.

Arguments against its prohibition came from the EMDL and others, with claims that MDMA was distinct from other illicit drugs. The pro-prohibition arguments focused on its abuse potential and alleged safety issues.

Ronald Siegel, a psychopharmacologist on the DEA’s side, noted:

[Street use] escalated from an estimated 10,000 doses distribution in all of 1976 to 30,000 doses distributed per month in 1985.

While these proceedings were taking place, the DEA announced in May 1985 that it would emergency schedule MDMA. It became a Schedule 1 drug under this order on July 1, 1985.

Judge Francis Young decided in 1986 that MDMA should actually be a Schedule 3 drug. This was based on a low apparent abuse potential, possible medical uses, and a higher safety level.

The DEA administrator decided to ignore the recommendation and pursued Schedule 1 status instead. The EMDL responded by suing the DEA. The EMDL won, forcing the DEA to come up with a better argument for Schedule 1 status.

Eventually, the DEA received a favorable Appeals Court decision, enabling MDMA to be classified as a Schedule 1 drug.

#### Mid-1980s

Around the time it was being prohibited, MDMA’s alleged safety issue received a lot of attention.

APA Monitor:

Repeated use of designer drugs such as Ecstasy produces potentially irreversible brain damage.

Dr. Charles Schuster in the Associated Press:

It can poison the nervous system probably irreversibly. It may very well be that a young, healthy adult who is exposed to these drugs is not going to show frank symptoms that are going to be picked up by a clinician. But what we don’t know is whether 20 or 30 years from now , at the age of 45 , they may begin to be showing central nervous system degenerative signs that ordinarily would not be seen until they get to be 70 or 80.

#### 1990s

(Cole, 2002) – Analysis of ecstasy batches in the UK.

1991 to 1996 values: 102 mg, 90 mg, 103 mg, 99 mg, 100 mg, and 88 mg

1997 to 2001 values: 75 mg, 77 mg, 82 mg, 74 mg, and 73 mg

#### 1994

(Millen, 1996) – Comprehensive survey of drug use by British students. It involved 7722 people aged 15 and 16.

There was an MDMA use rate of 8%.

#### 1996

Based on a study of high school seniors in Texas, 9% of seniors had used MDMA at least once.

#### 1998 – 2002

A rise in MDMA use, availability, and problems was seen in the US. US Customs and the DEA reported a rise in seizures:

- 1998 – 750,000 pills
- 1999 – 3.5 million
- 2000 – 9.3 million

Percent of high school seniors claiming it was “fairly” or “very” easy to get the drug:

- 1998 – 38%
- 1999 – 40%
- 2000 – 51%

Monitoring the Future survey data (high school seniors who reported at least one use)

- 1999 – 8.0%
- 2000 – 11%
- 2001 – 11.7%

Survey data in the US in 2000

- Lifetime use 
- 4.3% for eighth graders
- 7.3% for 10th graders
- 11.0% for 12 graders
- 11.6% for young adults
- Past 30-day use 
- 1.4% for eighth graders
- 2.6% for 10th graders
- 3.6% for 12th graders
- 1.9% for young adults

Emergency room visits associated with alleged MDMA use increased, often from adulterated drugs and high water consumption. In the US, they went from 2,850 in 1999 to 5,542 in 2001.

There was alarm among the media and government about MDMA and it was most prominent beginning December 1999. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) launched a campaign to inform people about the dangers of ecstasy. Their \$54 million club drugs initiative dedicated money to research, preventative education, and community alert bulletins.

NIDA called the increase in MDMA use an “epidemic” in 2000.

Hundreds of stories (often alarmist) showed up in the media by the early 2000s. Here are some headline examples:

- “The Dangers of Being Young, Hip, and High” in US News and World Report in 1999
- “Party-Drug Scene: E Trade Spreads Largely Unchecked” in Christian Science Monitor in 2000
- “Too High A Price” in The Reporter 2000
- “The Poisoning of Suburbia” in Salon in 2000

#### February 1999 – March 2000

A paper from EcstasyData reported on the contents of 107 tablets. 63% contained at least some MDMA or an analog (MDA, MDEA).

Of the tablets containing other drugs, 21% had dextromethorphan. Other adulterants included caffeine, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine.

#### 2013

NSDUH reported a lifetime use rate in the US of 6.8% for people over the age of 12. The past 30-day use rate was just 0.3%.

There were an estimated 800,000 first-time “ecstasy” users in the US.

#### 2017

MDMA is sold in powder, crystal, capsule, and tablet form. The tablets in the market have hundreds of different designs. The composition can vary even within designs.

There’s a higher rate of MDMA use among festival and nightclub attendees. (Palamar, 2016) found there was a lifetime use rate in New York of 42.8% for those who attended those events.

Depending on location and the exact time period, the MDMA market may primarily be problematic due to adulterants or because of high-dose MDMA products.

Organizations like DanceSafe, Bunk Police, EcstasyData, and Energy Control are trying to reduce the harms associated with the drug and the MDMA market.

## Legal Status

#### US (as of April 2017)

Schedule 1

#### Controlled

It’s a controlled substance in most countries.

## Safety

MDMA can be acutely dangerous and it may also pose health risks with chronic use. Most of the issues associated with the drug can be avoided or greatly attenuated.

If an otherwise healthy person takes a common dose of MDMA in a calm environment (low activity, moderate temperature), there’s very little risk of an acute safety issue.

To reduce the harms that can exist, organizations like DanceSafe, Bunk Police, EcstasyData, and Energy Control have tried to spread information and spread drug checking. The latter is particularly important given how common adulterants are in the MDMA market.

You should never take the drug without testing it first. Reagent liquids should be used at a minimum.

The core harm reduction measures beyond drug checking include administering electrolytes (mainly sodium), taking anti-neurotoxic supplements, taking breaks, keeping your temperature down, using a reasonable dose, and consuming a moderate amount of water.

Frequent use should be avoided. Try to avoid using MDMA more than every 3 months.

#### LD50

**Mice**

- (Hardman, 1973) 
- IP: 97 mg/kg
- (Davis, 1984) 
- IP: 98 mg/kg
- Though there were some delayed deaths at 20 mg/kg.

**Rats**

- (Hardman, 1973) 
- IP: 49 mg/kg
- Oral: 325 mg/kg

**Guinea pigs**

- (Hardman, 1973) 
- IP: 98 mg/kg

**Dogs**

- (Hardman, 1973) 
- IV: 14 mg/kg
- Death of one dog at 18 mg/kg with oral dosing, but chronic oral treatment with 15 mg/kg in others didn’t yield any deaths.

**Monkeys**

- (Hardman, 1973) using Rhesus macaque 
- IV: 22 mg/kg

**Humans**

Estimated to be 10-20 mg/kg based on the animal data.

#### Neurotoxicity/Neuroadpatations

You can read more about MDMA’s potential neurotoxicity with heavy and chronic use [here](https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/mdmas-neurotoxicity-research-shows-reduce-risk-detailed/) .

#### Acute problems

Acute safety issues and fatalities are possible, though the latter are quite rare. Nearly all of the severe responses involve a combination of the drug (often a strong+ dose) and environmental/behavioral conditions (high water consumption, high activity, high ambient temperature).

Some of the less severe symptoms of an overdose are: agitation, headache, disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, and sweating.

MDMA can lead to more problematic symptoms, including: loss of consciousness, hyperthermia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, brain edema, hyponatremia, and renal failure.

There are brain, cardiovascular, liver, and kidney toxicity concerns.

Fatalities tend to occur in connection with hyperthermia, hyponatremia, and/or cardiovascular issues.

**Hyperthermia**

MDMA can increase body temperature even in controlled settings, but it basically never surpasses low-level hyperthermia (38°C or 100.4°F).

Severe hyperthermia has been seen in many case reports and it can contribute to severe toxicity, including issues like disseminated intravascular coagulation.

In humans, the drug is known to increase metabolic activity and oxygen consumption. It could affect heat dissipation, as seen with a delay in the initiation of sweating. People may feel like they can tolerate higher body temperatures and higher ambient temperatures while on the drug, contributing to heatstroke.

**Hyponatremia**

MDMA itself can lower your serum sodium level. When this effect is combined with high levels of water administration in the absence of electrolytes, hyponatremia (notably low serum sodium) can easily develop.

Hyponatremia is of little concern with common doses in low-activity settings. Some of the key factors in its development are higher doses, vigorous exercise, excessive water use, and low electrolyte replacement.

Hyponatremia can be asymptomatic initially or include symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, aches, and mental status changes. It can progress to lethal cerebral edema, seizures, and coma.

Mechanism

MDMA’s triggering of hyponatremia is believed to come from syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and increased hypotonic fluid intake. Although drinking water is a good idea, you don’t need very high amounts. Around 500 mL per hour is fine. You can also use isotonic drinks (in place of regular water) or sodium supplements (along with regular water).

The roles of SIADH and fluid intake still aren’t entirely clear.

SIADH involves the secretion of vasopressin (ADH) despite normal circulating blood volume, leading to plasma hyponatremia and hypoosmolality along with impaired free water excretion. Vasopressin can lead to the retention of water by the kidneys.

Vasopressin release may come from MDMA and some of its metabolites.

Another possible factor is impaired gastrointestinal tract motility, which could be reduced at the end of someone’s activity. This hypothetical mechanism could lead to high hypotonic fluid intake from a bolus of water in the GI tract, quickly diluting the sodium level.

Females may be at an even greater risk of hyponatremia-related complications. This could be from estrogen’s inhibitory effects on brain Na+/K+-ATPase, which raises the risk of cerebral edema. Estrogen impairs brain cell volume regulation through that inhibition since the pumps remove sodium from astrocytes.

**Renal**

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with MDMA use, sometimes coming from nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis.

The first case of AKI was reported in 1992. The patient took three doses at a rave and then appeared to have rhabdomyolysis and seizures.

There could also be a direct toxic effect on myocytes.

**Hepatic**

(Baggott, 2001) reported hepatotoxicity was present in 16% of 199 hospital cases involving MDMA use, making it the 3rd most common SAE.

In clinical trials, there have been no liver-related issues.

Hepatotoxicity is often found alongside hyperthermia, indicating a possible connection. Some of the toxicity may arise from an immunological response.

In vitro studies have shown impairment of cell viability and an increase in profibrogenic activity in cultured stellate cells. However, the liver’s exposure to MDMA would be much lower in real-world in vivo settings than the dose utilized in the in vitro tests.

**Cardiovascular**

Heart rate and blood pressure increases are common even in controlled settings, but they’re typically moderate and tolerable. Occasionally someone will end up with a hypertensive state with a common dose and calm setting, but it’s not a typical response. If you have a preexisting vulnerability, however, you should avoid the drug.

The cardiovascular effects are more concerning with high activity levels and high doses.

It can raise the chance of acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and cerebral hemorrhage.

#### After effects

A portion of users report negative effects on the following day. Those tend to last no more than 3 days, but occasionally people report negatives persisting for 3-7 days. Depending on various factors, the after effects could be moderately negative, barely noticeable, absent, or even somewhat pleasant.

Higher doses, sleep deprivation, unideal general health, and high activity levels all likely contribute to worse after effect periods.

The common symptoms include: brain fog, irritability, depression, and insomnia.

These symptoms may come from serotonin depletion and a drop in tryptophan hydroxylase activity.

**Studies**

(Liechti, 2000)

- Half of the users had new feelings of fatigue, muscle ache, and headache at 24 hours.
- Up to 1/3 reported being slightly depressed with emotional irritability, lack of energy, brooding, and bad dreams.
- Only a few people had negatives lasting up to 3 days.
- Females appeared to be more susceptible.

(Blagrove, 2010) – Memory tests in people who used MDMA/ecstasy 2-3 days pre-test vs. those with 8+ days of abstinence vs. controls.

- Recent MDMA/ecstasy users (25) 
- Mean recent dose: 2.88 tablets
- Mean lifetime use: 269 tablets
- Less recent MDMA/ecstasy users (17) 
- Mean lifetime use: 422 tablets
- Controls (24)
- Results 
- Recent ecstasy/MDMA users scored significantly worse than controls for recall on the rivermead behavioral memory test (RBMT). 
- However, the significance disappeared when excluding individuals who took other illicit drugs 24-48 hours before the test. 
- Perhaps this is due to cannabis having been the most popular other drug in the time period.
- Recency of taking the drug was significantly associated with mean RBMT score.
- Abstinent ecstasy/MDMA users didn’t show declarative memory deficits.
- Procedural memory performance of recent and abstinent users didn’t differ from controls.

(Pirona, 2010)

- 19 males and 13 females 
- Leading to 16 people who would take ecstasy vs. 16 who wouldn’t.
- All had a long history of ecstasy use.
- No participant used the drug for at least 6 days pre-study.
- Tests of mood and cognitive function 
- Day 1, 24 hours later (either after abstinence or MDMA use), and then 3 days from the start.
- Analysis of samples confirmed accurate reporting of MDMA use or abstinence.
- Results 
- On second test, ecstasy users were significantly more sad, afraid, placid, muddled and dejected than controls 
- The negative mood scores weren’t significant different by the 3 days later test.
- There was no BDI score difference on second test between groups–though the usefulness of BDI in this setting is arguable.
- Ecstasy users reported sleeping significantly less sleep following their use.
- After controlling for sleep quality, ecstasy users didn’t have impairment on working memory, immediate or delayed recall, or decision-making performance.

(Curran, 1997) – Mood and cognitive effects in days following MDMA vs. alcohol use

- 24 participants (12 reporting MDMA use on Day 1, 12 reporting alcohol use on Day 1)
- Testing on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 5.
- Use of MDMA wasn’t confirmed.
- Results 
- MDMA on the weekend was found to be associated with lowering of mood mid-week, with higher scores on the BDI, several mood rating scales, and bodily symptoms scales (depressed, anxious, agitated.) 
- These differences were found across the 5 days.
- MDMA users had elevated mood on Day 1, with progressively lower scores on following days. 
- Whereas alcohol users had lowest point on Day 2 (acute hangover) and rebounding from there.
- On Day 2, both groups were broadly similar in negative ratings, implying the day after effects of MDMA (including lack of sleep) aren’t totally dissimilar from an acute alcohol hangover. 
- Difference being that MDMA’s effect persists longer into the week, presumably from subacute serotonin depletion and other factors.

## Duration
- **Onset:** 20-70 minutes
- **Duration:** 3-5 hours
- **After Effects:** 1-72 hours

## Interactions

### ⚠️ Dangerous
- **amt**
- **dextromethorphan**
- **lithium**: High risk of serotonin syndrome
- **maois**: MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with MDMA will lead to hypertensive crises.
- **tramadol**: Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.

### ⚡ Caution
- **2c-t-x**
- **5-meo-xxt**: Some of the 5-MeO tryptamines are a bit unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care
- **alcohol**: The combination of MDMA and alcohol may increase strain on the cardiovascular system and lead to increased alcohol consumption. MDMA may also impair one's ability to recognize their level of drunkenness, leading to increased alcohol consumption and poor decision-making. Alcohol may also increase the risk of dehydration and hyperthermia (increased body temperature) when combined with MDMA.
- **amphetamines**: This combination of stimulants will increase strain on the heart, may cause some physical discomfort, and has the chance to cause cardiovascular issues. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants can increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops and make the experience more uncomfortable, this combination raises these chances. Amphetamines will increase the neurotoxic effects of MDMA, in addition to causing further concerns of hyperthermia due to the inherent nature of the combination. It will also raise one's body temperature, also likely making the combination more neurotoxic.
- **caffeine**: Caffiene is not really necessary with MDMA and increases any neurotoxic effects from MDMA
- **cocaine**: Cocaine blocks some of the desirable effects of MDMA while increasing the risk of heart attack.
- **dox**: The combined stimulating effects of the two can be uncomfortable. Coming down on the MDMA while the DOx is still active can be quite anxiogenic. 
- **ghb/gbl**: Large amounts of GHB/GBL may overwhelm the effects of MDMA on the comedown.
- **mxe**: There have been reports of risky serotonergic interactions when the two are taken at the same time, but MXE taken to the end of an MDMA experience does not appear to cause the same issues.
- **nbomes**

### ✓ Low Risk & Synergy
- **2c-x**
- **cannabis**: Large amounts of cannabis may cause strong and somewhat unpredictable experiences in combination with MDMA. Cannabis should be saved for towards the end of the experience if possible.
- **dmt**
- **ketamine**: No unexpected interactions, though likely to increase blood pressure but not an issue with sensible doses. Moving around on high doses of  this combination may be ill advised due to risk of physical injury.
- **lsd**
- **mescaline**
- **mushrooms**
- **nitrous**

### ✓ Low Risk & No Synergy
- **opioids**

### Other
- **benzodiazepines** (Low Risk & Decrease)
- **pcp**: This combination can easily lead to hypermanic states (Unsafe)
- **ssris** (Low Risk & Decrease)

**MDMA** (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-Methylamphetamine) is an popular drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine class known for its empathogenic, euphoric, and stimulant effects, and has also been used in psychotherapy. It most frequently comes in tablet form, although it is also found in capsules or as powder. MDMA is also known as Ecstasy, Molly, XTC, E and several other names. 

Because MDMA is so popular and because it goes well with dance parties, the demand for it usually exceeds supply, especially at any given location on any given night. This creates an opening for unscrupulous individuals to sell virtually anything as 'ecstasy'. While 'ecstasy' is the popular name for MDMA, the functional definition of ecstasy is any pill represented as MDMA on the street. Ecstasy pills are notoriously unreliable in content, more so than most other street drugs, and commonly contain either caffeine, ephedrine, amphetamines, other MDXX's, DXM, or in rare cases DOX's, and don't necessarily contain MDMA or any psychoactive. They can also contain very neurotoxic substances (such as PMA, 4-CA, among many others). This problem has led to the development of simple MDMA [Test Kits](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Test_Kits) that may help give the user a general sense of the content of a pill.

The experience is often called rolling.

## History

MDMA was first synthesized in 1912 by Merck chemist Anton Köllisch. 

In the mid-1970s, Alexander Shulgin heard from his students about unusual effects of MDMA; among others, the drug had helped one of them to overcome his stutter. Intrigued, Shulgin synthesized MDMA and tried it himself in 1976. Two years later, he and David E. Nichols published the first report on the drug's psychotropic  effect in humans. They described "altered state of consciousness with  emotional and sensual overtones" that can be compared "to marijuana, and  to psilocybin devoid of the hallucinatory component".

In the early 1980s the drug emerged in the parts of Europe and the United States.

MDMA was first proposed for scheduling by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in July 1984 and was classified as a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S. on 31 May 1985; on an emergency basis.  No double blind studies had yet been conducted as to the efficacy of  MDMA for psychotherapy.

#### Hangover

Many users [report feeling extremely drained the day after MDMA use](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_effects_hangover1.shtml). This 'day after' effect means for many MDMA users that they need to plan 2 days for the experience: one for the peak experience and one recovery day, with very little planned. Many users also experience some level of post-MDMA depression, often starting on the second day after the experience and lasting for up to 5 days. A small percentage of users report depressive symptoms for weeks afterwards. Alternately, some users report feeling better than normal for a week or so after taking MDMA. The negative after-effects of taking MDMA appear to be worse with higher frequencies of use, higher dosages, and perhaps total lifetime usage.

- MDMA rapidly builds tolerance, depletes serotonin and compounds neurotoxicity issues. Look for other drugs and avoid using MDMA more than once every few months.

- Ecstasy tablets are notoriously impure, often containing chemicals other than MDMA. Check out [EcstasyData](http://www.ecstasydata.org/) and [Pill Reports](http://pillreports.com/) for pill testing results. Buy a [Test Kit](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Test_Kit)!

## Health risks

As with many drugs, there are some serious risks associated with taking MDMA affecting people with existing health conditions, or in certain cases people who are otherwise very healthy. It is not advisable to take MDMA if any of the following apply to you:

- Health issues with the Heart, Kidneys or Liver
- High blood pressure
- History of having a stroke or heart attack

In rare cases MDMA can cause seizures, overheating, hypothermia, dehydration or water poisoning. It is important to keep an eye on body temperature and hydration while under the effects of MDMA.

There are some studies which suggest that long-term overuse and abuse of MDMA can cause or increase depression.

### Interactions

- MDMA can cause [Serotonin Syndrome](/index.php?title=Serotonin_Syndrome&action=edit&redlink=1) when combined with MAOIs. Refer to [Drug combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations) for more information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

### Neurotoxicity, by Borax

- The neurotoxicity is [well established](https://pay.reddit.com/r/drugs/wiki/mdmaneurotoxicity), but studies are largely on mice and rats with [higher dosages than humans tend to use](http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/614514).

- There is an excellent run through of the pharmacodynamics of MDMA neurotoxicity [here](http://www.dancesafe.org/drug-information/is-mdma-neurotoxic/).

- Overall what we know is that the neurotoxicity scales with dose, and is likely to do so exponentially as the body is caused to overheat more and has less anitoxidants to deal with metabolites.

- We don't have any quantitative estimates about damage from normal human doses because it would not be ethical to dose people repeatedly just to see how much it damages them, and it's very hard to gather data from regular users because of the huge number of variables like alcohol and cannabis use, sleep deprivation, environment of MDMA use etc.

- We know that long term users are not [mentally impaired](http://jop.sagepub.com/content/24/2/175) but those *abusing* the drug do show a reduced ability to enjoy it and suffer a more intense comedown, indicating that there is something going on at higher doses.

- Another discussion about MDMA neurotoxicity can be found [here](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/12v5f8/research_suggests_no_neurotoxicity_in_mdma/c6ye9xc).

### MDMA purity myths, by Borax

The 84% claims are based around either a poor understanding of the science or are a deliberate attempt to pass off inferior product as high quality.

You should read [this discussion](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/xihdo/rdrugs_ama_series_mdma_aka_ecstasy_e_x_molly/c5moa3i), but basically if anyone claims their MDMA is 84% pure then they have performed no analysis at all and should not be trusted.    

With almost all, the name is an abbreviation for Drug.salt. In the case of MDMA, it is MDMA.HCl, amphetamine is usually amphetamine.H2SO4 and LSD is LSD.tartrate.  Because these forms are ubiquitous, nobody bothers to mention the second bit because it's irrelevant. All doses you see for MDMA are referring to the HCl salt, which means that MDMA which is sold as "the purest you can get, 84%", is treated as 100% pure.

The reason sellers do this is because they usually don't have very pure MDMA, and they want people to make the mistake you have made and take more to account for crappy product. It is dishonest, confusing and misleading and if you have a choice you should avoid this vendor.

### Production

MDMA is generally synthesised from naturally occurring safrole, extracted from the sassafras tree, making it a semi-synthetic drug.

## Legal Status

MDMA is legally controlled in most of the world under the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances and other international agreements, although exceptions exist for research and limited medical use. In general, the unlicensed use, sale or manufacture of MDMA are all criminal offences.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA*

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy (tablet form), and molly (crystal form), is an entactogen with stimulant and minor psychedelic properties. 
MDMA was first synthesized in 1912 by Merck chemist Anton Köllisch. It was used to enhance psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s and became popular as a street drug in the 1980s. MDMA is commonly associated with dance parties, raves, and electronic dance music. Tablets sold as ecstasy may be mixed with other substances such as ephedrine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. In 2016, about 21 million people between the ages of 15 and 64 used ecstasy (0.3% of the world population). In the United States, as of 2017, about 7% of people have used MDMA at some point in their lives and 0.9% have used it in the last year. The lethal risk from one dose of MDMA is estimated to be from 1 death in 20,000 instances to 1 death in 50,000 instances.
The purported pharmacological effects that may be prosocial include altered sensations, increased energy, empathy, and pleasure. When taken by mouth, effects begin in 30 to 45 minutes and last three to six hours. Short-term adverse effects include grinding of the teeth, blurred vision, sweating, and a rapid heartbeat, and extended use can also lead to addiction, memory problems, paranoia, and difficulty sleeping. Deaths have been reported due to increased body temperature and dehydration. MDMA acts primarily by increasing the release of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in parts of the brain. It belongs to the substituted amphetamine classes of drugs. MDMA is structurally similar to mescaline (a psychedelic), methamphetamine (a stimulant), as well as endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
MDMA has limited approved medical uses in a small number of countries, but is illegal in most jurisdictions. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is a promising and generally safe treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder when administered in controlled therapeutic settings. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given MDMA breakthrough therapy status (though there no current clinical indications in the US). Canada has allowed limited distribution of MDMA upon application to and approval by Health Canada. In Australia, it may be prescribed in the treatment of PTSD by specifically authorised psychiatrists.

## Uses

### Recreational

MDMA is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs, festivals, and house parties. In the rave environment, the sensory effects of music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple appealing aspects to users in the rave setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects. MDMA is used less often than other stimulants, typically less than once per week.
MDMA is sometimes taken in conjunction with other psychoactive drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, 2C-B, and ketamine. The combination with LSD is called "candy-flipping". The combination with 2C-B is called "nexus flipping". For this combination, most people take the MDMA first, wait until the peak is over, and then take the 2C-B.
MDMA is often co-administered with alcohol, methamphetamine, and prescription drugs such as SSRIs with which MDMA has several drug-drug interactions. Three life-threatening reports of MDMA co-administration with ritonavir have been reported; with ritonavir having severe and dangerous drug-drug interactions with a wide range of both psychoactive, anti-psychotic, and non-psychoactive drugs.

### Medical

As of 2023, MDMA therapies have only been approved for research purposes, with no widely accepted medical indications, although this varies by jurisdiction. Before it was widely banned, it saw limited use in psychotherapy. In 2017 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy designation for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Some researchers have proposed that psychedelics in general may act as active "super placebos" used for therapeutic purposes.

### Others

Small doses of MDMA are used by some religious practitioners as an entheogen to enhance prayer or meditation. MDMA has been used as an adjunct to New Age spiritual practices.

### Forms

MDMA has become widely known as ecstasy (shortened "E", "X", or "XTC"), usually referring to its tablet form, although this term may also include the presence of possible adulterants or diluents. The UK term "mandy" and the US term "molly" colloquially refer to MDMA in a crystalline powder form that is thought to be free of adulterants. MDMA is also sold in the form of the hydrochloride salt, either as loose crystals or in gelcaps. MDMA tablets can sometimes be found in a shaped form that may depict characters from popular culture. These are sometimes collectively referred to as "fun tablets".
Partly due to the global supply shortage of sassafras oil—a problem largely assuaged by use of improved or alternative modern methods of synthesis—the purity of substances sold as molly have been found to vary widely. Some of these substances contain methylone, ethylone, MDPV, mephedrone, or any other of the group of compounds commonly known as bath salts, in addition to, or in place of, MDMA. Powdered MDMA ranges from pure MDMA to crushed tablets with 30–40% purity. MDMA tablets typically have low purity due to bulking agents that are added to dilute the drug and increase profits (notably lactose) and binding agents. Tablets sold as ecstasy sometimes contain 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), other amphetamine derivatives, caffeine, opiates, or painkillers. Some tablets contain little or no MDMA. The proportion of seized ecstasy tablets with MDMA-like impurities has varied annually and by country. The average content of MDMA in a preparation is 70 to 120 mg with the purity having increased since the 1990s.
MDMA is usually consumed by mouth. It is also sometimes snorted.

## Effects

In general, MDMA users report feeling the onset of subjective effects within 30 to 60 minutes of oral consumption and reaching peak effect at 75 to 120 minutes, which then plateaus for about 3.5 hours. The desired short-term psychoactive effects of MDMA have been reported to include:

Euphoria – a sense of general well-being and happiness
Increased self-confidence, sociability, and perception of facilitated communication
Entactogenic effects—increased empathy or feelings of closeness with others and oneself
Dilated pupils
Relaxation and reduced anxiety
Increased emotionality
A sense of inner peace
Mild hallucination
Enhanced sensation, perception, or sexuality
Altered sense of time
The experience elicited by MDMA depends on the dose, setting, and user. The variability of the induced altered state is lower compared to other psychedelics. For example, MDMA used at parties is associated with high motor activity, reduced sense of identity, and poor awareness of surroundings. Use of MDMA individually or in small groups in a quiet environment and when concentrating, is associated with increased lucidity, concentration, sensitivity to aesthetic aspects of the environment, enhanced awareness of emotions, and improved capability of communication. In psychotherapeutic settings, MDMA effects have been characterized by infantile ideas, mood lability, and memories and moods connected with childhood experiences.
MDMA has been described as an "empathogenic" drug because of its empathy-producing effects. Results of several studies show the effects of increased empathy with others. When testing MDMA for medium and high doses, it showed increased hedonic and arousal continuum. The effect of MDMA increasing sociability is consistent, while its effects on empathy have been more mixed.

## Side effects

### Short-term

Acute adverse effects are usually the result of high or multiple doses, although single dose toxicity can occur in susceptible individuals. The most serious short-term physical health risks of MDMA are hyperthermia and dehydration. Cases of life-threatening or fatal hyponatremia (excessively low sodium concentration in the blood) have developed in MDMA users attempting to prevent dehydration by consuming excessive amounts of water without replenishing electrolytes.
The immediate adverse effects of MDMA use can include:

Other adverse effects that may occur or persist for up to a week following cessation of moderate MDMA use include:

Physiological

Psychological

### Long-term

As of 2015, the long-term effects of MDMA on human brain structure and function have not been fully determined. However, there is consistent evidence of structural and functional deficits in MDMA users with high lifetime exposure. These structural or functional changes appear to be dose dependent and may be less prominent in MDMA users with only a moderate (typically <50 doses used and <100 tablets consumed) lifetime exposure. Nonetheless, moderate MDMA use may still be neurotoxic and what constitutes moderate use is not clearly established.
Furthermore, it is not clear yet whether "typical" recreational users of MDMA (1 to 2 pills of 75 to 125 mg MDMA or analogue every 1 to 4 weeks) will develop neurotoxic brain lesions. Long-term exposure to MDMA in humans has been shown to produce marked neurodegeneration in striatal, hippocampal, prefrontal, and occipital serotonergic axon terminals. Neurotoxic damage to serotonergic axon terminals has been shown to persist for more than two years. Elevations in brain temperature from MDMA use are positively correlated with MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. However, most studies on MDMA and serotonergic neurotoxicity in humans focus more on heavy users who consume as much as seven times or more the amount that most users report taking. The evidence for the presence of serotonergic neurotoxicity in casual users who take lower doses less frequently is not conclusive.
However, adverse neuroplastic changes to brain microvasculature and white matter have been observed to occur in humans using low doses of MDMA. Reduced gray matter density in certain brain structures has also been noted in human MDMA users. Global reductions in gray matter volume, thinning of the parietal and orbitofrontal cortices, and decreased hippocampal activity have been observed in long term users. The effects established so far for recreational use of ecstasy lie in the range of moderate to severe effects for serotonin transporter reduction.
Impairments in multiple aspects of cognition, including attention, learning, memory, visual processing, and sleep, have been found in regular MDMA users. The magnitude of these impairments is correlated with lifetime MDMA usage and are partially reversible with abstinence. Several forms of memory are impaired by chronic ecstasy use; however, the effects for memory impairments in ecstasy users are generally small overall. MDMA use is also associated with increased impulsivity and depression.
Serotonin depletion following MDMA use can cause depression in subsequent days. In some cases, depressive symptoms persist for longer periods. Some studies indicate repeated recreational use of ecstasy is associated with depression and anxiety, even after quitting the drug. Depression is one of the main reasons for cessation of use.
At high doses, MDMA induces a neuroimmune response that, through several mechanisms, increases the permeability of the blood–brain barrier, thereby making the brain more susceptible to environmental toxins and pathogens. In addition, MDMA has immunosuppressive effects in the peripheral nervous system and pro-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system.
MDMA may increase the risk of cardiac valvulopathy in heavy or long-term users due to activation of serotonin 5-HT2B receptors. MDMA induces cardiac epigenetic changes in DNA methylation, particularly hypermethylation changes.

### Reinforcement disorders

Approximately 60% of MDMA users experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking MDMA. Some of these symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, depression, and trouble concentrating. Tolerance to some of the desired and adverse effects of MDMA is expected to occur with consistent MDMA use. A 2007 delphic analysis of a panel of experts in pharmacology, psychiatry, law, policing and others estimated MDMA to have a psychological dependence and physical dependence potential roughly three-fourths to four-fifths that of cannabis.
MDMA has been shown to induce ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens. Because MDMA releases dopamine in the striatum, the mechanisms by which it induces ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens are analogous to other dopaminergic psychostimulants. Therefore, chronic use of MDMA at high doses can result in altered brain structure and drug addiction that occur as a consequence of ΔFosB overexpression in the nucleus accumbens. MDMA is less addictive than other stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. Compared with amphetamine, MDMA and its metabolite MDA are less reinforcing.
One study found approximately 15% of chronic MDMA users met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for substance dependence. However, there is little evidence for a specific diagnosable MDMA dependence syndrome because MDMA is typically used relatively infrequently.
There are currently no medications to treat MDMA addiction.

### During pregnancy

MDMA is a moderately teratogenic drug (i.e., it is toxic to the fetus). In utero exposure to MDMA is associated with a neuro- and cardiotoxicity and impaired motor functioning. Motor delays may be temporary during infancy or long-term. The severity of these developmental delays increases with heavier MDMA use. MDMA has been shown to promote the survival of fetal dopaminergic neurons in culture.

## Overdose

MDMA overdose symptoms vary widely due to the involvement of multiple organ systems. Some of the more overt overdose symptoms are listed in the table below. The number of instances of fatal MDMA intoxication is low relative to its usage rates. In most fatalities, MDMA was not the only drug involved. Acute toxicity is mainly caused by serotonin syndrome and sympathomimetic effects. MDMA's toxicity in overdose may be exacerbated by caffeine, with which it is frequently cut in order to increase volume. The estimated fatal dose of MDMA in humans is around 15 or 16 times a typical recreational dose. Sympathomimetic side effects can be managed with carvedilol. A scheme for management of acute MDMA toxicity has been published focusing on treatment of hyperthermia, hyponatraemia, serotonin syndrome, and multiple organ failure.

## Interactions

A number of drug interactions can occur between MDMA and other drugs, including serotonergic drugs. MDMA also interacts with drugs which inhibit CYP450 enzymes, like ritonavir (Norvir), particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors. Life-threatening reactions and death have occurred in people who took MDMA while on ritonavir. Bupropion, a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, has been found to increase MDMA exposure with administration of MDMA. Concurrent use of MDMA with certain other serotonergic drugs can result in a life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome. Severe overdose resulting in death has also been reported in people who took MDMA in combination with certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or moclobemide (Aurorix, Manerix). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), duloxetine (Cymbalta), fluoxetine (Prozac), and paroxetine (Paxil) have been shown to block most of the subjective effects of MDMA. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) such as reboxetine (Edronax) have been found to reduce emotional excitation and feelings of stimulation with MDMA but do not appear to influence its entactogenic or mood-elevating effects.
MDMA induces the release of monoamine neurotransmitters and thereby acts as an indirectly acting sympathomimetic and produces a variety of cardiostimulant effects. It dose-dependently increases heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output. SRIs like citalopram and paroxetine, as well as the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin, have been found to partially block the increases in heart rate and blood pressure with MDMA. It is notable in this regard that serotonergic psychedelics such as psilocybin, which act as serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists, likewise have sympathomimetic effects. The NRI reboxetine and the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) duloxetine block MDMA-induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Conversely, bupropion, a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) with only weak dopaminergic activity, reduced MDMA-induced heart rate and circulating norepinephrine increases but did not affect MDMA-induced blood pressure increases. On the other hand, the robust NDRI methylphenidate, which has sympathomimetic effects of its own, has been found to augment the cardiovascular effects and increases in circulating norepinephrine and epinephrine levels induced by MDMA.
The non-selective beta blocker pindolol blocked MDMA-induced increases in heart rate but not blood pressure. The α2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine did not affect the cardiovascular effects of MDMA, though it reduced blood pressure. The α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists doxazosin and prazosin blocked or reduced MDMA-induced blood pressure increases but augmented MDMA-induced heart rate and cardiac output increases. The dual α1- and β-adrenergic receptor blocker carvedilol reduced MDMA-induced heart rate and blood pressure increases. In contrast to the cases of serotonergic and noradrenergic agents, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol did not affect the cardiovascular responses to MDMA. Due to the theoretical risk of "unopposed α-stimulation" and possible consequences like coronary vasospasm, it has been suggested that dual α1- and β-adrenergic receptor antagonists like carvedilol and labetalol, rather than selective beta blockers, should be used in the management of stimulant-induced sympathomimetic toxicity, for instance in the context of overdose.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MDMA is an entactogen or empathogen, as well as a stimulant, euphoriant, and weak psychedelic. It is a substrate of the monoamine transporters (MATs) and acts as a monoamine releasing agent (MRA). The drug is specifically a well-balanced serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA). To a lesser extent, MDMA also acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). MDMA enters monoaminergic neurons via the MATs and then, via poorly understood mechanisms, reverses the direction of these transporters to produce efflux of the monoamine neurotransmitters rather than the usual reuptake. Induction of monoamine efflux by amphetamines in general may involve intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ elevation and PKC and CaMKIIα activation. MDMA also acts on the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) on synaptic vesicles to increase the cytosolic concentrations of the monoamine neurotransmitters available for efflux. By inducing release and reuptake inhibition of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, MDMA increases levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain and periphery.
In addition to its actions as an SNDRA, MDMA directly interacts with a number of monoamine and other receptors. With varying potencies ranging from high to low, it is a partial agonist of several of the serotonin 5-HT1 receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT1D receptors, and is a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. The drug also interacts with α2-adrenergic receptors, with the sigma σ1 and σ2 receptors, with the imidazoline I1 receptor, and with other targets. Along with the preceding receptor interactions, MDMA is a potent partial agonist of the rodent trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). Conversely however, due to species differences, it is far weaker in terms of potency as an agonist of the human TAAR1. The drug appears to act as a weak partial agonist of the human TAAR1 rather than as an efficacious agonist. In relation to the preceding findings, MDMA has been said to be essentially inactive as a human TAAR1 agonist. TAAR1 activation is thought to auto-inhibit and constrain the effects of amphetamines that possess TAAR1 agonism, for instance MDMA in rodents.
Elevation of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels by MDMA is believed to mediate most of the drug's effects, including its entactogenic, stimulant, euphoriant, hyperthermic, and sympathomimetic effects. The entactogenic effects of MDMA, including increased sociability, empathy, feelings of closeness, and reduced aggression, are thought to be mainly due to induction of serotonin release. The exact serotonin receptors responsible for MDMA's entactogenic effects are unclear, but may include the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, 5-HT1B receptor, and 5-HT2A receptor, as well as 5-HT1A receptor-mediated oxytocin release and consequent activation of the oxytocin receptor. Induction of dopamine release is thought to be importantly involved in the stimulant and euphoriant effects of MDMA, while induction of norepinephrine release and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor stimulation are believed to mediate its sympathomimetic effects. Activation of serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors is also thought to be involved in the stimulant and euphoriant effects of MDMA, while serotonin 5-HT2C receptor activation is thought to constrain these effects and limit MDMA's reinforcing potential. Serotonin 5-HT2B receptor signaling appears to be required for MDMA-induced serotonin release and effects. MDMA has been associated with a unique subjective "magic" or euphoria that few or no other known entactogens are said to fully reproduce. The mechanisms underlying this property of MDMA are unknown, but it has been theorized to be due to a specific mixture and balance of pharmacological activities, including combined serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine release and direct serotonin receptor agonism.
MDMA is often said to have mild or weak psychedelic effects. These effects are said to be dose-dependent, such that greater hallucinogenic effects are produced at higher doses. The mild hallucinogenic effects of MDMA include perceptual changes like intensification of visual, auditory, and tactile perception (e.g., brightened colors), a state of dissociation with feelings of depersonalization and derealization (e.g., "oceanic boundlessness"), and thinking disturbances. Conversely, overt hallucinations do not occur, MDMA's hallucinogenic effects are described as "non-problematic" for users, and are said to be much less than those of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) or especially those of fully effective serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin. The hallucinogenic effects of MDMA have been theorized to be mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation analogously to the case of classical psychedelics. Accordingly, the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin has been reported to reduce MDMA-induced perceptual changes in humans. Conversely however, it failed to affect MDMA-induced feelings of dissociation and oceanic boundlessness. In contrast, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram, which blocks MDMA-induced serotonin release, diminished all of the psychoactive and hallucinogenic effects of MDMA. It has been noted that N-methylation of psychedelic phenethylamines, as in the structural difference between MDA and MDMA, has invariably greatly reduced or abolished their psychedelic activity. Whereas MDA and psychedelics like psilocybin induce the head-twitch response in rodents, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, findings on MDMA and the head-twitch response are mixed and conflicting. In addition, whereas MDA fully substitutes for psychedelics like LSD and DOM in rodent drug discrimination tests, MDMA does not do so, nor do psychedelics generally fully substitute for MDMA.
Long-term repeated activation of serotonin 5-HT2B receptors by MDMA is thought to result in increased risk of organ complications such as valvular heart disease (VHD) and primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). MDMA has been associated with serotonergic neurotoxicity. This may be due to formation of toxic MDMA metabolites and/or induction of simultaneous serotonin and dopamine release, with consequent uptake of dopamine into serotonergic neurons and breakdown into toxic species. Serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonists or serotonergic psychedelics may potentiate the neurotoxicity of MDMA.
MDMA is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (S)-MDMA and (R)-MDMA. (S)-MDMA is much more potent as an SNDRA in vitro and in producing MDMA-like subjective effects in humans than (R)-MDMA. By contrast, (R)-MDMA acts as a lower-potency serotonin–norepinephrine releasing agent (SNRA) with weak or negligible effects on dopamine. Relatedly, (R)-MDMA shows weak or negligible stimulant-like and rewarding effects in animals. Both (S)-MDMA and (R)-MDMA produce entactogen-type effects in animals and humans. In addition, both (S)-MDMA and (R)-MDMA are weak agonists of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. (R)-MDMA is more potent and efficacious as a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor agonist than (S)-MDMA, whereas (S)-MDMA is somewhat more potent as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Due to it being a more potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist than (S)-MDMA, (R)-MDMA has been hypothesized to have greater psychedelic effects than (S)-MDMA or racemic MDMA. However, this proved not to be the case in a direct clinical comparison of (R)-MDMA, (S)-MDMA, and racemic MDMA, with equivalent hallucinogen-like effects instead found between the three interventions.
MDMA produces MDA as a minor active metabolite. Peak levels of MDA are about 5 to 10% of those of MDMA and total exposure to MDA is almost 10% of that of MDMA with oral MDMA administration. As a result, MDA may contribute to some extent to the effects of MDMA. MDA is an entactogen, stimulant, and weak psychedelic similarly to MDMA. Like MDMA, it acts as a potent and well-balanced SNDRA and as a weak serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist. However, MDA shows much more potent and efficacious serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor agonism than MDMA. Accordingly, MDA produces greater psychedelic effects than MDMA in humans and might particularly contribute to the mild psychedelic-like effects of MDMA. On the other hand, MDA may also be importantly involved in toxicity of MDMA, such as cardiac valvulopathy.
The duration of action of MDMA (3–6 hours) is much shorter than its elimination half-life (8–9 hours) would imply. In relation to this, MDMA's duration and the offset of its effects appear to be determined more by rapid acute tolerance rather than by circulating drug concentrations. Similar findings have been made for amphetamine and methamphetamine. One mechanism by which tolerance to MDMA may occur is internalization of the serotonin transporter (SERT). Although MDMA and serotonin are not significant TAAR1 agonists in humans, TAAR1 activation by MDMA may result in SERT internalization, for instance in rodents in whom MDMA is a potent TAAR1 agonist. It is thought that brain serotonin levels are depleted after MDMA administration but that levels typically return to normal within 24 to 48 hours.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

The MDMA concentration in the bloodstream starts to rise after about 30 minutes, and reaches its maximal concentration between 1.5 and 3 hours after oral administration. It is then slowly metabolized and excreted, with levels of MDMA and its metabolites decreasing to half their peak concentration over the next several hours. The duration of action of MDMA is about 3 to 6 hours.

#### Distribution

The plasma protein binding of MDMA is unknown.

#### Metabolism

Metabolites of MDMA that have been identified in humans include 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA), 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine (DHA) (also called alpha-methyldopamine (α-Me-DA)), 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone (MDP2P), and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-hydroxyamphetamine (MDOH). The contributions of these metabolites to the psychoactive and toxic effects of MDMA are an area of active research. 80% of MDMA is metabolised in the liver, and about 20% is excreted unchanged in the urine.
MDMA is known to be metabolized by two main metabolic pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The metabolism may be primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and COMT. Complex, nonlinear pharmacokinetics arise via autoinhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2D8, resulting in zeroth order kinetics at higher doses. It is thought that this can result in sustained and higher concentrations of MDMA if the user takes consecutive doses of the drug.

#### Elimination

MDMA and metabolites are primarily excreted as conjugates, such as sulfates and glucuronides. MDMA is a chiral compound and has been almost exclusively administered as a racemate. However, the two enantiomers have been shown to exhibit different kinetics. The disposition of MDMA may also be stereoselective, with the S-enantiomer having a shorter elimination half-life and greater excretion than the R-enantiomer. Evidence suggests that the area under the blood plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was two to four times higher for the (R)-enantiomer than the (S)-enantiomer after a 40 mg oral dose in human volunteers. Likewise, the plasma half-life of (R)-MDMA was significantly longer than that of the (S)-enantiomer (5.8 ± 2.2 hours vs 3.6 ± 0.9 hours). However, because MDMA excretion and metabolism have nonlinear kinetics, the half-lives would be higher at more typical doses (100 mg is sometimes considered a typical dose).

## Chemistry

MDMA is in the substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine and substituted amphetamine classes of chemicals. As a free base, MDMA is a colorless oil insoluble in water. The most common salt of MDMA is the hydrochloride salt; pure MDMA hydrochloride is water-soluble and appears as a white or off-white powder or crystal.

### Synthesis

There are numerous methods available to synthesize MDMA via different intermediates. The original MDMA synthesis described in Merck's patent involves brominating safrole to 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-bromopropane and then reacting this adduct with methylamine. Most illicit MDMA is synthesized using MDP2P (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone) as a precursor. MDP2P in turn is generally synthesized from piperonal, safrole or isosafrole. One method is to isomerize safrole to isosafrole in the presence of a strong base, and then oxidize isosafrole to MDP2P. Another method uses the Wacker process to oxidize safrole directly to the MDP2P intermediate with a palladium catalyst. Once the MDP2P intermediate has been prepared, a reductive amination leads to racemic MDMA (an equal parts mixture of (R)-MDMA and (S)-MDMA). Relatively small quantities of essential oil are required to make large amounts of MDMA. The essential oil of Ocotea cymbarum, for example, typically contains between 80 and 94% safrole. This allows 500 mL of the oil to produce between 150 and 340 grams of MDMA.

### Detection in body fluids

MDMA and MDA may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Some drug abuse screening programs rely on hair, saliva, or sweat as specimens. Most commercial amphetamine immunoassay screening tests cross-react significantly with MDMA or its major metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. The concentrations of MDA in the blood or urine of a person who has taken only MDMA are, in general, less than 10% those of the parent drug.

## History

### Early research and use

MDMA was first synthesized and patented in 1912 by Merck chemist Anton Köllisch. At the time, Merck was interested in developing substances that stopped abnormal bleeding. Merck wanted to avoid an existing patent held by Bayer for one such compound: hydrastinine. Köllisch developed a preparation of a hydrastinine analogue, methylhydrastinine, at the request of fellow lab members, Walther Beckh and Otto Wolfes. MDMA (called methylsafrylamin, safrylmethylamin or N-Methyl-a-Methylhomopiperonylamin in Merck laboratory reports) was an intermediate compound in the synthesis of methylhydrastinine. Merck was not interested in MDMA itself at the time. On 24 December 1912, Merck filed two patent applications that described the synthesis and some chemical properties of MDMA and its subsequent conversion to methylhydrastinine. Merck records indicate its researchers returned to the compound sporadically. A 1920 Merck patent describes a chemical modification to MDMA.
MDMA's analogue 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) was first synthesized in 1910 as a derivative of adrenaline. Gordon A. Alles, the discoverer of the psychoactive effects of amphetamine, also discovered the psychoactive effects of MDA in 1930 in a self-experiment in which he administered a high dose (126 mg) to himself. However, he did not subsequently describe these effects until 1959. MDA was later tested as an appetite suppressant by Smith, Kline & French and for other uses by other groups in the 1950s. In relation to the preceding, the psychoactive effects of MDA were discovered well before those of MDMA.
In 1927, Max Oberlin studied the pharmacology of MDMA while searching for substances with effects similar to adrenaline or ephedrine, the latter being structurally similar to MDMA. Compared to ephedrine, Oberlin observed that it had similar effects on vascular smooth muscle tissue, stronger effects at the uterus, and no "local effect at the eye". MDMA was also found to have effects on blood sugar levels comparable to high doses of ephedrine. Oberlin concluded that the effects of MDMA were not limited to the sympathetic nervous system. Research was stopped "particularly due to a strong price increase of safrylmethylamine", which was still used as an intermediate in methylhydrastinine synthesis. Albert van Schoor performed simple toxicological tests with the drug in 1952, most likely while researching new stimulants or circulatory medications. After pharmacological studies, research on MDMA was not continued. In 1959, Wolfgang Fruhstorfer synthesized MDMA for pharmacological testing while researching stimulants. It is unclear if Fruhstorfer investigated the effects of MDMA in humans.
Outside of Merck, other researchers began to investigate MDMA. In 1953 and 1954, the United States Army commissioned a study of toxicity and behavioral effects in animals injected with mescaline and several analogues, including MDMA. Conducted at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, these investigations were declassified in October 1969 and published in 1973. A 1960 Polish paper by Biniecki and Krajewski describing the synthesis of MDMA as an intermediate was the first published scientific paper on the substance.
MDA appeared as a recreational drug in the mid-1960s. MDMA may have been in non-medical use in the western United States in 1968. An August 1970 report at a meeting of crime laboratory chemists indicates MDMA was being used recreationally in the Chicago area by 1970. MDMA likely emerged as a substitute for MDA, a drug at the time popular among users of psychedelics which was made a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the United States in 1970.

### Shulgin's research

American chemist and psychopharmacologist Alexander Shulgin reported he synthesized MDMA in 1965 while researching methylenedioxy compounds at Dow Chemical Company, but did not test the psychoactivity of the compound at this time. Around 1970, Shulgin sent instructions for N-methylated MDA (MDMA) synthesis to the founder of a Los Angeles chemical company who had requested them. This individual later provided these instructions to a client in the Midwest. Shulgin may have suspected he played a role in the emergence of MDMA in Chicago.
Shulgin first heard of the psychoactive effects of N-methylated MDA around 1975 from a young student who reported "amphetamine-like content". Around 30 May 1976, Shulgin again heard about the effects of N-methylated MDA, this time from a graduate student in a medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University who directed him to the University of Michigan study. She and two close friends had consumed 100 mg of MDMA and reported positive emotional experiences. Following the self-trials of a colleague at the University of San Francisco, Shulgin synthesized MDMA and tried it himself in September and October 1976. Shulgin first reported on MDMA in a presentation at a conference in Bethesda, Maryland in December 1976. In 1978, he and David E. Nichols published a report on the drug's psychoactive effect in humans. They described MDMA as inducing "an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones" comparable "to marijuana, to psilocybin devoid of the hallucinatory component, or to low levels of MDA".
While not finding his own experiences with MDMA particularly powerful, Shulgin was impressed with the drug's disinhibiting effects and thought it could be useful in therapy. Believing MDMA allowed users to strip away habits and perceive the world clearly, Shulgin called the drug window. Shulgin occasionally used MDMA for relaxation, referring to it as "my low-calorie martini", and gave the drug to friends, researchers, and others who he thought could benefit from it. One such person was Leo Zeff, a psychotherapist who had been known to use psychedelic substances in his practice. When he tried the drug in 1977, Zeff was impressed with the effects of MDMA and came out of his semi-retirement to promote its use in therapy. Over the following years, Zeff traveled around the United States and occasionally to Europe, eventually training an estimated four thousand psychotherapists in the therapeutic use of MDMA. Zeff named the drug Adam, believing it put users in a state of primordial innocence.
Psychotherapists who used MDMA believed the drug eliminated the typical fear response and increased communication. Sessions were usually held in the home of the patient or the therapist. The role of the therapist was minimized in favor of patient self-discovery accompanied by MDMA induced feelings of empathy. Depression, substance use disorders, relationship problems, premenstrual syndrome, and autism were among several psychiatric disorders MDMA assisted therapy was reported to treat. According to psychiatrist George Greer, therapists who used MDMA in their practice were impressed by the results. Anecdotally, MDMA was said to greatly accelerate therapy. According to David Nutt, MDMA was widely used in the western US in couples counseling, and was called empathy. Only later was the term ecstasy used for it, coinciding with rising opposition to its use.

### Rising recreational use

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, "Adam" spread through personal networks of psychotherapists, psychiatrists, users of psychedelics, and yuppies. Hoping MDMA could avoid criminalization like LSD and mescaline, psychotherapists and experimenters attempted to limit the spread of MDMA and information about it while conducting informal research. Early MDMA distributors were deterred from large scale operations by the threat of possible legislation. Between the 1970s and the mid-1980s, this network of MDMA users consumed an estimated 500,000 doses.
A small recreational market for MDMA developed by the late 1970s, consuming perhaps 10,000 doses in 1976. By the early 1980s MDMA was being used in Boston and New York City nightclubs such as Studio 54 and Paradise Garage. Into the early 1980s, as the recreational market slowly expanded, production of MDMA was dominated by a small group of therapeutically minded Boston chemists. Having commenced production in 1976, this "Boston Group" did not keep up with growing demand and shortages frequently occurred.
Perceiving a business opportunity, Michael Clegg, the Southwest distributor for the Boston Group, started his own "Texas Group" backed financially by Texas friends. In 1981, Clegg had coined "Ecstasy" as a slang term for MDMA to increase its marketability. Starting in 1983, the Texas Group mass-produced MDMA in a Texas lab or imported it from California and marketed tablets using pyramid sales structures and toll-free numbers. MDMA could be purchased via credit card and taxes were paid on sales. Under the brand name "Sassyfras", MDMA tablets were sold in brown bottles. The Texas Group advertised "Ecstasy parties" at bars and discos, describing MDMA as a "fun drug" and "good to dance to". MDMA was openly distributed in Austin and Dallas–Fort Worth area bars and nightclubs, becoming popular with yuppies, college students, and gays.
Recreational use also increased after several cocaine dealers switched to distributing MDMA following experiences with the drug. A California laboratory that analyzed confidentially submitted drug samples first detected MDMA in 1975. Over the following years the number of MDMA samples increased, eventually exceeding the number of MDA samples in the early 1980s. By the mid-1980s, MDMA use had spread to colleges around the United States.

### Media attention and scheduling

#### United States

In an early media report on MDMA published in 1982, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spokesman stated the agency would ban the drug if enough evidence for abuse could be found. By mid-1984, MDMA use was becoming more noticed. Bill Mandel reported on "Adam" in a 10 June San Francisco Chronicle article, but misidentified the drug as methyloxymethylenedioxyamphetamine (MMDA). In the next month, the World Health Organization identified MDMA as the only substance out of twenty phenethylamines to be seized a significant number of times.
After a year of planning and data collection, MDMA was proposed for scheduling by the DEA on 27 July 1984, with a request for comments and objections. The DEA was surprised when a number of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and researchers objected to the proposed scheduling and requested a hearing. In a Newsweek article published the next year, a DEA pharmacologist stated that the agency had been unaware of its use among psychiatrists. An initial hearing was held on 1 February 1985 at the DEA offices in Washington, D.C., with administrative law judge Francis L. Young presiding. It was decided there to hold three more hearings that year: Los Angeles on 10 June, Kansas City, Missouri on 10–11 July, and Washington, D.C., on 8–11 October.
Sensational media attention was given to the proposed criminalization and the reaction of MDMA proponents, effectively advertising the drug. In response to the proposed scheduling, the Texas Group increased production from 1985 estimates of 30,000 tablets a month to as many as 8,000 per day, potentially making two million ecstasy tablets in the months before MDMA was made illegal. By some estimates the Texas Group distributed 500,000 tablets per month in Dallas alone. According to one participant in an ethnographic study, the Texas Group produced more MDMA in eighteen months than all other distribution networks combined across their entire histories. By May 1985, MDMA use was widespread in California, Texas, southern Florida, and the northeastern United States. According to the DEA there was evidence of use in twenty-eight states and Canada. Urged by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the DEA announced an emergency Schedule I classification of MDMA on 31 May 1985. The agency cited increased distribution in Texas, escalating street use, and new evidence of MDA (an analog of MDMA) neurotoxicity as reasons for the emergency measure. The ban took effect one month later on 1 July 1985 in the midst of Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign.
As a result of several expert witnesses testifying that MDMA had an accepted medical usage, the administrative law judge presiding over the hearings recommended that MDMA be classified as a Schedule III substance. Despite this, DEA administrator John C. Lawn overruled and classified the drug as Schedule I. Harvard psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon then sued the DEA, claiming that the DEA had ignored the medical uses of MDMA, and the federal court sided with Grinspoon, calling Lawn's argument "strained" and "unpersuasive", and vacated MDMA's Schedule I status. Despite this, less than a month later Lawn reviewed the evidence and reclassified MDMA as Schedule I again, claiming that the expert testimony of several psychiatrists claiming over 200 cases where MDMA had been used in a therapeutic context with positive results could be dismissed because they were not published in medical journals. In 2017, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for its use with psychotherapy for PTSD. However, this designation has been questioned and problematized.

#### United Nations

While engaged in scheduling debates in the United States, the DEA also pushed for international scheduling. In 1985, the World Health Organization's Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended that MDMA be placed in Schedule I of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The committee made this recommendation on the basis of the pharmacological similarity of MDMA to previously scheduled drugs, reports of illicit trafficking in Canada, drug seizures in the United States, and lack of well-defined therapeutic use. While intrigued by reports of psychotherapeutic uses for the drug, the committee viewed the studies as lacking appropriate methodological design and encouraged further research. Committee chairman Paul Grof dissented, believing international control was not warranted at the time and a recommendation should await further therapeutic data. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs added MDMA to Schedule I of the convention on 11 February 1986.

### Post-scheduling

The use of MDMA in Texas clubs declined rapidly after criminalization, but by 1991, the drug became popular among young middle-class whites and in nightclubs. In 1985, MDMA use became associated with acid house on the Spanish island of Ibiza. Thereafter, in the late 1980s, the drug spread alongside rave culture to the United Kingdom and then to other European and American cities. Illicit MDMA use became increasingly widespread among young adults in universities and later, in high schools. Since the mid-1990s, MDMA has become the most widely used amphetamine-type drug by college students and teenagers. MDMA became one of the four most widely used illicit drugs in the US, along with cocaine, heroin, and cannabis. According to some estimates as of 2004, only marijuana attracts more first time users in the United States.
After MDMA was criminalized, most medical use stopped, although some therapists continued to prescribe the drug illegally. Later, Charles Grob initiated an ascending-dose safety study in healthy volunteers. Subsequent FDA-approved MDMA studies in humans have taken place in the United States in Detroit (Wayne State University), Chicago (University of Chicago), San Francisco (UCSF and California Pacific Medical Center), Baltimore (NIDA–NIH Intramural Program), and South Carolina. Studies have also been conducted in Switzerland (University Hospital of Psychiatry, Zürich), the Netherlands (Maastricht University), and Spain (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona).
"Molly", short for 'molecule', was recognized as a slang term for crystalline or powder MDMA in the 2000s.
In 2010, the BBC reported that use of MDMA had decreased in the UK in previous years. This may be due to increased seizures during use and decreased production of the precursor chemicals used to manufacture MDMA. Unwitting substitution with other drugs, such as mephedrone and methamphetamine, as well as legal alternatives to MDMA, such as BZP, MDPV, and methylone, are also thought to have contributed to its decrease in popularity.
In 2017, it was found that some pills being sold as MDMA contained pentylone, which can cause very unpleasant agitation and paranoia.
According to David Nutt, when safrole was restricted by the United Nations in order to reduce the supply of MDMA, producers in China began using anethole instead, but this gives para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA, also known as "Dr Death"), which is much more toxic than MDMA and can cause overheating, muscle spasms, seizures, unconsciousness, and death. People wanting MDMA are sometimes sold PMA instead.
In 2025, the BBC reported on a study of 650 survivors from the Nova music festival massacre. Two-thirds were under the influence of recreational drugs (MDMA, LSD, marijuana or psilocybin) when Hamas attacked the festival on October 7, 2023. MDMA appeared to have a protective effect against later problems with sleeping and emotional distress.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

MDMA is legally controlled in most of the world under the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances and other international agreements, although exceptions exist for research and limited medical use. In general, the unlicensed use, sale or manufacture of MDMA are all criminal offences.

#### Australia

In Australia, MDMA was rescheduled on 1 July 2023 as a schedule 8 substance (available on prescription) when used in the treatment of PTSD, while remaining a schedule 9 substance (prohibited) for all other uses. For the treatment of PTSD, MDMA can only be prescribed by psychiatrists with specific training and authorisation.
In 1986, MDMA was declared an illegal substance because of its allegedly harmful effects and potential for misuse. Any non-authorised sale, use or manufacture is strictly prohibited by law. Permits for research uses on humans must be approved by a recognized ethics committee on human research.
In Western Australia under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 4.0g of MDMA is the amount required determining a court of trial, 2.0g is considered a presumption with intent to sell or supply and 28.0g is considered trafficking under Australian law.
The Australian Capital Territory passed legislation to decriminalise the possession of small amounts of MDMA, which took effect in October 2023.

#### Canada

In Canada, MDMA is listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine. The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was updated as a result of the Safe Streets and Communities Act changing amphetamines from Schedule III to Schedule I in March 2012. In 2022, the federal government granted British Columbia a 3-year exemption, legalizing the possession of up to 2.5 grams (0.088 oz) of MDMA in the province from February 2023 until February 2026.

#### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on substances, preparations and plants considered to be narcotic drugs". Ecstasy is considered a very dangerous illegal drug.

#### Netherlands

In 2024, a Dutch state commission issued a report advocating for MDMA to be made available to patients with PTSD.
In June 2011, the Expert Committee on the List (Expertcommissie Lijstensystematiek Opiumwet) issued a report which discussed the evidence for harm and the legal status of MDMA, arguing in favor of maintaining it on List I.

#### United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, MDMA was made illegal in 1977 by a modification order to the existing Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Although MDMA was not named explicitly in this legislation, the order extended the definition of Class A drugs to include various ring-substituted phenethylamines. The drug is therefore illegal to sell, buy, or possess without a licence in the UK. Penalties include a maximum of seven years and/or unlimited fine for possession; life and/or unlimited fine for production or trafficking.
Some researchers such as David Nutt have criticized the scheduling of MDMA, which he determined to be a relatively harmless drug. An editorial he wrote in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, where he compared the risk of harm for horse riding (1 adverse event in 350) to that of ecstasy (1 in 10,000) resulted in his dismissal, leading to the resignation of several of his colleagues from the ACMD.

#### United States

In the United States, MDMA is listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. In a 2011 federal court hearing, the American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued that the sentencing guideline for MDMA/ecstasy is based on outdated science, leading to excessive prison sentences. Other courts have upheld the sentencing guidelines. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee explained its ruling by noting that "an individual federal district court judge simply cannot marshal resources akin to those available to the Commission for tackling the manifold issues involved with determining a proper drug equivalency."

### Demographics

In 2014, 3.5% of 18-to-25-year-olds had used MDMA in the United States. In the European Union as of 2018, 4.1% of adults (15–64 years old) have used MDMA at least once in their life, and 0.8% had used it in the last year. Among young adults, 1.8% had used MDMA in the last year.
In Europe, an estimated 37% of regular club-goers aged 14 to 35 used MDMA in the past year according to the 2015 European Drug report. The highest one-year prevalence of MDMA use in Germany in 2012 was 1.7% among people aged 25 to 29 compared with a population average of 0.4%. Among adolescent users in the United States between 1999 and 2008, girls were more likely to use MDMA than boys.

### Economics

#### Europe

In 2008 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction noted that although there were some reports of tablets being sold for as little as €1, most countries in Europe then reported typical retail prices in the range of €3 to €9 per tablet, typically containing 25–65 mg of MDMA. By 2014 the EMCDDA reported that the range was more usually between €5 and €10 per tablet, typically containing 57–102 mg of MDMA, although MDMA in powder form was becoming more common.

#### North America

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime stated in its 2014 World Drug Report that US ecstasy retail prices range from US\$1 to \$70 per pill, or from \$15,000 to \$32,000 per kilogram. A new research area named Drug Intelligence aims to automatically monitor distribution networks based on image processing and machine learning techniques, in which an Ecstasy pill picture is analyzed to detect correlations among different production batches. These novel techniques allow police scientists to facilitate the monitoring of illicit distribution networks.
As of October 2015, most of the MDMA in the United States is produced in British Columbia, Canada and imported by Canada-based Asian transnational criminal organizations. The market for MDMA in the United States is relatively small compared to methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. In the United States, about 0.9 million people used ecstasy in 2010.

#### Australia

MDMA is particularly expensive in Australia, costing A\$15–A\$30 per tablet. In terms of purity data for Australian MDMA, the average is around 34%, ranging from less than 1% to about 85%. The majority of tablets contain 70–85 mg of MDMA. Most MDMA enters Australia from the Netherlands, the UK, Asia, and the US.

#### Corporate logos on pills

A number of ecstasy manufacturers brand their pills with a logo, often that of an unrelated corporation. Some pills depict logos of products or media popular with children, such as Shaun the Sheep.

MDMA-assisted psychotherapy shows promising efficacy and a generally tolerable safety profile for treating PTSD, with meta-analyses indicating symptom reduction, though careful dosing and controlled therapeutic settings are essential to minimize risks.
MDMA is being investigated as a potential treatment for social impairments in autism.
The British critical psychiatrist Joanna Moncrieff has critiqued the use and study of MDMA and related drugs like psychedelics for treatment of psychiatric disorders, highlighting concerns including excessive hype around these drugs, blurred lines between medical and recreational use, flawed clinical trial findings, financial conflicts of interest, strong expectancy effects and large placebo responses, short-term benefits over placebo, and their potential for adverse effects, among others.
