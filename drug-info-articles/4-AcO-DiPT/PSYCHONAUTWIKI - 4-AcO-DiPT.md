**4-Acetoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine** (also known as **4-AcO-DiPT** , **4-Acetoxy-DiPT** , **Ipracetin** , **Iprocetyl** and colloquially as **"4-Ace"** or **"Aces"** ) is a lesser-known synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) chemical class that produces a unique mixture of [physically euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) , and atypically minimal [visual](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics) and [introspective](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) psychedelic effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

It has been described in early online reports as being only vaguely similar to structurally-related tryptamine substances such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) but with the [disinhibiting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [physically euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) and [libidinous](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) signature of psychedelics like [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) , and an atypically short duration of around 3 - 4 hours. It has since been reported to be slightly longer lasting and mildly less potent than [4-HO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DiPT) (also known as **Iprocin** ) with an active dose reported as between 15 and 40 mg.

4-AcO-DiPT is primarily thought to act as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) to [4-HO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DiPT) , a substance which [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) comments on in his book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) . In it he writes that he "truly doubt(s) that there is another psychedelic drug, anywhere, that can match this one for speed, for intensity, for brevity, and sensitive to dose, at least one that is active orally." Anecdotal reports dating from at least 1999 reveals that these properties are largely preserved with 4-AcO-DiPT, with the exception of a less rapid and potentially jarring onset, slightly extended duration and decreased physical side-effects from the excessive stimulation and restlessness that [4-HO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DiPT) is commonly reported to produce, making it a more comfortable experience overall.

Today, 4-AcO-DiPT is rarely able to be acquired on the consumer market and when it is, is almost exclusively distributed as a gray-area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) online for [recreational](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) and proclaimed [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogenic) purposes. It is an example of the early wave of psychedelic [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) that were explored following the wake of its initial synthesis and documentation in [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) , before the emergence of an easily-accessible network of online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors during the early 2000s. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-AcO-DiPT. Users are advised to proceed with caution when choosing to use this substance.

## Chemistry

4-Acetoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, or 4-AcO-DiPT, is a synthetic [indole](/w/index.php?title=Indole&action=edit&redlink=1) [alkaloid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkaloid) molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) chemical class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-AcO-DiPT is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with an acetoxy (-AcO) functional group CH 3 COO−. It also contains two diisopropyl chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its base tryptamine backbone (i.e. [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) ).

Structurally, 4-AcO-DiPT is the the acetate ester analog of [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) , N-substituted isopropyl homolog of [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) ( *Psilocin* ), and the N-substituted diisopropyl analog of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) .

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-AcO-DiPT likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The primary [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from 4-AcO-DiPT's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors, although a number of other receptors may be involved as well. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience remains subject to ongoing scientific investigation.

### Pharmacokinetics

4-AcO-DiPT is reported to produce effects that are almost identical to its de-acetylated counterpart ( **4-HO-DiPT** ), albeit with a slightly extended duration and slower ramp-up in its activity. This is in a similar manner that substances like [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) / [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) , [4-AcO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-MET) / [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) , and [4-AcO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DET) / [4-HO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DET) all seem to share the core pharmacokinetic relationship to their counterparts, suggesting that the 4-acetoxy tryptamine compounds are largely deacetylated into their respective 4-hydroxy homologs before exerting their main effects, though the degree and manner to which this occurs has yet to be scientifically validated..

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- The physical effects of 4-AcO-DiPT are perhaps the most pronounced and distinct of any four-position substituted tryptamine. Anecdotal reports suggest that they seem to come at the expense of any introspective quality and instead produces a state marked initially by sedation, deep relaxation, and physical comfort before proceeding to a state marked by a unique type of psychedelic [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , bodily awareness enhancements and physical euphoria that remains consistent throughout the experience once it has developed. 
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** and **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 4-AcO-DiPT is considered have the paradoxical property of both being relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating that arises in the first part of the experience, before the development of a marked sense of [physical stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) that can promote energetic activities such as dancing.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 4-AcO-DiPT can be described as a pleasurable, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation or glow. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. Once the peak of the experience or sensation is reached it can feel intensely euphoric and tranquil along with a paradoxical sense of energetic stimulation that is considered to be atypical for a [substituted tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) . 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - It should be noted that this effect is a very consistent and predominating component relative to related psychedelics like [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and produces energetic and stimulating effects that uniquely resemble those produced by [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) (in as close as a psychedelic can get to the physical euphoria these substances can produce), albeit in a less forced manner.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - This effect is extremely prominent relative to just about all other [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) .
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - This effect corresponds to the general sense of sedation and relaxation that characterizes 4-AcO-DiPT experiences, this manifests as a bodily heaviness that discourages movement but is typically only prominent during the first half of the trip.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually occurs during the initial part of the experience before the stimulating effects become more prominent. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects. This is usually reported as feeling deeply comfortable in its sensations and even peaceful, and is a very prominent effect produced by [4-HO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DiPT) .
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - A special amount of attention should be paid to the temperature modulating effects of this compound -- especially at its peak -- as reports suggest that it can reliably produce increases in bodily temperature that is somewhat atypical for a substituted tryptamine. 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect can be greatly lessened or even completely avoided if the individual has an near-empty stomach prior to ingestion. It is sometimes recommended that one eat a light meal 3 to 4 hours beforehand, particularly if feeling physically fatigued. Relative to other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) like [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) or [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) , however, reports suggest that this substance typically produces minimal nausea
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is likely a rare effect but can likely happen in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished. However it should be noted that there are no documented cases of seizures occurring with this compound. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- In comparison to other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) and [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) , 4-AcO-DiPT presents very little in the way of visual effects, with only mild visual alterations even at heavy doses for all of the effects listed across the board. Anecdotal reports suggest that it is incapable of producing any higher level visuals and totally incapable of inducing [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) or [hallucinatory states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinatory_states) as is the case with other 4-substituted tryptamines such as [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) or [4-AcO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-MET) . 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as extremely mild to moderate, even at heavy doses, and does not comprise a significant portion of the experience.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 4-AcO-DiPT are described by many as a paradoxical mixture of being both sedating/stoning and markedly stimulating in style when compared to other commonly used [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) , which tend to be sedating, introspective, personally meaningful, and emotionally charged. It is also regarded as being notably more lucid and un-impairing than [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) or even [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , with minimal to no headspace or visual alterations. It displays a number of cognitive effects that are not typically associated with traditional [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) . The most prominent of these typical effects generally include: 
- **[Outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection)** - This substance has been reported as being atypically non-introspective for a psychedelic [substituted tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_tryptamine) , instead lending itself to social activities and recreational outings.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)** - This effect is notably pronounced for a psychedelic tryptamine and reportedly lends to increased sociability and pleasure-seeking behavior. 
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - Anecdotal reports frequently remark on the highly libidinous and sensual nature of this compound. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect can be described as being less prominent, consistent and profound when compared to other traditional psychedelics such as [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) . It can lead to strong feelings of physical connection and social bonding, both in mass gatherings as well as in more intimate settings. The sociability enhancement occurs at a much higher and consistent rate than with just about all other [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) , which tend to produce socially-impairing effects at medium-to-high doses that 4-AcO-DiPT does not.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - This effect seems to be atypically prominent for this substance when compared to traditional psychedelics, and is likely due to its uniquely short duration and a progression marked by a rapid come up followed by an equally rapid offset.
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)** - This effect is typically only prominent at the very beginning stages of the experience, before the stimulating and disinhibiting aspects take over.
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This effect is comparatively mild when compared to simpler substituted tryptamines with longer durations and more memory-suppressing components. ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during and after the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of this compound are comparable to that of a mild [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) . The experience generally feels mildly fatiguing compared to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is colloquially referred to as a " [comedown](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_down) ". Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue)**
- **[Restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome)**

## Combinations

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - When used in conjunction with cannabis, both the visual and cognitive effects of 4-AcO-DiPT can be intensified and extended with extreme efficacy. This should be done with extreme caution, however, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics. Many users typically report a dramatically intensified visual and "body high"; however, this can also amplify the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) producing aspects of cannabis significantly, so extreme caution is advised when combining these two substances.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s [diuretic](/w/index.php?title=Diuretic&action=edit&redlink=1) and physically taxing effect which can negatively affect a trip if taken in high dosages. This combination is, however, considered to be reasonably safe in low doses and when used in moderate quantities, can often "take the edge off" a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, albeit in a more physically draining way.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a psilocin trip. They are very efficient at stopping [bad trips](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose, however, due to the very high habit-forming and addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-AcO-DiPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-AcO-DiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried 4-AcO-DiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-AcO-DiPT is not known to be habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with repeated administration. As with most psychedelics, it is generally considered to have a built-in, self-regulating aspect. However, it should be noted that due to the distinctly hedonic effects this substance produces, it may possess a higher liability for frequent or excessive consumption relative to most psychedelics.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-AcO-DiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. Afterward, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-AcO-DiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-AcO-DiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-AcO-DiPT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
