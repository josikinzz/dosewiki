## Subjective Experience

This is described by Wikipedia as a structural and functional analogue of psilocin,
which in turn is present in most psychedelic mushrooms. Hardly surprisingly, it is
generally considered to produce very similar effects. It was first synthesised by
Alexander Shulgin, and is documented in his book, TiHKAL.

At the time of testing, along with 4-ACO-DMT, 4-HO-MET is increasingly popular,
appearing on the must-do list of many regular Internet posters. It is often suggested
that of the two it offers more head clarity, is less deep, has more visuals, and is
therefore more recreational.

Unfortunately, it will be difficult to draw comparisons in this report, having only
sampled a low dose of 4-AcO-DMT, but I cannot deny that I have been looking
forward to this particular experiment.

My original inclination was to dose at 10-15mg, but social circumstances have again
conspired against me, dictating that I retain a reasonable degree of functionality. I
therefore dose significantly lower.

```
T+0:00 6mg is carefully measured from the 11mg that fell out of the small
plastic bag as I poured it on to the pan. I retain the other half for potential use
later in the trip. [2:40pm]
```
```
T+0:30 A headspace is slowly emerging, and I feel clammy, although I am
unsure whether I am hot or cold.
```
```
T+0:50 A very mild and pleasant headiness has developed, which is verging
on serene in nature, suggesting a mood lift. Vision is almost glossy in
character, with a mild sheen. Music is not particularly enhanced.
```
```
T+1:00 An hour has passed, and given that I consumed on an empty stomach,
I suspect that this is as far as it will go. This is fine, but so am I, so I decide to
toss and wash the other 5mg.
```
```
T+1:40 The gloss I referred to earlier is slightly stronger, I am warm, and the
headspace is now very comfortable. It isn't overpowering in any way, and I am
easily functional, but there is a rather pleasant ambience to existence.
```
```
I am not experiencing any real visuals at this stage, other than the haze
referred to above. This is contrary to expectations, and to most general user
reports. Perhaps this feature is dose dependent, although it is possible that my
sample isn’t particularly strong.
```
```
No significant pupil dilation is apparent, but there is some tactile sensitivity
present. Although I feel that I am definitely playing in low-dose territory, the
influence of the drug is well into the Shulgin ++ range.
```
```
T+2:00 I am in a reflective state of general psychedelic awareness. The
headspace has a gentle character to it, with no perceptible rough edges. Focus
on individual tasks is fairly straight forward if required, but the desire to bathe
in the overall warmth is stronger.
```
```
T+2:40 I am now floating on a plateau, having peaked some time ago. I sense
that from here I will experience a slow and gentle come-down, which I expect
to last a couple of hours. I remain comfortable however, in a somewhat
numbed bubble of contentedness. The body sensation of light tactility is still
physically present, but the clamminess is subsiding.
```
```
T+3:10 I continue to feel serene but I am now unengaged enough to pro-
actively seek some form of extra entertainment, courtesy of YouTube. I
purposely avoid the news, as it is generally bad, and I have an eye on set and
setting.
```

```
At this stage I feel more equipped to draw comparison with the low dose of 4-
ACO-DMT which I sampled a couple of weeks ago. This certainly has a milder
less intense feel about it, with possibly less scope for introspection. I would
have to go deeper with both to offer anything more substantive.
```
```
T+4:00 I have just consumed a meal without difficulty. Given that by now I
am well into the dying embers of the experience, perhaps it is not surprising
that I noticed no particular degradation or enhancement of taste or appetite.
```
```
To all intents and purposes the show now appears to be over. I feel largely at
base, with a mild psychedelic fatigue and lassitude, as is usual for most
members of this class.
```
In retrospect, I feel that I would have learned far more had I gone with the whole
11mg which fate served from the packet, rather than taking it in two halves. However,
this was still a positive low-end experience, with no real negatives or unwanted side
effects.

As with 4-ACO-DMT, I hope to return to this in due course.
