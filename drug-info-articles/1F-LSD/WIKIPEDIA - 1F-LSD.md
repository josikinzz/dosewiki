1F-LSD, also known as 1-(furan-2-carbonyl)-LSD, 1-(2-furoyl)-LSD, or SYN-L-005, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is thought to act as a prodrug of LSD. The drug interacts with serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, and produces the head-twitch response in rodents, with about 3-fold lower potency than LSD. It hydrolyzes into LSD in rodents. 1F-LSD was patented in 2024 and was first described in the scientific literature in 2025. It has been encountered as a novel designer drug in Germany and Japan.
