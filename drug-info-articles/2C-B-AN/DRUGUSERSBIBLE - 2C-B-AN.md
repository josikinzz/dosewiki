## Subjective Experience

A small supply of this appeared on the market in 2016, shortly before the general UK
ban came into effect. I was fortunate to obtain enough for a couple of low-dose trips.

These were pleasant enough: enhanced colouration with minor visuals, a sense of
mood lift with mild euphoria, and a tingly body feel as experienced with other 2C-B
variants.

The difference between many of these analogues is often subtle and difficult to
distinguish, particularly with respect to headspace. It could well be that this one
converts to 2C-B itself in vivo, as I have seen suggested.

Overall, this was a very nice foray, with the relatively short duration being a positive
in my circumstances at the time. It was certainly trippy in nature, and I was almost
back to baseline after about 6 hours.
