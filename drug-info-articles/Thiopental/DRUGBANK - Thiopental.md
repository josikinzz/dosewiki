## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as thiobarbituric acid derivatives. These are organic compounds containing a 2-thioxodihydropyrimidine-4,6(1H,5H)-dione skeleton.

### Background

A barbiturate that is administered intravenously for the induction of general anesthesia or for the production of complete anesthesia of short duration. It is also used for hypnosis and for the control of convulsive states. It has been used in neurosurgical patients to reduce increased intracranial pressure. It does not produce any excitation but has poor analgesic and muscle relaxant properties. Small doses have been shown to be anti-analgesic and lower the pain threshold. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p920)

### Indication

For use as the sole anesthetic agent for brief (15 minute) procedures, for induction of anesthesia prior to administration of other anesthetic agents, to supplement regional anesthesia, to provide hypnosis during balanced anesthesia with other agents for analgesia or muscle relaxation, for the control of convulsive states during or following inhalation anesthesia or local anesthesia, in neurosurgical patients with increased intracranial pressure, and for narcoanalysis and narcosynthesis in psychiatric disorders.

### Pharmacodynamics

Thiopental, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Thiopental is an ultrashort-acting depressant of the central nervous system which induces hypnosis and anesthesia, but not analgesia. It produces hypnosis within 30 to 40 seconds of intravenous injection. Recovery after a small dose is rapid, with some somnolence and retrograde amnesia. Repeated intravenous doses lead to prolonged anesthesia because fatty tissues act as a reservoir; they accumulate Pentothal in concentrations 6 to 12 times greater than the plasma concentration, and then release the drug slowly to cause prolonged anesthesia

### Mechanism of Action

Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1
Potentiator
Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-2
Potentiator
Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-3
Potentiator
+ 3 more targets

### Absorption

Rapidly absorbed.

### Metabolism

Thiopental is extensively metabolized, primarily in the liver, resulting in only 0.3% of an administered dose being excreted unchanged in the urine.
7
Ring desulfuration leads to the generation of an active metabolite,
pentobarbital
, that exists in concentrations approximately 3-10% that of the parent concentration.
5
Thiopental and pentobarbital are also subject to both oxidation and hydroxylation to carboxylic acids and alcohols, respectively, all of which are pharmacologically inert.
5
While many of the specifics regarding thiopental biotransformation have not been elucidated, including the enzymes responsible, the oxidation of  thiopental to its carboxylic acid may be the major driver of thiopental detoxification as this product appears to account for 10-25% of renally excreted drug.

### Half-life

3-8 hours

### Toxicity

Overdosage may occur from rapid or repeated injections. Too rapid injection may be followed by an alarming fall in blood pressure even to shock levels. Apnea, occasional laryngospasm, coughing and other respiratory difficulties with excessive or too rapid injections may occur. Lethal blood levels may be as low as 1 mg/100 mL for short-acting barbiturates; less if other depressant drugs or alcohol are also present.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Thiopental is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abaloparatide
Thiopental may increase the hypotensive activities of Abaloparatide.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Thiopental can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abrocitinib
The metabolism of Abrocitinib can be decreased when combined with Thiopental.
Acebutolol
Thiopental may increase the hypotensive activities of Acebutolol.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Additive CNS depression may occur if alcohol is consumed with thiopental.

### Mechanism of action

Thiopental binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl
-
ionopore at the GABA
A
receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl
-
ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Hydroxylates PUFA specifically at the omega-1 position (PubMed:18577768). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA (PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Responsible for the metabolism of a number of therapeutic agents such as the anticonvulsant drug S-mephenytoin, omeprazole, proguanil, certain barbiturates, diazepam, propranolol, citalopram and imipramine. Hydroxylates fenbendazole at the 4' position (PubMed:23959307)
