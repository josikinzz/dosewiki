*Onset* : 60 - 120 minutes
*Duration* : 8 - 18 hours
*Normal After Effects* : up to 3 days

Datura is a genus of legal flowering plants that contains two psychoactive chemicals in roughly equal amounts. These are known as Scopolamine and Atropine, two molecules that are both in the tropane alkaloid class, with anticholinergic effects. The plants precise and natural distribution seems to be throughout most of the temperate and tropical regions of the globe, owing to its extensive cultivation and naturalization. There are a total of nine different species in the Datura genus, but the two most well-known species are Datura inoxia and Datura strammonium. Both of which have been used in a shamanic context for religious purposes on most continents since before recorded history began, with records of its use being found throughout the ancient americas, europe and india.

In terms of it’s subjective effects the Datura trip is extremely similar to that of DPH with a significantly longer duration but less dysphoria. The mental transition from reality to delirium is an extremely smooth one, a stuporous, hazy, mildly dissociating, light and floaty high is felt, and everything seems almost normal apart from waves of mild to intense paranoia. Feelings of being unable to communicate or understand normal language also become apparent with higher doses.

Although Datura is not nearly as dysphoric as DPH it is still capable of feeling overwhelmingly unpleasant. With extreme dry mouth, hot / cold flushes and the inability to urinate despite desperately needing to all commonly reported throughout the trip. Blurred vision occasionally occurs, blinding the tripper and rarely but occasionally lasting for days to weeks after wards.

After a while, delirium takes over, causing you get used to the feeling and not notice it any more, or perhaps it genuinely fades. Leaving the trippers to experience concrete and 100% convincing visual and auditory hallucinations that can vary from mundane, to fascinating to horrifying.

You can use Datura in many ways, one of the most common ways is to smoke the leaves and flowers, which offers a very mild trip with a duration similar to that of weed. You can also make a tea out of the leaves, flowers, and seeds, or you can eat the seeds with or without cooking them. Eating raw seeds is not recommended because of the high toxicity of them. The most potent parts in decreasing order are respectively the seed pods, leafs and flowers. Seeds are eaten while leaves are usually brewed as tea, though they are also chewed for their effects.

It is extremely important to note however that the potency of plants varies wildly and there is no way for the common man to accurately measure the dosage. At high enough doses Datura becomes an incredibly toxic poison that can easily result in death, making Datura the most dangerous hallucinogen out there with accidental overdoses resulting in hospitalization not unheard of. The safest way to ensure this does not happen is to grind the dried plant matter into an extremely fine and even powder so that the active chemicals within them are distributed evenly across itself. From here you can slowly work your way up in extremely small increments until the correct dosage for that particular plant is found.

If you want to try Datura despite all of its risks, you can grow it yourself using seeds purchased online or find a wild plant in your local area.**
**

There is little to no insight to be gained from these substances and they can be extremely dangerous both physically and mentally if dosage is not payed close attention to. I would not recommend either of these drugs to any human being alive but view them more as drugs of interest than anything. Something that a person tries even if only once, just to see what they are like. Nobody is going to stop you from trying these substances, even our nations governments have deemed these substances as legally acceptable, whilst still prohibiting the use and sale of physically benign and mentally beneficial hallucinogens such as LSD or mushrooms. Keep in mind however, that you and you alone are responsible for your actions and that almost everybody who tries these drugs regrets it immediately.`,

## Subjective Experience

I wasn’t going to include datura in this book, and I didn’t include it the first edition.
Having experienced delirium at the hands of nutmeg, I saw no sense whatsoever in
exposing myself to it again, risking my life and my mental health in the process.

Why have I changed my mind? I would argue that I haven’t. What I have decided to
do is to go through the normal routine (research, document and record), but
critically, using a minimal dose.

The idea is to more fully elaborate upon the dangers of this plant, and on deliriants in
general, whilst limiting the threat of self-harm as far as I can. This is, after all, a book
about drug safety, and on balance, given that most readers will already have heard of
it, I feel that it would be remiss not to include datura in some form.

At the outset, I think it is worth stressing again what delirium actually is. A
contributor to the DMT-Nexus forum described it in these terms:

\`\`\`
“When a patient gets hallucinations from Datura alkaloids (hyoscyamine,
atropine, or scopolamine), it is a medical sign of a near fatal dose.” ~ 69ron
\`\`\`
On this basis, to experience delirium or hallucinations with this it is necessary to
overdose, with risk of death. Hardly surprisingly, therefore, on sensible social media
platforms the advice of experienced people is unambiguous in stating that datura
should be avoided. This is usually expressed in stark and graphic terms.

Even Wikipedia joins the chorus:

\`\`\`
“Most parts of the plants are toxic, and datura has a long history of use for
causing delirious states and death.”
\`\`\`
Medical papers are awash with details of the adverse effects, which can include
seizures, hyperthermia, wide-complex dysrhythmias, cardiovascular collapse, failure
of organ systems, rhabdomyolysis, and liver, kidney and brain damage. I hope that
you are painting a picture from this.

For my own cautious experiment the question of dosage is obviously of paramount
importance. However, it quickly emerges that dose measurement is far from a
straight forward exercise. Online comments like these are not uncommon:

\`\`\`
“There is no way to guess a reasonable dose, because potency of the plant
material itself and appropriate dose for an individual appear to vary so
much.” ~ Erowid
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
“A good dosage advise on Datura is not possible, as the alkaloid content
varies so extreme. The seeds are recognised as the part of the plant with the
least variation, but they can have anywhere from 0.1 to 0.7% tropane
alkaloids.” ~ Ginkgo, DMT-Nexus.
\`\`\`
On the premise of the latter comment, one seed could have seven times the potency
of the next seed. This is a huge disparity, and it doesn't help to answer the
fundamental question with respect to my own dose, which is: how much am I
prepared to poison myself for the purpose of this experiment? The answer to this is
as little as I can get away with whilst reaching a sufficient threshold to write about it
in a credible way.

In view of the potential horror, and given the enormous dose variability, I decide to
take a single seed. On this dose, of course, I don’t anticipate delirium. However, some
form of dream potentiation during sleep is perhaps a possibility.

Regarding duration, a moderate dose is generally considered to last around 8-12
hours, with higher doses persisting for perhaps 2-3 days. Effects can apparently be
felt after an hour, give or take half an hour, with peak typically being reached at
around 4 to 6 hours.

Ready to proceed, I select a datura stramonium seed from the small plastic baggy:
one which looks relatively wholesome and alive. Aware of the potential for impaired
judgement and lost memory under its influence, I dispose of the rest.

As I prepare to take the plunge, I cannot deny that part of me is hoping that the
exercise fails, and that my supply is somehow deficient. Yes, my nutmeg experience
really was that terrifying.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I briefly chew the seed, breaking it with my teeth, and I swallow the
debris with a glass of water. I have started the experiment at 5:00pm so that
any effects will over-run into my sleeping hours.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 Unexpectedly, I do feel a little something. Placebo effects can be
convincing, but there does seem to be a heady strangeness present. This is not
debilitating in any way, but it manifests largely through a tendency to linger
on thought-patterns. I am in a calm but slightly off-key space, aware of
distinct sounds and sights, but fully rational. This apparent psychoactivity
could of course have been initiated via buccal absorption whilst I chewed, in
which case I would expect it to dissipate relatively quickly.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 The mild psychoactivity has stabilised, or perhaps I have come to
terms with it. It is there in the background, but is not really intrusive, in that I
could probably forget it if I was heavily engaged in an absorbing task. As it is
not unpleasant I would in fact like it to persist, at least for a while longer.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 I feel quite close to base, but with a touch of headiness enduring. I
have had a bite to eat and will now embark upon some light exercise.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 “The swim passed as standard. I find myself maybe a little more self-
reflective than usual and possibly more neutral in mood. Apart from this I
now feel normal. The self-

  "wikipedia": `# Datura
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datura*

Datura is a genus of nine species of highly poisonous, vespertine-flowering plants belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). They are commonly known as thornapples or jimsonweeds, but are also known as devil's trumpets or mad apple (not to be confused with angel's trumpets, which are placed in the closely related genus Brugmansia). Other English common names include moonflower, devil's weed, and hell's bells. All species of Datura are extremely poisonous and psychoactive, especially their seeds and flowers, which can cause respiratory depression, arrhythmias, fever, delirium, hallucinations, anticholinergic toxidrome, psychosis, and death if taken internally.
The name Datura originates from the Hindi and Sanskrit words for "thorn-apple," with historical and cultural significance in Ayurveda and Hinduism, while the American term "jimsonweed" derives from its prevalence in Jamestown, Virginia, where it was called "Jamestown-Weed." Datura species are herbaceous annual or short-lived perennial plants up to 2 meters tall with trumpet-shaped flowers and spiny fruit capsules, historically used in traditional medicine, especially in India, where they hold cultural and ritual significance. Datura species classification is complex due to high variability and overlapping traits among species, with many "new species" later reclassified as local varieties or subspecies; most species are native to Mexico, though some have disputed native ranges outside the Americas, and the genus is closely related to Brugmansia and the recently established Trompettia.
Due to their effects and symptoms, Datura species have occasionally been used not only as poisons, but also as hallucinogens by various groups throughout history. Traditionally, their psychoactive administration has often been associated with witchcraft and sorcery or similar practices in many cultures, including the Western world. Certain common Datura species have also been used ritualistically as entheogens by some Native American groups.
Non-psychoactive use of plants in the genus is usually done for medicinal purposes, and the alkaloids present in some species have long been considered traditional medicines in both the New and Old Worlds due to the presence of the alkaloids scopolamine and atropine, which are also produced by plants associated with Old World medicine such as Hyoscyamus niger, Atropa belladonna, and Mandragora officinarum.

## Etymology

The generic name Datura is taken from Hindi धतूरा dhatūra "thorn-apple", ultimately from Sanskrit धत्तूर dhattūra "white thorn-apple" (referring to Datura metel of Asia). In the Ayurvedic text Sushruta Samhita, different species of Datura are also referred to as kanaka and unmatta. Dhatura is offered to Shiva in Hinduism. Record of this name in English dates back to 1662. Nathaniel Hawthorne refers to one type in The Scarlet Letter as "apple-Peru". In Mexico, its common name is toloache (also spelled tolguacha), which derives from the Nahuatl tolohuaxihuitl, meaning "the plant with the nodding head" (in reference to the nodding seed capsules of Datura species belonging to section Dutra of the genus).
The term "Jimsonweed" is said to come from the American colony Jamestown. In Jamestown datura was common, and was referred to as "Jamestown-Weed" by one Virginian, Robert Beverley. This then turned into the term "Jimsonweed".

## Description

Datura species are herbaceous, leafy annuals and short-lived perennials, which can reach up to 2 m in height. The leaves are alternate, 10–20 cm long, and 5–18 cm broad, with a lobed or toothed margin. The flowers are erect or spreading (not pendulous like those of Brugmansia), trumpet-shaped, 5–20 cm long, and 4–12 cm broad at the mouth; colours vary from white to yellow and pale purple. The fruit is a spiny capsule, 4–10 cm long and 2–6 cm broad, splitting open when ripe to release the numerous seeds. The seeds disperse freely over pastures, fields, and even wasteland locations.
Datura belongs to the classic "witches' weeds", along with deadly nightshade, henbane, and mandrake. All parts of the plants are toxic, and the genus has a long history of use for causing delirious states and death. It was well known as an essential ingredient of magical ointments, potions, and witches' brews, most notably Datura stramonium.
In India, D. metel has long been regarded as a poison and aphrodisiac, having been used in Ayurveda as a medicine since ancient times. It features in rituals and prayers to Shiva and also in Ganesh Chaturthi, a festival devoted to the deity Ganesha. The larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including Hypercompe indecisa, eat some Datura species. It has been observed that while insects may prefer to feed on Datura leaves, other animals such as cows will generally avoid consuming them.

## Species and cultivars

Classifying Datura as to its species is difficult, and the descriptions of new species often are accepted prematurely. Later, these "new species" are found to be simply varieties that have evolved due to conditions at a specific location. They usually disappear in a few years. Contributing to the confusion is the fact that various species, such as D. wrightii and D. innoxia, are very similar in appearance, and the variation within a species can be extreme. For example, Datura species can change size of plant, leaf, and flowers, all depending on location. The same species, when growing in a half-shady, damp location can develop into a flowering bush half as tall as an adult human of average height, but when growing in a very dry location, will only grow into a thin plant not much more than ankle high, with tiny flowers and a few miniature leaves. Datura species are native to dry, temperate, and subtropical regions. Most species are native to Mexico, which is considered the centre of origin of the genus. Several species are considered to have extra-American native ranges: D. ferox (native to China), D. metel (native to India and Southeast Asia), and D. leichardthii (native to Australia), however these may be early introductions from Central America.
A group of South American species formerly placed in the genus Datura are now placed in the distinct genus Brugmansia (Brugmansia differs from Datura in that it is woody (the species being shrubs or small trees) and has indehiscent fruits.) The solanaceous tribe Datureae, to which Datura and Brugmansia belong, has recently acquired a new, monotypic genus Trompettia J. Dupin, featuring the species Trompettia cardenasiana, which had hitherto been misclassified as belonging to the genus Iochroma.
Datura specialists Ulrike Preissel and Hans-Georg Preissel accept only 9 species of Datura, but Kew's Plants of the World Online currently lists the following 14 (out of which the current edition of The Plant List does not list D. arenicola, D. lanosa, and D. pruinosa as accepted spp.):

Datura arenicola Gentry ex Bye & Luna
Datura ceratocaula Ortega
Datura discolor Bernh.
Datura ferox L.
Datura innoxia Mill.
Datura kymatocarpa Barclay
Datura lanosa A.S.Barclay ex Bye
Datura leichhardtii Benth.
Datura metel L.
Datura pruinosa Greenm.
Datura quercifolia Kunth
Datura reburra Barclay
Datura stramonium L.
Datura wrightii Regel
Of the above, D. leichhardtii is close enough to D. pruinosa to merit demotion to a subspecies and likewise D. ferox and D. quercifolia are close enough in morphology to merit being subsumed in a single species. Furthermore, the Australian provenance of D. leichhardtii, the Chinese provenance of D. ferox, and the Afro-Asiatic provenance of D. metel have been cast into serious doubt, with the three species being almost certainly post-Columbian introductions to the regions to which they were originally thought native.
The case of D. metel is unique in that not only is the plant not a true species at all, but an assemblage of ancient pre-Columbian cultivars created from D. innoxia in the Greater Antilles, but evidence is mounting that it was introduced to the Indian subcontinent no later than the second century CE – whether by natural or human agency is, as yet, unknown – making it one of the most ancient plant introductions (if not the most ancient) from the New World to the Old World (see Columbian Exchange).
D. arenicola is a remarkable new species, described only in 2013, of very restricted range, and so distinctive as to have merited the creation for it of the new section Discola [not to be confused with the species name D. discolor] within the genus. The specific name arenicola means "loving (i.e. "thriving in") sand".

American Brugmansia and Datura Society, Inc. (ABADS) is designated in the 2004 edition of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants as the official International Cultivar Registration Authority for Datura. This role was delegated to ABADS by the International Society for Horticultural Science in 2002.

### Past classified species

D. lanosa
D. suaveolens

## Cultivation

Datura species are usually sown annually from the seed produced in the spiny capsules, but, with care, the tuberous-rooted perennial species may be overwintered. Most species are suited to being planted outside or in containers. As a rule, they need warm, sunny places and soil that will keep their roots dry. When grown outdoors in good locations, the plants tend to reseed themselves and may become invasive. In containers, they should have porous, aerated potting soil with adequate drainage. The plants are susceptible to fungi in the root area, so anaerobic organic enrichment such as anaerobically composted organic matter or manure, should be avoided.

## Toxicity

All Datura plants contain tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and atropine, primarily in their seeds and flowers, as well as the roots of certain species such as D. wrightii. Because of the presence of these substances, Datura has been used for centuries in some cultures as a poison. A given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions. These variations make Datura exceptionally hazardous as a drug. Since datura directly causes the effects of anticholinergic syndrome, the symptoms of its toxicity are often cited by the traditional mnemonic: "Blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, hot as a hare, dry as a bone, the bowel and bladder lose their tone, and the heart runs alone". Datura, as well as long-term psychoactive/toxic usage of other anticholinergic drugs, also appear to significantly increase the risk of developing dementia.
In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of Datura was critical to minimize harm. Many tragic incidents result from modern users ingesting or smoking Datura. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States media reported stories of adolescents and young adults dying or becoming seriously ill from intentionally ingesting Datura. Deliberate or inadvertent poisoning resulting from smoking jimsonweed and other related species has been reported as well. Although most poisonings occur with more common species of Datura such as D. stramonium, several reports in the medical literature indicate deaths from D. ferox intoxication. Children are especially vulnerable to atropine poisoning.

In some parts of Europe and India, Datura has been a popular poison for suicide and murder. From 1950 to 1965, the State Chemical Laboratories in Agra, India, investigated 2,778 deaths caused by ingesting Datura. A group called Thugs (practicers of thuggee) were reportedly devotees of an Indian religious cult made up of robbers and assassins who strangled or poisoned their victims in rituals devoted to the Hindu goddess Kali. They were alleged to employ Datura in many such poisonings, using it also to induce drowsiness or stupefaction, making strangulation easier.
Datura toxins may be ingested accidentally by consumption of honey produced by several wasp species, including Brachygastra lecheguana, during the Datura blooming season. These semi-domesticated honey wasps apparently collect Datura nectar for honey production, which can lead to poisoning.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported accidental poisoning resulting in hospitalization for a family of six who inadvertently ingested Datura used as an ingredient in stew.
In some places around the world, such as India due to the Drug & Cosmetic Act 1940 & Rule 1995,  buying, selling, or cultivating Datura plants is prohibited. Solanaceous tribes with a similar chemistry (i.e. a similar tropane alkaloid content), include the Hyoscyameae, containing such well-known toxic species as Hyoscyamus niger and  Atropa belladonna, the Solandreae containing the genus Solandra ("chalice vines") and the Mandragoreae, named for the famous Mandragora officinarum, most of which are considered traditional witches' herbs and poisons.

## Effects of ingestion

Datura is considered a deliriant. Due to the potent combination of anticholinergic substances it contains, Datura intoxication typically produces the effects of anticholinergic delirium (usually involving a complete or relative inability to differentiate reality from fantasy); bizarre thoughts, hyperthermia; tachycardia; bizarre, and possibly violent behavior; dry skin; dry mouth; illusions; and severe mydriasis (dilated pupils) with resultant painful photophobia that can last several days. Muscle stiffness, urinary retention, temporary paralysis, disrobing, emotional bluntness, dysphoria, and confusion are often reported, and pronounced amnesia is another commonly reported effect. The psychoactive alkaloids scopolamine and atropine are also both known for their characteristic hyperactive effects and ability to cause stark and dream-like hallucinations. The onset of symptoms generally occurs around 30 to 60 minutes after ingesting the herb. These symptoms generally last from 24 to 48 hours, but have been reported in some cases to last two weeks or longer.

### Treatment

Due to their agitated behavior and confused mental state, people with acute Datura poisoning or intoxication are typically hospitalized. Gastric lavage and the administration of activated charcoal can be used to reduce the stomach's absorption of the ingested material, and the drug physostigmine is used to reverse the effect of the poisons. Benzodiazepines can be given to calm the patient's agitation, and supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and symptomatic treatment is often provided. Observation of the patient is indicated until the symptoms resolve, usually from 24 to 36 hours after ingestion of the Datura.

## Psychoactive use

In Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs, Freye asserts, "Few substances have received as many severely negative recreational experience reports as has Datura." The overwhelming majority of those who describe their use of Datura find their experiences extremely unpleasant ─ both mentally and often physically. However, anthropologists have found that indigenous groups, with a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of Datura, have been known to use Datura spiritually (including the Navajo and especially the Havasupai). Adequate knowledge of Datura's properties is necessary to facilitate a safe experience. The ancient inhabitants of what became central and southern California used to ingest Datura to "commune with deities through visions". The Southern Paiute believe Datura can help locate missing objects. In ancient Mexico, Datura also played an important role in the religion of the Aztecs and the practices of their medicine men and necromancers. It was reportedly used by the Aztecs for ritual sacrifice and malevolent purposes as well. In modern-day Mexico, some Datura species are still used for sorcery and other occult practices, mostly in the southern region of Veracruz, specifically in the city of Catemaco. In Afghanistan, it was used by the Malang as a shamanic initiation rite and to contact the "other-world".
Bernardino de Sahagún, in around 1569, called attention to Datura in these words: 
"It is administered in potions in order to cause harm to those who are objects of hatred. Those who eat it have visions of fearful things. Magicians or those who wish to harm someone administer it in food or drink. This herb is medicinal and its seed is used as a remedy for gout, ground up and applied to the part affected."
Christian Rätsch has said, "A mild dosage produces medicinal and healing effects, a moderate dosage produces aphrodisiac effects, and high dosages are used for shamanic purposes". Wade Davis, an ethnobotanist, also lists it as an essential ingredient of a zombie potion in Haitian Vodou. In Western culture, the same species (Datura stramonium) has been said to have been commonly used by witches as an ingredient for their flying ointments and was regularly included in detailed recipes of magical ointments dating back as far as the early modern period, predominately in New England and Western Europe. During the anti-witchcraft hysteria of colonial times it was considered unlucky or inappropriate to grow D. stramonium in one's garden due to its supposed reputation for aiding in incantations.
