New on the market, being released just as the German NPS ban goes into place. The ban stipulates that at the N1 position, a carbonyl group can be no longer than 4 carbons. The obvious step is just to make one with 5 carbons! 

This gives us 1V-LSD, the V for Valeroyl, an alternate name for a pentanoyl group (I guess 1Pe-LSD would be more confusing and sound less flashy). No reports of consumption yet but speculations and eventual bioassays can go into this thread! I speculate it will be a similar prodrug to LSD like all of the other N1 substituted lysergamides, though this still remains to be seen (I am also an adherent to the hypothesis that LSD prodrugs aren't fully metabolized and some of the original material crosses the BBB, yielding a unique experience). What this one is like however, remains to be seen! Potentially a very exciting develpoment

The RC manufacturers do really need to step up their game. What's next? 1-Hexadecionyl-LSD?

There are many more interesting substutions (PRO-LAD, ETH-LAD, etc) that could be further explored, instead of another weak LSD-prodrug, the amide chain will be almost the size of the entire LSD molecule soon

C8-diethylamide and N6-methyl are generally accepted as the best substitutions. Hofmann made a miracle. ETH-LAD was done, was not well accepted. AL-LAD was good but weak and short lasting. All the other C8-amides are sub-optimal. Further functionalisation generally leads to inactivity.


LSD (or its prodrugs) are the vehicle in which we relive our past, present and future.

[@Gandalf-](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/122722/) idk ethlad was well received in these circles. Im

Not sure that designing drugs specifically to evade drug laws is THE way forward ... but perhaps it might make them realize the ridiculousness of it all. 


[@Nervewing](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/391837/) do you mean no shorter than 4 (if 1V is 5 Cs)? ...

Agreed, however, the 6-subs are much lower in yield and more difficult to synth than the 1-subs.

You haven't taken enough then.  I found that more is needed than LSD but at the right dose it is absolutely lovely, quite unique and strong.

How exciting! I have to admit that my heart sang a little to see the existence of 1V-LSD, and then sank back down slightly to realize it's "just" another 1-sub. Regardless, how cool is this to have a new LSD analogue in the wild?!

The sole purpose of this drug is for the people in Germany that want to experience LSD since LSD-25 is a pain in the ass because the dosages are way off. ETH-LAD and PRO-LAD are completely different.

Short acting? I've never done AL-LAD but IIRC it has a 8h+ duration.

No they aren't.


They're somewhat maybe possibly perhaps different, but definitely not "completely different". And they're definitely substitutes for each other.

I dunno I'd say the whole fractal images forming greater images rather than fractal geometric patterning does kind of set it completely apart from other lysgeramides. There is little I found about it to have in common with LSD bar the general feel I find lysgeramides to hold.

I'd rather have pro lad or pargy lad or ip-lad or anything that isn't just another pro drug for lsd. I can't really tell 1p from 1cp both of which  i have lots of, and ALD-52 too. Unless this is better for some reason I'm probably not going to bother, I never tried 1B-LSD either. I'm somewhat surprised German market is big enough to invent whole new lysergamides for.

Of all the ones I’ve tried OTHER than lsd-25, ETH-LAD is my fav. 

Visuals are nuts and if the body load is under control, it’s a great ride.


1V is now just another to try, cross it off the list!


It’d be cool if they could tinker with duration; to come up with a 4-6 hour version of a lysergamide.

Generally speaking going from a methyl to an ethyl won't make any real difference in a drug (inb4 methanol-ethanol comparisons), especially in a molecule as large as LSD. They are for all intents and purposes the same, and all "differences" should be attributed to placebo or just the standard case of trips being different each time.


I think a lot of this just comes down to people wanting there to be more psychedelics, so they attribute minor molecular differences to experiential changes.

ETH-LAD and METH-LAD (LSD) are not at all the same.  Have you tried them both?  There are similarities of course, but I challenge you to take both and find them the same.


An example of a methyl vs an ethyl making a huge difference is 2C-D vs 2C-E.  Nowhere even remotely close to the same drug.

Have you actually tried eth-lad or are you speaking purely from a theory pov?


I'm telling you as a person who has tried a lot of both lsd and eth-lad the two are distinctly different with only the general feel of a lysgeramide. Much like how all tryptamines and phenethylamines have a distinct character that all share in the class.


Beyond that the similarities end. One (lsd) produces vivid colours and geometric patterning, the other (eth-lad) produces images from your subconscious in fractal form which ultimately lead to bigger images made from a the little ones. Some minor colour changes but nothing like LSD.

I'd also say eth-lad's intense ability to cause strong nasuea at doses above 150mics every single time without fail also makes for incredibly distinct Pharmacology that departs from that of LSD.


As I've said having consumed both I find there to be little in common at all. Certainly not enough to say the two are basically the same, they really arent.

PRO-LAD I don't know about. But ETH-LAD is vastly different compared to LSD-25 and all the RC pro-drugs around. Duration wise, potency, headspace. It shares lysergamide aspects but is different.

Why exactly? It will yield you the same results as 1cP, 1P or 1B-LSD. The only thing that will be different is potency, which you won't notice because the molecular wieght probably doesn't differ that much.


The only reason to try this is to get your used substance/drug count up lol.

Yeah I agree, none of the 1-subs have been much different from one another.  Some of them seem to get slightly better ratings on average, but they're all basically identical to LSD.  I get why they're being synthed, because they keep getting banned and new ones get around this, and it allows people to sell quasi-legal LSD, plus the yields are high, but I do wish people would start exploring more novel substitutions (more 6-subs, particularly I want to see PRO-LAD).  However yields are apparently much lower than they are for LSD and the LSD 1-subs, so economically there is no incentive.  So the people producing and selling them are essentially doing it for the love of psychedelics.

Really? 1Cp feels quite a bit different from 1P for me. Less headfuck, more visual and higher euphoria. 1Cp I would eat at a festival, 1P I would not. But I rarely trip and am super sensitive to S&S , so it’s likely all

Placebo, the differences I feel

I find some differences, too, but never sure whether it's just placebo.  In any case, I find them all to basically just be LSD, except with a tendency towards different aspects of LSD, and somewhat different speeds in coming up (which could account for the differences in subjective effects, too).  But the 6-subs I've tried, AL-LAD and ETH-LAD, are substantially different to the point I am positive I could quickly identify which of the 3 (LSD, AL-LAD, and ETH-LAD) I took in a blind test.

something I have always wanted to know about the rc lsd analogs.


how the hell do they get there ergot starting material.


all the acid precursors I know of are illegal to own without license.


they would be making illegal substances to make quazi legal substances from so if there lab got done they


would be screwed I would think.

I'm almost entierly sure that's down to placebo, set and setting. And maybe difference in neuron levels in your brain. 100ug 1p-LSD at time X will feel different at time Y.

You know how hard it is to explain effects of psychedelics. ETH-LAD is roughly 1,5 times potent as LSD-25, is known to have less headspace, IIRC +-2 hours shorter, come-up almost all people get nauseas above +-200ug, known for more visuals. 200ug ETH-LAD and I couldn't see shit of the real world. CEV's I don't remember.


It shares similarities but it's obviously different. Just like how all tryptamines are different. I'd suggest reading the ETH-LAD thread on here. To my knowledge ETH-LAD is the only lysergamide that is pretty unique compared to 1p, al-lad, ald-52 etc.

ETH-LAD has substantially different visuals than LSD, very different and much more intense visuals.  It has greater bodyload.  The come-up and duration differ.  And the headspace is very mescaline-like, doesn't remind me of LSD very much in the headspace.


AL-LAD has entirely different visuals as well, and the headspace is closer to LSD, but more loopy and hilarious, and shallower.  Again I am 100% sure I could differentiate between the 3 every time once the peak hit, in a blind test where I knew it was going to be one of the three.  I can't verify that for 100% sure since I have not been part of such a test, of course.  But even to use your "inb4" example, the change from methyl to ethyl in drugs is not by any means always going to produce very little difference... ethanol to methanol is a great example.  So is 2C-D vs 2C-E.  So is amphetamine vs ethamphetamine, so is methamphetamine vs ethamphetamine.  I could go on.  DMT vs MET or DET is another example, changing just one of the methyls to an ethyl allows them to be orally active without an MAOI and changes the subjective experience quite a bit, too.

I 100% agree with Xorkoth's assessment of METH-LAD (aka LSD, I just love calling it that lol) vs ETH-LAD vs AL-LAD. They are all very distinct. Cousins, but distinct. 


AL-LAD is quite ridiculous, much shorter acting and fruity fresh than acid. The hot summer fling.


ETH-LAD is like a stick of lysergic dynamite - extremely potent, high bodyload potential, extreme psychedelia. The best bro.


LSD is the most serious and grounded of the three. Longest lasting, epic stuff. The wise old teacher. 


From me 1p-LSD vs LSD is more like twins. Personally, I can't tell the difference. I haven't explored any of the other subs on that pattern (1a, 1b, and now 1v) because I've presumed they'd all be more-or-less the same for me.

LSD vs 1P-LSD indeed lets say they are the same.


Most grounded is ALD ime way more then LSD

Thank you, that means a lot. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I am aware of the number of views on some of my older Erowid reports, kinda blows my mind.  It's funny because I joined BL when I saw that morninggloryseed posted here (RIP friend  ![♥️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2665.png)), I grew up reading his reports.  Many years later and I find myself in the same position.  Which is great because my goal is to try to reach people and make some sort of difference.

I don't understand why its so common for people to have debates about whether the lysergamides are distinguishable in a blind test, yet it's so rare for people to actually do a blind test. What's so difficult about doing a blind test? All you have to do is get one blotter of each, put them into capsules to ensure that you can't distinguish them by feel or taste, and take one at random without looking. When 1P first came out I assumed that within a few years there would be hundreds of reports of people testing it blindly against LSD.


I've done it numerous times and I can say without a doubt that LSD, 1P, and 1cP are subjectively different from each other. ALD-52 is actually close enough to LSD that I mistake them for each other.

An old PD mod (PsychaStevic) did do a blind test, had his girlfriend randomize which he took, he even included ALD-52, LSD and 1p-LSD (also AL-LAD and ETH-LAD), and was right with each one.  Of course it's just one data point.  he wrote it all up in one long report with 5 mini-reports and the results of the blind test.


I can't find the report though, BL's search engine sucks big time since the software upgrade in 2019. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


I would like to do a blind test experiment sometime but haven't ever gotten to it, as I don't trip super often these days and it's never conducive to that sort of thing when I do.  But for the sake of science I will try to do that at some point in the future.

I've seen that report. It's on Erowid. I wish he would have done more tests though to give it some real statistical significance. Obviously AL-LAD and ETH-LAD easy to tell apart so it was basically just one round of LSD vs ALD vs 1P.


I find it funny that some people are upset when a new lysergamide comes out and its a 1x-LSD. Imagine saying to someone a decade or two ago "In the future people will complain about RCs because some of them are too similar to LSD."

Here is a report from Reddit. Looks like the first published report on 1V-LSD. Sounds pretty intense!


Not sure about linking rules so I’ll quote it below.

There was the classic LSD energy and 'fluffiness' but nothing visual or mind altering. Taking into consideration that my full stomach might delay things a bit I waited for another half hour and vaporised some weed to see if this would kick things off. Sure enough the weed affected me more strongly than usual and half an hour after that I started wishing I hadn't taken any!
> > 
> > 
> >

I have a pretty good idea of what 150mcg of 1(c)P-LSD feels like and this was definitely on its way to a similar intensity, which caught me off guard and prompted some minor anxiety. The visuals started getting more pronounced. Heavy colour saturation and pattern shifting was everywhere but stayed at a manageable level. An enormous amount of energy started building up and made my hands tremble as I attempted to type down notes. The stimulation was a bit uncomfortable along with some mild nausea and stomach discomfort which could have been due to eating prior to dosing. This was suddenly a solid +++ experience!

Drank some water, jumped around a bit and even played some games in VR but it was all a bit uncomfortable and too intense.
> >

> > 
> > +5. I hadn't prepared for my trip well so I just listened to music for hours until some introspection suddenly demanded my attention. I had been laughing a lot at random internet stuff as well as at my own mental fabrications but the 1V made me aware of some repressed feelings of loneliness and pain which presented themselves like lightning strikes whenever I made associations between memories, alternating between happy, beautiful, heart breaking etc. In short moments of sadness I let my tears flow and allowed myself to be with the feeling of grief intently, without lingering too long. This is why I find LSD and its analogues to be so therapeutic sometimes. There is a ruthless directness to it. Things aren't sugar coated. It is just raw honesty. Maybe at times I felt slightly detached from my feelings and emotions whereas I might otherwise feel too identified with them, so this was useful and much needed.

I contemplated going cycling but I was too far out.

Since I had a single experience with 1B-LSD that I found disappointing in its intensity, I had low expectations for 1V-LSD and it ended up kicking my ass. The creator(s) of this compound made these blotters 150mcg with the expectation this should translate to roughly the potency of 125mcg 1(c)P-LSD. Subjectively it felt like more but that could be due to set and setting. I experienced a bit of everything and know that I still love LSD for many reasons.

I was already out of high school and was dealing rave drugs heavily at that time. After the Wamego, KS lab bust in 2000, it took a little under a year for the rest of that LSD flow to run dry. This coincided with the 9/11 Attacks on the World Trade Center in NYC, and suddenly every law enforcement budget saw a huge boom in budget. That George W. Bush / Dick Cheney /Rumsfeld & Wolfowitz era with no LSD fucking *sucked*. And it was dangerous to boot what with a sudden influx of 25X-NBOMe drugs being placed on blotter and having the unfortunate side-effect of randomly being lethal to some individuals… 


There's a good book about the strange and tragic tale of the Acid King, William Leonard Pickard called [Operation White Rabbit: LSD, the DEA, and the Fate of the Acid King](https://www.amazon.com/Operation-White-Rabbit-Fate-Acid/dp/1510745378). It came out this past October. I highly recommend it. It's a great read.

I speculate it will be a similar prodrug to LSD like all of the other N1 substituted lysergamides, though this still remains to be seen (I am also an adherent to the hypothesis that LSD prodrugs aren't fully metabolized and some of the original material crosses the BBB, yielding a unique experience). What this one is like however, remains to be seen! Potentially a very exciting develpoment

1cP-LSD is much better than 1PLSD, but was only whipped out two years ago despite having been synthesised and tested at the same time as 1P or at least years prior, when the German legislation came in banning nothing about 1PLSD except it’s import.


Major trade done via Germany, so a lot of their tact is towards keeping that avenue uninterrupted as long as possible.


They did well, it looked like 1PLSD via and from, within Germany was buried.


Out came 1cP-LSD and hurrah another two undisturbed years of business, they also supplied them with 1cP-AL-LAD, while other countries were able to just stick with regular AL-LAD.


So the same story, 2 years on, new legislation to make X compound technically and uncategorically illegal, and they have, 1V-LSD.


We can’t know how long they have had it. 1B-LSD was the only real flop.


1cP is much better than 1P, more potent per weight. But they no doubt retained 1cP in preparation for the law catching up.


Who knows what they are holding back?


It’s a shame most of all they aren’t just producing tons of ALD-52, since they stopped making it over 2 years ago due to lower yields and bigger costs.


I was glad to get some but in hindsight, I’d have gotten a tonne at the time.


1V-LSD is laid at 150 ug, they say 100 ug of 1cP-LSD is about equipotent to 120 ug 1V-LSD.


Which they say may be slightly more visual too. So the new blotters will likely be stronger, per tab.


Don’t knock it til you try it they say lol.


(although, I knocked 1B-LSD, I had the wisdom to see it wasn’t worth trying with way better alternatives).

Yeah that's talked about quite a bit throughout *Operation White Rabbit*. You definitely should read this book, man, just if for no other reason than to sort of give context to *Rose of Peracelsus*. I think what I found really interesting about *Operation White Rabbit* is that Dennis McDougal really calls Leonard Pickard out on some of his blatant bullshit, not the least of which is laid on heavy-handedly throughout his own prison-life-paced tome no doubt painstakingly typed out in the prison library of the United States Penitentiary Bumblefuck… poor guy. Don't know why he got so deeply involved with that rat fink piece of shit Gordon Todd Skinner, though. I'm glad he was let out of federal prison though recently after serving two long decades.

That ALD-52 thing was later proven to be false, he admitted he just said that to try to get out of trouble.  However I have also read that they were synthing analogues, but not  distributing on a wide scale.


Back in the day when the drought happened, the common lore was that the LSD synth was so complex that only a few people in the world had the skill to pull it off.  In reality, it's just that the precursors were so highly controlled, and the global supply had been so reliant on one team making almost all of it.  Since then, clearly the precursors have become more available, and/or some alternative synth routes were found.  Not sure which.  The global distribution network just needed some time to regroup and recover.

Agreed. It felt like 1P-LSD was too pushy and I didn't always like where it went with my headspace; whereas I find 1cP-LSD to be pleasant, friendly, super clean and clear, and virtually indistinguishable from top grade LSD like so-called “Fluff”, “Needlepoint”, “Cream”, etc. Maybe this is because 1cP-LSD purportedly acts as a prodrug to LSD, but Idk, I don't feel I could tell them apart in a double-blind study. Who knows? It's definitely kick-ass stuff and I preferred it very much over the pushiness of the 1P-LSD high. 


But goddamn, for any of the lysergamides in show business these days, LSD is a tough act to follow when you consider it's broad appeal, longevity in the drug scene, potency, and relatively forgiving safety profile (in terms of its LD50 & overdosing).

Yeah 1p is definitely different, I really don't care what anyone says, this discussion has been had many times but I swear I can pick the 1p out pretty easily, for sure much more pushy, physically and mentally, even on low doses my muscles get really tense,. Haven't taken it for 3 years though

Well firstly, my point was just that from a much earlier era, clandestine chemists had already been at least *thinking* of lysergamide analogs and such. The proving came down to the prosecution stating that the only known way (at that time) to produce ALD-52 was via using LSD-25 as an intermediate. And also since ALD-52 is a prodrug to LSD-25, this was functionally the same thing and therefore illegal. This was before the Federal Analog Act of course, but regardless the jury sided with the government and found the defendants guilty.

Just that he was talking about ALD-52 gave me a glimmer of hope that there would be a cool Pantheon, if you will, of lysergamide drug gods… Took a while, but lemme just say: *goddamn I love RCs. *

“Were”? It's still very, very difficult to obtain a nice chunk of clean ergotamine tartrate, the precursor of preference for most LSD producers. (EDIT: also diethylamine is not easy to procure. Nor Lyergic acid for that matter.)

So that ended up being a little untrue, fabricated somewhere between initial arresting officers and the press. The total seizure was not as large as was first reported. However, there is not a doubt in my mind that it knocked the LSD hustle off the rails for quite a few years. Also, the band Phish stopped touring and were on hiatus around this time, and I think in the U.S., at least, that made some impact on the flow of LSD.

I'm not really either. I mean, it's technically possible to cultivate one's own ergot by first sampling a little, then allowing it to grow in a larger substrate material before mixing this in with distilled water and misting the heads of rye grain with this ergot-infested water. There's about a two to three week window in the autumn time when it will bloom the best, so if you time it just right, you can fill up giant 55 gallon drums with the ergot fungus you just cultivated and grew… Obviously the site prohibits going into details, so to sum it up and make a point: ergotamine tartrate can be derived from this ergot in the right hands with the right methods and equipment. Where there's a will, there's a way.

Yes, and there were a lot of power struggles just after that bust as methamphetamine manufacture began to take off in Mexico and production shifted in the U.S. from domestic to import… this changed some of the distribution networks…

Also just wanted to add: the difficulty isn't for the chemist in a properly equipped lab. The difficulty is for the clandestine chemist to adequately create facsimile of same environment, replete with being sealed off from light and conducted under low-energy red lights, having a proper rotovap so solvents can be removed quickly and virtually without heat, and you'll need a tank of nitrogen to blow an inert atmosphere over top the initial reaction… It really gets tricky to do this surreptitiously, so it's not for no reason LSD is the Holy Grail of clandestine chemistry.

Yes, it's really remarkable how perfect a drug LSD is in a lot of respects, and how it happened to show up as basically the very first psychedelic RC. Its quality of being nearly the most potent (per mass) psychoactive drug, but with this built in safety-valve of not really being possible to overdose in any physically harmful way, makes it unusually perfect as a clandestine, underground mind-expanding drug. Dead easy to transport and distribute, not going to get anyone into tooooo much trouble if they take too much (most of the time.. obviously people can fuck themselves up with it, but it's no where close to as dangerous as nearly any other drug).


Combined with all kinds of coincidences around its arrival in the world, it's hard not to become a little superstitious about it.

It was certainly an event of great serendipity, which was also accidental.  The stuff of legends. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  On the other hand, if you think about it, so much of life is that way.  The n8mber of accidental random seemingly innocuous events that happen that end up radically altering the course of the rest of your life, and other peoples' lives, it really mind-blowing when you start to think about it.  Especially when you think about all the random stuff from before you were born that is the only reason you exist... ever since the beginning of time, really.  A butterfly flaps its wings, and all that.  The world and our lives all turn on chance encounters.

Butterfly wings indeed... One of the big coincidences that I like to think about is how it was discovered as psychoactive right in the middle of the Manhattan project, and leaked out into the world in parallel to nuclear brinkmanship and the cold war, and ended up becoming deeply intertwined and fuelling of the antiwar movement.


Now to get a little more tinfoil hat - It's probable that JFK took LSD, and I find it easy to imagine how this could have played a role in de-escalating nuclear tensions when he was surrounded by military hawks urging him to nuke USSR before they nuked the US. This is all very speculative and fanciful, but it really could have been a direct agent for peace that helped avert global nuclear war.

What about the reality in which Dr. Albert Hoffman settled on ALD-52 or 1V-LSD as the compound he dreamt about for five years in Switzerland during the second World War? What if that 1V-LSD had been the star lysergamide of the psychedelic revolution?

Interesting to imagine.. they seem like they'd be so similar to LSD that it would play out basically the same on average (depending on if and how much free will exists, you might have to rerun the simulation a bunch of times and take the average), OTOH given the butterfly wings idea, perhaps this subtlest difference would have far-reaching outcomes.

YES!  My +4 experience I had on 2C-E back in late 2005 showed me that similarly to how time is the 4th dimension and is composed of infinite snapshots, or slices, of one configuration of the 3 dimensional space in a moment in time, and when stacked together as a graph using time as the 4th dimensional axis, they form the spacetime continuum... similarly to that, the 5th dimension is the probability dimension.  Each entire spacetime continuum from the beginning to the end of time is a slice of the 5th dimension, but fixed.  The axis of the 5th dimension, the infinite slices of 4th dimensional spaces, contains the entirety of all possible configurations of the entirety of history/time/space, where events unfolded in a specific way.  Moving along the 5th dimensional axis gets you into realities where things were done differently, different choices were made, different random events ended up differently.  Together as a whole theyt make up all possible configurations of the entirety of space and time.  By choosing to turn left instead of right, you are moving through frames of the dimension of probability.


Or at least that's what I was seeing and experiencing on 3C-E that time.


I got the ideas originally from the book *Flatland*  by Edwin Abbott.  Really fantastic and interesting book if you've never read it.

I think you mean 2C-E here? Although [its alpha-methylated analog exists](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3C-E) as I'm sure you know. The third carbon in reference is at the *alpha *position, so it's kind of the amphetamine version of Mescalin-analog, Escalin. This *should* potentiate it quite a bit while extending its duration compared to its 2C cousin. The truth is though that 2C-E is quite an order of magnitude more potent than 3C-E. It's no wonder fixed onto that magical 2,5-dimethoxy-4-[  X  ]-phenethylamine structure where you just fill-in-the-blank for X with different atoms, molecules and moieties until you find something you like…

Yes I've read it. I was always distracted by the notion that in a two-dimensional world, no one can have a fully functioning digestive tract without being completely bifurcated down the middle by it… Nevertheless it's a nifty metaphor for us to try and imagine a fourth spatial dimension. I like the take on **Pointland** from that in which the point—sole inhabitant, king and universe in one—perceives communication as [thoughts originating in his own mind](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Flatland_(first_edition)/Other_Worlds):

Huh that's not good.  Is that stimulant substance ultra potent?  If not then there is no way enough dose could be on there to have an effect.  I mean people seem to be reporting LSD-like effects, too (I think, or I might be thinking of one of the other now-large collection of 1-subs I haven't bothered to try).  Wonder if someone got a dusting of that stim on there by accident, and the unknown substance is 1V-LSD (or another 1-sub lysergamide)?  I know when I sent some really rare things out to Energy Control, they were unable to verify what it was since they didn't have a reference sample.

No, it's not ultrapotent. It's probably a negligable amount, but the interesting thing is that they didn't detect any 1V-LSD. I have had over 50 substances lab-tested by Checkit, including a few novel lysergamides and they were always able to qualitatively determine the substance. I had 1B-LSD and MiPLA tested one week after they were publically released (their head-chemist even asked me if the 1B- was a joke lol) and the results were 1B-LSD (n.q) and MiPLA (n.q.) respectively. I don't see why it would be any different with 1V-LSD. 

I will shoot them a message and ask them if they already have 1V-LSD in their database. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Could the presence of the a-D2PV have overwhelmed the reading so that 1V-LSD would have not been measurable? I assume that's not how it works, otherwise the cellulose chemicals in the paper would do the same.

No, I don‘t think this is the case. ChEcKiT has one of the most sophisticated drug-testing setups in the world rn. They are capable of detecting fentanyl analogues in the ng range with their MALDI-HR-MS thingy and have consistently tested novel lysergamides the last couple of years. They were the first (and only, I think) drug-checking lab able to quantify the famous 1P-LSD micropellets.

I see, that's cool.  When I sent mine in they weren't able to tell but they must have used an inferior method, I guess.  It was free testing as a reward for participating in a study and I get the sense they weren't willing to do the full analysis for free as some of the results left something to he desired.  Though I did successfully identify some extreme rarities I have such as DOF, DOiP, and DOPr, which was great since I know for 100% sure that they are the real thing now.

If something came up as unknown that means they cannot test for everything. It seems as likely "unknown" is 1v-lsd as anything else. Its tasteless, active and I assume its "acidty" (i haven't done it). It sounds like cross contamination to me, why add an inactive microdose to something? This happened with al-lad too, same testing place as well, in 2018 with some cannabinoid, and general consensus here was cross contamination.

Cross contamination is very likely in your example as there were multiple, unrelated substances detected, but also AL-LAD.

I am fairly certain, like I mentioned above, that the unknown substance is not 1V-LSD. I already wrote them a mail and waiting for confirmation but Checkit has never failed to analyze a substance qualitatively they were actively looking for, also not with novel and extremely new lysergamides.


The amount of a-D2PV on a blotter is probably negligible for the consumer, but it still is the only known, active component of it. I rather think, this is an example of a botched 1V-LSD synthesis. The alpha-D2PV was maybe used as a catalyst in the synthesis of the 1V-LSD, or to prepare a chiral agent and it just wasn’t washed out properly afterwards. My guess is, the unknown substance is either a 1V-LSD stereoisomer or another byproduct.


Edit: Also it wasnt tested by the same lab. Checkit has a far superior setup than MDA Basecamp.

Edit 2: Grammar

Alright, ChEcKiT got back to me. This sample was handed in as crystalline “1V-LSD” powder and not on a blotter, so it could be absolutely anything.

ChEcKiT also confirmed me that they already have 1V-LSD in their database and that the unknown substance is without a doubt not 1V-LSD.

Curious, drugsdata requires ~20-50 mg samples.. Im assuming checkit would be about the same?

Thats like 2-500 doses if my math is on

They require 15-20mg, but yeah it‘s very odd. 150-300 common doses for one lab-analysis would be an expensive affair. I have also never seen powdered 1V-LSD for sale anywhere, but I imagine you could do a custom order for bulk.

I would guess that's due to handling. nobody wants to handle a mg or less of powder I think. all the labs do analysis of blotter paper as well, so I'd say put a small mg sample into a solution and put it onto blotter, cigarette paper or whatever and send it in like that if you wanted to get crystalline lysergamides analyzed.

Agreed. Thats why this seems kinda suspect to me. 

IT must have been one of the sellers/resellers, maybe someone who bought bulk, or perhaps something sinister... dun dun dun

Has anyone cared to calculate potency? Assuming it's a prodrug, it's a heavier molecule with the same effect. I guess i could do the calculations but it would take a while given my basic chemistry knowledge and skill. I figured i may be so rude as to ask for this info in case anyone already has it.

There isn't really a way to calculate its potency. 100µg of 1v-LSD hemi tartrate is the molar equivalent of 83µg LSD hemi tartrate, but the potency also depends on bioavailability and rate of metabolism, and there's no way to accurately predict that.

Most of us would agree al lad and Eth lad feel much different than lsd


1v lsd is smooth, a little more gentle, and otherwise similar to lsd. the head space isn't as crazy. its long lasting and good visuals. 


ordering from Germany while a little expensive isn't crazy and has a nearly 99% success rate compared to NL going through customs.


1v is worth trying. Its a great substitute if you can't find real lsd. it's agreed that 150ug is equal to 100ug lsd.

Pulled the trigger and bought 25 hits of 150ug 1V-LSD. 


For the same price I can get 50 hits of LSD but considering most street LSD is 50-80ug? I am basically paying the exact same amount at the end of the day. 


Most of us have found 1V to be different than typical LSD. Gentle with more visuals so it will be nice to have.


Also I want to say I despise gel tabs. I went on a limb and bought 50 gel tabs that were '350ug' LOL. I bought them because a lot of friends said it was literally the best LSD they've ever had. I guess I got a bad batch because it was half the potency of any paper ive ever had, and i paid 50% more for it. Honestly ive always had lackluster experiences with geltabs while paper always blew me away. Rant over. 


Would love to try AL LAD but the one site I know is not processing payments right now.

I like the intention here, but psychedelics are not for everyone (Most people with schizophrenia and/or psychosis react poorly to them and can often have their psychotic symptoms permanently worsened) and some have prejudices against it that are difficult to change if we are so overt about our use of psychedelics.


I like to show people the episode that the Netflix documentary 'The Mind Explained' did on the medicinal use of psychedelics as a starting point. Hamilton Morris's most recent JRE appearance also had some great excerpts regarding the War on Drugs and psychedelic use amongst many other important topics.

What's crazy is after reading much of this thread I've never even heard of some of these lysergamides. Pro-lad? 1ce? 1V? LSZ? After looking around I could only see the basics. 1p, al-lad ald-52 and eth-lad. If I could ask what could possibly be better then eth-lad? That was by far the best I'd experienced. Ibhad no grunge afterwards. Nothing but a truly incredible avatar like world of colors man! I've also never tried lsa but I'm sure it would be a similar experience to 1p correct?

Nah, LSA sucks quite frankly. 1P-LSD is a pro-drug to LSD, either in part or in whole, same as virtually any of the 1-substituted LSD analogues/homologues out there (1-Br-LSD, 1-cP-LSD, ALD-52 (aka: 1-acetyl-LSD), 1V-LSD, etc., basically 1x-LSDs, but anecdotally it seems there are some subtle differences in effects between these). Meanwhile ETH-LAD has substitutions at the 6-position, changing the effects of the parent compound, LSD, in generally positive ways, or at least qualitatively preferable ways. 


Between LSA and LSD, the diethylamide functional group has some bearing on the final qualitative effects of the drug. The same holds true for a comparison between 1P-LSD and LSA, so why would you speculate the effects would be similar?

I just want to say that 1V LSD is absolutely lovely.


It is very smooth and calm, euphoric, visual with a lot of blues, purples, and greens. Bright vibrant almost neon colors, akin but different to LSD visuals in the color department.


 Zero of the thought loops of LSD yet still stimulating in a mental way. Does not have the typical LSD crash and tweaked out feeling after a long hard trip. Came down gently.


This chemical has a special place in my heart. Its called Valerie because of its structure but also because researchers noted a particular friendly female 'entity' or precense while on the drug. I have yet to experience this but I have not gone beyond 150mcg. Will explore 300mcg soon.


The blotter also come in 225mcg which may be a perfect dose!


Regular LSD is very special to me, even though it has causes some very difficult and terrorizing trips it has healed me a lot and made me face a lot of fears. It is in my top 5 favorite drugs. I have found Valerie or 1V LSD to hold the exact same position in how fond I am of it.


Its really nice to trip without having to worry about speediness or being mind fucked so hard. There is still a psychedelic heads pace it is just more gentle is all. I find it to be so beautiful.


Duration may be slightly shorter or equal to LSD.


There is slightly more tummy twirls and nausea but its nothing crazy.


They are already proposing a ban for this chemical and many believe it will be banned by June or July. If it goes the way of the other analogues then its definitely true.


If able to, I would tell you to definitely buy a 100 sheet or two to have a supply. I am.


I could not imagine in 5 or 10 years not being able to use this drug(medicine). I would be heart broken.


This is only in Germany though so chances are it will still be available through Netherlands like 1cp lsd and 1p lsd still are. Still im not taking the risk.


Let be honest here, 95% of people would absolutely be fine and most likely have life changing trips if they used psychedelics. Schiz or on antidepressants and you are in the unfortunate minority otherwise i fully agree spread the word and let's heal the world with psychedelics. They are the way forward I believe it with all my heart, esp sacred plants.

The nickname ‘Valerie’ is derived from segments of the most significant chemical groups described in the chemical name 1-**VAL**eroyl-lys**ER**gic acid d**IE**thylamide. Several participants of our research group also noted the presence of a ‘female entity’ whilst researching this compound. Hence we feel the name Valerie is apt!


1V-LSD is [homologous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(chemistry)) to 1P-LSD, containing a valeroyl group bound to the indole nitrogen instead of a propionyl group. Due to the high lipophilicity of the valeroyl group there is now a great opportunity to study the potentially unique pharmacokinetic properties of this novel compound.


1V-LSD is a [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lsd) and an analogue of 1P-LSD. Since it is a prodrug, it shares many similar properties with LSD itself but also [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1p-lsd), [1cP-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1cP-LSD) and [1B-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1B-LSD). However, Valerie also has some distinguishing features including increased visual effects compared to 1cP-LSD and 1P-LSD, as reported by our research group.

I know that. I only meant the second part of your quote: *also because researchers noted a particular friendly female 'entity' or precense while on the drug. *Says who*?*


Maybe it's because 1V-LSD was given that (IMO silly) nickname for marketing purposes that more suggestible people have convinced themselves that there's a "female entity" attached to it? Personally I've never had any consistent "entity contact" on a lysergamide, but feel free to chime in with your experiences.


EDIT: lmao it's directly lifted from the supplier's description (or should I say press release?) Absolutely ridiculous.

I agree, [@blistersinthedark](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/305852/). I appreciate everything you’re saying [@Skippwiggins](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/377906/), and we share the same passion for LSD – defs in my top 5 as well – but I’d be lying if I said I could distinguish any of the 1-substituted LSD analogues from any particular batch of LSD, which themselves seem to vary in qualitative effects from batch to batch, sometimes seemingly from dose to dose. It’s entirely too possible that it’s just all in my head according to my expectations. The most likely thing that happens is that 1-subbed LSD analogues might differ in their onset owing to the fact the substituted moiety must be removed by our metabolism in order for the drug to cross the BBB. Of course I don’t know that for sure just yet, but it’s an educated guess. 


This mirrors to some extent the pro-drug family of 4-acetoxy-tryptamines, like 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-MET, 4-AcO-EPT, etc., and the debate as to whether 4-AcO-xT differs qualitatively from 4-HO-xT. For example, personally I cannot distinguish 4-HO-MET from 4-AcO-MET. 


It’s sort of akin to how [wine-tasting is a complete crock of shit, and the so-called experts are some fake-ass, self-deceiving jokers](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/08/the_most_infamous_study_on_wine_tasting.html). When they dyed white wine red during a study, wine-tasting “experts” couldn’t even distinguish red wine from white wine, let alone, say, a cabernet from a merlot. Similarly, I doubt most weed-smokers could easily distinguish *Cannabis sativa* from *C. sativa indica, *but at least here there can be a significant difference in cannabinoid and terpene profile, so I could be wrong here.


I think I’m gonna start some informal experiments in which I see how easily I can delineate the effects of closely related psychedelics.

Ann shulgin and I would both agree that every drug has some sort of chemical spirit. Ive definitely felt the energy of entities on LSD that was much different than anything on mushrooms or DMT. Id bet a lot of other long time trippers would say the same. However that is probably different than feeling some kind of chemical spirit or entity itself.  Marketing or not, the drug sells itself, and it being called Valerie does not distinguish it by much. Valerie, Lucy, sassy? aye. Im paying double for this than normal high quality LSD and its definitely worth it to me. The short duration  is a major bummer though. it also doesn't have as much stimulation which I both like and dislike.


After using it quite a bit I'm quite fond of the name Valerie now. it adds to the fun imo.


BS or not im gonna up the dose to 300-450 and see if I can find out!

To an atheist, this sounds like forced spiritualist, new age, hackneyed snake oil babble (not that I agree, just saying). So perhaps it’s best to just see it like what some people experience as spirits or energy entities, others experience as just non-paranormal (normal?) qualitative phenomena regarding their mood and the impression the drug gives them, subjectively speaking. In other words, a rose is a rose by any other name, right? We’re speaking about the same thing. Having a little backstory “legend”, whether real or imagined, is kind of a fun, harmless myth that the skeptical among us will always know to question.

These are good points. Valerie kind gives it a sort of 80s throwback vibe that’s super on-trend right now.

At that level, I would imagine the effects do become pretty indistinguishable from LSD as whatever percent of the molecule is metabolized, at that dose it should be a sufficiently strong dose of LSD regardless. I imagine you might get better bioavailability from swallowing your tabs instead of taking them sublingually, if that’s what you do, owing to increasing the exposure of the drug to first-pass metabolism (I’m assuming this is where the conversion happens; am I wrong?).

The legend definitely adds some fun to it. 


I feel theres some people who Can't distinguish it from LSD and some who can feel clear distinctions. We took 300mcg yesterday and it definitely felt different to both my wife and I. It was a great experience I absolutely loved it.


Nobody really knows what their tabs contain. Most people will brag that they are 200mcg or even 300mcg when in my experience most tabs are 50-100mcg. The ones I get are pretty strong, most likely on the upper range. 2-3 tabs causing some very intense visuals and quite a long experience, 3 usually rendering us rolling on the floor for a while.  For double the price I can get 225mcg 1V LSD, which by most reports is equivalent to 165mcg of LSD, so to me it evens out. Plus its just fun to try new psychedelics that is the part I love most. 


Reddit has a 1V sub forum with 2.5k people with hundreds of reports, most are consistent with the effects I mentioned. It seems its mostly people who no longer have access to normal LSD anymore or people in Europe who want a legal alternative. 


I will try 1p and 1cplsd next and see how those are, out of curiosity. 1cp definitely seems more desirable though. I have a feeling though I won't enjoy them as much as 1V though! fun lighthearted lysergamide.

That's nice that you *feel* that way, but I'm interested in, and persuaded by, **cold, hard facts** from **measurable data** in a **repeatable experiment**. I suspect a large portion of **what users think is novel lysergamide activity is actually just placebo effects** laid on top of this LSD pro-drug. Here's a challenge: take 20 trips; have your wife flip a coin (away from your view) each time before you trip; heads = you're given LSD; tails = you're given 1V-LSD, but of course you're not told which one you're getting. I know it's not much data, but I'm curious how accurate you would be in attempting to guess which one you'd been given solely by its effects.

So if 225 µg 1V-LSD is equivalent to 165 µg LSD, then **300 µg 1V-LSD should be equivalent to 200 µg LSD**. That's about the upper limit of LSD I'll take if I'm going out. Otherwise, set & setting become too critical.

The chemist who laid the blotter certainly should know, more or less. Also, there was a group a few years back called something like the darknet (market?) avengers, and they would chromatographically test tabs of LSD being sold on the DNMs in order to uncover the vendors who were lying about the strength of their doses, whether knowingly or not. Most people's blotters contained fewer µgs per hit than was advertised. Some were accurate, but there were a few who had more than twice the LSD per hit than was claimed. Also, sheets are sometimes unevenly laid depending on technique used and how the sheet dries.

Yeah but unless you quantified those amounts through HPLC or GC-MS or something like this, I believe you're just guessing at this "50-100mcg" you claim. Sounds dubious.

I disagree with your assessment. I'd say ~half the people who post on that sub say the same thing I do – that LSD and its 1-substituted analogues are virtually indistinguishable in qualitative effects, probably b/c they're **pro-drugs to LSD**. 

Also do note: **Germany is slated to outlaw 1V-LSD this coming Jun**e of 2022.

I've done all of these LSD pro-drug compounds. I honestly cannot tell them apart; they're just all like really clean, well made LSD. Throw ALD-52 (aka: 1A-LSD, 1-acetyl-LSD) into this group as well as 1B-LSD.

See so right here you're already** setting your expectations **and instructing your own nervous system on how to respond to these compounds before you've even tried them.

To go back to "Valerie", I take issue with needless nicknames being given to drugs to make them more appealing because it only services to obscure their nature as novel RCs (as benign though the 1-substituted LSD analogs may be) and ultimately can only lead to confusion among users who aren't necessarily well-informed, namely those who procure their drugs from real-life acquaintances. How hard is it to learn "1V-LSD"? Even that is a trivial name.


Maybe calling 1V-LSD "Valerie" is among the more benign examples of this, but giving a substance a cute nickname and making up some bullshit new-age lore about it is about as helpful as calling 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT "Moxy" and "Foxy" (I can never remember which is which because the nomenclature is utter bollocks!) or 3-MeO-PCP "meow" (do people also call 3-MeO-PCE that?) or whatever. Can't we just call a spade a spade? This is a harm reduction forum after all. And it looks like 1V-LSD tabs don't even have the name of the molecule printed on them. This is a step backwards IMO.


Besides, there already is a whole category of [chemicals derived from valerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerian_(herb)#Biochemical_composition) which have similar-sounding names.


Sorry, this pisses me off! If the  name had come from users themselves I would just be mildly annoyed at the phenomenon, but this is the maker/supplier of yet another entry in a chain of LSD analogues with increasingly heavy substitutions actively telling people to call their product that as a marketing ploy and I think we need to push back against it.

Ok, fair points, kind of hard to argue against, except how far should one take that concept? As you pointed out, “1V-LSD” is fairly arbitrary to begin with? I wouldn't expect people to use each chemicals' [IUPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry) name, but that's the most unambiguous name one could pick, the entire point of the [IUPAC nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry). And I also figure, if a more generalised naming practice was okay with people like Dr. David Nichols, and the late Dr.'s Albert Hofman the Alexander Shulgin, I can live with it, ya know?


Plus that knife cuts both ways – I think the popularity of MDMA began to skyrocket when people relabeled the drug “Molly” and/or “Mandy”, which sounds far less salacious than “ecstasy”, a decadent- and depraved-sounding term to society's more prudish types. The word practically *wants* to rhyme with “sextasy.” Fewer people are afraid of a drug with a harmless name like “Molly” whereas if you use a drug called “ecstasy” you might sort of assume there's no free lunches in this world and there's a terrible price to pay for feeling “ecstasy” apropos of nothing more than swallowing a pill or powder. Whether it's true isn't important, perception is the key thing. Since the crack epidemic of the 80s and 90s, for example, the reputation of cocaine—even “crack cocaine”—has significantly improved, even US Federal law has relaxed on its former 100-to-1 statues from the Reagan administration. Now meth and heroin/fentanyl have the Draconian sentencing. 


The federal mandatory minimums on methamphetamine are insane. Just 5 grams fetches a mandatory minimum of 10 years for someone with a prior felony, and 5 years for a first-timer, while 50 grams of pure meth doubles those sentences to 20 and 10 years, respectively. Compared to cocaine, the same mandatory minimums have a threshold of 500 grams of powder cocaine and I think 85 grams of “crack” or freebase cocaine. Talk about arbitrary.


But back to Valerie, you're not really upset about a drug named after a Steve Winwood song, are you? Lol, it's a good point though – I've loathed the inconsistent application of “molly” for some time, and the hack bullshit drug going around called "Tusibi"—pronounced "2C-B" despite containing no 2C-B (as in 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromo-phenethylamine) but rather usually MDMA, caffeine, and ketamine and usually dyed pink—that shit is very unhelpful and annoying. I guess in the grand scheme of things you have to sort of pick & choose your battles, ya know?

There's a fine line between being disillusioned and being jaded. I'd like to think that isn't true for me personally, and believe me, I still love LSD and will, and do, still take any of these analogs, homologs, or whatever is technically the correct term. If nothing else, the LSD that winds up crossing the blood brain barrier is typically very fine, pure LSD once it's converted in the body, in my speculation. Furthering this conjecture, my guess is this seeming purity (based on subjective experience) is due to its careful manufacture in a professional, well equipped lab, given the general complexity and delicacy of the molecule and its precursors. In a clandestine setting, LSD production is notoriously difficult, particularly regarding the safe procurement of the necessary precursors and specific equipment such as a rotovap and light-sealed lab lit only by a dark-room, red light bulb, that kinda shit. Plus the need for column chromatography to separate the three various enantiomeric impurities (nor-LSD, lumi-LSD, and iso-LSD) from the one that's active. I don't believe it's commonly encountered in clandestine settings, but I could be wrong, and this is all just guesswork. 


And what do I know? You could be right and there is an “entourage effect” between LSD and possibly one or more of these enantiomers, analogues, homologs, etc. Can't really rule anything out without the data from some reputable researchers, preferably across multiple studies.

I don't think these sell to well?


I ordered 10 to test and the dude sent me 25. That's 15 for free worth 90 euro's.

There were 2 tabs missing on the cp-lsd order though.

Nice!


I think i have the same tabs. Took a half tab last time, 75ug, and that was a proper trip for me. It was even overwhelming for my partner. 


I'm gonna try 1/4th tab or slightly more than that next time. I won't be looking for a microdose. To me there's a low recreational sweetspot which basically works like a better version of stimulants and what people seek in stimulants. The mood and self-confidence is boosted, everything has an edge of profundity, conversation is greatly enhanced. Pretty much any recreational and spare-time activity is doable. Not quite a trip but still more intense and somehow complex than most other types of drug effects.


I don't know if i could tell the difference vs normal LSD. As usual, my life and psychophysical status as well as dosage matter a lot more than the substance of choice.

yes that's the level I like most, jacked and profound, both happy alone, and people find me fun too. I just wish I was not the driver in the family. but I get to fly low often enough, no real complaints.

With no tolerance I get very speedy effects on a 20ug micro dose.


I tried 300ug last night and see why they call it valery.


Nice clean trip just I prefer 1-cp-lsd subtle differences between the two of them.

The purple colours were prominent though.

I'm about to try this one at 300ug and I'm pretty stoked....if it's great I'm just buying a sheet immediately lol.

Will definitely report back ....it sounds like I'm either going to fall in love with this one or write it off completely....

Me too. To be frank, it's uncomfortable and I see it like: since I'm experiencing the anxiogenesis, I might as well get a more satisfying trip, ya know? Otherwise it feels like an annoying waste of LSD. Instead: Macro-dose that shit, son!

**What are your thoughts on ALD-52**, aka 1-acetyl-LSD?


I've had LSD, 1cP-LSD, 1P-LSD, ETH-LAD, LSA, 1P-ETH-LAD, PRO-LAD, 1V-LSD, ALD-52, AL-LAD, and PARGY-LAD as far as lysergamides go. Though this has been over the years, and with a few of them I have only two or three trips under my belt, so it's tough recalling and attempting to delineate between their effects sometimes. However, I've tripped *dozens *of times on a few of them, to wit: 1cP-LSD, ETH-LAD, and ALD-52, and I consistently seem to recognize some of their traits, though I concede that I can't be sure this isn't either placebo or that a trait isn't simply inherent to the particular batch / synthesis, skill, and technique used to produce the batch I happen to have received. 


And then LSD I've probs dosed a couple hundred times in my life, possibly more… LSD and I became close friends when I was ~15 yrs old, dropping acid alone on random school nights so I could stay up all night tripping with my headphones plugged into a 1970s Marantz tube amplifier and a CD player (this was the 90s). I'd trip in the dark all night and listen super intently to albums and artists I like. 


The point is: I've tripped a lot, and the fact that my mind experiences consistent, subjective differences from batch to batch is fascinating no matter what causes it: placebo, entourage effect, or something else still.

This one is absolutely extraordinary imho....

Only ended up taking 150ug but still tripped quite hard ....my tripping partner did not feel nearly as much as me but she's a psychedelic hard head and well known for it.

Very very sooth , very very VERY clear headed and quite euphoric!

Watched the very weird movie "MEN"(A24 productions -Alex Garland) which i thought was absolutely brilliant!!

"Then watched the south park streaming wars special" We ended up just having some if the most extraordinary sex weve ever had ....just incredible!!!

Still up 24 hours later and despite having dropped acid and stating up all night I feel absolutely awesome this morning....this is the only Lysergamide that has given me such an incredible afterglow....I think  BLOWS 1CP-LSD out of the water....1V-LSD is absolutely next level....visuals were particularly gorgeous and reminded me a lot of 4-aco-met visuals at certain points.

In my experience stock up on this one before it's gone fir good which will be soon.

YMMV

Also....I found this one FAR less stimulating than 1cP-LSD (I pretty much get muscle tremors on that stuff like I have temporary Parkinsons)

This had very minimal tremor....hardly even noticed and I was able to channel that into tremendous sexual energy.

I'm honestly just really shocked at myself at how utterly fantastic I feel this morning after dropping 1V-LSD.

Honestly feeling very unusually extremely euphoric and in a tremendously awesome mood ....almost feeling rather hypomanic!!!

No idea if anyone else is going to have this type of experience but I certainly did!!![😅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f605.png)

No, I get why the nickname in terms of the 1-valeroyl substitution coupled with the significance of "er" from "lyergic" itself from ("ergot") and of course the "ie" from the diethylamine moiety. But the "female entity" phenomenon is interesting. Here's a question: did you come to this conclusion regarding the female entity *before* or *after* you knew about the research groups findings? If before, do you think it's possible that you might've been influenced by this and were "looking for" said female presence? Humans are really good at finding what we seek even when it's not really there. 


It's kind of like Terence McKenna's thing about testing a group of people who had never heard anything about DMT before and letting them try DMT and mostly preparing them for what will happen, letting them know about hyperspace and ego death, but never mentioning any machine elves or other entities commonly reported, and then seeing if they come to the same conclusion of elves after experiencing DMT. I.e.: is the “machine elf experience” learned and subconsciously mimicked or innate to the experience? I wonder.

I was aware of it before but I didn't think about it for ages.

Only when I was tripping that it popped up as in it went a tiny bit the feminine way.

You could argue I was influenced by it.

I know what you mean by 'placebo' effect.


I'll see the next time I trip on it.


It is called valery anyways as in I didn't have to read the feminine entity.

My two cents.


I find 2 tabs of 1P-LSD a wonderful combination for a day at the beach with a girlfriend and a portable speaker. I like the fact that 2 hits manifest themselves in 25 minutes, but neither overpower me, nor  provide an unpleasant amount of electric body load. I never had negative feelings on it. It is this positivity and lack of overload that make it superior to other forms of acid that I tried.  For me it lasts for 10 hours.


Unlike 1P-LSD, ALD-52 once made me feel insecure. (I've only taken it twice)


I felt positively poisoned by 1 tab of ETH-LAD, almost like with 25N-NBOMe (which at the time left me wondering why this substance was ever created). Enough so, that I immediately threw away the other 8 tabs, as I would never share with anyone something that made me feel bad.


The first time I took AL-LAD when it just became available and over twenty years after I tried LSD-25, it made me sob when I turned on Alegria (by Cirque du Soleil. I absolutely didn't expect it. I first took one tab and waited for an hour and a halve without any results. Then I took a second tab and quickly felt overpowered. There was this uncomfortable electric body load, not quite as bad, but similar to the one I felt the first time I tried a 24 mg oral doze of 2C-I. And then out of curiosity, I turn on Alegria... People say that it is more visual than other analogues. I don't know about that. Maybe.

I tried it several times by itself - one tab was never useful, two tabs were uncomfortable. But I found it quite good when a single tab of it was used together with 1 tab of 1P-LSD.


I tried 1-cP-LSD a year or so ago. The come up was surprisingly long - over an hour. Comparatively to 1P-LSD it felt stronger and rougher. I took it at home with my girlfriend. She had a good creative time and got inspirational ideas that later helped her to create new artwork. I spent four hours torturing myself over everything that I didn't do right in my life. I will try it again.


Based on what I've read, I think I will be skipping Valery.

Perhaps this is because the body has to first remove the 1-cP substitution to produce LSD. Some people believe the differences between these lysergamides is entirely placebo, and none of us could accurately discern them apart in a double-blind study. While I tend to believe there are nuanced differences, I can't say for sure whether this placebo theory is correct or bullshit.

What? Why? Just my opinion here, but I think we're lucky to be able to taste all these incredible, rare lysergamides. I wouldn't skip the opportunity, and I would suggest reconsidering any permanent stance you've taken regarding these compounds, such as ETH-LAD. But above all, feel free to disregard my advice, of course, and listen to your own body above others' advice. And regardless, thank you for sharing ![🙂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Those were original tabs from I think 2014, when *snip* first produced them, so they had to be 150mcg. I have only acquired branded analogue tabs and have assumed that nobody is buying branded blanks, imprinted with compound formulas, and laying sheets themselves. Have there been any rumors of people doing that?


I guess I have to qualify what I said. With one tab AL-LAD, I would still have body energy which was not to my liking, but not enough of visual effects and depth of headspace. With 2 tabs, the headspace would be there, but the stimulation would be overwhelming.

I do relatively very little research in vivo - with lysergamides, maybe 2 times a year or less.  Back when it first came out, thinking that it would be soon banned I bought more AL-LAD that I needed for a few experiments , so it is the only lisergamide which I have lying around - thus when I do want an occasional recreational experience I tend to add it to 1P-LSD just to use it up eventually.

Well, one might be able to choose the appropriate set, but setting might be much harder to control if you are in a particular long-lasting phase in of your life or if there is something that you are aware and accept of yourself in a normal state, but feel reprehensive under an influence of a particular psychedelic. Meditation doesn't work for me for this purpose. 1P-LSD never made me do "emotional work" (mindfuck), but ALD-52 did it twice, both times in good setting. I suddenly felt a pit in my chest, as if somebody close would emotionally hurt me. Beyond vulnerable. You know, sunk kind of feeling. (Not anything like panic attack)

I made a mistake. I never got to try ETH-LAD. It was 1P-ETH-LAD experience, that I was referring to. Is ETH-LAD really comparable to 4-HO-MET and 2C-B?! In low dozes these two chemicals can be taken in any party setting - there is absolutely no mind fuck with them and almost no load of any sort.  I believe that ETH-LAD was distributed at 100mcg per tab. Did you have such easy-going experiences at that dosage? Did you experience it at party setting. (And I don't mean a party with just a few close friends)

Have there been any rumors of people doing that?

Right, good logic. No, I've never heard any rumors of that sort and have a hard time fathoming someone doing this.


I will say that 150 µg is a fairly powerful per hit dose. Makes two hits a solid 300µg and three becomes a head-knocking 450 µg. Of course most of these analogues/homologues are structurally slightly heavier in molar weight, but this wouldn't affect the potency by much more than a few percent.

No, I get that. It's not a very clean, pleasant feeling during the come-up. However, I find that the anxiogenesis of LSD (and its ilk) comes on during the first 1/3 of the trip, then levels off during the peak, which is Act 2/3, as it were. Finally, the comedown—which is sometimes introspective—comes in waves during the final third as it tapers off and leaves me with an afterglow until I sleep.

Back when it first came out, thinking that it would be soon banned I bought more AL-LAD that I needed for a few experiments , so it is the only lisergamide which I have lying around - thus when I do want an occasional recreational experience I tend to add it to 1P-LSD just to use it up eventually.

Makes sense. You should have someone do a blind study with you in which you're given one or the other without knowing which is which and then after the trip seeing if you can guess correctly.

I suddenly felt a pit in my chest, as if somebody close would emotionally hurt me. Beyond vulnerable. You know, sunk kind of feeling. (Not anything like panic attack)

Yeah, tripping involves deliberately placing yourself in a state of vulnerability. Doing so with courage, compassion, and aplomb takes practice and forethought. It doesn't come naturally, but it can be cultivated, learned, even mastered. And even *then,* it will still serve up a slice of humble pie once in a while to keep us on our toes.

> — Pastel said:

Yes, and I've read similar opinions elsewhere, too. Mind you: ETH-LAD is still a lysergamide, 4-HO-MET is still a mushroom-esque tryptamine, and 2C-B is still a psychedelic phenethylamine. But within their respective divisions, they all share in common that they're chill AF whilst still being visually arresting, pleasantly euphoric, inducing of the best headspaces, and all while keeping your social skills and communicative abilities in tact. It's generally what I'm looking for… unless I'm going HAAM.

Definitely, and at 200µg as well. Much over that can get difficult unless you're experienced. I wouldn't take more than three hits and go out unless it were to a like a Phish show or a festival or something, and only with a relatively sober trip-sitter/good, trusted friend. Lysergamides turn into delieriants if the dose gets too high.

Yes, but compared to others, I kinda have balls of steel when it comes to tripping in public. The more you do it, the easier it gets. And the more frequently you trip, the less unfamiliar the headspace will be to you. YMMV. Good luck ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I was able to try 300 µg of 1V-LSD a few weeks ago. I’ve been using LSD for over 25 years and didn’t find anything unique or outside the range of LSD experiences, other than a longer time till onset.


I’ve found the phenomenology of LSD experiences can vary a lot and I think attributing effects to types of crystal or types of prodrugs doesn’t make sense when tabs from the same blotter or drops from the same vial can produce such different effects one week or one year to the next.

QFT. For me, pretty much every trip starts out with at least a tinge of, "why would I do this to myself?" Unconditional acceptance brings on the answer loud and clear.

I want to agree, but I've seen a great deal of **consistency within individual batches** of LSD/lysergamides that's hard to account for with purely placebo. Some batches of acid are better than others. Consistently. 


I'm not willing to rule out placebo, of course, nor have I seen a formal study. It's a personal, anecdotal hunch and an educated guess. I agree that LSD itself has a good deal of variability to its qualitative effects, but I'm certainly not alone on the notion the core lysergic trip experience is influenced by analogue substitutions and synthetic impurity byproducts. For example, while **nor-LSD**, **lumi-LSD**, and **iso-LSD** have no discernible psychoactive effects on their own, they are still **active in the peripheral nervous system**, which is lined with serotonin. It's also quite possible these compounds have an "**entourage effect**", similar to cannabinoids in C. sativa. 


I have a hard time discerning 1-substituted LSD structural analogues from one another and from the primary compound. I agree they take longer to kick in, which stands to reason given their pro-drug nature. However, compounds like ETH-LAD and AL-LAD *do *feel different from LSD to me (though similar to one another). 


Or I'm just consistent and adept at self-deceit. Always possible, hard to rule out. That might sound sarcastic, but I assure you I'm being 100% genuine. I know how powerful placebo can be, and I'm as human as anyone and just as prone to confirmation biases & such… so take it with a grain of your favorite drug salt ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

So because it was the weekend where I'm at and to honour the Lizard Overlord that was recently taken down by foreign invaders....my tripping partner and decided to partake a 300ug 1v trip last night ( last trial was at 150ug)...and my God....for me 300ug 1V felt closer to 5 or 600ug regular acid in terms of visuals....mentally crystal clear the whole trip but just overwhelmed by the probably one the greatest visual trips of my entire life....I cannot even begin to put into words the sheer beauty and reverence of what I saw both open and closed eye visuals were indescribably beautiful and breathtaking.....interestingly my wife barley had any visuals at 300ug abd I was nearly overwhelmed....I'm goingbto have rewatch this latest season of Rick abd Morty because the visuals became so strong I couldn't even watch the TV at a certain point!

At least for me....the dose response curve is just ridiculous with this one....so keep this in mind my fellow explorers. 

Peace be with you all and stay safe!!!

This I think is my absolute favorite Lysergamide at least fir my own individual body chemistry....YMMV.

As a side note....it's worth mentioning that over the last few months I've been recovering from an accute kidney injury which may explain why my trip ended up being so visually intense as my kidneys are at around 70-80% normal function at the moment but getting better with every month/bloodwork... but I know that the metabolic pathway for LSD ends up with the majority being excreted through the kidneys so this may explain why I ended up with such an intense trip at 300ug .

But Jesus H Vishnu....what a glorious experience ![💥](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f4a5.png)

Okay I’m having trouble keeping up with all these lsd derivatives/prodrugs. From the brief research I’ve conducted, it appears 1V-LSD is one of the better ones. I’d like something that produces a clearer headspace with a lot visuals. I just tried 3 tabs of 25b-nboh and didn’t feel a thing yet others have, so not sure what occured their. It seems  the only psych these days that actually effects me is a large dose of dmt. Anyways I got 5 tabs of 1V coming so we shall see. Is it weaker than lsd? How many mics of 1V are equivalent to say 100 mcs of lsd?

Just in general, for me, the psychedelics that produce great visuals with a relatively clear headspace are: 


1. ETH-LAD
2. 2C-B-FLY
3. 4-HO-MET ("Colour")
4. DOM ("STP")
5. 5-MeO-DiPT ("Foxy Methoxy")

I almost ordered some ETH-LAD as well, but am a lil low in the cash department. I’ve had tons of Al-lad, which tends to be similar in that it produces a lot of visuals without messing with your mental state too much, but not eth-lad. From what I heard, it’s a lil rough in terms of body load.


I have some DOC, which I thought was supposed to be more visual and cleaner than DOM. I had DOM like 10 plus years ago and thought it was decent but not particularly very visual, though everyone reacts differently. Now 4-HO-MET and it’s MIPT counterpart were extremely visual and not mentally challenging in the slightest, it almost felt positive and empathic, albeit 4HMET can have an abnormally fast come up which can cause some discomfort. 


Now I’ve tried 5-meo-mipt and thought it was okay, but produced hardly any visual distortions. I’ve had more visuals from MDA and 6-APB than the aforementioned. It did feel nice though and only psych that I consider to induce erotic tendencies.

ETH-LAD is def my next psych I wanna purchase. I figure if I take some lyrica, it’ll mitigate some of the rough body load.


Very excited to try out the 1V-LSD though. Yeah I could have grabbed some quality acid for cheaper, but I like the novelty aspect of it and am curious if I can discern differences between the two compounds. I’m a bit confused though because some say it’s stronger like Sir Ballz Trippington (“300 mcs felt like 5-600 mcs in terms of visuals) and others say it’s weaker.

Not for me. ETH-LAD is the opposite. It's chill in the body load department. PRO-LAD is a difficult ride, though…


I also like ALD-52, and though it's entirely possible it acts entirely as a prodrug to LSD, in my mind it seems distinctly clean to me.

No, DOM is doooooope. Love that drug. DOC in fact really rattled my proverbial cage the first time I used it. Talk about body load. I much prefer the cleaner feeling of DOM or the heavy entactogenic waves of DOB, or the intense CEVs of DOI … any of these to DOC's anxiogenesis / am-I-having-a-heart-ache? type of feeling…

It depends on the dose. DOM can be *highly *visual, particularly the R-isomer. DOI is probably the most visual I've had from that group of DOx drugs though.

Like psilocin, Colour (4-HO-MET) comes on quickly. You might prefer Comet (4-AcO-MET) which has a slower onset but otherwise the same basic set of effects.


And yeah Miprocin (and Miprocetin for that matter, 4-HO-MiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT, respectively) has insanely detailed visuals, but also some notable body load, in my opinion. Nothing unbearable, but I know when I've taken it. Still, I find tryptamines easier to navigate than lysergamides in terms of headspace.


What I'd like to do is inject MET into some mycelium-growing substrate material for the purpose of producing 4-HO-MET-bearing mushrooms which is evidently quite possible.

Yeah Moxy is almost like Diet Foxy, if you will. Foxy Methoxy (5-MeO-DiPT) definitely has you covered in the visuals department, but it can also turn up the nausea factor a degree or two, something to keep in mind.

Again, 5-MeO-DiPT, aka "Foxy Methoxy" is more intense here, too. There's a reason they call it "Foxy". And you must've had a pretty low dose, b/c ordinarily Moxy is much more visual than MDA or 6-APB.

If you really want to take that challenge seriously you should arrange it such that when you trip, you get at a blind assignment if not possibly a double blind assignment so that neither you, nor the administrator of the test knows which drug you took until after the test. Otherwise you'll be "leading the witness" so to speak, no?

Well so… many of the these lysergamides are just 1-substituted versions of LSD. There's a good chance anything on that 1-position is getting cleaved off, either entirely, or—as I suspect—partially, seriously mitigating any small refinements to the overall qualitative effects such a substitution might bring to the proverbial table. Compounds like 1V-LSD, 1P-LSD, 1cP-LSD, ALD-52 (read: 1-Acetyl-LSD), basically 1x-LSD, right? Those are all most likely prodrugs to LSD. But I would be curious to see the results of a larger study on that topic… So Godspeed and good luck on that endeavor!  ![🤟](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f91f.png) ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I’d like to get a group of individuals who have had multiple experiences with all these pro drugs and see if they could differentiate each one them from lsd itself. They definitely have minute differences between them, but in totality it basically feels like you took lsd. I mean every Pure lsd experience has a high degree of variability in all aspects. Sometimes I don’t really have much of a body load and it feels really clean accompanied,with nice visuals and other times it’s the complete inverse.

It's hard for me to notice any difference between 1v-LSD, 1cp-LSD and LSD (apart from the dosage as LSD seems to be about 20% stronger than the other two at the same dose). Well there are, but I don't think they are anything significant beyond the set&setting variance. In particular, between 1v and 1cp....I've had tens of 1cp experiences and just a few with 1v. Some people say 1cp is euphoric, while 1v is more relaxed, but it's not the case for me. Most of my 1cp trips were rather serene and easy-going. The last 1v one was rather stimulating and not at all relaxed. Some people say 1v is more visual which is also not the case for me, none of my 1v experiences involved any visuals.


That said, most of my experiences are low dose, around the 75-120ug mark (my last 1v one was 100ug + 50ug a hour later - still zero visuals but definitely strong mind effects). I can't say whether I prefer 1cp or 1v, both are similar to me. I also think 1v is a little bit weaker compared to 1cp (need to check the molecular weight as that could explain it). But not much. Another thing I noticed (but I don't have enough statistical data) is that 1cp tends to last somewhat longer as compared to 1v, perhaps 1v metabolizes a little bit faster? It also kicks in a little bit faster for me, but the difference is not big and again I don't have enough sampling.


What I really find drastically different to LSD is AL-LAD, definitely different molecule with different effects and different dosage obviously.

Yeah Al-lad and eth-lad are there own compounds so will exert different effects. this is so confounding. A few posters above say V lsd is more potent but other say it’s less. But one thing I noticed that seems to be agreed-upon is that 1V comes on a little quicker and doesn’t last as long or perhaps Im mistaken. Should be getting it next week. Not sure when I’m gonna be able to do it because I got a lot going on right now.


Eth-lad is next on the list for me. Thus far I’ve tried 1p-lsd, 1cp-lsd, and the other one escapes me right now. I don’t count alladin obviously as it’s not a prodrug.

Well Valerie was definitely distinct from other LSD pro drugs. It came on quicker, yet lasted just as long as straight LSD. I wish I didn’t take 3-ho-pcp before I dropped it. For whatever reason lsd and it’s prodrugs don’t get along with 3-x-pcp compounds when one is already in a dissociated state. However, if I were to take the psych and then consume dissos post peak, it’s a great combination, but unfortunately if done the other way around, it leaves one severly confused and disoriented. I’ve done this before with regular lsd, but for whatever reason I forgot about how I react to it. Nonetheless, it wasn’t an unpleasant experience and I could still notice that 1V is much smoother and cleaner than LSD. 


Next time I’ll be sure to just try it by itself.

You compare it to the same dosage of LSD? In my opinion it is pretty much similar if you take into account it has a higher (~20%) molecular weight, so 150ug of 1v-LSD would be somewhat similar in potency to 120ug of LSD. But yes, different people different experiences.


I had another 1v experience 2-3 days ago at an openair event in a park (100ug 1v-LSD and 75ug of AL-LAD). It was truly marvelous. Lovely combination. Felt great, lots of euphoria (funny thing being in a foreign country among people I don't know). I had zero visuals for the whole event, then took the bus ride back to the appartment, then at home I browsed an internet forum and saw a photo of a bar and a pile of sand next to it in my hometown....and then the sand started to melt and change colors, it was like 8-9 hours into my experience and I felt completely sober just somewhat unable to sleep. My pupils were normal, not dilated at that time and mentally I was almost completely sober. That was really wow wtf. Slept after having a beer. Had great colorful dreams.

i can't speak from a business- decisions standpoint, but i personally would like to see more explorations of the various 6- position and 1- position substitutions. 


1-v-eth-lad, 1-a-eth-lad, 1-cp-eth-lad, etc.

It makes me wonder if the delay is because the body has to metabolize whatever substitutes are on the one position before the compound becomes active, and/or whether 1V-LSD is on its own active. Same for any one-substituted lysergamides.

Yes, I do know that. The first time I tried LSD-25 was in 1985. And by now, regardless of what could be said about set and setting, I know a poison from a good substance. It wasn't only me, my girlfriend who took it with me felt equally bad. Head pressure, chest pressure. General discomfort, feeling of doom. Kind of similar to what I and my other x felt when we took 25-N-Nbome back when Nbomes were a novelty. We both felt like we were cut by millions of paper cuts and I remember her saying what is the point and how could anyone possibly enjoy that. And we both were rested, unburdened, spending a weekend in a summer rental by the ocean. That eth-lad was from a Canadian vendor. I am beginning to lose face in them. This summer among other stuff I have yet to try, I bought 4-Ho-MET from another reputable Canadian vendor. This is a third 4-Ho-MET sample in my collection. The first one was from a reputable British vendor circa 2013, which was exactly what 4-Ho-MET is supposed to be from the description. The second one was from one well known guy in Holland and while it had all the normal 4-Ho-MET visuals, though perhaps a tit bit lighter than the first sample, it had an incredible 12 hour amphetaminic pleasure push, the kind that you feel in your lower spine or butt, which always made me wonder whether it was just 3-Ho-MET. No other tryptamine that I took had this purely methampetaminic angle.  And so we arrive at what I got from Canada this summer. My girlfriend and I took exactly in the same place where we take it once or twice a summer. At the beach near a harbor where ships are constantly arriving and leaving, which makes it an incredible fun to watch as 4-Ho-MET hallucinations turn ships into expanding and contracting trains. But instead of all that beauty we just felt poisoned. Wicked head pressure. Tryptamines  raise blood pressure ever so lightly. I have 4 other substances from that guy, and I am afraid to try them.

Careful not to placebo yourself into bad trips. It's possible you're overthinking it and there were other factors at play. 


I guess if you're sweating it, keep a benzo on hand so if the trip feels shitty like it did before, you can cancel it and ease out with the anxiolytic blanket of a good benzo or similar CNS downer.

Firstly, there are worse things than euphoria.


Secondly, do you have experience with methamphetamine or is this more of what you figure it's like? You don't strike me as the kind of person who would try methamphetamine. Also, why the jump from "amphetaminic" (cool word, btw) to "methamphetaminic"? Is there a distinction to you?


Lastly, seems like you're implying the 4-HO-MET was cut with methamphetamine. I highly, highly doubt that, and besides, it doesn't seem like it would be to anyone's advantage to do this. Psychedelics and stims don't mix for shit. Terrible combo. 


So I figure you must've tried acid at, idk, 15-yrs-old we'll say, and that was 1985, which means you were born around 1970, putting you in your mid-50s now? That about right? How was that first acid trip in 1985? That was a good era for following the Dead, I understand. Another decade and I would start frequenting Phish lots, particularly after Jerry died…

I did lots of amphs and meth probably 2 or 3 times, that was many years ago (I was young and stupid). I don't think there is a very noticeable difference in effects to be honest, except for the fact that meth hangover the next day was definitely worse. To me, there is a definite difference between coke and amphs, but much less so between amphs and meth. I did an experiment with stims while on acid once even though I've read and heard this is a bad idea over and over. Wasn't that bad actually, but coke completely overrode the acid headspace, like instantly killed the magic (it was probably 5-6 hours into the trip) and everything became much more mundane and boring, the place started to look dirty and cheap, the people around were annoying and boring to communicate with. The insomnia that followed was really brutal ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

So you think using amphetamine and its n-methyl analog is "young and stupid" just in and of itself? That's a shame.

Meth is more serotonergic, more potent, more euphoric, and more mentally scattering. In short, methamphetamine is a recreational stim, while amphetamine is a productivity tool.

Well yeah, coke is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor, while amphetamine-class drugs act primarily as triple monoamine releasing agents, though they also inhibit reuptake a bit.

LSD hits a very wide range of receptor subtypes – multiple dopamine, norepinephrine, and 5-HT sites plus Sigma receptors and serotonin subtypes we don't know much about still. However, a drug like 4-HO-MET releases 5-HT, particularly 5-HT2A, and in larger doses, adrenaline.

Coke is a bully. Overrides nearly everything, which can be useful at times; too bad it's so short-lived. Hard on the heart, too. Also, it's typically cut, which is a bummer, b/c the pura is so much better…

Let's say if I could turn back time, I would definitely not do that for a number of reasons. I don't think I ever formed a real addiction to it, but I did abuse it. Did not get involved in those several day binges as some of my friends did, but I've had 24+ hours episodes on that. My brain and my body felt completely fried when I woke up after something like that. I've had an incredibly realistic hallucination once, possibly partly due to sleep deprivation, so unbelievably real I don't think it's possible at all on psychedelics for example, it really freaked me out. I've done really stupid things like I've done it at work. I was very lucky to stop before it started to have serious health implications, because it did have on some of the people I know (which was one of the reasons I stopped it). I just got away with fucked up immune system, some anhedonia and some headache and all this ceased after some time. I was lucky stopping that though, didn't experience lots of craving or other really unpleasant abstinence symptoms. So yes, I was young and stupid and also I was lucky.

I know, read that many times. I'm just speaking from my experience. While amphetamine could be a productivity tool, it is definitely a rather rushy type of stimulant as long as you do a large enough line. Very euphoric for me. More of a productivity tool in mini-doses, yes, though for me it had to be really low as I tend to get distracted easily on it. I don't understand how it makes people focused as it rarely worked for me that way even in small doses. That said, I've never taken it orally, used to snort it, might be the route of administration is the reason for that? As per meth, can't really remember how it compared dose-wise to amphetamine (never weighed my lines for sure), I believe since I knew it was meth, I did smaller lines just because it was expected to be stronger, but I have no memory of this really. However, I don't remember feeling it stronger than amphetamines, the experience was rather similar to me.

Yep, but there's also quite a lot of difference b/t PCP and PCE, and this is also true of their 3-substituted analogs. Also, MDEA is different from MDMA, but perhaps the most divergent effects gap exists between ethyl alcohol and methyl alcohol, the latter of which will blind you at 5 ml and kill you at 15 ml. Pretty significant difference from booze.

RoA *definitely *plays a large roll in how the drug hits the user, from the rush and come-up to the peak and eventual crash. Measured/weighed-out, reasonable oral doses are definitely the safest method. After that, I say vaporization ('smoking') is a superior RoA to insufflation, which frankly hurts like a mofo for about 45 seconds. At least, to me it does, but I tend to be kind of sensitive to this RoA.

They are rather similar to me as well, but FWIW, I seem better at concentrating on a single task at a time and feel the urge to be productive when I'm on amphetamine – e.g. Adderall, Vyvanse, Dexedrine, or plain old amphetamine sulfate; they all do the trick. I'm more easily distracted on meth, though it also draws out a certain degree of creativity from me when I'm on it, particular if I combine it with Cannabis/THC. Some people detest this combo, but different strokes for different folks and all that.

Well, I am from Eastern Europe, we don't have....legally prescribed amphetamines here like you guys have in US, so I don't really know what Adderall or Vyvanse really is. We used to have that niche industry in the socialist times (long story), so what happened after the regime collapsed, many of the people that were employed there went on working for the criminals, good side of this being they knew how to produce it good and pure. It was very popular here circa  90s - beginning of 00s but AFAIK it gradually got replaced by the shady self-taught chemists' meth. I am not sure whether I can find it even if I want to nowadays (not that I bothered anyway). TBH sometimes I miss it, it was fun though also evil. Maybe I would be using it now in a more responsible manner as compared to then, just like with M, which I abused quite a lot too back then.

Meth, like any other chemical, is an inanimate object. It isn't evil. That's superstition.

I'm sure you would. People generally become more responsible as they get older, so it stands to reason. 


What country are you in?


As to Adderall, Vyvanse, Dexedrine, et al., they are amphetamine salts mostly concentrated on the d-isomer of amphetamine, which is more mentally stimulating and less physically distracting.

That's interesting, unfortunately I don't have any idea as to whether the ones back then were left or right-handed or a racemic mixture, guess it was known only to the chemists that produced it. Never got to test the difference between the two isomers. I remember once I got a captagon pill as the guy had no amphs, but had some of those and I got it for a music event. It is a prodrug to amphetamine, to my knowledge very popular in the middle east, much less so in Europe (media here sometimes dub it as "the ISIS drug"). It metabolizes to amphetamine. Even though it was a pill, I crushed it and snorted it. It was a big disappointment. No rush and very little euphoria, even after I stuffed it all in my nose (which was certainly more painful than amphetamine). I remember I stayed VERY focused throughout the whole night, feeling more sober than sober. Wasn't as social as amphetamine, but conversations with people were (subjectively) more meaningful. Insomnia was insane too and the crash was very similar to an amphetamine crash. Is it possible it metabolizes to dextroamphetamine and not the l-isomer? Not sure, but now it makes sense to me.

Stereo-isolation outside of the legit pharmaceutical industry is fairly rare. Amphetamine sulfate, unless otherwise noted, should be assumed to be racemic. Meth is an exception, but it has more to do with the fact that an ephedrine reduction typically produces only the d-isomer.

Ouch. Also wouldn't it need to pass through the gut to be metabolized into the target chemicals by first-pass metabolism?
