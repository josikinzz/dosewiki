## Subjective Experience

First synthesised in Japan in the 1970s, AL-LAD gained traction as a recreational
psychedelic after it was included in Alexander Shulgin's second landmark book,
TiHKAL. It became particularly popular from 2013, due to its wide scale availability
as an Internet research chemical.

I have sampled AL-LAD on a number of previous occasions. I re-test it again today
partly to do justice to it in terms of detail, but also because my memory refuses to
distinguish it from LSD.

I elect to sample a small dose of 60ug, which is less than half my previous high dose,
but nonetheless is within the range suggested online as common. I limit myself
largely due to personal domestic circumstance: real life intervening again.

I note in reading the literature that Shulgin himself had this sort of cross to bear with
this exact same chemical. On testing 50ug of AL-LAD he stated that:

```
"I am aware in twenty minutes, and am into a stoned place, not too LSD like,
in another hour. I would very much like to push higher, but that is not in the
cards today and I must acknowledge recovery by hour eight." ~ TiHKAL
```
Regarding the nature of trip itself, I don't recall the same degree of LSD-like oneness
from my previous forays, but rather, more brightness of colours and a shorter ride. I
hope that this experiment will clarify.

```
T+0:00 I cut a 150ug square into half. I then take one half and also cut it into
half. I then repeat this with one of the ¼ pieces, making one half of this a little
larger than the other. I therefore have ½, ¼, ⅛- and ⅛+.
```
```
I chew and swallow the ¼ and the ⅛+ which should approximate the
requisite 60ug. I do realise that this isn’t science at its best. [3pm]
```
```
T+0:15 I have perhaps the first inkling that something may be occurring: a
strange turn of headspace. When I think about it, perhaps colours become
slightly more vibrant. We are, however, very much in the margins here. I listen
to Alan Watts (philosopher) on YouTube to pass the time.
```
```
T+0:40 Something is certainly happening now. The headspace is developing
along with a comfort zone. I notice events through the window, such as a bird
flying by, which catches my eye, and I actually watch it; which is something, of
course, that I don't usually do.
```
```
I drift slightly into unconscious thought, with a now dreamy sensibility.
Physically the familiar tingly sensation is stirring.
```
```
T+1:00 I find myself asking a number of questions: When is a trip a trip?
Where exactly is the threshold and how do I define it?
```
```
Here, now, I am clearly affected by this drug. The headspace has developed,
colours are brighter, and my mind wanders where it would not normally
wander. Having stated this, I am more or less completely functional and
behaviourally normal if I choose to focus on being so.
```
```
I feel like I am in a twilight zone between normality and tripping.
```
```
I spot the ⅛- of the tab still on the desk, and given that this is so gentle, I
decide to chew and swallow, taking the dose up to 75mg. This is still very
much in the shallow end.
```
```
T+1:15 I feel warm and content, and to a degree I am wallowing in the
headspace.
```

```
As I contemplate generally I examine the question of horn. Yes, it is there if
desired, but the issue I ponder is that sex is frequently considered to be a
significant matter with respect to stimulants, which promote an animalistic
lust. It is less debated with respect to psychedelics. Granted, this is possibly
due to the more intellectual focus of the latter, and that thoughts can
sometimes be too strange or weird to progress, but on the other hand, isn’t
human sexuality actually played out in the brain, via imagination, anticipation
and thought?
```
```
I suddenly remember that I am tripping, and thus I am aware that everything
I have just typed could be out of court.
```
```
T+1:30 I play some music, and it is easy to drift into. I am relaxed, but
somehow my mind is hungry for elevation and stimulation. I am drawn to
documentaries and information as a source of ideas and knowledge.
```
```
There is no adverse body load at all, although at times I feel slightly numb
(physically) with ongoing tingles.
```
```
I feel the sort of mellow equanimity that I only really fall into via this class of
psychedelic. I am usually in a rush, but not so when engaging. It occurs that
intellectual stimulation is far easier to achieve if a pro-active decision is taken
to stop and explore more slowly.
```
```
T+2:15 I am on a plateau and have been for some time, drifting in and out of
different areas of interest. I can be functional if I need to be. This is a pleasant
level.
```
```
T+3:00 A quality I find with most psychedelics is that the come-down is so
gracious. You can start to leave the peak, and pass down through the main
plateau, yet there is no urge to redose. The contentedness remains, even where
the effects begin to dissipate.
```
```
This is what I feel now. I am still within the experience, very much so, but the
intensity has declined from, for example, an hour ago. I feel fine about that. I
am drifting nicely. The headspace is warm, even though signs of fatigue
occasionally manifest. I am still in a very nice place.
```
```
I should state that this has largely been a cerebral type of expedition. There
have been no overwhelming OEVs or CEVS, other than occasional bits and
pieces as I stared into the garden. There has been a touch of morphing and
some tracers and a little pattern recognition, but not as the central focus of
proceedings.
```
```
I have an awareness of this aspect, but my mind is largely preoccupied by
varying thoughts and inquiries and interests.
```

```
T+4:00 I am well on the way back to base, although the warmth and
headspace creates the impression that the current state will linger for several
hours. I feel a little worn out.
```
```
T+5:00 To snap out of the slumber I decide to walk to the local pool and take a
swim. I have done this previously under the influence of lysergamides, and
have found it to be refreshing and rewarding.
```
```
T+6:00 Mission accomplished: I returned from the pool safely, albeit having
detoured to savour the outing.
```
```
When I do take myself out of the confines of the house, I always have the same
feeling: I wish that I had stopped analysing and reflecting and opted for the
open-air much earlier. It always takes me by surprise. In a sense it is like
seeing the world for the first time; seeing it with new eyes.
```
```
I gaze around and I walk in wonder. I feel safe, and can take it all in, as though
I am in a personal bubble. The colours, the sounds, the stillness, the entire
scene is almost overwhelming in parts. It is beautiful.
```
```
The feeling is one of pro-actively observing it as an outsider, but from a
vantage point of being within. It is a detachment that isn't really detached: one
of being able to actually look, appreciate, and indeed, experience as a
consciously separate entity. It is a unique type of awareness. It never fails to
fill me with awe.
```
```
I promise myself that next time I use this class of chemical I will explore this
much earlier in the trip.
```
```
I have enjoyed this ride immensely. Even after six hours I still feel positivity
and a general vibe of well being.
```
I retired to bed at 11:30pm (T+8:30) and had a good night’s sleep, interestingly, with
deeper cycles than usual. There was also some vivid dreaming. I woke in the morning
feeling refreshed and on form.

This is a chemical that has consistently delivered insight, fulfilment and positivity,
with little or no body load. This occasion was no exception.

Unfortunately, it was formally banned by the UK government in January 2015,
following earlier recommendations from its Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs
(ACMD). It is noteworthy and indeed, politically revealing, that this body had failed
to identify any harm associated with its use.
