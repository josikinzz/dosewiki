**6-allyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide** (abbreviated **AL-LAD**, also known as **Aladdin**) is a semi-synthetic hallucinogenic psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family, as described by Alexander Shulgin in the book TiHKAL (Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved).

This substance has little to no history of human usage. However, it has recently become commonly marketed along side of LSZ as a legal alternative to LSD through online research chemical vendors.

In terms of its chemistry, the molecule differs in structure to LSD by the simple replacement of the methyl group with an allyl group at the 6th nitrogen. Lysergamides are distinct from both tryptamines and phenethylamines, although the chemical structure is more similar to a tryptamine than a phenethylamine.

In terms of its pharmacology, AL-LAD acts as a 5-HT2A partial agonist. The psychedelic effects are believed to come from AL-LAD’s efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

AL-LAD shares many common traits with LSD; it appears to be equal in potency as well as similar in mechanism. However, the progression and duration of effects are compressed due to its metabolic differences.

While the subjective effects are almost identical to that of LSD, AL-LAD is significantly shorter in its duration. In comparison to its structural relative LSZ, it is reported to be more introspective and stoning. It therefore comparatively lies on the opposite end of the spectrum of effects which most lysergamides are capable of producing.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) contributors. The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The “body high” of AL-LAD can be described as proportionally intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a euphoric, fast moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. For some it is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. At moderate to high doses of AL-LAD, this sensation will usually hit its highest level and become so overwhelming that people find themselves writhing on the floor in complete pleasure.
- [Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Stimulation) - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, AL-LAD is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxing.
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Nausea)** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes instantly once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Enhancement of touch ](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Enhancement_of_touch)**- Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most AL-LAD trips. Once [level 8A geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_geometry_%28psychedelic%29#7A_-_Exposure_to_entirety_of_neurological_structure) is reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person’s entire body all at once is consistently present.
- **[Increased bodily control](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Increased_bodily_control)**

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of AL-LAD can be broken down into 14 components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to other psychedelics such as Psilocin, LSA and Ayahuasca, AL-LAD is significantly more stimulating and fast paced in terms of the specific style of thought stream which it produces and contains a large number of potential effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **[Enhancement of current mind state](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Enhancement_of_current_mind_state)**
- [Acceleration of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Acceleration_of_thought)
- [Feelings of fascination, importance and awe](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_fascination,_importance_and_awe)
- [Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Time_distortion)
- [Introspection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Introspection)
- [Deja-Vu](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Deja-Vu)
- [Multiple thought streams](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Multiple_thought_streams)
- [Removal of cultural filter](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Removal_of_cultural_filter)
- [Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Conceptual_thinking)
- [Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)
- [Thought loops](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Thought_loops)
- [Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)
- [Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Delusions)
- [States of unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_States_of_unity_and_interconnectedness)

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

AL-LAD presents a full and complete array of visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Increased visual acuity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Increased_visual_acuity)**
- **[Enhancement of colour](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhancement_of_colour)**
- **[Enhanced pattern recognition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhanced_pattern_recognition)**

*Distortions*

AL-LAD presents a full and complete array of visual distortions which generally include:

- **[Visual drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting)*****([Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Melting), [Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Breathing), [Morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Morphing) and [Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Flowing))***- In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon-like in appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance.
- [Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Tracers)
- [After images](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_After_images)
- [Depth Perception Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Depth_perception_distortions)
- [Symmetrical texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Symmetrical_texture_repetition)
- [Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Colour_shifting)
- [Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Scenery_slicing)

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 2C-B or 2C-I than Psilocin, LSA or DMT. It can be comprehensively described through its variations as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, organic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, soft in its edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, round in its corners, unimmersive in depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it consistently results in states of Level 8A visual geometry over Level 8B.

*Hallucinatory States*

AL-LAD is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects include:

- **[Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Transformations)**
- [Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations) ([Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Autonomous_entities), [Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes),[Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Alterations_in_perspective) and [Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Scenarios_and_plots)) - Although AL-LAD is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent in comparison. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, AL-LAD will for most simply go straight into Level 8A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, AL-LAD is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics. On the rare occasion that they are induced however, they can be comprehensively described in terms of their variations as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and geometry-based in appearance.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of AL-LAD are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Enhancements)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Distortions)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Hallucinations)**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational AL-LAD use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because AL-LAD is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychedelic community who have tried AL-LAD suggests that there is no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

AL-LAD is non-habit forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

An almost immediate tolerance is built to AL-LAD after ingestion, preventing one from experiencing its full effects more often than every 4-7 days unless they increase their dose significantly.

**Legal issues:**

AL-LAD is currently a legal research chemical in the UK, however it is illegal in the US under the analogue act when sold for human consumption. It is unclear in many countries whether it is legal or not and one should take precaution and assume it is illegal to avoid legal issues.

On June 10th, 2014 the UK ACMD recommended that AL-LAD be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying any harm associated with its use.[2]

**Conclusion:**

AL-LAD induces a worthwhile lysergamide experience which can be described as almost indistinguishable from that of LSD although with a much shorter duration. It is a trip which is equally compatible for both recreational and spiritual settings. I would recommend this substance to anybody who is interested in experiencing a somewhat legal alternative to LSD.

## Subjective Experience

First synthesised in Japan in the 1970s, AL-LAD gained traction as a recreational
psychedelic after it was included in Alexander Shulgin's second landmark book,
TiHKAL. It became particularly popular from 2013, due to its wide scale availability
as an Internet research chemical.

I have sampled AL-LAD on a number of previous occasions. I re-test it again today
partly to do justice to it in terms of detail, but also because my memory refuses to
distinguish it from LSD.

I elect to sample a small dose of 60ug, which is less than half my previous high dose,
but nonetheless is within the range suggested online as common. I limit myself
largely due to personal domestic circumstance: real life intervening again.

I note in reading the literature that Shulgin himself had this sort of cross to bear with
this exact same chemical. On testing 50ug of AL-LAD he stated that:

\`\`\`
"I am aware in twenty minutes, and am into a stoned place, not too LSD like,
in another hour. I would very much like to push higher, but that is not in the
cards today and I must acknowledge recovery by hour eight." ~ TiHKAL
\`\`\`
Regarding the nature of trip itself, I don't recall the same degree of LSD-like oneness
from my previous forays, but rather, more brightness of colours and a shorter ride. I
hope that this experiment will clarify.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I cut a 150ug square into half. I then take one half and also cut it into
half. I then repeat this with one of the ¼ pieces, making one half of this a little
larger than the other. I therefore have ½, ¼, ⅛- and ⅛+.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I chew and swallow the ¼ and the ⅛+ which should approximate the
requisite 60ug. I do realise that this isn’t science at its best. [3pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:15 I have perhaps the first inkling that something may be occurring: a
strange turn of headspace. When I think about it, perhaps colours become
slightly more vibrant. We are, however, very much in the margins here. I listen
to Alan Watts (philosopher) on YouTube to pass the time.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:40 Something is certainly happening now. The headspace is developing
along with a comfort zone. I notice events through the window, such as a bird
flying by, which catches my eye, and I actually watch it; which is something, of
course, that I don't usually do.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I drift slightly into unconscious thought, with a now dreamy sensibility.
Physically the familiar tingly sensation is stirring.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 I find myself asking a number of questions: When is a trip a trip?
Where exactly is the threshold and how do I define it?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Here, now, I am clearly affected by this drug. The headspace has developed,
colours are brighter, and my mind wanders where it would not normally
wander. Having stated this, I am more or less completely functional and
behaviourally normal if I choose to focus on being so.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I feel like I am in a twilight zone between normality and tripping.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I spot the ⅛- of the tab still on the desk, and given that this is so gentle, I
decide to chew and swallow, taking the dose up to 75mg. This is still very
much in the shallow end.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:15 I feel warm and content, and to a degree I am wallowing in the
headspace.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
As I contemplate generally I examine the question of horn. Yes, it is there if
desired, but the issue I ponder is that sex is frequently considered to be a
significant matter with respect to stimulants, which promote an animalistic
lust. It is less debated with respect to psychedelics. Granted, this is possibly
due to the more intellectual focus of the latter, and that thoughts can
sometimes be too strange or weird to progress, but on the other hand, isn’t
human sexuality actually played out in the brain, via imagination, anticipation
and thought?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I suddenly remember that I am tripping, and thus I am aware that everything
I have just typed could be out of court.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 I play some music, and it is easy to drift into. I am relaxed, but
somehow my mind is hungry for elevation and stimulation. I am drawn to
documentaries and information as a source of ideas and knowledge.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
There is no adverse body load at all, although at times I feel slightly numb
(physically) with ongoing tingles.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I feel the sort of mellow equanimity that I only really fall into via this class of
psychedelic. I am usually in a rush, but not so when engaging. It occurs that
intellectual stimulation is far easier to achieve if a pro-active decision is taken
to stop and explore more slowly.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:15 I am on a plateau and have been for some time, drifting in and out of
different areas of interest. I can be functional if I need to be. This is a pleasant
level.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 A quality I find with most psychedelics is that the come-down is so
gracious. You can start to leave the peak, and pass down through the main
plateau, yet there is no urge to redose. The contentedness remains, even where
the effects begin to dissipate.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This is what I feel now. I am still within the experience, very much so, but the
intensity has declined from, for example, an hour ago. I feel fine about that. I
am drifting nicely. The headspace is warm, even though signs of fatigue
occasionally manifest. I am still in a very nice place.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I should state that this has largely been a cerebral type of expedition. There
have been no overwhelming OEVs or CEVS, other than occasional bits and
pieces as I stared into the garden. There has been a touch of morphing and
some tracers and a little pattern recognition, but not as the central focus of
proceedings.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I have an awareness of this aspect, but my mind is largely preoccupied by
varying thoughts and inquiries and interests.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+4:00 I am well on the way back to base, although the warmth and
headspace creates the impression that the current state will linger for several
hours. I feel a little worn out.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:00 To snap out of the slumber I decide to walk to the local pool and take a
swim. I have done this previously under the influence of lysergamides, and
have found it to be refreshing and rewarding.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:00 Mission accomplished: I returned from the pool safely, albeit having
detoured to savour the outing.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
When I do take myself out of the confines of the house, I always have the same
feeling: I wish that I had stopped analysing and reflecting and opted for the
open-air much earlier. It always takes me by surprise. In a sense it is like
seeing the world for the first time; seeing it with new eyes.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I gaze around and I walk in wonder. I feel safe, and can take it all in, as though
I am in a personal bubble. The colours, the sounds, the stillness, the entire
scene is almost overwhelming in parts. It is beautiful.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The feeling is one of pro-actively observing it as an outsider, but from a
vantage point of being within. It is a detachment that isn't really detached: one
of being able to actually look, appreciate, and indeed, experience as a
consciously separate entity. It is a unique type of awareness. It never fails to
fill me with awe.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I promise myself that next time I use this class of chemical I will explore this
much earlier in the trip.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I have enjoyed this ride immensely. Even after six hours I still feel positivity
and a general vibe of well being.
\`\`\`
I retired to bed at 11:30pm (T+8:30) and had a good night’s sleep, interestingly, with
deeper cycles than usual. There was also some vivid dreaming. I woke in the morning
feeling refreshed and on form.

This is a chemical that has consistently delivered insight, fulfilment and positivity,
with little or no body load. This occasion was no exception.

Unfortunately, it was formally banned by the UK government in January 2015,
following earlier recommendations from its Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs
(ACMD). It is noteworthy and indeed, politically revealing, that this body had failed
to identify any harm associated with its use.

## SYNTHESIS

## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 80 μg, orally) âI had a mild effect, although the doors to my repressed feelings somehow really become opened up. There was nothing transcendental here, but there were moments where I felt a conscious separation from the world about me. None of the profound meanings that I had hoped to have explained were explained.â

(with 150 μg, orally) âI felt it in less than a quarter hour, and was shooting up past a +++ in another quarter hour. Fast. Just like LSD but without the vaguely sinister push. A little time slowing, randy, no body disturbance. Dropping at six hours and totally tired and going to sleep at twelve hours. I will repeat.â

(with 150 μg, orally) âSimply beautiful. Erotic and music absorption after second hour. Clear thinking with superb imagery and good interpretation. Easy, gentle sleeping. Next dayâserene, clear-thinking peacefulness. One of the best materials ever.â

(with 160 μg, orally) âI took 160 micrograms ug at 11 a.m. on an empty stomach and lay down to listen to a hypnotic relaxing tape, with eye shades and headphones. The onset was very gradual over two or three hours. There was some visual distortion similar to LSD, but mild. I decided that this was about as intense as it was going to get, so I lay down in the living room with the others. The experience continued to intensify over the next hour in intermittent waves. I had to verify that I was actually in a physical room rather than in the music I was hearing. There was never any fear or panic, but I chose to retreat to a private place for the next couple of hours. Soon I started to feel worse and I tried to gain some insight and relief from my negative attitude. I prayed, and I cried, and I began to feel calmer and had more positive thoughts as to how to deal with the others, but I was still afraid to go out into the group. I was afraid that my hopelessness would bother them but I eventually went back out at about the five hour point and the rest of the day was spent pleasantly and smoothly. I took 2.5 g of L-tryptophan to sleep, and I slept well, waking twice.â

(with 160 μg, orally) âI pretreated myself with 40 milligrams of Inderal 40 minutes beforehand, took the AL-LAD, and went to bed with eye-shades and ear-phones. There was a very slow onset. The effects were best described as very short bursts of loss of contact with my body, which became increasingly intense and frequent as things progressed. It became really trippy, like acid. There were no visuals with my eyes closed, but when I removed my eye-shades the floors were melting, and the wall patterns and the wood ceiling really flowed. My body felt very blob-like, and I had to get help from my sitter to get up so I could pee. I was very affected by music. There was a very long down-ramp, with physical excitation appearing to linger longer than psychic excitation. Pretty much out of it by 12 hours and I felt well the next day.â

(with 200 μg, orally) âThis was taken on the tail end (seventh hour) of an MDMA experience. I felt it quickly, but it never got to a super level. Complicated erotic, good talking, looked pretty stoned, and yet I still had cognitive integrity.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
A comment is appropriate concerning the use of the prefix ânor,â as in the name of this material N-allyl-nor-LSD and of its immediate precursor, nor-LSD. Its exact meaning is that there is an alkylated nitrogen atom somewhere that has lost an alkyl group. The original term is from the German phrase âN-ohne-Radicalâ meaning N (the nitrogen) without the radical (meaning the alkyl group). The removing of the N-methyl group of LSD to form the N-H counterpart is a text book example of this usage. Unfortunately its use has slopped over to embrace the removal of an alkyl group from a heteroatom of any sort. Recently I learned of a metabolite of ibogaine that has lost a methyl group from the indolic oxygen atom (a methoxy has become a hydroxy) and the compound was called noribogaine. The correct term, to retain the use of the parent ibogaine word in its name, would have been desmethyl ibogaine. The removal of something is usually indicated with a âde-â or a âdesâ prefix ahead of the item that has been lost, as in deoxy (or desoxy) ribonucleic acid, DNA, which is ribonucleic acid (RNA) missing an oxygen atom.

**6-Allyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide** (also known as **N-allyl- *nor* -lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide** , **N-allyl *-nor* -LSD** , or commonly as **AL-LAD** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class. AL-LAD is chemically similar to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and has a similar mechanism of action, working primarily by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) receptors in the brain.

AL-LAD was first investigated in 1984 by Andrew J. Hoffman and [David Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_Nichols) as part of a series of LSD analogs, which also included [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) and [PRO-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PRO-LAD) . Its activity in humans was later documented by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"), in which it is described as "one of the several very potent compounds in a large series of nor-LSD analogues". In 2013, AL-LAD appeared for sale on the [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market, where it has been commonly marketed alongside lysergamides such as [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) , [ALD-52](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ALD-52) and [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) as a legal, grey-market alternative to LSD.

User reports describe the effects of AL-LAD as similar to those of LSD with some subtle differences. It is thought to either be equally or moderately less potent than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) itself, with an active dose reported at between 75 and 150 micrograms. It is often described as being more visually-oriented but with a less introspective headspace. It also has a moderately shorter duration and is generally considered to be a less [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) -provoking and challenging version of LSD.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of AL-LAD. While it is often characterized by users as being generally more recreational and non-threatening compared to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , it is highly advised to approach this highly potent [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using it.

## Chemistry

AL-LAD, or 6-allyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide, is a semisynthetic [alkaloid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkaloid) of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) family. AL-LAD is a structural analog of lysergic acid, with an N,N-diethylamide functional group bound to R N of the chemical structure. AL-LAD's chemical structure contains a bicyclic hexahydroindole fused to a bicyclic quinoline group (nor-lysergic acid). Unlike [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , AL-LAD does not contain a methyl group substituted at R 6 of its nor-lysergic acid skeleton, this is represented by the nor- prefix. Instead, AL-LAD is substituted at R 6 with an allyl group comprised of a methylene bridge bound to a vinyl substituent. At carbon 8 of the quinoline a N,N-diethyl carboxamide is bound.

AL-LAD is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R 5 and R 8 . AL-LAD, also called (+)-D-AL-LAD, has an absolute configuration of (5 *R* , 8 *R* ). The three other stereoisomers of AL-LAD do not have psychoactive properties.

AL-LAD does not cause a color change with the Marquis, Mecke or Mandelin reagents, but does cause the Ehrlich's reagent to turn purple because of the presence of the indole moiety in its structure.

## Pharmacology

AL-LAD likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from AL-LAD's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain an object of scientific elucidation.

AL-LAD shares many common traits with its parent compound [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) ; in humans it appears to be roughly equal (if slightly less) in potency as well as similar in mechanism although the progression and duration of effects are compressed (while remaining qualitatively less intense and more manageable - perhaps due to being catabolised more readily). In rats, however, AL-LAD was measured to be around twice the potency of LSD, although anecdotal reports by humans have reported to be about equipotent if not slightly less potently psychoactive as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

## Subjective effects

While its subjective effects largely overlap with those of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , AL-LAD is commonly reported to be significantly shorter in its duration and less uncomfortable in both its [negative physical side effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Uncomfortable_physical_effects) and general [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) . Some users have proposed that this compound could potentially serve as an effective introductory psychedelic, alongside other shorter-lasting and manageable psychedelics like [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) .

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, AL-LAD is regarded as being able primarily stimulating in nature in the same vein as LSD. This is in distinction to other, more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) which are more consistent in producing [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [relaxedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of AL-LAD can be described as proportionally intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a euphoric, fast-moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the experience, but for most it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. In comparison to LSD, it is a little less sharp in the tingling sensations it produces as but is otherwise essentially indistinguishable.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - This component typically accompanies any feelings of [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) that this compound can produce.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - It should be noted that this effect is not as reliably induceable as it is with substances like [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , and can just as easily manifest as physical discomfort without any apparent reason.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually occurs during and up to the peak of the experience or directly afterward. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable and peaceful in its sensations.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensations are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most AL-LAD trips. If [level 8A geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) is reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person's entire body all at once becomes consistently present.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - This component can occur with the use of any lysergamide or psychedelic, but reports suggest it may be pronounced in AL-LAD. It is highly advised that users of this compound, especially at heavier doses, monitor their bodily temperature and use techniques like hot showers or cold packs to regulate their core and brain temperature throughout the experience, and to generally always maintain proximity to a climate-controlled environment.
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when this substance is consumed in moderate to high dosages, usually during the peak, and either passes soon after the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This is generally mild in comparison to traditional [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect is significantly less pronounced than it is with [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and its related compounds, the four-position [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine#List_of_substituted_tryptamines) .
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is an effect whose likelihood is largely extrapolated from the seizures that have been reported from the use of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . They are thought to mainly be a risk in those who are genetically predisposed to them, particularly while accompanied by physically taxing conditions such as dehydration, fatigue or undernourishment. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon-like in appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance. This is nearly identical in appearance to the visual drifting which occurs under the influence of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The [visual geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_geometry) evoked by AL-LAD can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful and cartoonish in scheme, organic in feel, flat in shading, soft in its edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, either angular or round in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it consistently results in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
In comparison to LSD specifically, AL-LAD's geometry tends to be more rounded in its corners, slightly softer in its edges, warmer in hue, and slightly less intricate in its form. Aside from this, it is otherwise identical in its appearance.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
AL-LAD is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is a less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) but considerably more likely to when compared to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This can feel similar to the hallucinations which occur with [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) but tends to occur almost exclusively at [heavier](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) [doses](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) . Some of these effects include:
 
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and occasionally of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , AL-LAD is significantly more stimulating and fast-paced in terms of the specific style of thought stream which it produces and contains a large number of potential effects associated with both psychedelic tryptamines and phenethylamines. In comparison to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , it is often reported to be less [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) -provoking and generally more emotionally comfortable and forgiving. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and [outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) dominant.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This component is, generally speaking less consistent and pronounced than it is with substances like [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . The mental euphoria experienced on AL-LAD is usually simply due to an enhancement of the user’s current psychological and emotional state coupled with its more regularly occurring effect, [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) .
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This effect is experienced exclusively on low or [threshold](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#Threshold) dosages and feels less forced than it does with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Perception of eternalism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_eternalism)**
- **[Perception of self-design](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_self-design)**
- **[Perception of interdependent opposites](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_interdependent_opposites)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol's central depressant effects can counteract some of the anxiety and bodily tension produced by AL-LAD. However, alcohol can cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively impact the tone of the trip. Users are advised to pace themselves and drink a portion of their usual amount.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines are highly effective at reducing the intensity of AL-LAD's effects through the general suppression of brain activity.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis strongly intensifies the sensory and cognitive effects of AL-LAD. Extreme caution is advised when using this combination as it can significantly increase the chances of a negative psychological reaction like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - AL-LAD enhances the cognitive, visual and general hallucinatory effects of dissociatives. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) and [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) become more vivid and intense on AL-LAD. These effects correspond with an increased risk of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - AL-LAD and MDMA are highly synergistic and mutually enhance each other's physical, cognitive, and visual effects. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable so it is advised to start with markedly lower doses than one would take for each individually. There is some evidence that suggests that co-administration of LSD with MDMA increases the neurotoxicity of the latter, and this may extend to AL-LAD.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational AL-LAD use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because AL-LAD is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

The body of anecdotal reports suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

As with other psychedelic substances, there are relatively few physical side effects that have been reported associated with acute AL-LAD exposure. Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is likely that as with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) itself, AL-LAD is able to be considered non-addictive, with an extremely low toxicity relative to dose. It is also likely that as with LSD, there are little to no negative physical, cognitive, psychiatric or other toxic consequences associated with acute AL-LAD exposure.

However, as with LSD and psychedelics in general, it is possible that AL-LAD can act as a potential trigger for those with underlying psychiatric conditions. Those with a personal or family history of mental illness are generally advised not to use this substance, particularly outside of a supervised medical setting.

It is strongly recommended that one uses [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that as with LSD itself, AL-LAD is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of AL-LAD is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). AL-LAD presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the use of AL-LAD all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

The LD 50 of AL-LAD is unknown. Adverse psychological reactions are common especially at higher dosages. Some of these include [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and more rarely [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . Medical attention is usually only needed if suspected of severe psychotic episodes or “fake acid” (such as [25i-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25i-NBOMe) or [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) ). Administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help to relieve the negative cognitive effects of AL-LAD.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of AL-LAD. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

AL-LAD is a psychedelic in the lysergamide class. It has a short history of human use. It’s been in the scientific literature for decades, but it only entered the research chemical market in the 2010s.

It appears to produce LSD-like effects, perhaps with less intense mental activity and equal or greater visual activity at common doses. These qualities have led to people calling it a more “recreational” psychedelic.

## Effects

#### Positives

- Stimulation
- Euphoria
- Open eye visuals
- Closed eye visuals
- Increased creativity
- Insightful thinking
- Music enhancement
- Ego dissolution

#### Negatives

- Anxiety
- Confusion
- Increased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure
- Muscle tension
- Nausea

#### General

As with any psychedelic, the experiences involves a complex interplay between yourself and your environment. Changes in your visual perception (such as drifting, melting, fractals, patterns, and color changes) are common.

Your mental state will become less secure, so you’re more easily pushed in creative, anxious, or insightful/introspective directions. Your ability to control your headspace is also reduced, making it harder to move beyond a depressed or anxious state when one arises.

There’s a tendency to feel somewhat dissociated from your body and your sense of Self. The dissociation from your body is less intense than with actual dissociatives.

#### Compared to LSD

AL-LAD has a shorter duration and an easier headspace for most people. It seems somewhat less likely to produce anxiety, panic, or confusion. Because your mental state is more likely to be neutral or positive, the experience may be more consistently “enjoyable” or “recreational.”

Clearer thinking is also common. Despite all of this, AL-LAD is certainly capable of producing anxiety, dysphoria, negative thought loops, and confusion. Problematic mental activity becomes more likely with strong+ doses.

The visual effects appear to remain at least as significant as with LSD dose-for-dose.

Because the mental activity is often less intense at common doses, some users find it’s not a very interesting psychedelic and it may not produce what they consider a “complete” experience. Just as it appears less likely to produce confusion, it may also be less likely to produce introspection and insightful thinking. This has led to people recommending either alternative psychedelics or higher doses of AL-LAD, such as 300+ μg.

Not all users are looking for intense psychological effects, so even common doses of AL-LAD may be fine in those cases. Further, the dose-response relationship with the substance isn’t entirely clear. Some users get pretty significant effects at ~150 μg, while others need over 250 μg. You should start with low/common doses before attempting larger amounts.

It has a similar level of stimulation to LSD, so it produces wakefulness in a way that psychedelics like psilocin don’t.

Because the headspace may be lighter at common doses, communication and social interactions could be less impaired.

Quite a few users have reported a dream-like feel at higher doses and some have reported periods of amnesia.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

AL-LAD is a member of the lysergamide class. Instead of a methyl group at the 6 position, like LSD has, an allyl group is present. This is somewhat similar to the substitutions found on ETH-LAD and PRO-LAD.

The substitution is distinct from what’s seen on ALD-52 and 1P-LSD, which differ from LSD due to substitutions at the 1 position.

#### Pharmacology

Only a limited amount of formal pharmacology information is available. What exists so far supports binding at 5-HT2A receptors and agonism at 5-HT2A. Other serotonin receptors could potentially be affected.

- Based on testing with an isolated rat uterus preparation, AL-LAD had a more potent contractile effect than LSD. This effect supports a role at serotonin receptors.

(Hoffman, 1985)

- AL-LAD produced full substitution in rats trained to discriminate 0.08 mg/kg LSD. And the potency in the drug discrimination paradigm (ED50 of 0.013 μM/kg) was greater than LSD’s (ED50 of 0.046 μM/kg).

(Hoffman, 1987)

- Displayed a high affinity for 5-HT2A receptors labeled with ketanserin (Ki of 8.1 nM) and DOI (Ki of 3.4 nM) in rat frontal cortex homogenates.

(Watts, 1995)

- Slightly lower affinity for D1 (K0.5 of 189 nM) and D2 (K0.5 of 12.3 nM) compared to LSD.

(Brandt, 2016)

- Head-twitch response 
- Both AL-LAD and LSZ induced the HTR.
- They had nearly identical u-shaped dose-dependent effects, with the maximal responses occurring at 200 ug/kg (IP).
- LSZ was equipotent to LSD in mice, while AL-LAD was slightly less potent.
- The magnitude of the max response to AL-LAD was greater than LSZ’s max, though lower than LSD. 
- When normalizing the responses as % of baseline, AL-LAD was confirmed to have a significantly larger response than LSZ.
- Interpretation 
- AL-LAD could be producing differential effects via 5-HT2A or by exhibiting a different level of activity at 5-HT1A or 5-HT2C, which could attenuate the HTR.

**AL-LAD** is a hallucinogenic drug, lysergamide and an analogue of [LSD](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/LSD). It is described by Alexander Shulgin in the book *TiHKAL* (Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved). AL-LAD is reported as having some subtle experiential differences to LSD (such as increased visuals), and also appears to be slightly shorter lasting. AL-LAD doses are similar to those of LSD, depending on purity.

## History

AL-LAD was originally discovered in the 90s by David Nichols along with several LSD analogues, and later reviewed by Alexander Shulgin. The drug was popularised for recreational use in 2013, as part of the progression through the release of chemicals Shulgin discusses and provides syntheses for in his book TiHKAL. It became increasingly popular among recreational users, via the conduit of its legality and easy access through the Internet. Since then, a few countries such as the UK have moved to illegalise the chemical.

## Dosage

| Common | 60-160μg |
| --- | --- |
| Strong | 300μg+ |

## Duration

| Onset | 45-90 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Duration | 4-6 hours |

## Effects

In large, AL-LAD is reported as having a very similar effect profile to [LSD](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/LSD). However, many subjective differences are noted - a different 'headspace' and slightly different visuals are noted, along with what may be perceived as a slightly 'happier' push. 

## Harm Reduction

While widespread use of AL-LAD is relatively new and therefore its full impact is unknown, it is likely that it has a similar safety profile to [LSD](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/LSD). Refer to [LSD](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/LSD) and [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for more information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Systemaic name:6-allyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide

### Reactivity

AL-LAD does not cause a colour change with the marquis, mecke or mandelin reagents but does cause the ehrlich's reagent to turn purple because of the presence of the indole moiety in its structure.

## Legal status

### America

Controlled in the United States via the Federal Analog Act, but only if it is intended for human consumption.

### United Kingdom

AL-LAD was scheduled as a Class A drug in the UK in June 2014, despite not carrying out any of the usual recommended research on proving any harm is associated with recreational use of the drug.

AL-LAD, or ALLAD, also known as ALLY-LAD or as 6-allyl-6-nor-LSD, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is taken orally.
The drug interacts with serotonin and dopamine receptors and is known to act as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor similarly to LSD. AL-LAD produces psychedelic-like effects in animals. It is closely structurally related to LSD and to other psychedelic lysergamides such as ETH-LAD and PRO-LAD.
AL-LAD was first described in the scientific literature by 1976. Subsequently, it was described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved). AL-LAD was encountered as a novel designer recreational drug by 2015. The related drugs 1P-AL-LAD, 1cP-AL-LAD, and 1T-AL-LAD are thought to function as prodrugs of AL-LAD and have also been encountered as designer drugs in the 2020s.

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin describes the dose range of AL-LAD as 80 to 160 μg and its duration as 6 to 8 hours. In other publications however, Shulgin listed its dose range as 50 to 150 μg. A typical or moderate dose may be around 100 μg. The drug appears to be roughly equipotent with LSD, which has a listed dose range of 50 to 200 μg. AL-LAD's duration appears to be shorter than that of LSD, which is said to have a duration of 8 to 12 hours. The onset of AL-LAD has been reported to be within 15 to 20 minutes, but others reported a slower and more gradual onset building up over a few hours. It is also reported to have a very long "down-ramp" of effects.
AL-LAD has been described as producing similar effects to LSD and as being "really trippy" similarly, but as lacking the "vaguely sinister push" of LSD. In addition, it has been reported to have less visual distortion than LSD. The experience has been described as "simply beautiful". Its effects have been reported to include waves of intensification, no closed-eye visuals to superb mental imagery, mild visual distortion, open-eye visuals including floors melting and patterns on walls and ceilings flowing, some time dilation, separation from surrounding world, loss of contact with body, body feeling "blob-like", feeling stoned, music and erotic enhancement, clear thinking and good interpretation, mental and physical excitation, mood fluctuations, emotional lability, crying, opening up of repressed feelings, and in one case social distance and avoidance. Some individuals specifically reported no fear, panic, or body disturbance.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

AL-LAD has been found to interact with the serotonin 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors and with the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. It is known to act as a potent full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
The drug was about 3.5-fold more potent than LSD in substituting for LSD in drug discrimination tests in rodents. Conversely however, AL-LAD was similar in potency to LSD in humans. AL-LAD produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents. It was slightly less potent than LSD in producing the head-twitch response in rodents.

### Pharmacokinetics

The in-vitro metabolism of AL-LAD has been studied.

## Chemistry

AL-LAD, also known as 6-allyl-6-nor-LSD or as 6-allyl-6-nor-N,N-diethyllysergamide, is a synthetic substituted lysergamide and a 6-substituted derivative of nor-LSD (LAD).

### Detection

AL-LAD does not cause a color change with the Marquis, Mecke or Mandelin reagents, but does cause the Ehrlich's reagent to turn purple because of the presence of the indole moiety in its structure.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of AL-LAD has been described. It is starting from nor-LSD as a precursor, using allyl bromide as a reactant.

### Analogues

AL-LAD is closely related to other 6-substituted lysergamides such as LSD (METH-LAD), ETH-LAD, PRO-LAD, and MAL-LAD, among others. Ester prodrugs of AL-LAD include 1P-AL-LAD, 1cP-AL-LAD, and 1T-AL-LAD.

## History

AL-LAD was first described in the scientific literature by Tetsukichi Niwaguchi and colleagues in 1976. Subsequently, it was further studied by Andrew J. Hoffman and David E. Nichols in 1985. Alexander Shulgin described the effects of AL-LAD in humans in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe by 2015.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### International

AL-LAD is not scheduled by the United Nations' Convention on Psychotropic Substances overcome is legal ever that doesn't be sold for recreational usage, could be sold for medical or research purposes like a research chemical..

#### Denmark

AL-LAD is illegal in Denmark.

#### Finland

Listed in a decree of the government's psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market.

#### France

AL-LAD is illegal in France.

#### Latvia

AL-LAD is possibly illegal in Latvia. Although it isn't specifically scheduled, it may be controlled as an LSD structural analogue due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.

#### Sweden

The Riksdag added AL-LAD to Narcotic Drugs Punishments Act under Swedish schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use" ) as of January 26, 2016, published by Medical Products Agency (MPA) in regulation HSLF-FS 2015:35 listed as 6-allyl-6-nor-LSD, AL-LAD, and 6-allyl-N,N-dietyl-9,10-didehydroergolin-8-karboxamid.

#### Switzerland

#### United Kingdom

AL-LAD is illegal in the UK. On June 10, 2014 the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that AL-LAD be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying any harm associated with its use. The UK Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015 as part of The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2014.

#### United States

AL-LAD is a Controlled Substance at the federal level in the United States, AL-LAD could be legally considered an analogue of the Schedule I drug LSD, therefore, sales, possession or consumption for recreational not medical nor scientific use could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.
