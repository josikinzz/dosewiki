**2,4,5-Trimethoxyamphetamine** (abbreviated **TMA-2** ) is a synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) known to produce a unique spectrum of [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects that differ substantially from other psychoactive [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . TMA-2 along with [TMA-6](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TMA-6) and others are members of the trimethoxylated family of phenethylamines. Members in this family been observed to produce a complex mixture of [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) , [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects that qualitatively separates it from other psychedelic phenethylamine compounds like members of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) or [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) series.

TMA-2 was first synthesized by Viktor Bruckner in 1933 , but was not investigated as a psychoactive chemical until [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) synthesized and tested it in 1962 . Shulgin published his synthesis and initial research findings in a 1964 paper, describing the effects as similar to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , though lacking in color effects, producing less nausea and prone to causing anxiety and restlessness. .

There are occasional references to the use of TMA-2 in early 1970's counter-culture publications , describing the drug as being rarely produced for sale and expensive in comparison to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This suggests that there was only very limited human usage of TMA-2 between its invention and the publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in Shulgin's 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved"). Since then it has been regarded as an oddball and a novelty in the psychedelics community and is only occasionally sought after intentionally. In terms of its subjective effects, it is known for its lack of classic psychedelic visuals compared to its parent compound (mescaline) and is known instead for its unique stimulating body-high and altered headspace that ranges from euphoric to dysphoric variably.

Anecdotal reports suggest that TMA-2 is a highly unpredictable and dose-sensitive substance that can produce uncomfortable amounts of body load, nausea, overstimulation, and inconsistencies between experiences.

In modern times, TMA-2 is used as an obscure [recreational drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) and a occasional [entheogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) . It is rarely sold on the streets and is almost exclusively obtainable as a grey area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) through the use of online vendors.

## Chemistry

TMA-2, or 2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine, is a molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Amphetamines are substituted phenethylamines, being comprised of a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and a methyl group bound to the alpha carbon R α . TMA-2 contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 4 and R 5 of the amphetamine backbone.

## Pharmacology

TMA-2's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, TMA-2 is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming, resulting in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging one to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of TMA-2 is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin, but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most TMA-2 trips.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the person has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages, but can be particularly uncomfortable.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.

- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of TMA-2 are described as powerful mental stimulation along with undertones of intoxication that can increase the connectivity and rate of conceptual thinking without being overwhelming. The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes: 
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are weaker and sharper than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , but still can elevate one's mood.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

Toxicity studies in rats have been showed TMA-2 doses of 80 mg/kg induced frequent clonic convulsions. A dose of 120 mg/kg was associated with fatal toxic effects. It was estimated that the LD50 of mice to be 180mg/kg.

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational TMA-2 use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because TMA-2 has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried TMA-2 suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

TMA-2 is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of TMA-2 are built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). TMA-2 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of TMA-2 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

In November 2003, the European Council decided that TMA-2 shall be subjected by the Member States to control measures and criminal penalties within three months.

- **Austria** : TMA-2 is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the SMG (Suchtmittelgesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany** : TMA-2 is controlled under Anlage I BtMG (Narcotics Act, Schedule I) as of October 10, 1999. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Switzerland** : TMA-2 is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis D.
- **Turkey:** TMA-2 is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom:** TMA-2 is a controlled Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and is covered by the generic definition (TMA-2 is a positional isomer of the UN controlled drug TMA). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
