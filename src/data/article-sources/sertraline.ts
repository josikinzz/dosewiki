## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as tametralines. These are compounds containing a tametraline moiety, which consists of a tetrahydronaphthalene linked to a phenyl group to form N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-amine skeleton.

### Background

Sertraline is a popular antidepressant medication commonly known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and is similar to drugs such as
Citalopram
and
Fluoxetine
. Despite marked structural differences between compounds in this drug class, SSRIs exert similar pharmacological effects.
Several weeks of therapy with sertraline may be required before beneficial effects are noticed. Sertraline displays enhanced safety or tolerability than other classes of antidepressants, which frequently cause high levels of drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and other undesirable effects.

### Indication

Sertraline is indicated for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD).
21
Common off-label uses for sertraline include the prevention of post stroke depression
11
, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), fibromyalgia, premature ejaculation, migraine prophylaxis, diabetic neuropathy, and neurocardiogenic syncope.
23

### Pharmacodynamics

Sertraline improves or relieves the symptoms of depression, OCD, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder via the inhibition of serotonin reuptake.
10
,
21
Clinical studies have shown that it improves cognition in depressed patients.
6
It has less sedative, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular effects than the tricyclic antidepressant drugs because it does not exert significant anticholinergic, antihistamine, or adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta) blocking activity.
5
The onset of action and beneficial effects are usually noticed after 4-6 weeks, for reasons that are not fully understood and currently under investigation.

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter
Inhibitor
Binder
Downregulator

### Absorption

Following once-daily administration of 50 to 200 mg for two weeks, the mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of sertraline occurred between 4.5 to 8.4 hours after administration, and measured at 20 to 55 μg/L.
6
,
21
Steady-state concentrations are reached after 1 week following once-daily administration, and vary greatly depending on the patient.
7
,
21
Bioavailability has been estimated to be above 44%. The area under the curve in healthy volunteers after a 100mg dose of sertraline was 456 μg × h/mL in one study.
7
Effects of food on absorption
The effects of food on the bioavailability of the sertraline tablet and oral concentrate were studied in subjects given a single dose with and without food. For the tablet, AUC was slightly increased when sertraline was administered with food, the Cmax was 25% greater, and the time to peak plasma concentration was shortened by about 2.5 hours. For the oral concentrate preparation of sertraline, peak concentration was prolonged by approximately 1 hour with the ingestion of food.
21

### Metabolism

Sertraline is heavily metabolized in the liver and has one major active metabolite. It undergoes N-demethylation to form N-desmethylsertraline, which is much less potent in its pharmacological activity than sertraline.
7
In addition to N-demethylation, sertraline metabolism involves N-hydroxylation, oxidative deamination, and finally, glucuronidation.
21
The metabolism of sertraline is mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, with some activity accounted for by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.

### Half-life

The elimination half-life of sertraline is approximately 26 hours.
6
,
21
One reference mentions an elimination half-life ranging from 22-36 hours.
7

### Toxicity

The LD50 of sertraline is >2000 mg/kg in rats according to the FDA label.
25
One other references indicates an oral LD50 of in mice and rats of 419 - 548 mg/kg and 1327 - 1591mg/kg, respectively.
MSDS
The most common signs and symptoms associated with a non-fatal sertraline overdose are somnolence, vomiting, tachycardia, nausea, dizziness, agitation, and tremor.
21
No cases of fatal overdose with only sertraline have been reported. Most fatal cases are associated with the ingestion of sertraline with other drugs.
18
Consequences of a sertraline overdose may include serotonin syndrome, hypertension, hypotension, syncope, stupor, coma, bradycardia, bundle branch block, QT-prolongation, torsade de pointes, delirium, hallucinations, and pancreatitis.

### Mechanism of action

Sertraline selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, thereby increasing serotonergic activity. This results in an increased synaptic concentration of serotonin in the CNS, which leads to numerous functional changes associated with enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission.
19
,
21
These changes are believed to be responsible for the antidepressant action and beneficial effects in obsessive-compulsive (and other anxiety related disorders). It has been hypothesized that obsessive-compulsive disorder, like depression, is also caused by the disregulation of serotonin.
16
In animal studies, chronic administration of sertraline results in down-regulation of brain norepinephrine receptors.
21
Sertraline displays affinity for sigma-1 and 2 receptor binding sites
13
, but binds with stronger affinity to sigma-1 binding sites.
12
In vitro, sertraline shows little to no affinity for GABA, dopaminergic, serotonergic (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2), or benzodiazepine receptors.
21
It exerts weak inhibitory actions on the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine
5
and exhibits no inhibitory effects on the monoamine oxidase enzyme.

### Volume of distribution

Sertraline is widely distributed, and its volume of distribution is estimated to be more than 20L/kg.
6
Post-mortem studies in humans have measured liver tissue concentrations of 3.9–20 mg/kg for sertraline and  between 1.4 to 11 mg/kg for its active metabolite, N-desmethyl-sertraline (DMS).
7
Studies have also determined sertraline distributes into the brain, plasma, and serum.
7

### Protein binding

Sertraline is highly bound to serum proteins, at about 98%-99%.
15
,
21

### Route of elimination

Since sertraline is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in the urine is a minor route of elimination, with 12-14% of unchanged sertraline excreted in the feces.
6
,
7
,
21

### Clearance

In pharmacokinetic studies, the clearance of a 200mg dose of sertraline in studies of both young and elderly patients ranged between 1.09 ± 0.38 L/h/kg - 1.35 ± 0.67 L/h/kg.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/sertraline/*

Sertraline is an antidepressant in the SSRI class. It’s used for depression, anxiety, panic disorder, OCD, and a number of other conditions.

After entering the market in the early 1990s, sertraline became one of the most popular antidepressants.

The drug is used in adults, adolescents, and children. There might be greater concerns and lower efficacy in young people.

## Effects

#### Positive

- Anxiety reduction
- Mood improvement
- Depression reduction

#### Negative

- Nausea
- Headache
- Diarrhea
- Sexual dysfunction
- Insomnia
- Dry mouth
- Drowsiness
- Dizziness
- Tremor
- Fatigue

Efficacy has been demonstrated in depression, dysthymia, OCD, social anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD, premature ejaculation, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It’s also sometimes used for eating disorders.

The core effect of the substance is that it alters mood. This could mean less anxiety, less depression, a more positive outlook, improved cooperation with others, and greater assertiveness.

SSRIs may initially worsen symptoms like depression and anxiety in some people. This changes over a period of weeks, with the efficacy building over time.

Some benefits in depression may be noticed in the first 1-2 weeks, but the greatest clinical efficacy arrives in the first couple months.

#### Medical

**Depression**

Most of the evidence points to sertraline being more effective than placebo, with similar efficacy to other SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs.

Some trends in favor of it vs. other antidepressants may exist, making it a possible first-line treatment. It’s commonly used as a first-line in cases of depression with comorbid cardiovascular disease.

Longer-term studies support its ability to reduce relapse rates. At least three randomized controlled trials examined efficacy for relapse prevention over 18 months. Sertraline offered significant beneficial effects.

One study in moderate cases of depression found sertraline was only somewhat superior to Rhodiola rosea over a period of 12 weeks. Rhodiola had fewer negative effects.

Efficacy has been shown in depression associated with traumatic brain injury.

Meta-analyses

Paper 1 – 35 trials from 1980 to 2011

- Similar response rates between sertraline, escitalopram, and paroxetine.

Paper 2 – 10 studies with 2687 MDD patients

- Escitalopram had a greater overall treatment effect vs. sertraline.

Paper 3 – 16 randomized trials with 4569 patients

- Escitalopram was found to be more effective than other SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) and SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine).
- The greatest difference was between escitalopram and citalopram. Sertraline was between them.

Paper 4 – Cochrane review of 59 RCTs with 10,000 patients

- Trend in favor of sertraline over other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability.

**PTSD**

Some trials have yielded postive results and others have found no notable effect.

One paper found a lack of efficacy in children and adolescents with PTSD.

Studies

Paper 1 – 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled

- 187 outpatients with PTSD
- Mean duration of illness of 12 years
- Randomized to flexible dose sertraline (50 – 200 mg/d) following initial week with 50 mg/d
- Sertraline had significantly greater improvement on 3/4 primary outcome measures.
- 53% response rate vs. 32% with placebo.
- Significant efficacy on CAPS-2 total severity score from Week 2 onward.
- Insomnia was the only negative reported significantly more than with placebo.

Paper 2 – 10-week double-blind placebo-controlled

- 62 military veterans
- Significant improvement on 3/3 efficacy measures: IES-R, CGI-I, CGI-S.
- Significantly greater reduction in the mean score of each of the DSM-4 clusters of the IES-R subscales: reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal.

**Dysthymic disorder**

Several randomized trials have shown 12 weeks of flexible-dose sertraline if effective, even in cases of longstanding dysthymia.

It has a similar efficacy to imipramine and may be better tolerated.

**Social anxiety disorder**

Evidence supports its efficacy for psychic and somatic symptoms.

Studies

Paper 1 – 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled

- 211 patients with flexible-dose sertraline and 204 with placebo
- Sertraline had a significantly higher response rate and improvement. 
- 47% response vs 26%
- Greater decrease in mean LSAS score.
- Among Week 12 completers, the mean change in LSAS was significantly greater, as was the percentage of CGI-I responders.

Paper 2 – 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled

- 204 adults with SAD
- Initially sertraline 50 mg/d or placebo
- After 4 weeks, the dose could increase by 50 mg/d every 3 weeks if clinically indicated.
- By the end, the mean dose was 146.7 mg.
- Demonstrated superior efficacy relative to placebo.
- 53% response rate vs 29%.

Paper 3 – 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled

- 387 patients with at least moderate social phobia
- 50 to 150 mg of sertraline or placebo for 24 weeks
- Sertraline patients were significantly more improved than placebo patients.

**Anxiety**

Evidence supports its status as more effective than placebo.

Study

Paper 1 – 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled

- 146 sertraline patients completed study, 139 completed it with placebo.
- Flexible-dose for sertraline, with a mean endpoint dose of 95.1 mg/d.
- Sertraline had significantly higher efficacy from Week 4 onward on all primary and secondary outcome measures.
- Significantly higher treatment responder rate, remission rate, and improved quality of life.
- Adverse effects (over 3% and higher than placebo) 
- Sweating, nausea, decreased libido in women.

**Alcohol addiction**

It’s been tested on its own and in combination with naltrexone, with the goal of boosting naltrexone’s effect, especially in those with alcohol addiction and depression.

Evidence for sertraline notably reducing drinking on its own is basically absent, but it might address depression in alcohol-dependent individuals.

If there’s any benefit of SSRI monotherapy, it’s shown up more in less severe drinkers taking 200 mg of sertraline.

**Tobacco addiction**

It’s been tested, particularly in those with a history of depression.

One study found it reduced the intensity of withdrawal, but it didn’t significantly impact abstinence rates.

**OCD**

Significant benefit has been seen with 50 to 200 mg/d.

Benefit appears to be maintained in the long-term for many responders.

High doses of 250 to 400 mg/d were shown to be effective in patients unresponsive to initial standard treatment with lower-dose sertraline. The higher doses had a similar apparent safety profile.

Some evidence that CBT is more effective than 100 mg of sertraline.

**For adolescents and children**

Efficacy has been shown in OCD.

It also appears effective for anxiety in some cases.

Study

Paper 1 – 12-weeks placebo-controlled

- 7 to 17 years old with separation/generalized anxiety or social phobia.
- 440 completed assessment at 12 weeks.
- Rates for “very much improved” or “much improved” on the CGI-I scale at the endpoint: 
- Combo of CBT and sertraline: 80.7%
- CBT: 59.7%
- Sertraline: 54.9%
- Placebo: 23.7%
- Indicates it is effective in the short-term for multiple types of childhood anxiety relative to placebo.
- Combo with CBT may be most effective.
- Adverse effects 
- No greater suicidal or homicidal ideation over placebo.
- More insomnia, fatigue, sedation, and restlessnesss.

#### Tolerance

Efficacy declines over long periods of time in general, but it’s maintained to a useful degree in many patients.

It appears there is a notable rise in the risk of relapse over a period of months and years.

#### Negatives

**Most common negatives**

At least 1% of patients experience the following: agitation, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, increased sweating, dry mouth, and dyspepsia.

It may temporarily lead to anxiety and agitation in a subset of patients during the initial phase of treatment before giving way to anxiolysis. This may fit with a finding that acute SSRI administration seems to increase threat processing in healthy volunteers.

Hypotension has sometimes been seen when treatment first begins and it’s usually transient. Trials often don’t record any instances of hypotension, so it appears quite rare.

There are rare reports of diplopia, blurry vision, mydriasis, anisocoria, abnormal bleeding, and psychotic symptoms like auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation.

**Compared to other treatments**

Sexual dysfunction was shown to be less significant with sertraline and fluoxetine relative to paroxetine, citalopram, and venlafaxine in one multicenter study. Though it was markedly higher than with nefazodone or mitrazapine.

Escitalopram and sertraline have overall superior tolerability profiles relative to other common antidepressants. Escitalopram appears to result in less sexual dysfunction than sertraline.

Multiple pieces of research have pointed towards it leading to less weight gain relative to paroxetine. Though the rate of diarrhea is higher.

It may also have less constipation, fatigue, decreased libido in women, and micturition problems vs. paroxetine.

VS TCAs

Significantly lower drowsiness, amnesia, dizziness, constipation, micturition disorders, and general fatigue than amitriptyline.

No apparent differences with insomnia, agitation, headache, dyspepsia, and palpitations.

Possibly higher nausea and insomnia with sertraline vs. amitriptyline.

**Sexual dysfunction**

Like with other SSRIs, sexual dysfunction can occur, possibly due to 5-HT2 and 5-HT1 receptor agonism.

It tends to persists over time, unlike other negatives.

These problems are highly associated with treatment nonadherence.

Among the problems are anorgasmia, decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, and decreased pleasure.

A double-blind controlled study found orgasm difficulties in 47% of females and 67% of males.

A double-blind controlled study found decreased libido in 21% of females and 22% of males.

**Mania and hypomania**

There have been some relatively rare reports of mania and hypomania, including in children and adolescents. In some cases just 25-50 mg/d was enough to trigger the response.

#### Neurogenesis & neuroprotection

A role of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis may exist in the beneficial effects of SSRIs like sertraline.

Studies have indicated neurogenesis is associated with beneficial effects in mice.

It appears SSRIs can affect signalling pathways that regulate neuroplasticity and cell survival.

There may be a protective effect against neurodegeneration caused by oxidative stress and disrupted energy metabolism.

An upregulation of BDNF is seen with sertraline treatment.

Studies

Paper 1 – Sertraline promoting rat hippocampus-derived neural stem cells differentiating into neurons & attenuating some cellular damage.

- It promoted NCS differentiation into serotonergic neuronal cells at 5 uM.
- It inhibited NCS differentiation into glial cells.
- Protected against LPS-induced cellular damage (LPS is proinflammatory) at 5 uM.

Paper 2 – Slowed disease progression and increased neurogenesis in an in vivo mouse model of Huntington’s diease

- Rise in BDNF levels, preservation of chaperone protein HSP70 levels, preservation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 levels, restoration of depleted serotonin, retarded motor behavioral impairment, enhanced neurogenesis, and increased survival.
- Appears the rise in neurogenesis mediated the beneficial effects. 
- Blocking neurogenesis removed the beneficial impact on motor function and reduced survival extension.
- Effective dose level was similar to what’s considered safe and achievable in humans.

Paper 3 – Attenuation of postischemic brain injury in mice

- Dose of 20 mg/kg (IP) began 1 hour after ischemia and continued for 14 days.
- Significantly reduced damage following photothrombotic cortical ischemia.
- Restored CBF autoregulation.
- Elevated expression of HIF-1a and HO-1 proteins.
- Relevance 
- Could be useful post-stroke to reduce depression and improve recovery.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Sertraline is an isomer of a tametraline derivative.

#### Pharmacology

It has a primary effect of inhibiting reuptake of serotonin. Some dopamine reuptake inhibition also exists, though it’s of unclear clinical relevance.

The therapeutic activity of sertraline comes from processes more complex than simply inhibiting serotonin uptake. Most of the hypotheses have to do with neuroadaptations resulting from prolonged exposure to the drug.

Some of the possibilities are 5-HT1A autoreceptor desensitization (boosting serotonin activity), decreasing serotonergic and glutamatergic activity, and causing neurogenesis and synaptogenesis.

There’s an immediate effect on serotonin, yet the medical benefits take longer to appear. It’s believed the adaptations are responsible for that delay.

To achieve a 250% increase in extracellular serotonin, SERT occupancy must be 70% for escitalopram, 83% for paroxetine, and 95% for sertraline.

**Hypotheses**

BDNF/neurogenesis

A lot of attention has been given to the impact of SSRIs on BDNF, a protein associated with the support of neurons and the growth/differentiation of new neurons and synapses.

BDNF increases can be seen with sertraline and other antidepressants. Lower basal levels of BDNF are also seen in depression.

One study found sertraline significantly increased serum BDNF levels after 5 weeks and that was sustained after 6 months, nearly normalizing the patients.

With neurogenesis enhanced, shrinkage seen in depression could be reversed.

Problems do exist with this hypothesis. Namely, some antidepressants don’t really affect BDNF, yet they’re still effective.

High serotonin

Some evidence exists in support of the idea that depression is a serotonin-influenced state, whose high activity diverts resources towards cognitive processes like rumination and away from activities like growth and reproduction.

Melancholia is highly associated with sustained HPA axis activation, suggesting it’s an energetically expensive state.

An initial rise in serotonin from SSRIs may aggravate symptoms, while prolonged treatment leads to useful adaptations.

Acute SSRI treatment raises serotonin transmission to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), causing an increase in glutamatergic activity. This has been shown in rodents.

Longer-term treatment can eventually drop extracellular serotonin levels. Chronic treatment could then reduce glutamatergic activity.

In rats, the symptom-reducing effects of chronic desipramine (a TCA) administration were associated with reduced total (intracellular and extracellular) serotonin content in the PFC, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens.

In primates, a microdialysis study found extracellular serotonin levels in the hippocampus and other regions returned to baseline with chronic fluoxetine administration.

Given these lines of evidence, the hypothesis is that chronic administration serves to reverse elevated glutamatergic activity that’s initially boosted by SSRIs.

Information processing

SSRIs seem to impact low-level information processing, moving it towards positive vs. negative associations.

This can be taken as a “bottom-up” impact on emotional processing.

Relearning as a result of these changes could take weeks, possibly contributing to the therapeutic lag time.

Relearning could be connected to effects on synaptic plasticity.

**Dopamine activity**

Sertraline was found to significantly increase spontaneous locomotor behavior in animals at doses that produce 5-HT reuptake inhibition. Paroxetine and escitalopram were devoid of this effect.

The drug increased extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and striatum of rats at clinically relevant doses. This wasn’t seen with other SSRIs.

It also boosted extracellular norepinephrine levels in the nucleus accumbens, possibly from dopaminergic activity.

#### Pharmacokinetics

Half-life: 24 to 27 hours

Desmethylsertraline half-life: 66 hours

Extensive metabolism in the liver. The primary metabolite is desmethylsertraline, which is 5-10x less potent with its activity.

CYP2B6 is the primary enzyme involved, though it’s not the only one.

---

## History

#### 1977

Kenneth Koe, a chemist in the Pfizer pharmacology department, was looking at structural features of potent and relatively selective uptake inhibitors.

He worked with Willard Welch to examine a set of of tametraline derivatives.

Those derivatives were tested and sertraline was picked from the group due to its selective and potent nature.

#### 1979

Patented by Pfizer.

#### 1980s

In vitro and in vivo research was carried out, showing sertraline was an effective serotonin uptake blocker and could be absorbed orally.

The studies confirmed it was largely devoid of non-serotonin actions and didn’t inhibit MAO.

Up to 400 mg/d could be tolerated in humans and the substance led to fewer side effects than TCA antidepressants.

#### 1990s

Sertraline was approved in the UK in 1990.

The FDA approved it for clinical use in 1991. Sertraline entered the market in February 1992 under the name Zoloft.

#### 1990s – 2000s

It was investigated and adopted for many uses around the world.

During the early part of its history, sertraline was one of the only SSRIs on the market, alongside fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine.

Many health professionals were unaware of some of its problematic aspects, particularly its withdrawal symptoms. This was connected with a lack of knowledge among patients as well.

#### ~2005

The drug was generating revenue of \$2 to \$3 billion per year.

#### 2013

Sertraline was the most popular antidepressant in the US with over 40 million prescriptions. It was the second most popular psychiatric medication.

---

## Legal Status

#### US (as of February 2017)

Unscheduled. Prescription-only.

#### Other countries (check your local laws)

Generally unscheduled or prescription-only.

---

## Safety

#### Negatives

Most of the negatives in medical settings are fairly mild.

It may increase panic and anxiety, though this can be followed by a therapeutic anxiolytic action.

Some of the negatives include nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, dyspepsia, sweating, and diarrhea.

#### Rare problems

There are rare cases of abnormal bleeding, pancreatitis, hepatitis, significant tremor, galactorrhea, syncope, and sinus arrest.

Not all of those have been definitively connected to sertraline, but they’ve been associated with its use in a small portion of users.

#### Overdose

The drug is largely safe in fairly large overdose.

Some of the symptoms include drowsiness, tachycardia, tremor, nausea, vomiting, and mydriasis.

Compared to TCAs, antidepressant-only death from overdose is much less common with SSRIs. The majority of cases involve additional drugs.

**Reviews**

1 – Analysis of 52 cases of sertraline-only overdose

- Mean dose of 727 mg
- No significant symptoms in 34 cases.
- Symptomatic patients had mild CNS, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal effects.

2 – Analysis of 40 overdoses

- Mean dose of 1,579 mg. 
- Median of 1,400 mg.
- Range of 50 to 8000 mg.
- 17 sertraline-only ingestions, 10 of which were asymptomatic. 
- Tremor was the primary symptom in the others.

3 – Manufacturer reported ingestions up to 2,600 mg in four patients with suicidal intent

- All required minimal treatment.

#### Suicide

There’s conflicting evidence about the impact of SSRIs and sertraline specifically on suicidal thoughts and action.

Most data suggests it’s a very low risk for all patients. SSRIs may slightly increase the risk in people under the age of 24 and have a neutral or positive impact over the age of 24.

Even though it’s rare, there are cases of sudden onset aggression and suicidal ideation. Prescribers should be particularly focused on monitoring patients for the first 1-2 months of treatment.

Sertraline appears to have an even lower risk than some antidepressants, such as venlafaxine.

#### Interactions

**CYP2D6 inhibition**

Inhibition of CYP2D6 was found to result in 2 to 10-fold higher level of a TCA.

This could have an impact on other drugs reliant on CYP2D6 for metabolism.

**Antiplatelet drugs**

SSRIs are known to be a risk factor for hemorrhage and that risk could further increase when combined with antiplatelet drugs like acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or clopidogrel.

This comes from SSRIs inhibiting serotonin uptake into platelets, thereby significantly reducing serotonin concentrations in platelets. Serotonin plays an important role in the aggregation of platelets.

The risk of problematic responses is still low, but it should be considered.

**Liver disease**

Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis have been shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of sertraline.

Studies

Paper 1

- 10 patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency from cirrhosis.
- Cmax increased 1.7-fold
- Cmax of desmethylsertraline decreased 1.5-fold
- No significant difference in the Tmax of sertraline.
- Tmax of desmethylsertraline was significantly longer.
- The elimination half-life was 2.5x longer.

#### Cardiovascular

Although it’s less problematic than TCAs, some cardiovascular issues may still arise, mainly in overdose. The primary effect is tachycardia and ECG changes have sometimes been recorded.

Studies

Paper 1 – Impact on cardiac ion channels in vitro

- It inhibited ion channels 
- IC50s 
- hERG – 0.7 uM
- IK1 – 10.5 uM
- IKs – 15.2 uM
- The hERG IC50 is close to the mean peak plasma concentration in once-daily dosing of 200 mg, which is about 0.6 uM.

#### Hepatic

A premarketing study showed 0.8% of participants had elevations in serum transaminase by the first week, gradually returning to normal upon drug withdrawal.

Typically the drug has no effect on liver function or such a minimal effect that discontinuation isn’t warranted.

There have been a few cases of liver toxicity, though it’s difficult to figure out sertraline’s importance in some.

It’s a very rare response regardless of dose. Over 100 mg might be somewhat riskier than under 100 mg.

The mechanism has been hypothesized to be immunologic.

Studies

Paper 1 – Disruption of liver mitochondria in rat primary hepatocytes in vitro

- ATP depletion was observed within 0.5 hours, a sign of mitochondrial dysfunction. 
- Prolonged or worsening ATP depletion can lead to irreversible mitochondrial damage and necrotic cell death.
- Mitochondrial swelling could be prevented with an ANT inhibitor, but not a CypD inhibitor. 
- Indicating adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) could be the primary target for the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPT) induction that was observed, with the mitochondrial swelling as the indicator.
- MPT induction via ANT appears to be the likely mechanism for sertraline hepatotoxicity.
- However, the concentration is higher than what’s seen clinically. 
- A single 400 mg dose in healthy people leads to a 0.253 ug/mL plasma concentration (0.74 uM)
- But the study was using 37.5 uM
- Studies looking for relevant hepatotoxicity do use concentrations above what’s seen clinically. So, the finding was still considered meaningful.

- Admitted on November 3 for acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome–he had been abusing alcohol for over 10 years. 
- Given diazepam
- November 20 
- Referred to department of psychiatry for depression
- Given sertraline 50 mg BID (100 mg/d), which was in addition to ongoing diazepam.
- Liver enzymes at this time were normal except for elevated serum yGT.

- Postmortem showed extensive hepatocyte necrosis with formation of bridges linking portal tracts together and to terminal hepatic venules.
- Sertraline was considered the trigger for the acute liver injury. 
- Mechanism unknown

#### Serotonin syndrome

It could potentially occur with sertraline by itself, generally with a very large overdose (though there are outlier reports). It’s mainly a concern when other serotonergic drugs are used.

Rare reports of it occurring with low therapeutic doses, such as a 9-year-old given a single 50 mg dose.

MAOIs and l-tryptophan are among the things that should be avoided.

Normally it resolves within 24 hours, but there are reports of delirium and other effects persisting for days.

Even relatively weak MAOIs like linezolid have been problematic.

Cases

Case 1

- 47-year-old female
- On sertraline 100 mg/d for over a year
- Linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours added 
- Clinical pharmacist explained the potential interaction to prescriber, but combo went forward anyways.
- Fourth day of linezolid 
- Incoordination, confusion, and hypertension.
- Symptoms went away within 4 days of removing linezolid.
- Another round of treatment with linezolid, but with sertraline removed on Day 1. 
- Nine days into treatment: delirium, confusion, incoordination, myoclonus, then cardiopulmonary arrest, and patient in coma with anoxic brain injury.
- Linezolid discontinued
- Cyproheptadine, a serotonin antagonist, was started. 
- Relieved symptoms within a few days.

#### Withdrawal

Withdrawal is common in medical settings. It’s typically mild and short-lived.

The syndrome isn’t specific to SSRIs, having also been reported with MAOIs, TCAs, and SNRIs over the decades.

Usually it appears within a few days of stopping or reducing your dose. It then resolves between 1 day and 3 weeks after the onset, with a common duration of about 5-8 days.

If withdrawal is significant, restarting the medication can usually eliminate the symptoms within 24 hours.

Withdrawal doesn’t occur for everyone and the actual prevalence is unknown. It’s also unknown why most people experience mild short-lasting symptoms while a minority have prolonged or severe symptoms.

**Symptoms**

The primary ones are: flu-like symptoms, anxiety, emotional lability, insomnia, decreased concentration, irritability, headache, dizziness, light-headedness, and nausea.

Electric shock sensations are fairly common and of variable intensity and duration.

Severe and rare symptoms include: mania, hypomania, extrapyramidal symptoms, ataxia leading to falls, fatigue causing difficulty walking, electric shock sensations that impair walking and driving.

**Rebound**

It’s possible to experience rebound depression or anxiety, meaning the original problems return with greater intensity following cessation. Typically this effect is only present for a short time.

**Prolonged**

Longer-lasting issues persisting for more than 6 weeks are rare, but they’ve sometimes been reported. These include disturbed mood, depression, emotional lability, mood swings, irritability, insomnia, anxiety, impaired concentration, and impaired memory.

The issues may be distinct from the patient’s original condition.

This might be somewhat less common with sertraline compared to other SSRIs.

**Tapering**

Tapering is a useful strategy to potentially reduce the severity of symptoms.

People often still report symptoms to some extent once they actually end their use, even after a long taper.

#### Risky combinations (list may not be complete)

Dextromethorphan, Tramadol, and MAOIs.

Sertraline, sold under the brand name Zoloft among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Although also having approval for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), findings indicate it leads to only modest improvements in symptoms associated with this condition.
The drug shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, mild sedation, dry mouth, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild. Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a mildly elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 25 years old. It should not be used together with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): this combination may cause serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening in some cases. Sertraline taken during pregnancy is associated with an increase in congenital heart defects in newborns.
Sertraline was developed by scientists at Pfizer and approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and available as a generic medication. In 2016, sertraline was the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication in the United States. It was also the eleventh most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 42 million prescriptions in 2023, and sertraline ranks among the top 10 most prescribed medications in Australia between 2017 and 2023. 
Sertraline's effectiveness is similar to that of other antidepressants in its class, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, which are also considered first-line treatments and are better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants.

## Medical uses

Sertraline has been approved for major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Sertraline is approved for use in children with OCD.

### Depression

In meta-analyses, sertraline efficacy is similar to that of other SSRI antidepressants, with an odds ratio for response in clinical depression of between 1.44 and 1.67. However, as with other antidepressants, the nature and clinical significance of this effect remain disputed. A major study of sertraline in a broad primary care population found improvements in general mental health, quality of life, and anxiety. However, it failed to find significant effects on depression in either the mildly or severely depressed, and the clinical relevance and accuracy of the positive effects found have been questioned.
In several double-blind studies, sertraline was consistently more effective than placebo for dysthymia, a more chronic variety of depression, and comparable to imipramine in that respect. Sertraline also improves the functional impairments of dysthymia to a similar degree whether group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is undergone or not.
Limited pediatric data also demonstrates a reduction in depressive symptoms in the pediatric population though remains a second-line therapy after fluoxetine.

#### Comparison with other antidepressants

In general, sertraline efficacy is similar to that of other antidepressants. For example, a meta-analysis of 12 new-generation antidepressants showed that sertraline and escitalopram are the best in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of adults with depression. Comparative clinical trials demonstrated that sertraline is similar in efficacy against depression to moclobemide, nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. Sertraline may be more efficacious for the treatment of depression in the acute phase (first four weeks) than fluoxetine.
There are differences between sertraline and some other antidepressants in their efficacy in the treatment of different subtypes of depression and in their adverse effects. For severe depression, sertraline is as good as clomipramine but is better tolerated. Sertraline appears to work better in melancholic depression than fluoxetine, paroxetine, and mianserin and is similar to the tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. In the treatment of depression accompanied by OCD, sertraline performs significantly better than desipramine on the measures of both OCD and depression. Sertraline is equivalent to imipramine for the treatment of depression with co-morbid panic disorder, but it is better tolerated. Compared with amitriptyline, sertraline offered a greater overall improvement in quality of life of depressed patients.

#### Depression in elderly

Sertraline used for the treatment of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients is superior to placebo and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) amitriptyline, nortriptyline and imipramine. Sertraline has much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurs more frequently with sertraline. In addition, sertraline appears to be more effective than fluoxetine or nortriptyline in the older-than-70 subgroup. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of antidepressants in older adults found that sertraline, paroxetine and duloxetine were better than placebo. However, in a 2003 trial the effect size was modest, and there was no improvement in quality of life as compared to placebo. With depression in dementia, there is no benefit of sertraline treatment compared to either placebo or mirtazapine.

### Obsessive–compulsive disorder

Sertraline is effective for the treatment of OCD in adults, adolescents and children. It was better tolerated and, based on intention-to-treat analysis, performed better than the gold standard of OCD treatment clomipramine. Continuing sertraline treatment helps prevent relapses of OCD with long-term data supporting its use for up to 24 months. The sertraline dosages necessary for the effective treatment of OCD are higher than the usual dosage for depression. The onset of action is also slower for OCD than for depression. The treatment recommendation is to start treatment with half of the maximal recommended dose for at least two months. After that, the dose can be raised to the maximal recommended in the cases of unsatisfactory response.
Cognitive behavioral therapy alone is not more effective than sertraline in adolescents and children; however, a combination of these treatments is effective.

### Panic disorder

Sertraline is superior to placebo for the treatment of panic disorder. The response rate was independent of the dose. In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in an improvement in quality of life on most parameters. The patients rated as "improved" on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who "improved" on placebo. The authors of the study argued that the improvement achieved with sertraline is different and of a better quality than the improvement achieved with a placebo. Sertraline is equally effective for men and women, and for patients with or without agoraphobia. Previous unsuccessful treatment with benzodiazepines does not diminish its efficacy. However, the response rate was lower for the patients with more severe panic. Starting treatment simultaneously with sertraline and clonazepam, with subsequent gradual discontinuation of clonazepam, may accelerate the response.
Double-blind comparative studies found sertraline to have the same effect on panic disorder as paroxetine or imipramine. While imprecise, comparison of the results of trials of sertraline with separate trials of other anti-panic agents (clomipramine, imipramine, clonazepam, alprazolam, and fluvoxamine) indicates approximate equivalence of these medications.

### Other anxiety disorders

Sertraline has been successfully used for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. All three major domains of the disorder (fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms) respond to sertraline. Maintenance treatment, after the response is achieved, prevents the return of the symptoms. The improvement is greater among the patients with later, adult onset of the disorder. In a comparison trial, sertraline was superior to exposure therapy, but patients treated with the psychological intervention continued to improve during a year-long follow-up, while those treated with sertraline deteriorated after treatment termination. The combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be more effective in children and young people than either treatment alone.
Sertraline has not been approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder; however, several guidelines recommend it as a first-line medication referring to good quality controlled clinical trials.

### Premenstrual dysphoric disorder

Sertraline is effective in alleviating the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began during the first week of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity, and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating, and breast tenderness, were less responsive to sertraline. Taking sertraline only during the luteal phase, that is, the 12–14 days before menses is not as effective as continuous treatment. Continuous treatment with sub-therapeutic doses of sertraline (25 mg vs. usual 50–100 mg) is also effective.

### Other indications

Sertraline is approved for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends it for patients who prefer drug treatment to a psychological one. Other guidelines also suggest sertraline as a first-line option for pharmacological therapy. When necessary, long-term pharmacotherapy can be beneficial. There are both negative and positive clinical trial results for sertraline, which may be explained by the types of psychological traumas, symptoms, and comorbidities included in the various studies. Positive results were obtained in trials that included predominantly women (75%) with a majority (60%) having physical or sexual assault as the traumatic event. Somewhat contrary to the above suggestions, a meta-analysis of sertraline clinical trials for PTSD found it to be statistically superior to placebo in the reduction of PTSD symptoms but the effect size was small. Another meta-analysis relegated sertraline to the second line, proposing trauma focused psychotherapy as a first-line intervention. The authors noted that Pfizer had declined to submit the results of a negative trial for inclusion in the meta-analysis making the results unreliable.
Sertraline, when taken daily, can be useful for the treatment of premature ejaculation. A disadvantage of sertraline is that it requires continuous daily treatment to delay ejaculation significantly.
A 2019 systematic review suggested that sertraline may be a good way to control anger, irritability, and hostility in depressed patients and patients with other comorbidities.

## Contraindications

Sertraline is contraindicated in individuals taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or the antipsychotic pimozide. Sertraline concentrate contains ethanol and is therefore contraindicated with disulfiram. The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment "must be approached with caution". Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may be as high as three times the average exposure for the same dose.

## Side effects

Nausea, ejaculation failure, insomnia, diarrhea, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, tremor, headache, excessive sweating, fatigue, restless legs syndrome and decreased libido are the common adverse effects associated with sertraline with the greatest difference from placebo. Those that most often result in interruption of the treatment are nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia. The incidence of diarrhea is higher with sertraline – especially when prescribed at higher doses – in comparison with other SSRIs.
Over more than six months of sertraline therapy for depression, people showed no significant weight increase. A 30-month-long treatment with sertraline for OCD also resulted in no significant weight gain. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the average weight gain was lower for fluoxetine (1%) but higher for citalopram, fluvoxamine and paroxetine (2.5%). Of the sertraline group, 4.5% gained a large amount of weight (defined as more than 7% gain). This result compares favorably with placebo, where, according to the literature, 3–6% of patients gained more than 7% of their initial weight. The large weight gain was observed only among female members of the sertraline group; the significance of this finding is unclear because of the small size of the group.
Over a two-week treatment of healthy volunteers, sertraline slightly improved verbal fluency but did not affect word learning, short-term memory, vigilance, flicker fusion time, choice reaction time, memory span, or psychomotor coordination. In spite of lower subjective rating, that is, feeling that they performed worse, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the objective cognitive performance in a group of people treated for depression with sertraline for 1.5 years as compared to healthy controls. In children and adolescents taking sertraline for six weeks for anxiety disorders, 18 out of 20 measures of memory, attention, and alertness stayed unchanged. Divided attention was improved and verbal memory under interference conditions decreased marginally. Because of the large number of measures taken, it is possible that these changes were still due to chance. The unique effect of sertraline on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be related to these effects on cognition and vigilance.
Sertraline has a low level of exposure of an infant through the breast milk and is recommended as the preferred option for the antidepressant therapy of breast-feeding mothers. However, there is 29–42% increase in congenital heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed sertraline during pregnancy, with sertraline use in the first trimester associated with 2.7-fold increase in septal heart defects.
Abrupt interruption of sertraline treatment may result in withdrawal or discontinuation syndrome. Dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, agitation, and irritability are common symptoms. It typically occurs within a few days from drug discontinuation and lasts a few weeks. The withdrawal symptoms for sertraline are less severe and frequent than for paroxetine, and more frequent than for fluoxetine. In most cases symptoms are mild, short-lived, and resolve without treatment. More severe cases are often successfully treated by temporary reintroduction of the drug with a slower tapering-off rate.
Sertraline and SSRI antidepressants in general may be associated with bruxism and other movement disorders. Sertraline appears to be associated with microscopic colitis, a rare condition of unknown etiology.

### Sexual

Like other SSRIs, sertraline is associated with sexual side effects, including sexual arousal disorder, erectile dysfunction and difficulty achieving orgasm. While nefazodone and bupropion do not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties versus 18% before the treatment. Sexual arousal disorder, defined as "inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men", occurred in 12% of people on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo. The mood improvement resulting from the treatment with sertraline sometimes counteracted these side effects, so that sexual desire and overall satisfaction with sex stayed the same as before the sertraline treatment. However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved. Some people continue experiencing sexual side effects after they stop taking SSRIs.

### Suicide

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including sertraline, to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25 years. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 100% increase of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 50% increase in the 18–24 age group.
Suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical trials are rare. For the above analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain statistically significant results. Considered separately, sertraline use in adults decreased the odds of suicidal behavior with a marginal statistical significance of 37% or 50% depending on the statistical technique used. The authors of the FDA analysis note that "given the large number of comparisons made in this review, chance is a very plausible explanation for this difference". The more complete data submitted later by the sertraline manufacturer Pfizer indicated increased suicidal behavior. Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK MHRA found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the patients on sertraline as compared to the ones on placebo.

## Therapeutic dosage

The therapeutic dosage varies according to the patient's age and/or clinical condition, but for all treatments with sertraline, it is recommended to start with lower dosages (25 to 50 mg/daily) and adjust according to the patient's therapeutic response, with a maximum maintenance dose of up to 200 mg per day.

## Overdose

Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia and seizures. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of sertraline and norsertraline, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. As with most other SSRIs its toxicity in overdose is considered relatively low.

## Interactions

As with other SSRIs, sertraline may increase the risk of bleeding with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid), antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements due to sertraline's inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation via blocking serotonin transporters on platelets. Sertraline, in particular, may potentially diminish the efficacy of levothyroxine.
Sertraline is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased blood levels of CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, dextromethorphan, desipramine, imipramine and nortriptyline, as well as the CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent; for example, co-administration with 50 mg of sertraline resulted in 20% greater exposure to desipramine, while 150 mg of sertraline led to a 70% increase. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of sertraline and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. Bupropion is metabolized by CYP2B6, which is inhibited by sertraline, and this may result in an interaction between sertraline and bupropion.
Sertraline had a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of diazepam, tolbutamide, and warfarin, which are CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates; the clinical relevance of this effect was unclear. As expected from in vitro data, sertraline did not alter the human metabolism of the CYP3A4 substrates erythromycin, alprazolam, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and terfenadine; neither did it affect metabolism of the CYP1A2 substrate clozapine.
Sertraline did not affect the actions of digoxin and atenolol, which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking sertraline with phenytoin or zolpidem may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking sertraline with lamotrigine may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation.
CYP2C19 inhibitor esomeprazole increased sertraline concentrations in blood plasma by approximately 40%.
Clinical reports indicate that interaction between sertraline and the MAOIs isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine may cause serotonin syndrome. In a placebo-controlled study in which sertraline was co-administered with lithium, 35% of the subjects experienced tremors, while none of those taking placebo did.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). By binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) it inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin and potentiates serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. Over time, this leads to a downregulation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance, and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases. It does not significantly affect histamine, acetylcholine, GABA or benzodiazepine receptors. 
Sertraline also shows relatively high activity as an inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT) occupying ~20% of DAT receptors at doses 200mg and above, and antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor (but not the σ2 receptor). However, sertraline affinity for its main target (SERT) is much greater than its affinity for σ1 receptor and DAT. Although there could be a role for the σ1 receptor in the pharmacology of sertraline, the significance of this receptor in its actions is unclear. Similarly, the clinical relevance of sertraline's blockade of the dopamine transporter is uncertain.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

Following a single oral dose of sertraline, mean peak blood levels of sertraline occur between 4.5 and 8.4 hours. Bioavailability is likely linear and dose-proportional over a dose range of 150 to 200 mg. Concomitant intake of sertraline with food slightly increases sertraline peak levels and total exposure. There is an approximate 2-fold accumulation of sertraline with continuous administration and steady-state levels are reached within one week.

#### Distribution

Sertraline is highly plasma protein bound (98.5%) across a concentration range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. Despite the high plasma protein binding, sertraline and its metabolite desmethylsertraline at respective tested concentrations of 300 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL were found not to interfere with the plasma protein binding of warfarin and propranolol, two other highly plasma protein-bound drugs.

#### Metabolism

Sertraline is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism, as indicated by a small study of radiolabeled sertraline in which less than 5% of plasma radioactivity was unchanged sertraline in two males. The principal metabolic pathway for sertraline is N-demethylation into desmethylsertraline (N-desmethylsertraline) mainly by CYP2B6. Reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation of both sertraline and desmethylsertraline also occur. Desmethylsertraline, while pharmacologically active, is substantially (50-fold) weaker than sertraline as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and its influence on the clinical effects of sertraline is thought to be negligible. Based on in vitro studies, sertraline is metabolized by multiple cytochrome 450 isoforms; however, it appears that in the human body CYP2C19 plays the most important role, followed by CYP2B6. In addition to the cytochrome P450 system, sertraline can be oxidatively deaminated in vitro by monoamine oxidases; however, this metabolic pathway has never been studied in vivo.

#### Elimination

The elimination half-life of sertraline is on average 26 hours, with a range of 13 to 45 hours. The elimination half-life of desmethylsertraline is 62 to 104 hours.
In a small study of two males, sertraline was excreted to similar degrees in urine and feces (40 to 45% each within 9 days). Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in urine, whereas 12 to 14% of unchanged sertraline was present in feces.

### Pharmacogenomics

CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 are thought to be the key cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of sertraline. Relative to CYP2C19 normal (extensive) metabolizers, poor metabolizers have 2.7-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.4-fold higher levels. In contrast, CYP2B6 poor metabolizers have 1.6-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.2-fold higher levels.

## Chemistry

In terms of chemical structure, sertraline is a 1-aminotetralin. Several notable analogues sertraline are known, including desmethylsertraline, dasotraline, tametraline, and lometraline.

## History

The history of sertraline dates back to the early 1970s when Pfizer chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds, including lometraline, based on the structures of the neuroleptics thiothixene and pinoxepin. Further work on these compounds led to tametraline, a norepinephrine and weaker dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired stimulant effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist Kenneth Koe, after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated several potent norepinephrine and triple reuptake inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive cis-analogs was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared stereoisomers of this compound, which were tested in vivo by animal behavioral scientist Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not "very goal driven", and the invention of the sertraline molecule was serendipitous. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even "did not have a formal project team". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company.
Sertraline was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991 based on the recommendation of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee; it had already become available in the United Kingdom the previous year. The FDA committee achieved a consensus that sertraline was safe and effective for the treatment of major depression. During the discussion, Paul Leber, the director of the FDA Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, noted that granting approval was a "tough decision", since the treatment effect on outpatients with depression had been "modest to minimal". Other experts emphasized that the drug's effect on inpatients had not differed from placebo and criticized the poor design of the clinical trials by Pfizer. For example, 40% of participants dropped out of the trials, significantly decreasing their validity.
Until 2002, sertraline was only approved for use in adults ages 18 and over; that year, it was approved by the FDA for use in treating children aged 6 or older with severe OCD. In 2003, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued guidance that, apart from fluoxetine (Prozac), SSRIs are not suitable for the treatment of depression in patients under 18. However, sertraline can still be used in the UK for the treatment of OCD in children and adolescents. In 2005, the FDA added a boxed warning concerning pediatric suicidal behavior to all antidepressants, including sertraline. In 2007, labeling was again changed to add a warning regarding suicidal behavior in young adults ages 18 to 24.

## Society and culture

### Generic availability

The US patent for Zoloft expired in 2006, and sertraline is available in generic form and is marketed under many brand names worldwide.

### Brand names

In the US, Zoloft is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

### Interest during COVID-19 pandemic

Sertraline has been the most sought-after antidepressant worldwide before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Google Trends data. The pandemic has led to an increase in searches for antidepressants, with sertraline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine showing the highest search volumes, whereas searches of citalopram decreased during the pandemic.

## Research

Sertraline may be useful to treat murine Zaire ebolavirus (murine EBOV). The World Health Organization (WHO) considers this a promising area of research.
Lass-Flörl et al., 2003 finds it significantly inhibits phospholipase B in the fungal genus Candida, reducing virulence.
Sertraline is also a very effective leishmanicide. Specifically, Palit & Ali 2008 find that sertraline kills almost all promastigotes of Leishmania donovani.
Sertraline is strongly antibacterial against some species. It is also known to act as a photosensitizer of bacterial surfaces. In combination with antibacterials its photosensitization effect reverses antibacterial resistance. As such sertraline shows promise for food preservation.
Lass-Flörl et al., 2003 finds this compound acts as a fungicide against Candida parapsilosis. Its anti-Cp effect is indeed due to its serotonergic activity and not its other effects.
Sertraline is a promising trypanocide. It acts at several different life stages and against several strains. Sertraline's trypanocidal mechanism of action is by way of interference with bioenergetics.
When mothers take sertraline during pregnancy, there is research evidence that the newborn may experience sertraline withdrawal symptoms.
