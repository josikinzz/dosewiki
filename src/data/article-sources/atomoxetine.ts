## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenol ethers. These are aromatic compounds containing an ether group substituted with a benzene ring.

### Background

Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Also known as the marketed product Strattera, atomoxetine is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD including distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Although the underlying pathophysiology that causes ADHD remains unclear, evidence suggests that dysregulation in noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways plays a critical role in suboptimal executive functioning within prefrontal regions of the brain, which are involved in attention and memory.
5
Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase NA and DA within the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NA) or striatum.
8
This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as
Methylphenidate
,
Dextroamphetamine
, and
Lisdexamfetamine
.
8
Use of non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine is therefore thought to offer a clinical advantage over the use of traditional medications for the management of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT),
9
and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,
10
indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD.
Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants (such as
Methylphenidate
,
Dextroamphetamine
, and
Lisdexamfetamine
) are typically considered the most effective and first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and children as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance).
16
However, these stimulant medications are limited by dose-related side effects and concerns of abuse. Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. In particular, increased dopamine in key areas caused by these stimulant medications is associated with their reinforcing and addictive properties, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.
6
Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine,
Modafinil
and
Guanfacine
. The non-stimulant norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor
Bupropion
(commonly used for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation) has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of ADHD.

### Indication

Atomoxetine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults.

### Pharmacodynamics

Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase norepinephrine and dopamine within the prefrontal cortex, which results in improved ADHD symptoms.

Due to atomoxetine's noradrenergic activity, it also has effects on the cardiovascular system such as increased blood pressure and tachycardia.
11
Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients taking atomoxetine at usual doses for ADHD. Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. It should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experienced clinically important increases in blood pressure or heart rate. Although the role of atomoxetine in these cases is unknown, consideration should be given to not treating patients with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities. Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during atomoxetine treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.
18
In general, particular care should be taken in treating ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Treatment emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by atomoxetine at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of atomoxetine, and discontinuation of treatment should be considered.
18
Atomoxetine capsules increased the risk of suicidal ideation in short-term studies in children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). All pediatric patients being treated with atomoxetine  should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.
18
Postmarketing reports indicate that atomoxetine can cause severe liver injury. Although no evidence of liver injury was detected in clinical trials of about 6000 patients, there have been rare cases of clinically significant liver injury that were considered probably or possibly related to atomoxetine use in postmarketing experience. Rare cases of liver failure have also been reported, including a case that resulted in a liver transplant. Atomoxetine should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted. Laboratory testing to determine liver enzyme levels should be done upon the first symptom or sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark urine, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained “flu like” symptoms).

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter
Inhibitor

### Absorption

The pharmacokinetic profile of atomoxetine is highly dependent on cytochrome P450 2D6 genetic polymorphisms of the individual.
1
A large fraction of the population (up to 10% of Caucasians and 2% of people of African descent and 1% of Asians) are poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2D6 metabolized drugs. These individuals have reduced activity in this pathway resulting in 10-fold higher AUCs, 5-fold higher peak plasma concentrations, and slower elimination (plasma half-life of 21.6 hours) of atomoxetine compared with people with normal CYP2D6 activity.
Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with absolute bioavailability of about 63% in extensive metabolizers (EMs) and 94% in poor metabolizers (PMs). Mean maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing with a maximal concentration of 350 ng/ml with an AUC of 2 mcg.h/ml.
1

### Metabolism

Atomoxetine undergoes biotransformation primarily through the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzymatic pathway. People with reduced activity in the CYP2D6 pathway (also known as poor metabolizers or PMs) have higher plasma concentrations of atomoxetine compared with people with normal activity (also known as extensive metabolizers, or EMs). For PMs, the AUC of atomoxetine at steady-state is approximately 10-fold higher and Cmax is about 5-fold greater than for EMs.
The major oxidative metabolite formed regardless of CYP2D6 status is 4-hydroxy-atomoxetine, which is rapidly glucuronidated. 4-Hydroxyatomoxetine is equipotent to atomoxetine as an inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter, but circulates in plasma at much lower concentrations (1% of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 0.1% of atomoxetine concentration in PMs).
In individuals that lack CYP2D6 activity, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine is still the primary metabolite, but is formed by several other cytochrome P450 enzymes and at a slower rate. Another minor metabolite, N-Desmethyl-atomoxetine is formed by CYP2C19 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, but has much less pharmacological activity than atomoxetine and lower plasma concentrations (5% of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 45% of atomoxetine concentration in PMs).

### Half-life

The reported half-life depends on the CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms of the individual and can range from 3 to 5.6 hours.
1

### Toxicity

There is limited clinical trial experience with atomoxetine overdose. During postmarketing, there have been fatalities reported involving a mixed ingestion overdose of atomoxetine capsules and at least one other drug. There have been no reports of death involving overdose of atomoxetine capsules alone, including intentional overdoses at amounts up to 1400 mg. In some cases of overdose involving atomoxetine, seizures have been reported. The most commonly reported symptoms accompanying acute and chronic overdoses of atomoxetine capsules were gastrointestinal symptoms, somnolence, dizziness, tremor, and abnormal behavior. Hyperactivity and agitation have also been reported. Signs and symptoms consistent with mild to moderate sympathetic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, blood pressure increased, mydriasis, dry mouth) have also been observed. Most events were mild to moderate. Less commonly, there have been reports of QT prolongation and mental changes, including disorientation and hallucinations. If symptoms of overdose are suspected, a Certified Poison Control Center should be consulted for up to date guidance and advice. Because atomoxetine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be useful in the treatment of overdose.

### Mechanism of action

Atomoxetine is known to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter (NET),
2
which prevents cellular reuptake of norepinephrine throughout the brain, which is thought to improve the symptoms of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT),
9
and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,

### Volume of distribution

The reported volume of distribution of oral atomoxetine was 1.6-2.6 L/kg. The steady-state volume of distribution of intravenous atomoxetine was approximately 0.85 L/kg.
1

### Protein binding

At therapeutic concentrations, 98.7% of plasma atomoxetine is bound to protein, with 97.5% of that being bound to albumin, followed by alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and immunoglobulin G.
1

### Route of elimination

Atomoxetine is excreted primarily as 4-hydroxyatomoxetine-O-glucuronide, mainly in the urine (greater than 80% of the dose) and to a lesser extent in the feces (less than 17% of the dose). Only a small fraction (less than 3%) of the atomoxetine dose is excreted as unchanged atomoxetine, indicating extensive biotransformation.
18

### Clearance

The clearance rate of atomoxetine depends the CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms of the individual and can range of 0.27-0.67 L.h/kg.

  "wikipedia": `# Atomoxetine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine*

Atomoxetine, sold under the brand name Strattera, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (sNRI) medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, to a lesser extent, cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS). It may be used alone or along with stimulant medication. It enhances the executive functions of self-motivation, sustained attention, inhibition, working memory, reaction time, and emotional self-regulation. Use of atomoxetine is only recommended for those who are at least six years old. It is taken orally. The effectiveness of atomoxetine is comparable to the commonly prescribed stimulant medication methylphenidate.
Common side effects of atomoxetine include abdominal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, feeling tired, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include angioedema, liver problems, stroke, psychosis, heart problems, suicide, and aggression. There is a lack of data regarding its safety during pregnancy; as of 2019, its safety during pregnancy and for use during breastfeeding is not certain.
It was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. In 2023, it was the 161st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

Atomoxetine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

Atomoxetine is approved for use in children, adolescents, and adults. However, its efficacy has not been studied in children under six years old. One of the primary differences with the standard stimulant treatments for ADHD is that it has little known abuse potential. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have found that atomoxetine has comparable efficacy and equal tolerability to methylphenidate in children and adolescents. In adults, efficacy and tolerability are equivalent.
While its efficacy may be less than that of lisdexamfetamine, there is some evidence that it may be used in combination with stimulants. Doctors may prescribe non-stimulants including atomoxetine when a person has bothersome side effects from stimulants; when a stimulant was not effective; in combination with a stimulant to increase effectiveness; when the cost of stimulants is prohibitive; or when there is concern about the abuse potential of stimulants in a patient with a history of substance use disorder.
Atomoxetine alleviates ADHD symptoms through norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and by indirectly increasing dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, sharing 70–80% of the brain regions with stimulants in their produced effects.
Unlike α2-adrenergic receptor agonists such as guanfacine and clonidine, atomoxetine's use can be abruptly stopped without significant withdrawal symptoms being observed.
The initial therapeutic effects of atomoxetine usually take 1 to 4 weeks to become apparent. A further 2 to 4 weeks may be required for the full therapeutic effects to be seen. Incrementally increasing response may occur up to 1 year or longer. The maximum recommended total daily dose in children and adolescents is 70 mg and adults is 100 mg.

### Other uses

#### Cognitive disengagement syndrome

Atomoxetine may be used to treat cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS), as multiple randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have found that it is an effective treatment. In contrast, multiple RCTs have shown that it responds poorly to the stimulant medication methylphenidate.

#### Traumatic brain injury

Atomoxetine is sometimes used in the treatment of cognitive impairment and frontal lobe symptoms due to conditions like traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is used to treat ADHD-like symptoms such as sustained attentional problems, disinhibition, lack of arousal, fatigue, and depression, including symptoms from cognitive disengagement syndrome. A 2015 Cochrane review identified only one study of atomoxetine for TBI and found no positive effects. Aside from TBI, atomoxetine was found to be effective in the treatment of akinetic mutism following subarachnoid hemorrhage in a case report.

## Contraindications

Contraindications include:

Any cardiovascular disease including:
Moderate to severe hypertension
Atrial fibrillation
Atrial flutter
Ventricular tachycardia
Ventricular fibrillation
Ventricular flutter
Advanced arteriosclerosis
Severe cardiovascular disorders
Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism
Pheochromocytoma
Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
Narrow-angle glaucoma

## Side effects

Common side effects include abdominal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, erectile dysfunction, feeling tired, dizziness and urinary retention. Serious side effects may include angioedema, liver problems, stroke, psychosis, heart problems, suicide, and aggression. A 2020 meta-analysis found that atomoxetine was associated with anorexia, weight loss, and hypertension, rating it as a "potentially least preferred agent based on safety" for treating ADHD. As of 2019, safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not clear; a 2018 review stated that, "because of lack of data, the treating
physician should consider stopping atomoxetine treatment in women with ADHD during pregnancy."
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a black box warning for suicidal behavior/ideation. Similar warnings have been issued in Australia. Unlike stimulant medications, atomoxetine does not have abuse liability or the potential to cause withdrawal effects upon abrupt discontinuation.

## Overdose

Atomoxetine can lead to cardiac complications, with severe overdose requiring intensive medical care to avoid death.

## Interactions

Atomoxetine is a substrate for CYP2D6. Concurrent treatment with a CYP2D6 inhibitor such as bupropion, fluoxetine, or paroxetine has been shown to increase plasma atomoxetine by 100% or more, as well as increase N-desmethylatomoxetine levels and decrease plasma 4-hydroxyatomoxetine levels by a similar degree.
Atomoxetine has been found to directly inhibit hERG potassium currents with an IC50 of 6.3 μM, which has the potential to cause arrhythmia. QT prolongation has been reported with atomoxetine at therapeutic doses and in overdose; it is suggested that atomoxetine not be used with other medications that may prolong the QT interval, concomitantly with CYP2D6 inhibitors, and caution to be used in poor metabolizers.
Other notable drug interactions include:

Antihypertensive agents, due to atomoxetine acting as an indirect sympathomimetic
Indirect-acting sympathomimetics, such as pseudoephedrine, other norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), or MAOIs
Direct-acting sympathomimetics, such as phenylephrine or other α1-adrenergic receptor agonists, including vasopressors such as dobutamine or isoprenaline and β2-adrenergic receptor agonists
Highly plasma protein-bound drugs: atomoxetine has the potential to displace these drugs from plasma proteins which may potentiate their adverse or toxic effects. In vitro, atomoxetine does not affect the plasma protein binding of aspirin, desipramine, diazepam, paroxetine, phenytoin, or warfarin
Atomoxetine prevents norepinephrine release induced by amphetamines and has been found to reduce the stimulant, euphoriant, and sympathomimetic effects of dextroamphetamine in humans.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Atomoxetine inhibits the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter (NET), preventing the reuptake of norepinephrine throughout the brain along with inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine in specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, where dopamine transporter (DAT) expression is minimal. In rats, atomoxetine increased prefrontal cortex catecholamine concentrations without altering dopamine levels in the striatum or nucleus accumbens; in contrast, methylphenidate, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, was found to increase prefrontal, striatal, and accumbal dopamine levels to the same degree. In addition to rats, atomoxetine has also been found to induce similar region-specific catecholamine level alteration in mice.
Atomoxetine's status as a serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor at clinical doses in humans is uncertain. A PET imaging study on rhesus monkeys found that atomoxetine occupied >90% and >85% of neural NET and SERT, respectively. However, both mouse and rat microdialysis studies have failed to find an increase in extracellular serotonin in the prefrontal cortex following acute or chronic atomoxetine treatment. Supporting atomoxetine's selectivity, a human study found no effects on platelet serotonin uptake (a marker of SERT inhibition) and inhibition of the pressor effects of tyramine (a marker of NET inhibition).
Atomoxetine has been found to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist in rat cortical neurons at therapeutic concentrations. It causes a use-dependent open-channel block and its binding site overlaps with the Mg2+ binding site. Atomoxetine's ability to increase prefrontal cortex firing rate in anesthetized rats could not be blocked by D1 or α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists, but could be potentiated by NMDA or an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, suggesting a glutaminergic mechanism. In Sprague Dawley rats, atomoxetine reduces NR2B protein content without altering transcript levels. Aberrant glutamate and NMDA receptor function have been implicated in the etiology of ADHD.
Atomoxetine also reversibly inhibits GIRK currents in Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent, voltage-independent, and time-independent manner. Kir3.1/3.2 ion channels are opened downstream of M2, α2, D2, and A1 stimulation, as well as other Gi-coupled receptors. Therapeutic concentrations of atomoxetine are within range of interacting with GIRKs, especially in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. It is not known whether this contributes to the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD.
4-Hydroxyatomoxetine, the major active metabolite of atomoxetine in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, has been found to have sub-micromolar affinity for opioid receptors, acting as an antagonist at μ-opioid receptors and a partial agonist at κ-opioid receptors. It is not known whether this action at the kappa-opioid receptor leads to CNS-related adverse effects.

### Pharmacokinetics

Orally administered atomoxetine is rapidly and completely absorbed. First-pass metabolism by the liver is dependent on CYP2D6 activity, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of 63% for extensive metabolizers and 94% for poor metabolizers. Maximum plasma concentration is reached in 1–2 hours. If taken with food, the maximum plasma concentration decreases by 10–40% and delays the tmax by 3 hours. Drugs affecting gastric pH have no effect on oral bioavailability.
Following intravenous delivery, atomoxetine has a volume of distribution of 0.85 L/kg (indicating distribution primarily in total body water), with limited partitioning into red blood cells. It is highly bound to plasma proteins (98.7%), mainly albumin, along with α1-acid glycoprotein (77%) and IgG (15%). Its metabolite N-desmethylatomoxetine is 99.1% bound to plasma proteins, while 4-hydroxyatomoxetine is only 66.6% bound.
The half-life of atomoxetine varies widely between individuals, with an average range of 4.5 to 19 hours. As atomoxetine is metabolized by CYP2D6, exposure may be increased 10-fold in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Among CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, the half-life of atomoxetine averaged 5.34 hours and the half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethylatomoxetine was 8.9 hours. By contrast, among CYP2D6 poor metabolizers the half-life of atomoxetine averaged 20.0 hours and the half-life of N-desmethylatomoxetine averaged 33.3 hours. Steady-state levels of atomoxetine are typically achieved at or around day 10 of regular dosing, with trough plasma concentrations (Ctrough) residing around 30–40°ng/mL; however, both the time to steady-state levels and Ctrough are expected to vary based on a patient's CYP2D6 profile.
Atomoxetine, N-desmethylatomoxetine, and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine produce minimal to no inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9, but inhibit CYP2D6 in human liver microsomes at concentrations between 3.6 and 17 μmol/L. Plasma concentrations of 4-hydroxyatomoxetine and N-desmethylatomoxetine at steady state are 1% and 5% that of atomoxetine in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, and 0.1% and 45% that of atomoxetine in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, respectively.
Atomoxetine is excreted unchanged in urine at <3% in both extensive and poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, with >96% and 80% of a total dose being excreted in urine, respectively. The fractions excreted in urine as 4-hydroxyatomoxetine and its glucuronide account for 86% of a given dose in extensive metabolizers, but only 40% in poor metabolizers. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers excrete greater amounts of minor metabolites, namely N-desmethylatomoxetine and 2-hydroxymethylatomoxetine and their conjugates.

#### Pharmacogenomics

Chinese adults homozygous for the hypoactive CYP2D6*10 allele have been found to exhibit two-fold higher area-under-the-curve (AUCs) and 1.5-fold higher maximum plasma concentrations compared to extensive metabolizers.
Japanese men homozygous for CYP2D6*10 have similarly been found to experience two-fold higher AUCs compared to extensive metabolizers.

## Chemistry

Atomoxetine, or (−)-methyl[(3R)-3-(2-methylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamine, is a white, granular powder that is highly soluble in water.

### Synthesis

### Detection in biological fluids

Atomoxetine may be quantitated in plasma, serum, or whole blood to distinguish extensive versus poor metabolizers in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims, or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage.

## History

Atomoxetine is manufactured, marketed, and sold in the United States as the hydrochloride salt (atomoxetine HCl) under the brand name Strattera by Eli Lilly and Company, the original patent-filing company and current U.S. patent owner. Atomoxetine was initially intended to be developed as an antidepressant, but it was found to be insufficiently efficacious for treating depression. It was, however, found to be effective for ADHD and was approved by the FDA in 2002, for the treatment of ADHD. Its patent expired in May 2017. On 12 August 2010, Lilly lost a lawsuit that challenged its patent on Strattera, increasing the likelihood of an earlier entry of a generic into the US market. On 1 September 2010, Sun Pharmaceuticals announced it would begin manufacturing a generic in the United States. In a 29 July 2011 conference call, however, Sun Pharmaceutical's Chairman stated "Lilly won that litigation on appeal so I think [generic Strattera]'s deferred."
In 2017 the FDA approved the generic production of atomoxetine by four pharmaceutical companies.

## Society and culture

The drug was originally known as tomoxetine. It was renamed to avoid medication errors, as the name may be confused with tamoxifen.

### Brand names

In India, atomoxetine is sold under brand names including Axetra, Axepta, Attera, Tomoxetin, and Attentin. In Australia, Canada, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and the US, atomoxetine is sold under the brand name Strattera. In France, hospitals dispense atomoxetine under the brand name Strattera (it is not marketed in France). In the Czech Republic, it is sold under brand names including Mylan. In Poland, it is sold under the brand name Auroxetyn. In Indonesia, it is sold under the brand name Xenocy. In Iran, atomoxetine is sold under brand names including Stramox. In Brazil, it is sold under the brand name Atentah. In Turkey, it is sold under the brand names Attex, Setinox, and Atominex. In 2017, a generic version was approved in the United States.

## Research

There has been some suggestion that atomoxetine might be a helpful adjunct in people with major depression, particularly in cases with concomitant ADHD.
Atomoxetine may be used in those with ADHD and bipolar disorder although such use has not been well established. Some benefit has also been seen in people with ADHD and autism. As with other norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors it appears to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms, although research has focused mainly on specific patient groups such as those with concurrent ADHD or methamphetamine dependence.
