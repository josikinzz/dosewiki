## Subjective Experience

Whilst chaliponga is generally used as an ingredient of ayahuasca, I have occasionally
encountered reports which claimed a degree of success via the route of quidding.

Whilst this sounded unlikely, I decided to experiment regardless, and procured the
requisite material from an online vendor.

I placed the leaves into my cheeks, and held them there whilst they dampened. I held
them and held them, for what seemed to be an eternity. I found it to be extremely
difficult to forget that this stuff was there.

I got little. Perhaps a minor change in headspace materialised but perhaps not.
However, as the leaves are supposed to be fresh, and mine were quite old, the chance
of significant success was always going to be minimal.

This one was filed in the basket: try again if you ever obtain fresh leaves.
