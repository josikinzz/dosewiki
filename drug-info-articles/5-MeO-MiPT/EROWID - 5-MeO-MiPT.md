5-MeO-MIPT
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
5-MeO-MIPT is one of the less common psychedelic tryptamines that was developed by Alexander Shulgin in the 1980s. It shares some similarities with 5-MeO-DIPT (Foxy Methoxy). One of the isopropyl groups of 5-MeO-MIPT is simply exchanged by a one carbon (methyl) chain resulting in the most active asymmetrically N-methyl N-isopropyl substitution pattern. 
 
[ [Main 5-MeO-MIPT Vault](https://erowid.org/5meo_mipt.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/5meo_mipt_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of 5-MeO-MIPT is between 2 and 7 mg.
 
Price #
 
In 2015, 5-MeO-MIPT is sold for between $50 - $125 USD per gram at single gram prices. Prices are higher for lower amounts. As with any recreational substance, single dose (7-10mg) prices at events are dependent on the market, but are usually in the $10-20 range.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/5meo_mipt_law.shtml) #
 
5-MeO-MIPT is not specifically controlled in the United States, but could be considered an Analogue of 5-MeO-DIPT, a Schedule I drug, if it were intended for human use.
 
Chemistry #
 
N-isopropyl-5-methoxy-N-methyl-tryptamine (5-MeO-MiPT) is a synthetic chemical tryptamine and thus is structurally related to other tryptamines (natural and synthetic), such as 5-MeO-DMT, N,N-DMT, psiloc(yb)in and serotonin.

History #
 
The first publication of the synthesis and pharmacology of this compound was in 1985 in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry by Repke, Grotjahn & Shulgin [ [article](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6540) ].
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
5-MeO-MIPT.
 
The Experience:
 
Tripping.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/5meo_mipt_effects.shtml) #
 
Oral 5-MeO-MIPT has some similarities with 5-MeO-DIPT. Users have reported aphrodisiac effects, minor changes in visual perception, mental stimulation, new perspectives, feelings of insight, emotional shifts, muscle tension, and mild tremor. The body load seems to be milder than with 5-MeO-DIPT. Sometimes there is a tendency of dreamy separation of mind and body as with 5-MeO-DMT. With the smoking route, more visuals and a "rush" are reported.
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently the user has eaten, oral 5-MeO-MIPT generally takes 10-20 minutes to start to take effect. Smoked freebase usually comes on within seconds.
 
Duration #
 
Due to the small number of reports and a wide variation in reported durations for this chemical, it is difficult to give reliable estimates of length of action. Some users have reported effects completely abating within 4-6 hours, while others have reported residual stimulation and inability to sleep for several additional hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Some users report unpleasant body effects or "body load". Unpleasant stomach effects, gastro-intestinal distress (diarrhea, cramps & gas) are not uncommon. In some cases there are difficulties with falling asleep for some hours after having returned to baseline, but there is less stimulation and body load than with 5-MeO-DIPT. There are cases of cardiac problems (tachycardia and pain), especially after high doses (over 10 mg). Other possible negative effects are difficult experiences as possible with nearly all psychedelics. The [Psychedelic Crisis FAQ](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml) addresses some of the issues involved in dealing with a difficult trip.
 
Contraindications #
 
- 5-MeO-MIPT and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of 5MeO-MIPT unpredictably. Taking this chemical while on prescription MAOIs is strongly discouraged. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 5-MeO-MIPT as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems. Combining multiple psychoactive tryptamines, such as taking 4-oxygenated tryptamines (e.g. psilocybin, 4-AcO-DIPT, 4-AcO-MIPT) with 5-oxygenated ones such as 5-MeO-MIPT or 5-MeO-DIPT, may lead to unexpected potentiation of the action of each substance. This means that low doses of each, in combination, may produce an unexpectedly strong action. Individuals with seizure or convulsive disorders or heart problems may be at higher risk for health problems when taking psychedelics. Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar closely, as there have been some reports of problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
As with most psychedelics 5-MeO-MIPT seems to be neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependence. But As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 5-MeO-MIPT use. Using it two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.

DESCRIPTION #
 
The effects of 5-MeO-MIPT (oral) have been described as somewhere between the effects of 5-MeO-DIPT (Foxy) and 5-MeO-DMT, without being a combination of the two. Reported effects vary dramatically from sleepy to speedy and from sense enhancing to mind-numbing. 
 
 Users describe a speedy body load, predominantly at the beginning of the experiment and a kind of 5-MeO-DMT like dissociation rather at the end. The turned on body load in some people enhances erotic qualities as with 2-CB or 5-MeO-DIPT (Foxy). Some visual effects are reported, especially at higher doses (10 mg and above). Enhanced pleasure when listening to music seems to be common. 
 
 In many cases, 5-MeO-MIPT in rather low doses up to 5 mgs is reported to be smooth, relaxing, friendly and sense enhancing. It is reported to produce emotionally lability. Some experience the coming up period as being somewhat cold and shivery. To prevent dehydration drink a lot during the experiment. 
 
 Smoked, it can produce a rush including trippiness. Visual effects are more often reported when smoked than after oral ingestion. The acute rushing phase lasts about 30 min and then declines slowly producing a trippy feeling for the next few hours, with baseline reached in 6-7 hrs. So the total duration of smoked-5-MeO-MIPT is comparable to an oral dose experiment in higher doses. 
 
 As with other entheogens, it is unsafe to drive or use dangerous equipment with 5-MeO-MIPT because it affects attention span, visual acuity, concentration, and coordination.

5-MeO-MIPT is a tryptamine that has been compared to both 5-MeO-DIPT and 5-MeO-DMT. It is usually taken orally, though smoking/vaporizing of the freebase form has been reported. Some people appear to be significantly more sensitive to 5-MeO-MIPT than others.

5-MeO-MIPT is uncontrolled in the United States. This means it is generally considered legal to buy, possess, and distribute (sell, trade or give).
