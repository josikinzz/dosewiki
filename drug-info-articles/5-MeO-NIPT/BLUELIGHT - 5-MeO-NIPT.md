I really like a few of them such as 5-MeO-MiPT, but in general I agree with you.

In my opinion 5-meo-nipt sounds just about as exciting as 5-meo-eipt ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)


Why aren't they making 4-ho-MPT. Everybodys been pining for it since it was last available.

Right! I knew I wasn't the only one thinking this. If your gonna spend money on custom synths why not invest in a more well tolerated tryptamine. 5-MEO's have notoriously bad bodyloads and that alone puts people off. Out of all the 5-MEO's I've  tried (-DIPT, -DALT, -MIPT, -DMT) all of them sucked. I agree with xorky that the MIPT varient was the best but it still sucked compared to any other simple or 4-sub. During a benzo blackout I accidently ordered 5-meo-mipt instead of miprocin so this time I have.enough material to explore different doses and ROA's but even if I find my sweet spot I doubt it would impress me, maybe I could be wrong...I sure hope I am or else I've lost faith in 5-meo's. I would also like to see 5-MEO-MET re-emerge as I would probably give that one a shot. I also wonder what 4-HO/ACO-MALT would feel like but I sure as hell ain't buying 5-MEO-MALT

They might be shit but there cheap

Its easier to sell cheap shit than expencive quality

Im basing this on 4aco dalt being 8 times the cost of 5meo dalt

I here its a lot better but still vendors choice 5meo cos it makes more profit

Yeah but that's because your in the UK and the only 4-sub you guys have access to is one that's active in huge doses. For other countries 4-subs are VERY affordable, for example I can get 9 full doses of 4-aco-dmt for way less than the price of a quarter of shrooms which can either be one super trip or two alright trips. It's unfortunate you guys only have the DALT series as far as 4-subs go, if you had easy, legal acces to other members of the series you would change your mind, for many 5-meo's are simply the inferior poduct and it's obviously not easier to sell "cheap shit" if you look at the track record of the last two 5-meo-flops.

I for one think the 5-meo-tryptamines are underrated. There are already a wide variety of 4-sub tryps available I'm glad that they're exploring a few other avenues. 5-meo-mipt,5-meo-dmt,5-meo-met all rate highly for me. It's unfair to classify a whole substitution pattern as inferior because of your personal preference.

Have you read this thread? I'm not alone, I don't think there's any denying that 5-meo's are less tolerated and carry more adverse effects than 4-subs. Glad your getting what you want though, all the power to you. Obviously if they're "under-rated" then there's others who feel the same way I do. I could just as easily say there's enough 5-meo tryptamines out on the market.

I think that's the thing though, before recently the only 5-meo's people had much experience with were 5-meo-dipt,5-meo-mipt,and 5-meo-dmt. 5-meo-dipt being the most popular and 5-meo-dmt being, well 5-meo-dmt meant that people's opinions were a bit coloured. I haven't actually tried any of the new ones as I've lost most interest in psychedelics but I think you're being a bit quick to dismiss them. At any rate there is an incredible variety of psychedelics available on the market these days so I'm just thankful that I live in a time where I can experience all sorts of different substances. It's not like a new chemical takes away from this variety.

I've never enjoyed ANY 5-meo yet I've enjoyed just about every 4-sub I've tried, I've given the 5-meo's a chance and they all follow the same pattern. Just read experiences on 5-meo-malt and 5-meo-eipt, those were both shit as well so why would I think this chem is gonna be any different? Also, there are more 5-meo's on the market than 4-subs so I don't know where the whole schpeel about there being too many 4-subs is coming from, it's been years since a new 4-sub came out. These are my opinions and I'm entitled to them, I just don't see any sort of potential in this chem but I would love to be proven wrong. It will be the first and only 5-meo that I've found worthwhile if that's the case... While I'm sure there are plenty of 5-meo fans happy to see these chems explored I'm just not one of them and I'm not the only one who feels this way.

I hate to argue about trivialities but there are at least a dozen 4-substituted tryptamines on the market. You're certainly entiteled to your opinion and I can't argue that it's one shared by many others. I just think that certain common characterizations of this class of chemicals are unfair. If you're like me, and get few physical side effects from them, there are some really interesting headspaces to be explored every bit as worthwhile as the 4-sub-tryptamines. I know I'm in the minority with this opinion and it's probably because my experience is not typical but still, I can't help but feel that they were never really given a chance but the "community." If it's any consolation this could be a sign that the corresponding 4-sub chemical will pop up eventually, that's what happened with DALT afterall.

This is a pointless arguement, I have my opinion you have yours, can we agree to disagree? I gave 5-meo's as much of a chance as any other chem and they are shit IMO, end of discussion ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Captain, have you done bufotenine?  It does pack quite a physical load for about the first two minutes, but then it becomes VERY nice...sort of a cross between psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT.  Different stokes for different folks...I just know the legend of bufotenine is very colored by some reports from the 50s and it appears that the type of salt has a huge effect upon how the compound reacts in the body...a salt made from lime though is incredibly psychedelic and deep...and it is very possible some bufotenine analogues could be stellar.

You mean the secretion from toads? Can't say that I have, I was under the impression that the secretion was nothing more than a combination of 5-meo-dmt and some rather toxic chemicals, I believe 5-ho-dmt is the toxic substance or is pure 5-ho-dmt bufotenine? Has 5-ho-dmt ever been isolated and released to the public before? Lol I have no clue but it sounded toxic and worthless when using shulgins trials as reference. Anyways, I didn't enjoy 5-meo-dmt one bit, I felt like I was gonna die in a non-profound not good way, more like in the "hey dummy you done fucked up, you shouldn't have smoked me, now I'm gonna wreak havoc on your circulatory system" kinda way so I've had no intention on smoking an even more toxic version of that. Could be good though but I have no future plans on trying it lol, no thank you.


Also, I should clarify that when I say there are more 5-meo's than 4-subs I meant that the 5-meo series has more variations of simple tryptamines than the 4-sub series if that makes sense, I'm bad at explaining things sometimes. If you split the 4-subs into the two categories then there are indeed more 4-subs by number but had the 4-sub series been 1 class ie. only 4-ho or only 4-aco there would be less variation and exploration in this series ie 2. Wheres the 4-ho/aco-malt, -nipt, -eipt, -amt etc... I'm aware the latter is supposably toxic but tbh if you read the adverse effects shulgin listed for 4-ho-amt the same side-effects can be applied to 5-meo-amt so I wonder if it really is toxic, we'll probably never know.

^ Thank you MGS, Just my thoughts. I really don't understand how Shulgin could write off bufo analogs so quickly because of some reports from the 50s.


Wouldn't be the first time he left an interesting path unexplored, I guess there's only so much time, right?


About the 5-meo's I'd say that foxy/5-meo-DiPT is a pretty worthwhile compound in my opinion. I haven't tried Moxy but I'm sure I'd like that one too. 5-meo-dmt might be too harsh for most (didn't have the balls yet myself) But it *surely* is very fascinating, and it most certainly can't just be written off as garbage.


My gripe with stuff like 5-meo-NiPT and 5-meo-EiPT isn't *just* that they are 5-methoxy's, but that the substitution on the nitrogen sounds fucking boring too. Okay, I wouldn't mind a stab at EiPT or NiPT, for novelties sake. But the 4 sub ones I wouldn't expect much of either.

Off topic here but I'm hearing so much trash talk of 5-meo tryptamines compared to 4-aco/ho substituted tryptamines, so I've tried 5-meo-mipt and 5-meo-dipt. They were both ~alright. Are any of the other 5-meo's worth looking into or are just too vasoconstricting and side effect ridden is what I'm wondering? Don't want to waste my time on more 5-meo if none are any good...

@fagott if you found foxy worthwhile I can almost guarantee you will enjoy moxy, although they were different moxy was just better in every way, it's the only 5-meo that I've found tolerable... well I had one decent foxy experience but the side-effects put me off from ever trying it again.


To the post above, although I'm biased I would say the others you haven't tried are even worse as far as side effects go, I found moxy to be the smoothest of the ones I've tried and even then moxy could be rough at times, I have 100mgs of moxy that I plan on running more trials with so I don't waste it, only reason I have this supply is that I blacked out on alpraz and woke up with a tracking number for this substance lol, maybe fate wants me to give this one another shot.

I liked 5-MeO-DiPT too, but I like 5-MeO-MiPT much better.  It's one of my preferred compounds actually, I never pushed it high (where there are scattered reports of profound experiences) because the low and moderate dosage range is so wonderful.  Great energy, very very light on the body, and a euphoric, alert, contemplative headspace.  Great stuff.

^ xorkoth do you know of any substances that combine well with low/medium dose moxy? I've also read of people recieving profound experiences with high doses but I just feel that there are better compounds for that type of experience and obviously from reading this thread anyone could tell I'm sensitive to the side effects of 5-meo's (particularly tachycardia, diahrea, tremors, and uncomfortable body buzzes) so I plan on keeping my trials within reasonable ranges but I'm wondering if moxy will work best for me as a substance to enhance other psychedelics. I know low dose moxy has a rather pleasant body high but also lacks in visuals and headspace for me, have you ever combined it with any 4-subs or phens?


Ps: I sincerely appologize to the OP, I've REALLY set this thread up for derailment and there's yet to be anyone commenting on the substance this thread was created for, 5-meo-nipt. As an apology I will spend some time trying to dig up what I can on this new chem so I can add something usefull in this thread for once ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

**Well as promised I scoured the net for info on this chem but its rather scarce: this site has a couple of our posts on this chem but also  has reviews from reddit as well.**


** Link to info below apparently sources so I deleted it.**


"had that the other day. it was pretty interesting. i took way too much, it turns out, something like 20mg, but no problems. started out with kind of a body high. i spent most of the time playing my drum, then got a lot more mellow. just sat back and relaxed. tended to drift in conversation then forget what i was talking about. was a pretty interesting time"

**Only TR I've found on 5-meo-nipt, doesn't sound TOO bad but who knows if this report is legit, it is reddit afterall.**


"This particular compound is most definitely not “new”. Back a few years ago (well, okay…maybe more than a few now) this was making the rounds in some circles. Never got my hands on it however.


Anyways, SAR leads me to believe that this wouldn’t be all too great of a psychedelic. I mean, it’s an N-monoalkylated tryp, whathca expect? "

**Has this chem been released before? I doubt it as there's practically zero info on it.**


**Then there's this which is pretty worthless:**

[http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=164228892](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=164228892)


**Besides this all I could find was that it's a 5-meo-dipt metabolite, I guess were just gonna have to wait for the guinea pigs to write up more reports.**

^ That first link should probably be edited out due to sourcery.


Like you I can't say I'm particularly excited about this. I do occasionally enjoy 5-MeO-MiPT but other than that I'll go with the general consensus that 5-MeO's aren't particularly enjoyable.

Different stokes for different folks...I just know the legend of bufotenine is very colored by some reports from the 50s and it appears that the type of salt has a huge effect upon how the compound reacts in the body...a salt made from lime though is incredibly psychedelic and deep...and it is very possible some bufotenine analogues could be stellar.

Ohh okay after reading your informative post over again I didn't realize that the type of salt affects the overall effects. Also another thing worth noting is that shulgin did his trial intraveniously so who knows, maybe IV route just isn't ths way to go and couple that with using the wrong salt could easily explain his "miss-trials". What form of bufotenin do you use MGS? toad venom, pure 5-ho-dmt, or yopo seeds? 


Maybe I should actually give this this one a shot. Would you recomend toasting some yopo seeds(all I have access to), crushing them into powder and add some lime juice and snort away? Would this give me an idea of what bufotenine has to offer? How many seeds will I need to consume to have a moderate +++? Who knows, now that I know this I can kinda see why exploring the 5-ho trypts may have some hidden gems, now I'm on the same page as fagott. Again, thanks for that post but If you would be kind enough to answer my questions or add any other tips to ensure I get the most out of 5-ho-dmt I would REALLY appreciate it. Color me interested, I'll give this one a shot ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

And I have never even tried the fabled 'calcium' form.  So far, just heating the beans till popping, deshelling, mashing to paste, drop water and baking soda, heat till dry....is enough for me to taste enough that...yeah this is a badass psychedelic.  With baking soda, I suspect I am not fully base-ifying it because there is a 'bodyload' that starts upon exhaling and lasts a minute or two until the visionary effects begin...but it goes right away.  Fully based bufotenine does not seem to produce this (so I read.)

No experience with snorting the bean snuff but it for sure sounds like the most 'hard core' and 'authentic' means of taking it.  As the below texts shows, these are potent little things, 3 or 4 beans prepared as below is enough for full effects.


I never had enough to bother trying to get pure crystals, but last time I did take a few grams of the snuff, soaked in dry acetone, filtered, and evaporated on parsley for a much easier way to smoke bufotenine and it was very successful.


PS..it isn't lime juice you want, you need 'pickling lime' aka calcium hydroxide.  Found in any grocery store in the canning section.


Fuck, nursing a serious broken heart.  Everything reminds me of the thing I ended today, first time I got the beans I shared it with K and so naturally that night is in my head.  Sometimes it would have just been easier to have been born horrendously disfigured with a personality to match.  It is always something, or well at least there are drugs to make me feel better, or perhaps another go with ibogaine will be a wake up call I need....until summertime when I started 'dating' again I was VERY happy and secure being single..I really need to get back there again.


Done, thanks for reading.

Wow so this stuff has some real potential huh? Thanks for your reply and the heads-up on the calcium hydroxide. Maybe I'll place an order and start off by smoking then move onto insufflation as I would imagine it to be painfully uncomfortable. So to be straight when going for the smoked route I wanna use sodium bicarbonate and NOT calcium hydroxide? Also how much baking soda is required for smoked? How much calcium hydroxide should be enough for insufflation?

Well, the experience is like a cross between psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT.  In fact, a recent paper shows that bufotenine once in the brain is actually converted to 5-MeO-DMT, and back.  It will exist in a state of both at times, I'll dig up the paper tomorrow.

Wow I took a look at those pieces of art and their beautiful. That technique you discovered is very sexy and abstract (my favorite art). I've never seen such beatiful brushstrokes, keep up the good work man cuz your definately talented. How did you manage to blend the colors so well on a tiny 5x5 surface? Either way your style of art has a very psychedelic twist that really draws me in..

And we could hang out with Delsyd and Karma and Bob Loblaw lives here too.

Not something I'm really interested in, but not all 5-meo tryptamines are bad. I thought 5-meo-mipt was quite nice in the 15-25mg range although once I got to around 20mg it did produce some nausea. At the time, my blood pressure would normally run in the 140s/90s and a 30mg dose had it above 160/100 for a short time (the worst part of the come up until I peaked). My pulse went above 100 during the come up but dropped down to the 80s and 90s once I reached the peak.


5-meo-dmt sounds awesome and I really want to try it.

5-meo-dalt doesn't seem psychedelic to me unless I take a really high dose. One of those times I blacked out and apparently was freaking the fuck out thinking I was dying for about 1.5 hours. Low doses were boring. Don't like it.

5-meo-amt is not a very good psychedelic until you take it at levels that are way above Tikhal's dose range. Take enough for a real trip and you'll feel sick for 2-3 hours as you slowly peak. You'll puke your guts up. You can get around it by splitting it into 3 or 4 doses but then you have to take a little extra - 20-25mg instead of 14-16mg, and it still is not as good as most other psychedelics.


I did hear some good things about 5-meo-met a few years ago but never found a vendor. I might try that one but not much interest in 5-meo-nipt or malt. If I got some for free or could buy a gram for $20 I guess I'd try them. I'd much rather see what 25E-NBOMe or methallylescaline are like (need to read about them first).


I'd love to see some new 4-ho-tryptamines like others here. I've been interested in 4-ho-amt forever (wikipedia says side effects are similar to 5-meo-amt but I remember reading somewhere that it was extremely visual and maybe it would have some unique properties) and I'd be happy to try 4-ho-aet. Or an ALEPH (I know, those aren't tryptamines).

Heh, funny, I just re-read that earlier when this thread popped up again. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I was being serious though.  I have no doubt we'd get along great.

Yeah no doubt, your probably my favorite bluelighter ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif). Too busy with work in such to travel though. I think this was the day I blacked out after taking aMT and etizolam and most of my moxy vanished... there's something fishy about releasers and etizolam that causes me to break the blackout threshold very easily.

You may be onto something there, when I blacked out of 2mg of etizolam I was also on ~100mg of MDMA.

Same thing with 5-APB, I mean I've taken etiz with APB's and aMT plenty of times with no problem but out of the blue my average dose of etiz will send me into blackout mode. Strange stuff... I don't think I've ever blacked out on etiz only, maybe some amnesia but that's about it. Actually now that I think about it there was this other aMT trip where I thought I fell asleep but I left "clues" that I was still awake ie. The tv channel was changed, left food and dishes out, and was laying on my back propped up with two pillows which I never do.

I gotta say back when I was a heavy benzo abuser and would blackout often and badly on the regular, so much that it was etc. I had a vicious blackout that really stands out in my mind on MDMA and Alprazolam, probably the worst black out I remember if you get what im saying, scares me to think about what would have happened if I didnt have good friends with me. also lost my phone and had to go all over town trying to remember where i had been to no avail. 


as for 5-MeO-NiPT, I agree what a waste making that when you could be making a 4 sub- whatever. oh well, still got a good amount of those I havent delved into yet. Just the descriptions of all the 5-meo's sound nasty, (there was one I wanted to try pre 2C ban, eh slightly wanted to try) Im prone to nasty side effects all ready the 5-meo's just seem like a family that would not sit well with me.

I wouldn't expect many 5MeOs to be great but some do like some of them; many like 5meo-Mipt and 5meO-Dalt for example but that is much beside the point for me which is more the sense of enquiry which Shulgin never lost - what will it do and why? I suppose it comes down to whether you favour the potential kicks or the "science" more - most things I can at least have one intersting trial of although obviously I would favour better things but I still find the whole thing fascinating...I haven't tried this but how does it compare with 5MeO-MiPT, 5meO-NMT and then those to 5MeO-iMPT and so on

5-MeO-MET was divine stuff, mostly like MET/5-MeO-DMT hybrid.  Same warm blue colors of MET but far more potent.  Little to no bodyload or PNS nonsense like most of the other 5-MeOs cause.  The only other one I have tried with any regularity and enjoyed was 5-MeO-MiPT (vaporized) which is *alright* but nothing great.  I have some 5-MeO-DPT but never got around to sampling it...perhaps one day.

5MeO-DMT is top notch - I'd take you up on MET or 5MeO-MET - just saying I understand why people don't expect much from this catagory - I didn't get much fun off 5Me0-MiPT which a lot like (maybe didn't take enough) 5MeO-DALT was good enough for a few goes etc. Tastes vary but the search should continue not just based on individual opinion but just for knowledge.

Well yeah, but I don't consider 5-MeO-DMT a '5-MeO'...to me it is simply *the sacrament*.  All of the synthetics are in a whole other categorization system.

I have tried this beautiful compound a few times in the past, but always in combination with other substances, and it truly blew me away. I combined it with 5-MeO-MALT both times, so I'm not sure how it is on its own. I also very irresponibly tried it together with diphenidine, had some weird body sensations at some times (which isn't abnormal for these substances) but also the most beautiful open-eyed visuals ever. 


Soon I will bio-assay the NiPT on its own and I will try and write a nice trip report for you all. I hope this compound resurfaces the market so anyone can try ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

5-meo-dmt is one of my magical triad. It´s a category on itself. So different to the rest, so powerful and versatile. I can understand is not an easy one so its not suited for the faint of heart...


It´s the only psych that I have had some kind of addiction as well. During a brief time I was vaporizing it most of the nights. Quickly I understood I was raping the spirit of the molecule and my own spirit abusing that way and I just stopped. I haven´t vaporized it again and now only use it sparely, maybe once in a month of two, using the nasal route, with I find way more healthier and less fiendish. As I wrote this Im thinking that maybe plugged or taken oreal with an imao can be even more healthy.


Sorry for derailing the thread, but all the hate to 5-meo´s and that one in particular was kind of disrespectful for a family of magestatic compounds

So, has anyone actuality assayed the title compound?


I'm very curious about tryptamines derivatives with a single alkyl substitution on the amine, regardless of additional functional group's. Given the (relatively) bulky nature of the iP moiety, this seems like a reasonably canidate; at least given my admittedly lacking chemistry and pharmacological knowledge.

Curious... removing a carbon chain to only have one is something that seems to not have been explored much.  Though given NMT's relative inactivity, it doesn't seem too promising.
