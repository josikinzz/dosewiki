## Subjective Experience

JWH-018 was the first artificial cannabinoid I sampled, and was procured under the
original brand name of Spice. This was sold under the auspices of potpourri, and
marked clearly as “Not for human consumption”.

From 2006 onwards, the spice brand became increasingly well known. The
manufacturers leveraged this advantage with an entire family of related products:
Spice Gold, Spice Arctic Synergy, Spice Diamond, Spice Tropical Synergy, and so
forth.

The active synthetics used also varied. Along with JWH-018, I sampled JWH-073,
and I believe, CP-47.

So dominant was this brand that spice was eventually to be used by many as a
generic term for all artificial cannabinoids.

At the time, such compounds had a fairly unblemished reputation, with little or no
association with the sort of horror stories which would eventually emerge. In relative
terms, JWH-018 was also to prove to be one of the less harmful chemicals in this
class. That is not to say, of course, that it wasn't corrosive in its own right. It was.

On face value, it was an attractive proposition: a cannabis type experience, via a
smokable herb, with a pleasant non-cannabis type odour, making it suitable for
consumption in public. Its bright packaging and obvious popularity enhanced the
illusion of safety, and I naively consumed far too much of it.

For all the positives, there was always the feeling of artificiality: that this was a
chemical and not a natural plant. That feeling was never far away.

In addition, the wealth of subtlety and variation that came with the infinite number
of cannabis strains was absent. The experience was fairly standard, at least during
those early years.

From my perspective, it was close enough to meeting certain demands, but not
engaging enough to become a constant or frequent habit. Unfortunately this did not
apply to everyone.

JWH-018 was classified in the UK under the Misuse of Drugs Act at the end of 2009,
and in the United States during the summer of 2012. What was to replace it,
however, was a slippery slope of ever stronger, ever more toxic chemicals, with the
inevitable consequences in terms of public safety.

JWH-018 (1-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole, NA-PIMO or AM-678) is an analgesic chemical from the naphthoylindole family that acts as a full agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, with some selectivity for CB2. It produces effects in animals similar to those of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a cannabinoid naturally present in cannabis, leading to its use as synthetic cannabinoid products that, in some countries, are sold legally as "incense blends".
As a full agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, this chemical compound is classified as an analgesic medication. The analgesic effects of cannabinoid ligands, mediated by CB1 receptors are well established in treatment of neuropathic pain, as well as cancer pain and arthritis.
These compounds work by mimicking the body's naturally-produced endocannabinoid hormones such as 2-AG and anandamide (AEA), which are biologically active and can exacerbate or inhibit nerve signaling. As the cause is poorly understood in chronic pain states, more research and development must be done before the therapeutic potential of this class of biologic compounds can be realized.

## History

John W. Huffman, an organic chemist at Clemson University, synthesized a variety of chemical compounds that affect the endocannabinoid system. JWH-018 is one of these compounds, with studies showing an affinity for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor five times greater than that of THC.
On 15 December 2008, it was reported by German pharmaceutical companies that JWH-018 was found as one of the active components in at least three versions of the grey market drug Spice, which has been sold as an incense in a number of countries around the world since 2006. An analysis of samples acquired four weeks after the German prohibition of JWH-018 took place found that the manufacturers had shortened the alkyl chain by one carbon to circumvent the ban.

## Pharmacology

JWH-018 is a full agonist of both the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, with a reported binding affinity of 9.00 ± 5.00 nM at CB1 and 2.94 ± 2.65 nM at CB2. JWH-018 has an EC50 of 102 nM for human CB1 receptors, and 133 nM for human CB2 receptors. JWH-018 produces bradycardia and hypothermia in rats at doses of 0.3–3 mg/kg, suggesting potent cannabinoid-like activity.
In synthetic cannabinoids, the switch to being a full agonist, increases the activation towards extending its psychoactivity and not regulating but also extending central nervous-activity anymore, to be more selective (CB1). This is meaning an activation of the central nervous system. Therefore, indirectly activating dopaminerelease in the cortexareas of the frontal brain. This is meaning, that it is activating and so, is being dopaminerg. 
Therefore, it can induce potent dopaminergic and hypnotic states with JWH-018 being heavy sedative with a binding affinity of 9.0 KnM.

### Pharmacokinetics

Metabolism of JWH-018 was assessed using Wistar rats which had been administered an ethanolic extract containing JWH-018. Urine was collected for 24 hours, followed by extraction of JWH-018 metabolites using both liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction. GC-MS was utilized to separate and identify the extracted compounds. JWH-018 and its N-dealkylated metabolite were only detected in small amounts, with hydroxylated N-dealkylated metabolites comprising the primary signal. The observed mass shift indicates that it is likely that hydroxylation occurs in both the naphthalene and indole portions of the molecule. Human metabolites were similar although most metabolism took place on the indole ring and pentyl side chain, and the hydroxylated metabolites were extensively conjugated with glucuronide. When inhaled, the median half-life of JWH-018 is 1.69 hours.

## Recreational use

At least one case of JWH-018 dependence has been reported by the media. The user consumed JWH-018 daily for eight months.  Withdrawal symptoms were more severe than those experienced as a result of cannabis dependence. JWH-018 has been shown to cause profound changes in CB1 receptor density following administration, causing desensitization to its effects more rapidly than related cannabinoids.
On 15 October 2011, Anderson County coroner Greg Shore attributed the death of a South Carolina college basketball player to "drug toxicity and organ failure" caused by JWH-018. A November 2011 email concerning the case was released in December 2011 under the Freedom of Information Act after multiple requests to see the information had been denied.
Compared to THC, which is a partial agonist at CB1 receptors, JWH-018, and many synthetic cannabinoids, are full agonists. JWH-018 may cause intense anxiety, agitation, and in rare cases, has been assumed to have been the cause of seizures and convulsions. JWH-018 and analogs of it may present serious dangers to the user when used to excess.
Various physical and psychological adverse effects have been reported from JWH-018 use. One study reported psychotic relapses and anxiety symptoms in well-treated patients with mental illness following JWH-018 inhalation. Due to concerns about the potential of JWH-018 and other synthetic cannabinoids to cause psychosis in vulnerable individuals, it has been recommended that people with risk factors for psychotic disorders, such as a past or family history of psychosis, not use these substances.

## Detection in biological fluids

JWH-018 usage is readily detected in urine using "spice" screening immunoassays from several manufacturers focused on both the parent drug and its omega-hydroxy and  carboxyl metabolites. JWH-018 will not be detected by older methods employed for detecting THC and other cannabis terpenoids.  Determination of the parent drug in serum or its metabolites in urine has been accomplished by GC-MS or LC-MS. Serum JWH-018 concentrations are generally in the 1–10 μg/L range during the first few hours after recreational usage. The major urinary metabolite is a compound that is monohydroxylated on the omega minus one carbon atom of the alkyl side chain. A lesser metabolite monohydroxylated on the omega (terminal) position was present in the urine of six users of the drug at concentrations of 6–50 μg/L, primarily as a glucuronide conjugate.
