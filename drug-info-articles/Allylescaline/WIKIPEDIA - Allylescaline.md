Allylescaline (AL), or allylmescaline, also known as 4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and scaline families related to mescaline. It is taken orally.
The drug acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It is closely related to other scalines including mescaline, escaline, and proscaline, among others.
Allylescaline was first described in the scientific literature by Otakar Leminger in 1972. Subsequently, it was further described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). It was encountered as a novel designer drug in 2013.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, the dose range of allylescaline is 20 to 35 mg and its duration is 8 to 12 hours. Its onset ranged from 10 minutes to 50 minutes, with peak effects occurring at around 1 to 1.25 hours. The drug has been described as having a very gradual onset, an unusually long plateau of effects, a very gradual descent, and some effects persisting past 12 hours or even into the middle of the next day. Allylescaline is about 10 times as potent as mescaline, which has a listed dose range of 200 to 400 mg. It was the most potent scaline (mescaline analogue) of all those described.
The effects of allylescaline have been reported to include perceptual changes, warmer and enhanced colors, objects looking different or more "plastic", colorful hallucinations in the dark, surroundings being much more interesting than usual, no sharpening of the senses including visual, auditory, or olfactory, pleasantly and abundantly increased energy, creative and free-flowing thoughts, clearheadedness, unusual ease of free association, everything feeling funny and laughter, feelings of inner excitement and enjoyment, desire to move, simultaneous positive and negative feelings, working through and being freed of depression, feelings of dissociation and being disconnected from one's thoughts, wholly social and no requirement of withdrawal, religious feelings and connection, slight vertigo, light drunkenness, restless sleep and unusual and difficult dreams during sleep, and next-day hangover such as lethargy.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Allylescaline acts as a potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It also possesses other activities, such as weak interactions with dopamine D2-like receptors. A 2021 study evaluated the pharmacodynamics of many scalines, but did not include allylescaline. However, a subsequent 2025 study comprehensively assessed and reported the drug's pharmacodynamics.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of allylescaline has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of allylescaline include mescaline, escaline, proscaline, methallylescaline, cyclopropylmescaline, and 3C-AL, among others.

## History

Allylescaline was first synthesized and studied by Otakar Leminger in 1972. The drug was later synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and further described in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). It was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2013.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Sweden

Allylescaline is illegal in Sweden as of January 2016.

#### United States

Allylescaline is not directly scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act. However, due to its structural similarities with mescaline, it could potentially be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act if sold for human consumption.
