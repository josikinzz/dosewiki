Fair.  It typically gets lumped together with benzos when people refer to it as a recreational drug though, which is why I felt it might fit there better.  


I don't know about any of this though.

i don't really find this a recreational drug, although some people seem to report some 'recreational' effects when first using. i put recreational in the little '' marks 'cause from what i have read these effects seem to be just drowsiness similar to things like low doses of anti-histamines, not any real euphoria or high. however everyone is different and different people enjoy different things, and please correct me if you are experiencing other effects from this drug. one thing i have heard repeatedly though is that any effects from it go quickly from regular use, so tolerance to them builds up quickly (regarding any 'recreational' effects, not medicinal ones), and people have reported not getting and of these effects after only a short period of regular use even at high raised doses.  


my personal experience is that after using them (for pain relief) for about three weeks, i was no longer feeling any side effects of drowsiness or others. my body seemed to get used to them in this time.


also my doctor told me (although her advice and info has been dodgy on occasion, but it's worth checking out) that this drug lowers one's seizure threshold, especially in combination with some other drugs, so please research if you are planning on taking high doses. i started off on a lower dose and built up to the 600mg 3 times a day i take now.

Dude, you don't need to make huge bold letters stating to the admins that " gabapentin isn't a benzo". This is common knowledge. Also, NOTHING you listed will make it stronger. It's a pretty crappy drug recreational wise. Your lucky if you get high once.

Your doctors an idiot. Gabapentin is used an anti-epileptic drug.


How would orange juice make it stronger? Vitamin C? Highly doubt it. I was prescribed for 5 years, at 2,300mg a day for EPILEPSY. So there goes the seizure theory. Taking alcohol with it, would maybe make you feel drunker. If you consider that better go for it.

Taking Lyrica to make Neurontin stronger? no.

It MIGHT make the opiate/opioid stronger, but in no way would it make the gabapentin feel stronger.

Thats such a broad term, it's meaningless to me.

Most muscle relaxers aren't recreational. Are you referring to soma? Make your post clear instead of posting things "off the top of my head".

i have just checked and gabapentin  can lower the seizure threshold when taken with various medications, for instance some anti-depressents, so i just thought i was worth mentioning for the sake of harm reduction

I got 50 of these from the doc for nerve pain a couple weeks back.  Slight mood lift at 900- 1500mg, I noticed i was talking more excitedly and on end about things.  I also tried up to 3000mg which caused sedation. Maybe like a low dose benzo 5mg diazepam perhaps.  But relly has no recreational potential.. The best those 6 pills will do will give a mild mood lift which i doubt you'l notice if your trying to get a high on

I'm RX'ed 1,800mgs of Gabapentin a day and tolerance builds VERY fast...


My first 3 days on Neurontiin, I fell in love...The experience was almost like that of a benzo, but more stimulating...social interaction was forced and enhanced, quality of sleep was profound, just an overall less anxious feeling...


It's now 3 months later, and after that 3 days, I haven't experienced anything close to that initial feeling..even in doses as high as 3-4 grams...


If you don't have a tolerance to gabapentin than a dose of over 1,000 mgs will be similar to that of a low dose of GHB or a stimulating yet disorienting inebriation similar to that off benzos or even soma....


I'm currently trying to taper off my dose so I can lower my tolerance and use gabapentin like a benzo for situational anxiety...

Ah, I thought you were referring to gabapentin on its own. Thank god I'm no longer on gabapentin for epilepsy because it is just too weak compared to other anti-convulsive.

Wrong, this drug does have recreational value. More than benzos IMO, at least I find neurontin fun and interesting while benzos are boring and make me fall asleep.


It depends on the person, this is one of the best social drugs I've ever taken. Better than adderal, it helps you be calm, social, energetic but not ampy-feeling with body tense and too focused to the point of OCD.

2muchpain says something worth looking into.


At least combined with Remeron (mirtazapine), this definitely seems to be true.

I am on methadone and its kinda hard to get high off of it anymore.. Recently I was prescribed neurontin because a couple people told me it goes great with methadone.  So I talked my doctor into giving it to me and I dosed it at the same time as my meth and I was getting rushes of euphoria for an hour or two.. Gabentin is an odd drug. I am not even sure that anyone knows how it works.. It doesnt have any afininity for most of the known receptor sites. They found with radioactive dye that it has some action in the hypocampus sp but who knows.. If your on methadone give it a try.. It gives a couple of warning on several different interactions and one of them is MORPHINE . Also it increases that AUC of hydrocodone.

I came across a DICK load of gabapentin... long story, but i had like 200g lying around and i have experimented with it many times. 3g plus couple of beers and im completely wasted... myoclonus, ataxia, slurred speech. Not all that recreational. 


I find if i split the doses by an hour or so, i get more out of it. Its an interesting buzz, especially with a billy or two. 


And for some reason, having a cigarette after a large dose has kicked enhances the effects. 


Still i think pregabalin is the way to go... if you like just being wasted that is

**The Gabapentin (Neurontin) Mega THREAD!**


Hey!!!! Let me tell you some stuff about Gabapentin(Neurontin).

**What is it?-**Gabapentin (Neurontin) is a GABA analogue. It was originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy, and currently, Gabapentin is widely used to relieve pain, especially neuropathic pain.


![220px-Gabapentin_3D.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F7%2F7b%2FGabapentin_3D.png%2F220px-Gabapentin_3D.png&hash=7d86e4c09b9b081d2a2236657dc7d2de)


**So why was it made?**Gabapentin was initially synthesized to mimic the chemical structure of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but is not believed to act on the same brain receptors.**Sounds a lot like GHB/GBL****GHB-gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, a neuroprotective and depressant drug**&**GBL-gamma-Butyrolactone** Hmmmm.. They sound very alike!

**What's it feel like?-**It varies from person to person. I don't want to tell you to go out and take 2500+mg.. Begin with a low dose to see how it effects you. I'm no MD but I can tell you that if it's your first time you should begin with 1-3 to begin with (900mg). It has the same sort of effect's of xanax, ghb, and hydrocodone. With a THC buzz. It makes me feel really dream like, and smooth high. When I take high doses I tend to drop things, and have a small twitching problem. 

**Best way to take it!-**I don't want you to go and do this to every gabapen capsule you have. I normally will empty the contents of the capsules into a square of toilet paper and parachute it. It tastes **WORST** than ecstasy/mdma! Gabapentin tastes horable!!! So be sure to swallow it before it bust's open in your mouth!

**Cool things about Gabapentin!-**There have been reports by methamphetamine addicts that gabapentin alone in doses of 1200 mg at bedtime taken for 40–60 days has been effective in reducing the withdrawal symptoms and almost eliminating cravings or desire to use methamphetamine. It also helps those addicted to prescribed pain medications and takes away withdrawal symptoms.

**Is it addictive?**-Yes, it is. it's withdrawl effects are verry similar to benzo/alocohol withdrawl symptoms. (Only after long term use.)

**So what's it feel like again...?-**Although gabapentin is not a controlled substance, it does produce psychoactive effects that could lead to recreational use of the drug. However, it is widely regarded as having little or no potential for misuse. Pregabalin, a gabapentinoid with higher potency marketed for neuropathic pain, is a controlled substance, under Schedule V of the United States' Controlled Substances Act.

Recreational use of gabapentin produces a varying number of effects including euphoria, appetite stimulation, incessant talking, physical and mental stimulation which result in varying degrees of drug-induced productivity. Diarrhea/stomach discomfort is commonly reported with heavy use.

*Gabapentin is close to pregabalin(lyrica)*

If you have any questions, comments, complaints, or what you experience with gabapentin, please let us know!!!!

I want to mention that tolerance builds EXTREMELY rapidly with this one. I had around 180 300 mg pills a couple years ago, and started out taking 900-1200 mg at a time to get the weird benzo-ish effects. Within a couple of weeks I was up to 3000 mg at a time just to feel anything.

Man, I appreciate your sentiments and respect opinions but I'm sorry, I disagree.  I'm certainly not familiar w/ your drug use so please forgive me, but have you taken much xanax and/or especially hydrocodone?  


I used to take considerable amounts of neurontin while in opiate withdrawals and I had also taken it by itself, before I had a physical opiate addiction.  I'd compare it more to a very very mild muscle relaxer w/ little sedative effects and ultimately just makes me (and others I've talked to) feel strange, kind of creepy.  Makes you a little off balance and clumsy.  Pillidamors nailed it I think  *"started out taking 900-1200 mg at a time to get the weird benzo-ish effects"

* 

Everyone's different, that's for sure ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Neurontin may very well affect you in a positive way.   I think the reason it has little or no potential for abuse is simply because it produces little or no desired effects.   I would venture to say those of you out there that are curious, provided you have a good tolerance and enjoy harder drugs and enjoy noticeable effects, neurontin will be a waste of time (it did nothing for opiate wd's either)  Perhaps if you're a little more naive and intolerant to harder drugs, neurontin may produce some desirable effects, but none that I can list IME

Oddly, I actually enjoy neurontin. I stray towards the harder side of drugs I suppose, being on heroin and all, but neurontin, while not quite as enjoyable as benzos, gives me some of the wackier effects, and even a little bit of music-related euphoria or CEVs at higher dosages or when mixed with opiates. But for most people, I don't see it having much potential for recreation or abuse...I'm just lucky with my neurobiology, I suppose.

What's funny is that I was tripping today in class. I kept seeing swirls on my paper while taking notes. It was a weird trippy feeling.

Drugs effect people differently, I believe at high doses of anything your going to get some kind of buzz.

It actually makes opiates kind of enjoyable!  You get really weird OEVs/CEVs with this one and opiates.  It's sort of a mix between blurred vision and the kind of visuals you get when you've taken too much MDA.


Er, on its own it's a pretty mild-moderate sedative.  Not terribly interesting, similar to antihistimines but slightly less sedating.  I'm not sure I'd consider it addictive.


Pregabalin is pretty much like gabapentin except much more fun in every way.

Exacttly! I get those same OEV and CEV on it! The OEV makes me see swirles, like whirl pools in my notebook paper, and computer screens. The CEV is Insane! If i'm laying there in my bed, feels like i'm on a roller coaster, Lot's of diffrent scenes and the body fuck makes it feel realastic.

Not bad for 2000mg.

Now my tollerance is fucked. It's like you can only be high on them once every 2 weeks.

Yep, I've had full blown hallucinations from it. Mostly in dim light or no light, whereby lamps and other vertical objects turn into trees...welcome to the jungle, population me.


The CEVs that I've gotten from it seem to synch up to music at times as well, which is an effect I normally only get with DXM.

Neurontin is in its own twisted world. I know that it is nothing compared 2 codiene or all of codienes like alkoids but still it gives me the nod feeling. Yeah i take a lot. I would just begin low.

**GABA with OPIATES**


I was scripted 100  300 milligram gaba's recently for nerve pain.  It has some uses, but not for nerve pain i'll say that.   I started out taking 300mg 3x daily with no results except increased appetite..  So i pick up my next script & decide to push the envelope.  I took 3grams with 20mg of Morphine & let me tell you guys n girls this was a fuckin hot 1 right off the bat.  It had me floating for about 4 hours & normally low dose morphine only does it for me for 2 hours most.  It certainly wasn't the gaba alone fo sho.  


 I don't wanna keep babbling so i''l check back in a couple days & hope there are some more news/views, experiences with this combo

Yeah, opiates and gabapentin are awesome together. I think I read somewhere a while back that gaba increases the bioavailability of morphine by something like 40%?


I was wondering what you guys thought about the risks of taking copious amounts of gabapentin. I know it can affect the kidneys. Apparently the max dose is 2400mg/day or 3600mg/day, depending on which of my doctors you ask. A friend of mine who is a psychotic pill-popper has taken 24 800mg pills of gaba before, and does at least 10-15 800mgs on a regular basis. Now his kidneys are always fucked up, but who knows if it's actually from the gaba or something else because this kid is a drug garbage disposal.

^ Actually, its backwards - morphine increases the bioavailability of gabapentin. Not as fun, huh? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


In general, opiates [at least the morphine-like ones] increase gabapentin's bioavailability; but gabapentin decreases their bioavailability [hydrocodone for example]. I wouldn't take that trade-off.


Anyone who is considering combining gabapentin with hydrocodone or other similar opioids should keep this in mind.

Gabapentin is one of those "Good for 1 time per month" kind of drugs. Witch I really can't think of any others.. Maybe like salvia? You smoke that shit, and you vow to never smoke it again, and a month rolls by and you smoke some salvia, lol (Trying to put this in some kind of way, work with me here ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) 


..Well for me at least, your different than I am. I did notice that when I took really high doses, and tried to match it a few days later + more I wouldn't feel as high as I did. I did still feel weird, and mostly my hand-thought process was pretty much fucked and I couldn't hold on to a damn thing.


I really don't recommend this until you try it using the full capsules.

Parachute the same amount, this time take the white powder out of the capsules. *I do not want to see you doing this to your entire 90-120** script bottle.*


It will seriously kick in the effect's of virtually any kind of opioid or opioid-like alkaloid. So for you non-Americans hit up your local pharmacy for the codeine/Tylenol pills will pretty much double in strength.

Don't be a dumb ass and this being your first time doing a high mg Oxy, and think that you want to feel even more fucked up. Please don't! ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


**If you think your overdosing from Gabapentin (Neurontin)**

*First thing to do is do not freak out/panic.*( This will increase your heart beat so remain calm dude. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png))

*Second thing, take some fluid's, water, Gatorade, power aid, Pedialyte or any other liquid with a good level of water. Electrolytes will work best getting the fluids to your brain.* *I wouldn't recommend sticking your self with a IV-"saline solution " unless you know what your doing, and still if you notice your bad,* **CALL 911 ASAP! You CANNOT DRIVE if you've taken A LOT of GABAPENTIN!** Not only it's stupid as fuck but ask the other bluelighter's how difficult it was to do normal thing's at high doses. So don't do it! ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

*Third thing, control your blood pressure, and breathing. Like I mentioned above, before you even start to panic, grab some water ASAP and relax. Don't try to go cut the yard, or meet your in-laws/girlfriend's parents for lunch.*

If you notice that the party is getting a little to out of hand call 411 for your local poison Yellow book it ahead of time or call 1-800-222-1222 ( United States Poison Control Center.) 


I noticed someone from London,UK here, so for anyone outside of the United State's please go to [http://www.who.int/ipcs/poisons/centre/directory/euro/en/](http://www.who.int/ipcs/poisons/centre/directory/euro/en/). *They listed about 48 countries that have Poison Control Center number's.* If your country isn't listed use "Google", or contact your local/state/country health services. ( *This might save your life someday so find out what the number is for future reference.*.)


Hope this clear's some questions about Gabapentin/Neurontin.

If your question hasn't been answered I beg you to ask it!!!


Be safe with **ANY DRUG!!**

i was on klonopin 4mg a day for 5 years and taken off a month ago.  neurontin does wonders for my anxiety in the 1200-1800 range.  only been 2 days I am gonna try 1500 again tonight and will see what happens.  I wasn't that impressed thought more would happen.  i love the pulsing energy it gives you.  plus it evens out my bipolar 2.

That's cool Jeah, I was prescribed it for the same reason. Since virtually every hospital around here knows that I'm a drug addict they don't prescribe me any benzo's, which is a good thing.

So do you take 5-6 capsules on average? Do you take it with water,cola,beer or milk?

I'm not trying to play 50 questions, but from my experience taking Neurontin different food's and cola's make the effect's more aware.

I dislike taking it with beer because mixing the two gives me to much of a body high.

I don't see a problem in taking another capsule, just don't make it a habit.

I take 3200 mg a day for bipolar, and it's good on a full stomach with cola. I think that fatty food actually works better but I'm not really sure. My high is nonexistent by now; tolerance develops *quickly* so don't take it more than once every 3 weeks. Otherwise you lose a lot of the trippy effects.


Also it's basically impossible to OD, you'll just get diarrhea and s**t it all out. Don't take more than 7 grams or you're wasting it. Make sure you drink enough water as it will dehydrate you.

D's, I'm not sure if you're aware but they come in more than just 300mg. Actually, I think they make a ridiculous amount of different dosages - 100mg, 200mg, 300mg, 400mg, 600mg, and 800mg.

I was on gabapentin for a while. I got up to a pretty high dose, about 12.000 mg per day. Tolerance builds up very fast on this drug, so it was a dead end for me. Tapered down slowly, but I guess I could have gone cold turkey if I wanted to. 


I was put on gabapentin to try and limit my drug-cravings. It kinda worked for a while, but was not a solution in the long therm.

so i've ruled out taking this with codeine, but how would it effect say tramadol and fentanyl (sublingual)?  i just got a bucketload from my doctor an am interested in trying out the recreational side of this drug a few times to see how it compares to pregabalin.  i didn't get much joy out of the lyrica so im not expecting much from this.

I havent tried mixing gabapentin and tramadol, but I can imagine that the gabapentin would sorta smooth out the rough edges that sometimes come with tramadol...occasionally I used to get anxious or detached feelings with tramadol, and I believe that the quasi-benzo-esque effects of the gabapentin could help relieve these feelings and the more speedy side of the trams, if you get those effects too I'd be interested in hearing if the gabapentin helps with that at all.


I have combined gabapentin and pregabalin with sublingual fentanyl (using the mylan patches between the gum and cheek), and I enjoyed thoroughly both  combinations. I ended up getting some euphoria specifically connected to music, and even some mild CEVs that synched up to the music, too! The way the CEVs were, some basic geometric patterns and colors moving in synch with the tunage, reminded me a bit of the CEVs one gets with DXM. Of course, the experience didnt really feel much like DXM, but that solitary aspect of the combination was bit reminiscient of it. Be careful mixing high doses of the two drugs though, there were times I found myself nodding out heavily and with amazing rapidity (such as in the middle of smoking a cigarette), and if I hadn't had a friend to check up on me, I don't doubt that I might have gotten into trouble!

I assume you are asking if gabapentin has the same adverse effect with tramadol or fentayl that it has with morphine and hydrocodone, and it does not. Gabapentin is not supposed to have any CYP450 interactions or even be metabolized by the liver (at least in any appreciable amount); the way it decreases the bioavailability is by an unknown mechanism and not related to CYP450 enzyme inhibition/induction/etc. 

Now, all of this is accurate as of whenever I last read about it (maybe a year or two ago [?]). Perhaps the more research has been done on the subject and proved otherwise, but I doubt it.


My opinion of the other part: It clouds opiates too much and ruins the experience. Maybe it'd be good in a low dose, but finding that right dose is hard. It might be 300mg, it might be 3000mg. Retarded drug.

yeah it did take away that edginess that tramadol sometimes produces.  though the combination really wasnt that great.  it's not recreational at all in my opinion now after i've experimented with over the last few days.  though it has worked pretty well with my sciatica.

i actually got some of these CEV as well when i was listening to some tunes and thought it was pretty cool, similar to DXM like you said but the high (if you can call it a high) wasnt anything alike.  


i took 1200mg of tramadol and had 2 x 25mcg patches sublingually with about 1600mg of the gaba which was split into 2 doses and was nodding out pretty hardcore.  dad noticed how fucked up i was and actually had to yell at me a few times because i was dropping cigarettes left right and centre.  i did get a bit of a hangover from it as well, similar to that ive had from lyrica.  it was pretty nasty and something i dont want to experience again

yeah thats what i was after, cheers.  and yeah, it is a pretty retarded drug to use recreationally.  im going to stick to using it as prescribed as it's working pretty well.  it didnt cloud the high at all, im not really sure what it did besides induce the CEV's and add to the sedation.  it did have a semi benzo like feeling when taken on it's on but nothing to write home about or desire to use it to get high.

**Neurontin (Gabapentin)**


Hey there, my brother is prescribed all these ridiculous amounts of pills for his diabetes, recovering heroic addiction, and so on. 


He has a very very large amount of 600mg Gabapentin pills, I use to take these from him every so often about two years ago, but those were tiny compared to these. He stopped getting them for a while and just got back on them.


I'm wondering, what's a "safe" recreational dosage I could take having 600mg pills?

Well, if he sells his meds and doesn't take them, then I guess it's your own move.  


Gabapentin isn't too recreational from what people normally say, however 600mg is a bit high though, try 150mg or 300mg to start.

Sorry if I came off as an ass, I can see your point though. If he actually needed some of this stuff I'd take into consideration he needs it, but he doesn't haha - and I do recall it being very tolerable after one use.

Gabapentin doses for first time users are very unpredictable IME (not to mention the fact that I don't consider it to be that fun of a drug). Anyway, whatever that feeling you get from it is, it could take as little as a few hundred milligrams or it could take thousands of milligrams [I think the first time I took it I took 1500mg and felt nothing. Then again, others have gotten 'high' from much less - or much more]. As I'm pretty sure I posted earlier in this thread, gabapentin is a retarded drug (pharmacologically speaking).

You really need at least 3000mg to get a "recreational high" on this drug.


Taking less can ease social anxiety but it won't make you as "gregarious" or joyed as 3000mg.


For me Gabapentin feels like a mix of benzo/opiate/kratom all in one. I list kratom because Gabapentin has a nice and relaxing "upper" affect that doesn't make you jittery...much like kratom does.


And it's a safe dose, this stuff is hard to OD on.


Whoever says this drug isn't recreational didn't take enough or has a tolerance, it sure was for the times I've taken it spaced far a part.


It's not a pure opiate buzz, this drug doesn't make you apathetic or take away your problems so you can't expect it to be a substitute. It also depends on the individual, if you had epilepsy then you probably won't get high because you "NEED" the drug. Just like someone who has a severe injury won't get very high from painkillers because they are in pain and need them.

I wouldn't try 3000mg as a starting dose, bad idea it might be overwhelming. Maybe 1000mg. In the interests of harm reduction I would say even less should be taken to get a feel for the substance but IIRC 1000mg can be RX'd (I even got 3600mg x3 with a bit of persuasion - but the stuff actually helped me up incrementally up to 3000mg). 


Just don't drive on it. And for what it's worth after I found out it could be recreational, I did get a lot of enjoyment out of it.

**Some questions**


Does anyone have hard info on the effects of Gabapentin on the kidneys and liver?


Also, someone said it causes 'hepatic cancer'. Is there any truth to that?


What is your guys max dosage? I find that 2400 is quite good. But then there's that weird tolerance.


Does anyone know how Gabapentin interacts with benzos (ie Lorazepam)?


thanks

Gabapentin definitely gets me high in a strange way that is hard to describe.  I know it doesn't do anything for some people, as is the case for most anything.  I experience the meticulous "almost OCD" effect that I have seen mentioned here, as well as built up a tolerance.  In fact, from the period of July 4th, 2009 to August 30th, I ingested about 400 of either 300mg or 400mg capsules.  I felt amazing, I was flying around the house doing things that would I normally laugh at the thought of doing such as dishes and other chores.  Also, I am a waitress, and it made kissing people's asses for bigger tips very easy and effective.  HOWEVER, I have to let anyone who is about to or who has already fallen in love with this drug that I experienced the worst withdrawal I ever have, and that includes methadone.  I am sure that my methadone withdrawal might seem laughable to anyone here who was hooked to heroin, but I digress.  


I cannot remember where I read it but I seem to remember some adverse effects on the kidneys or liver.  


Sorry if I bored everyone but I hate the thought of ANYONE going through what I did coming off of gabapentin.  The reason that I ended up eating THAT MANY pills in such a short time was because of the quick tolerance build up.

There's some good advice here; I have to agree with the people that say the recreational effects start in the gram + range, and those effects are indeed strange.


Something that is mentioned but not emphasized...  Gabapentin and pregabalin both potentiate benzos to an extreme degree.  **Extreme**.  Be very careful or you'll black out and do god-knows-what...

Hey guys, I have a few questions.


First off, my main concern: I am prescribed 300 mgs a day of gabapentin in conjunction with 400mg a day with Lamotrigine for depression and anxiety. Will taking 300 mgs a day give me a significant tolerance so that it will no longer alleviate my symptoms?


Also, I'm skeptical about cola potentiating its effects. What chemical in it affects gabapentin? 


I'll let you guys know how 600mg is mixed with 20 mg oxycodone and some weed after my aquaintance tries it.

I asked my doctor about possibly switching from clonazepam to gabapentin and he totally wrote me off. Which is odd considering the former actually has dependence liability : ?

How effective is gabapentin as an anxiolytic?

Is it expensive at the pharmacy?

interactions/side effects?

Thanks magnum zero!

Yeah I looked it up here, not so expensive.

 I'm cool with my doctor so I'm going to bring in literature about gabapentin.

  I have high hopes for it and Pregabalin, I really want to taper off clonazepam and switch to

something like gabapentin, I've read many positive reports.

gorgoroth, i wouldnt be too eager, i heard gabapentin has the same WD's as alcohol - shakes, possible delerium


just as bad if not worse WD's than klonos....and not nearly as effective


however its a lot less noticeable, so its better for school/work (if ur doing that 2 lol)

^Your question is hard to answer.  I have read that gabapentin works moderately alright as a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, but also that it may not, and that it will likely not work for long periods of time to rid you of anxiety.  The impression I get, which isn't more than that because anxiety is an off-label use of gabapentin, is that like benzos, it should be more as a temporary "band-aid" for the anxiety rather than a long term solution.  This is based on factors such as the eventual tolerance you build, the resulting addiction and need to taper off (your body becoming used to it, basically), and increased incidence of suicidal behavior.  


I don't know your exact situation, but I hope this helps somewhat.

I love gabapentin, 3x300mg to start the day with a couple jerky sticks and a bowl of cereal is an awesome breakfast after a couple days of being sober. High and I am having a great day regardless of the BS around me, I find myself talking to complete strangers like they're my best friends and everything and anything I do is totally fun and exciting, specially wrenching on cars.. I love driving around jammin out, bass waay up, reggae blaring, with no destination or certain objective to accomplish, just appreciating whats going on around me.

Cola and stogies definitely increase the high mysteriously but that stogie for the seven minutes its alive is the best stogie in the world. 

I rock climb and if I dose up before a sesh at the gym I'm much more relaxed yet more effective and controlled and actually climb better than I would sobor and forget about climbing after smoking a couple bowls. I take a suppliment for increasing the nitric acid in my blood stream before I hit the gym (L-arginine) and when taken in conjunction with 900-1800 mg of gabapentin the high is really smooth yet very strong and I don't feel as burned out as quickly. A sobor sesh at the gym usually lasts about 2-3 hours but dosed on gabs I tend to linger in there around 5-6 hours. 


anyone have any info about the interactions between l-arginine and gabapentin ?

Maybe its just some sort of a placebo effect but I really like it ether way. 

Mixing things while dosed on gabapentin doesn't work very well for me, smoking makes me feel uber sick and queezy as well as doing oxys but drinking a less than normal amount of alcohol feels fine. 

I just got a bottle of them so I'm going to sobor up for a few days then dig back in. I should have enough for four 3 gram days but who knows.


I usually don't do many drugs all that often but like to endulge from time to time and only to a minor extent, smoking oxycotton is about as hardcore as i get now days. usually just stick to smokin bowls and drinkin a few beers through out the week. 


I'm no scientist, I just know what I've read on here and this is only my personal experience with gabapentin, my other friend who also takes it from time to time feels nothing like the high i feel from it and he doesn't enjoy it nearly as much as I do.. I kind of like that its a case by case drug because that makes it more fun in my opinion, its not something that everyone is on and doing and it keeps the price for the pills way low when you have to pay for it and that's only when people aren't giving it away.. I like that you can look in the mirror and question being fucked up because you look totally normal on the outside but on the inside you know your trashed so that question quickly fades away.


oh well what ever, the controversy continues.

I think this is basically true in a sense. It is very mild to not noticable. Lyrica is much better but still very mild.


It does potentiate most other drugs. I find that if you only use it once in a while, as mentioned, and if you load (read very high doses) I find you can get a strange sort of high that lasts for quite a while. Tolerance builds very quickly (one use for me). Lyrica is better. Makes me have these strange walk into walls staggering gait.


To each their own but I wouldn't spend a lot of money on this stuff or one is likely to be disappointed IMO.

Do I have this right, withdrawal happens only when you abuse it?


 I have taken 300 mg doses to ease slight opiate WDs, Lyrica helped me kick suboxone, I'm a chipper, and I found it works as an antidepressant better than wellbutrin (which I'm on). I want to ask the doc for a script as an AD but I hesitate to take something that causes WDs. 

Seriously, I take it, and I'm in a good mood. Not high, but really positive.

If the doc gives it to me or not, I am gonna take 300 mgs every day that I have to work, it makes my day and my productivity soar to the sky.


But all bets are off if it causes WDs at that low of a dose.Does anyone have experience stopping the med at it's prescribed dose?

You don't get my question Ds , I want to use it as an antidepressant at a low dose every day. I want to know if I do that and stop suddenly, will I have withdrawals?

Lyrica is a lot like gabapentin, just less sedating and shorter acting.


In contrast to the people here who say gabapentin does very little, it gets me retardedly high if I take 600-1200mg, dosing 150mg every 45 minutes.  I have caught myself nodding before from gabapentin alone.


The ceiling of this stuff dosed like that is somewhere between 600-1200mg, and you will not get any higher if you take more I find.  The pharmacokinetics of gabapentin are strange because they rely on an amino acid transporter for uptake which is the rate-limiting step in adsorption, so if you dose 300mg or 600mg or 1200mg, you'll absorb almost the same amount and the rest will be excreted and wasted.  And I would know, I've consumed like 6-8 grams in one night and it got me no higher than 1 gram.  To best counter this only consume the drug in 150mg-300mg doses at 45 minute intervals.


It also should be noted that the effects always take 2-2.5 hours to reach peak for me.


These days the only use I have for gabapentin and pregabalin is for sleep, which they work nicely for when rotated with methocarbamol and diphenhydramine.

This is quite true. I couldn't figure out why 2100 mg wasnt doing any more for me than 1200, but once i started spacing my doses out 30-60 min apart, i began to feel the gabapentin again. At first I thought it was an issue of tolerance, and that's partially it, but I didn't really understand that the uptake was limited at the time, either, so I just kind of stumbled upon the idea of spacing doses.

Yep I use express pay too.  I have my grandma's credit card on there (with her consent of course) to pay for all my scripts.

I think somehow the WD effects of gabapentin got overstated.  You won't experience any from recreational use.  The only way you will have any is if you are on it daily at a decent dosage for long periods of time.  I've been on it daily at smaller dosages and have never noticed any WDs.

**Gabapentin Recreationally??**


Hey everyone,

I've been gone for quite some time and I have 2 new questions for all of you.......

I just recieved 10 300mg capsules of Gabapentin and I was wondering what recreational properties that they have. I've read that they have pshycoactive capabilities.........Can anyone elaberate on that?


Secondly.....

My buddy has a theory that if someone is having a seizure, you can get them out of it with the application of Gabapentin.

-Then I replied "How the hell is shoving a pill down thier throat going to help stop the seizure, even if it is seizure medication, the pill wouldnt absorb that quickly, it would take forever to break down in thier stomach."

-Then he replied "I know, thats why you burn it down and shoot it in thier blood stream"


.........Now, to be honest I think my friend was just giving me shit, but theres a part of me that realizes, Hey, it sounds like it could actually work......

Can anyone make light on this for me?


Thanx, Jack

I thought it was very recreational at first, but I abused it too much and my tolerance rose fast. At the start though I liked it better than any benzo.


No you can not melt the powder down and inject it to stop a seizure. That's just plain stupid. I don't think it's just gabapentin powder in the capsules

**45-minute intervals & bioavailability**


the percentage absorbed decreases in larger doses but not so much that you are absorbing less overall (by mg). in other words:


Gabapentin bioavailability is not dose proportional; i.e., as dose is increased, bioavailability decreases. Bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1200, 2400, 3600, and 4800 mg/day given in 3 divided doses, respectively. Food has only a slight effect on the rate and extent of absorption of gabapentin (14% increase in AUC and Cmax).


I like the 45-minute interval idea. I wonder if that would work in light of the above. HAS ANYONE HERE tried it?

I take 600mg  twice daily. I've never even felt it, but when I forget to take it , it makes me feel nauseous.

A friend takes 900 twice daily and he says it's euphoric...you just can't tell, which is why everything new should be tried at smaller doses first. Obviously.

Neurontin and morphine increase morphine analgesic effect. 


"In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with 12 healthy volunteers, we studied the interaction of morphine and gabapentin using the cold pressor test. The anticonvulsant gabapentin enhanced the acute analgesic effect of morphine. Furthermore, the plasma concentration of gabapentin was increased when morphine was administered concomitantly. Therefore, the well tolerated combination of gabapentin and morphine may improve pain therapy, especially in pain states, like chronic and neuropathic pain, which respond poorly to opioids. "

I always thought the opposite, that gabapentin decreased morphine BA ... 


There was something about NMDA activity in the abstract too... Would be nice if gabapentin was a decent NMDA antagonist, Would love to reduce my tolerance.

ABSTRACT


The development of neuropathic pain involves a series of changes including primary and secondary hyperalgesia, peripheral and central sensitization, and wind-up phenomena. Neurotransmitters play a critical role in this process. For example, glutaminergic subtypes of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and neurokinin prime the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by triggering the release of intracellular calcium ions, thus unblocking the magnesium ion plug on the NMDA receptor and allowing Ca2+ influx into the cell. Ca2+ ions acting as secondary messengers initiate protein kinase C activation, phospholipase C and nitric oxide synthetase production, and proto-oncogene expression. The activation of the NMDA receptor thereby increases the responsiveness of the nociceptive system. Anticonvulsant drugs—including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and felbamate—have been used to treat neuropathic pain. Gabapentin is a novel anticonvulsant that may have a unique effect on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel currents at postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons. Thus, gabapentin may interrupt an entire series of events, not just a single process, that lead to the development of neuropathic pain. Preclinical models of anti-inflammatory and neuropathic pain indicate that gabapentin effectively antagonizes the maintenance of this pain. Additionally, in preemptive surgical models, gabapentin has been shown to prevent the induction of pain. Gabapentin has been shown to be efficacious in numerous smaller clinical studies, case reports, and chart reviews in a variety of neuropathic pain syndromes. Two large multicenter studies, one in postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and one in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), support preclinical findings. In the PHN study, patients treated with gabapentin demonstrated a significant difference (P < 0.001) in their average daily pain score at endpoint compared to placebo patients. In the DPN trial, mean weekly pain was significantly (P<0.001) different for gabapentin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients at endpoint. Consistent with the known side-effect profile of gabapentin, the most common adverse events noted in both studies were dizziness and somnolence. Gabapentin should be considered an important addition to the management of neuropathic pain syndromes.

I find gabapentin wonderfully recreational.


The headspace is very dissociative - somewhere between dxm and an alcohol-blackout, except completely "gentle" and positive feeling. I get a warm warm buzz sorta like carisopodal. I get a body high, too. Most of my body is dissociative, and while not numb, I don't notice any sensations from them unless I concentrate. Except for my major muscle groups like my triceps, thighs, and back. These get nice and fuzzy, almost a methamphetamine body buzz.


I get the best results 1 pill every 30 minutes or so. The high isn't "euphoric" until like 2 and a half hours into it. and doesn't seem to go beyond like hour 4 or 5.


the anti-anxiety effect is pretty damn recreational in itself.

I wanted to ask.. Anyone ever tried this stuff to reduce anxiety from stimulant abuse? Are there any obvious risks to such a combination (specifically a NERI/DARI chemical). As far as I can tell it should be okay.

I took 600mg the other night with my typical dose of benzos (all meds are Rx'd except xanax), 1.0 Kpin, 1.0Xanax 600 Gaba


"felt good until bed"


Woke up about 3AM needing to pee and I couldn't walk for shit, stumbled around.  Woke up at 6:20 for work and was still like that.  Couldn't go to work.  WAS NOT THE BENZOS.

Sorry guys, personal experience disagrees pretty hard.


Dose 300mg every 30-60 min up to 3grams or so.  Smoke a fat blunt.


Enjoy.  I find it feels a lot like rolling.  As far as "if you like this you don't know what drugs are," I have scripts for hydros, oxy, and tramadol, as well as 4 different benzos, and have tried shrooms, acid, and mdxx.  I still enjoy properly dosed gabapentin.

3. anyone tried this personally - either withdrawal or taper
4. "effective" lists supposedly should use no more than 3 questions so disregard this last one ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Well, honestly Im not sure how much neurontin will help your withdraw, it is worth a try though for sure, it has helped some with withdraw before. Especially in conjunction with you tapering it may have a better chance of helping. I havent tried neurontin for withdraw in a couple years, I use it for pain though. Back when I did go through short one or two days of severe withdraw I would try anything and really did abuse neurontin. In desperation I would take big doses, I would even snort it or open the capsules and swallow the powder out of hopes for quicker onset.

Uck, I hated neurontin.  They gave it to me when I was in rehab for heroin addiction because I kept having seizures.  Man, that shit made me so paranoid and hyper.  I ended up feeling like I had all the negative aspects of a tweak high and none of the good.  I would say for me it had absolutely no recreational value.  Oh, and the side effects were bothering so much I refused to take it after 2 weeks and had horrible wds.  Never touching that stuff again

its used for seizures, and nervous sytem damage/pain issues. so, it seeeems that it would help by cooling down your nervous system.


when you become addcicted to opioids, they are bound to many many nerve endings through out your body. when you stop taking them, the 'reexposure' of your nerves to real world conditions, everything is exagerated, just the air, clothing, sheets w/e, will hurt, because your nerves are now hypersensitive, giving you the crawling skin sensation, and general feeling of discust.


neurotin, is given to fibromyalgia patients because at some point their nerves became literally shocked, and fryed, becoming extremely sensitive to pain or touch, its all amplified, much like opioid w/d.


so it makes sense that neurotin would help in that way.


lyrica is suppose to be much much better feeling, and is usually preffered ove gaba by most fibro patients. i couldnt tolerate lyrica, it gave me some nasty medicine head, and a run down nasty feeling, so i stopped that.


the gaba i took a while and did tolerate, but it didnt help with my pain, and would give me headaches. i started out taking 2000mgs, which was not a good idea. 600 will knock you out id bet, so be careful.

I have complaints, to be honest. As someoneone who had used gabapentin medicinally for the past five or so years, I feel D's post is a bit misleading:


> [D's said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=7460980)
> 
> 
> 
> 			Hey!!!! Let me tell you some stuff about Gabapentin(Neurontin).
> 
> **What is it?-**Gabapentin (Neurontin) is a GABA analogue. It was originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy, and currently, Gabapentin is widely used to relieve pain, especially neuropathic pain.
> 		
> Click to expand...
> — D's said:


True enough.


> **So why was it made?**Gabapentin was initially synthesized to mimic the chemical structure of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but is not believed to act on the same brain receptors.**Sounds a lot like GHB/GBL****GHB-gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, a neuroprotective and depressant drug**&**GBL-gamma-Butyrolactone** Hmmmm.. They sound very alike!
> 		
> Click to expand...


FAR from it. Although they have some similarities in chemical structure, that's where it ends. Gabapentin has no direct action on either GABA or GHB receptors. Their mechanism of action is as different as meth is different from heroin.


> **What's it feel like?-**It varies from person to person. I don't want to tell you to go out and take 2500+mg.. Begin with a low dose to see how it effects you. I'm no MD but I can tell you that if it's your first time you should begin with 1-3 to begin with (900mg). It has the same sort of effect's of xanax, ghb, and hydrocodone. With a THC buzz. It makes me feel really dream like, and smooth high. When I take high doses I tend to drop things, and have a small twitching problem.
> 		
> Click to expand...


That's just your experience. For me it is primarily a stimulant without the anxiety that levels my mood. And I've taken it in doses of anywhere between 300mg and 6g+.


> **Best way to take it!-**I don't want you to go and do this to every gabapen capsule you have. I normally will empty the contents of the capsules into a square of toilet paper and parachute it. It tastes **WORST** than ecstasy/mdma! Gabapentin tastes horable!!! So be sure to swallow it before it bust's open in your mouth!
> 
> **Cool things about Gabapentin!-**There have been reports by methamphetamine addicts that gabapentin alone in doses of 1200 mg at bedtime taken for 40–60 days has been effective in reducing the withdrawal symptoms and almost eliminating cravings or desire to use methamphetamine. It also helps those addicted to prescribed pain medications and takes away withdrawal symptoms.
> 		
> Click to expand...


See the ADD forum for more details. To keep it short: your body actively takes up gabapentin, it is not absorbed. This means that after a certain ammount, any more gabapentin you take is going out with your shit. So the best way to take it is to actually take small doses over the space of several hours.


> **Is it addictive?**-Yes, it is. it's withdrawl effects are verry similar to benzo/alocohol withdrawl symptoms. (Only after long term use.)
> 
> **So what's it feel like again...?-**Although gabapentin is not a controlled substance, it does produce psychoactive effects that could lead to recreational use of the drug. However, it is widely regarded as having little or no potential for misuse. Pregabalin, a gabapentinoid with higher potency marketed for neuropathic pain, is a controlled substance, under Schedule V of the United States' Controlled Substances Act.
> 		
> Click to expand...


Really? This has not been my experience. Although PREGABALIN does have mild w/d symptoms, gabapentin really didn't have any and, like I said above, I've used it for years (and still do, with frequent stops) because it cures my illness. 


> Recreational use of gabapentin produces a varying number of effects including euphoria, appetite stimulation, incessant talking, physical and mental stimulation which result in varying degrees of drug-induced productivity. Diarrhea/stomach discomfort is commonly reported with heavy use.

True, and to me it seems you've been talking about pregabalin the whole time, not gabapentin ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well, probably the most correct thing said so far about gabapentin is that its effects will differ from person to person. Just as much as I believe it doesnt have any effect close to a benzo, opiate, or marijuana, it also didnt have any stimulant effects with me. I think its pretty useless recreationally which is so upsetting when I see all these users having great effects. I have also read of users having withdrawal like symptoms when stopping suddenly. It is also recommended by the manufacturer to not stop its use suddenly.

^Yes, I think the reason for all this is the greatly varying amounts needed in people and the differences in individual chemistry.  For me to get any sort of positive (recreational) effect out of gabapentin. I had to take a few grams of the stuff, and it only worked the first time I tried it (maybe the second too...), but not in the days following that.


Jamshyd, I have read about taking little bits at a time, but I do feel it is possible to get pretty strong effects just from taking them all at once.  Sure, you get to a point where you're wasting some of the excess, but by that point, the effects are pretty damn intense and borderline unpleasant (IME).

Nikolai and Boll: I wrote everything I wrote here with the thought of gabapentin as a **medicine**, not as something to get high on. It simply doesn't work that way. Sure, the first few times it might give a nice buzz, but that  goes away, and after that all you can hope to do is to take it as economically as possible for its medical effects because it is the only thing that heals me.

hey all, i just sublingualled 7-8 5 mg vals and a 1 mg xanax. i have a high benzo tolerance, if i want to get completely high from xanax i usually take 6 if i've drank 5 or so vodka sodas, i'm an alkie, or 10 to 12 if i'm not drinking. no blackouts, no falling down, just the nice benzo bloom that makes me forget about paying bills, going to work, and anything else i'm upset about. i'm about to smoke a cig to kick start the benzo bloom too. anyways, i came across 3 completely full bottles of 400 mg neurontins recently. there are 100 pills in each bottle. i've pretty much read all the posts, but benzos treat me differently than most people. they don't ever, ever make me sleepy unless i include them in a drug-doing pissing contest, but that doesn't count, and it isn't recommended. they are my all time favorite drug besides morphine and tramadols. even heroin, dilaudids, oc's, uppers (aside from phentermine) and (sometimes, depending on who's in my bed) e doesn't really compare. psychadelics are fun every once and a while when you're with cool people, or you have some contemplating to do on your own, but they don't let me sleep for days either. z drugs make me hallucinate and i become very hyper and almost tweakish. long story short, drugs don't ever make me sleepy unless i shoot a bunch of heroin. so should i drink a couple of glasses of plum wine or take about 200 mgs of neurontin now and then 200 later? i'll start another post about drugs that aren't supposed to making people stay up and hyper another time, but i thought it might somehow be related. 


any advice is greatly appreciated.

I doubt 200mg's will do much recreationally for you. Thats a very low dose. I however dont know how it works in combination with alcohol. I dont think gabapentin is a good replacement of xanax, but thats my experience.

I've never experienced the effects you listed though I've been taking gababpentin for neuropathic pain for several years (Crushed left nerve root at L4-L5, L5-S1, still compressed after surgeries.) But I know that responses to this drug vary widely.


I didn't bother taking it for years because after my first experiments I didn't "feel anything" (relief or recreational) but lately I decided to go ahead with it anyway in hopes that it would help with my condition. I've recently been taking it as directed (3600mg/day; 1200mg 3x/day).


So far I don't notice any difference in the intensity of my sciatica and the accompanying constant muscle spasms in my lower leg (OW!FUCK!). But I'm going to give it a good shot this time. Some drugs like herbal formulations take months to show a recognizable effect.


I'm really glad you started this thread! Any anecdotal information I can get from other users will be welcome whether they're trying for psychoactive effects or just pain relief. So thank you! Maybe I'll discover a way to enjoy my doses on top of getting relief.

Thought I'd mention that some people, like me, seemingly have very little effect from low doses of gabapentin. 300mgs did nothing for my nerve pain or have any psychological effects that I could detect. I was prescribed the max of 3600mgs/day and it definitely gave me a "loopy" feeling, as a friend once described it to me and that word stuck.


Now I take lyrica/pregabalin which is the "other" gaba-oid and at prescribed doses I feel very little. At ridiculously high doses, there is a strange feeling and severe memory impairment but not accompanied with any sort of (notable) physical impairment.


If 300mgs doesn't do much then try higher. I was prescribed 1200mgs/3x/day and even that had very little if any immediate effect but the drug was never much of anything helpful to me.

I suffer similar problems as yourself due to gunshot wounds. My experience was similar to yours, I underwent surgeries, I tried gabapentin a couple times, with no luck. After one surgery and being told that gabapentin sometimes will help someone it hadnt helped before after an operations changes I was put on it again, and amazingly this time it did help some. I am unsure why, i also had compression on nerves along with extensive damage to my left S1 and L5 nerve roots. I think one reason could be compression being lifted from nerves, but am unsure, my nerve damage never healed any. Despite you likely having at least some permanent damage, is there any chance of attempting another operation?

I just tried a small dose of Gabapentin for neve pain....I feel some mood elevation and some additional stimulation with my oxycodone. I think that in combination with opiates an initial small dose of Neurontin adds something to the effects of opiates.

i'm reading this thread, and i'm amazed at how many people don't enjoy the effects of neurontin..... i've got a script for it, and i think it's fucking great..!  there is a buildup of tolerance, but it drops quickly too.  i donno, i just really enjoy the effects.  i get this sort of manic enthusiasm, it's like the perfect drunk, where life is rowdy and ecstatic but you don't talk with a slur... i guess it does make me prone to stumble, though.


also, i find it really helpful for opiate withdrawals..... of course it doesn't "end" it, like suboxone might, but it relieves things significantly for me.  most of all, withdrawals or not, it puts me in a really positive mindset.  i just feel fucking right on!


anyway, just wanted to offer my varying mileage.  i was shocked at all the negative press!

Neurontin has worked for people with WD before. I wouldnt go expecting that, but it is worth a shot IMO, and if it helps, thats great.

The one thing about Gabapentin is that I have been a little more sleepy in the daytime when I take it with my pain medication. I could take some Provigil with it to give me energy but then if I get any anxiety I will want to take an ativan....thats a lot of drugs, especially for someone who always wanted to do things naturally and not be taking a dozen pills every day.

For me this drug hasn't only not worked, staggering the doses, high doses, low doses, taking it with an aleve, with a paracetamol (and at least 2 other NSAIDs), with a snack, a benzo, a cigarrette, with coke, mineral water, pepsi or anything else, but it has also blocked the effects of my Lyrica (pregabalin).


I'll avoid neurontin, and stick with lyrica and benzos, it just doesn't work.


UPDATE: Wait! I feel something! 

I feel tired...

Gabapentin kinda-sorta works for me. The first few days when I started and/or have increased my dose, I notice some positive effects, both in terms of relief and recreation. It gives me a mood life (read: not euphoria) and makes me more talkative. These effects last for 1-2 days at that dose and then stop.


As far as pain relief (I take it for fibromyalgia), it seems to be mildly helpful. It will take the edge off the pain for a few hours. I'm now on 300mg x3 daily and I'm sure I'll be upped again in two months, but it doesn't really matter as the effects seem to be the same every time. No matter the dose it's. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) Tolerance seems to be a 24-48 hour thing, being that that is how long it takes to build one. 


Overall it's a decent drug for pain relief, I'd give it a 4 out of 10. As far as a recreational substance, it's shit. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Thanks for the advice guys,, I bought a load of it primarily for the WD's from opiates I'm gonna have to face soon,, as for recreational value,, ahh fuck I took 3.2 grams pretty much at once with 240mg Extended Release DHC, about 5 valium (though they are shit maybe 5-6mg generics) and a few ciders and aint feelin shit from the neurontin inparticularly yet,,, it hasnt been that long so I guess I'll repost if anything amazing happens in an hour or two. But I guess having built up tolerances to pretty much everything I do isnt gonna help me when it comes to Neurontin.

  I banged it all together because I remember once getting off my fuckin face on a well over the usual prescription dose of Lyrica, its bigger brother - cant remember how much but a fuckload all at once, man I was all over the place, euphoric, loss of coordination -felt more like a massive dose of tramadol mixed with being drunk but retaining a clear head - fun time anyway. I can see why it's scheduled and Neurontin isnt atm. So yeah I thought neurontin might be similar but from reading the posts through it looks like I should space out my dosing next time round huh? After Ive laid off it for a week or two to get my tolerance levels to it back to what they were. Maybe I'm just one of those guys who aint gonna get a recreational high from it,, but like I said its primarily available to me for the opiate WD I gotta do,, and maybe it'll help a bit with my anxiety disorder once I figure out what doseage/s and when works best,, but like I said the 3.2 grams of this (which I'm pretty sure is a high enough dose) aint shit next to a huge dose of Lyrica all at once - I do remember lookin at the erowid trip reports on Lyrica though and Im pretty sure mine was at the higher end of those doses.

 Oh well , hope to post a more positive report next time round

But yeah, I'll write back if I have more positive results with it spaced out in the future,, whether it be for fun or for help with my anxiety/WD's

bumping this to the front page so i can check it daily.  currently taking lyrica, got scripted low dose of neurontin.  ill have to educate myself on the latter via this thread and experimenting with doses.


reading the monograph for lyrica they compared doses of pregabalin and gabapentin that lead me to believe that lyrica is roughly 3 times stronger than gabapentin.  to add merit to this speculation, if you look at the highest mg supplied pills it rougly matches this conversion.  300mg of lyrica v. 800mg of gabapentin.  800mg of gp = 266mg of pg.  so about right with the 3 fold theory.  


staggering is a new concept for me.  lyrica doesnt have the BA issues that gp does.  ill have to read this entire thread before i post more.

I believe their is a cross tolerance.  


Gabapentin is good for mild opiate withdrawals, it almost makes you feel normal.  I have taken it when in bad withdrawals and the relief was minimal.


I don't take it often but when I do I take 300mg and then 30-45min. later I pop another 300mg.  I feel like it slows down my brain and I'm able to concentrate and process information better.  It also makes me more social and it gives me motivation.

just started a week break from lyrica.  scripted 200mg a day of gabapentin.  anywhere from 67-80mg pregabalin when you do the math.  


that should be enough to keep my mood elevated while.  i dont know what the extent of the cross tolerance is though.  anyone?

**cross tolerance btw neurontin and lyrica?**


posted several times in both the lyrica and gabapentin mega thread, no answer.


im sure there has to be somewhat of a cross tol, but im trying to figure out to what extent.  im taking gabapentin this week to take a break from lyrica to bring my tolerance down.  the effects are different which leads me to believe there is an incomplete cross tolerance.  anyway, taking 200mg of gp a day is about the same as taking 70mg of pg.  so maybe i should just take 100mg a day, i would like to get to close to 0 as possible.  how i would love to take 300mg of pg and get that crazy acid/ghb effect.  makes my dick hard thinking about it.  throw in a shot of bupe and its even better.  add just 1 glass of beer and its like nodding on heroin.

Just as oxycodone is cross-tolerant with diacetylmorphine, so, too, is there a cross tolerance between gabapentin and pregabalin. The extent of this is unknown as far as I know, because no clinical trials have been conducted to assess it.

this drug kinda sucks.  i can feel it but it only lasts for 30 mins and it goes away.  lyrica is way waaaaay better.  not nearlly as energizing/motivating as pregabalin either.  the BA is shitty too.  what other drugs have non linear responses to dosing too?

**No Cross-Tolerance Between Pregabalin & Gabapentin**


Thought this might be of interest to those of you debating the existence of a cross-tolerance between the two compounds; according to [The FreePatentsOnline Database](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1196160.html), there is none!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

Gabapentin is the generic name for the marketed product Neurontin. The chemical name is 1-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexaneacetic acid. The chemical structure of the compound is:


Pregabalin is the generic name for (S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid. The chemical structure of the compound is: It is also known as CI-1008 and as S-(+)-3-IBG.


Formerly, it was thought that gabapentin and pregabalin were the same in all pain models as one antagonist blocked both; therefore, a similar result was expected.


However, surprising differences have now been observed in an inflammatory model of pain.


The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions have a synergistic effect in the treatment of pain. Advantages of these compositions include fewer side effects as lower dosages are needed. This increases patient compliance with the beneficial result of better control of pain.


The drugs can be administered together in the same dosage unit or can be prepared in separate dosage units administered at the same time. Different forms of dosage units can be used, i.e., a tablet of gabapentin and an injection of pregabalin.


**One particular advantage of the instant invention is the fact that no cross tolerance between the two compounds has been observed.**


The synergistic composition of this invention utilizes any GABA analogs. A GABA analog is a compound derived from or based upon gamma-aminobutyric acid.

I take back what I said above; I'll chalk it up to sheer ignorance on my part. However, it *was* a fair assumption, given how drugs that are chemically related normally interact, but check on the citation I provided over in the Pregabalin MegaThread that states "...that no cross tolerance between the two compounds [i.e. pregabalin & gabapentin] has been observed."


Apologies for sending out a false positive, HDPT! It took me quite a while of digging around the internet to locate that citation, however. Methinks not much work (VERY surprisingly) has been done to determine the extent to which pregabalin induces tolerance to gabapentin, and vice versa. Shocking, almost, don't you think?

Neurontin does shit for me. I have been on a dose of 600mg x2 a day and it wasn't working so they lowered my dose to 200mg x2 a day which did EVEN less. I am in severe pain ALL the time. Like literally. It sucks, and I think that's why it doesn't work. Opiod pain killers barely help. The only thing that's ever helped me was IV hydromorphine.

yeah, from the study vaya cited it seems that gp is a totally dif drug from pg.  lack of cross tolerance backs this up.  as far as effects you can tell they are dif drugs as well.  with the creation of lyrica i feel like a LOT of progress was made.  i thought it was just an evergreened tweaked gp but it really is not.

I notice a lot of gas (I'm assuming you mean methane released from the anus ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ) with pregabalin; I haven't been on gabapentin for four years now so I can't remember that clearly whether or not it produced the same effect, but it probably did.

yeah, what the fuck is it with this stuff?  i seriously feel like my butthole is looser or something.  it just slips out, i feel like an old man losing control of my sphincter muscles.  its kinda wet too.  i think you are right, it may be more with pg.

Oh yes loads of gas, they just slip out, fart fart fart fart as you walk down the street. 

I was perscribed 2700mg a day to help reduce muscle spasms, did nothing for me apart from gas and making me feel slightly altered. Mixed it with benzos and alcohol once and pissed myself![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)

Is there any good combos with gabapentin cos I have about 60g of the stuff left over.

Would it help with benzo withdrawal?

Sometimes I get something far worse than "bad gas" on gabapentin.  It'll turn into straight up liquid diarrhea, and whole lots of it.  It's like I'm pissing out of my ass.  This, mixed with what homeydontplaythat states, is really no fun.  There have been times where I haven't been able to leave the bathroom for about an hour after taking a larger amount of gabapentin.

is there anyway to get an effect from this stuff besides taking a break from it for a few days?  no matter how much or little i take i cant feel jack from it.  the first day i took it i felt good for an hr.  light a lyrica buzz without the energy.  i cant see much theraputic potential for this, nevermind rec potential.

So whats the consensus on gabapentin for opioid withdrawal, specifically suboxone? My doctor said its supposed to help get rid of up to 50% of the withdrawal you are feeling, however i am a bit skeptical..

i am totally frustrated with this drug.  i have gotten an effect from it twice, for like 1 hr each time.  the first 2 days i tried it.  i have tried taking several days off and staggering....nothing.  i dont understand how this is used for treating anything.  maybe it is just that i have been spoiled by lyrica.  


i would assume 1g is 300mg of lyrica, but even with staggering with small bits of food 1 hr apart it did nothing but give a slight mood lift.  300mg of lyrica would have me feeling NICE and smiling and talking to everyone like it was the best day of my life.  i suppose this is the future of pharmaceuticals....these are not even drugs that work directly on neurotransmitters but rather indirectly.

I find that if you only use it once in a while, as mentioned, and if you load (read very high doses) I find you can get a strange sort of high that lasts for quite a while.

im thankful for neurontin as i feel it is the basis on which lyrica was developed but i dont see much value at all in the drug.  ive only gotten an effect out of it once for 1 hr the first time i took it.  ive tried staggering, taking with/out food, dif doses, and it does jack shit.  lyrica on the otherhand always provides wonderful antidepressant and anxiolytic effects with just 150mg.

For long term use many, myself included, prefer the effects of gabapentin. It is more subtle (none of the drunken confidence/energy/dizziness of pregabalin) but it seems to have a broader more consistent scope. Lyrica feels great for the first few weeks or months but then it runs itself out, and has such severe rebound anxiety and withdrawals. Gabapentin is much more forgiving, doesnt rape you as much, and has more consistent and well rounded results. When lyrica came out I thought it was great but it drove me into a hole over the course of a few months. I have gone back on it several times over the past few years but I usually return to Gabapentin because I can actually manage it(usually ;D). I dont have the "take more, take more!" burning with it that I do with pregabalin, probably because  the reward isnt there and its effects are so subtle.  800mg x 3 of gabapentin does me quite fine now :D but, once again, YMMV :D

So I just got 18,000mg of this for my script. I toook a TON of it with hydroxyzine and suboxone.


WOW, I nodded out smashed my head off dresser, all sorts of stuff, keep falling asleep while typin. The scripts all gone for the next 3 weeks, but jus like wow.


People always say gabapentin/lyrica suck, and they usually do. If you just take a ton at a time +  (optional other drugs, you'll be good.


Only thing is i'm hearing weird voice that don't exist, sometimes i see them, however,  I am also twitching likre crazy.

Yeah,, a bit like Jantastic here to,,, I was quite happily nodding on an amount of plugged tramadol I'm not gonna mention,, but way over the recommended max anyway (along with valium tho). I was also on Dihydrocodeine and the pods I'd ate the night before were still in my system.... So I parachuted 2.4 grams of the stuff just to see if it'd work for me ,,,and after feeling spaced out for a bit and my sight going a bit woozy I crashed out,,, I mean luckily I was on my sofa but between feeling the effects of it and falling asleep I dont remember that much - but on waking up I still feel a bit weird and spacey... I do remember having a fuckinhg awesome dream that felt quite different from my normal dreams (probably because of the physical effects of the gabapentin),.,, I woke up at 7am just to check which reality was which then I remember just smiling and going back to dreamworld in a tick.


 Its past midday now and having just woke and Im still feeling it,, hmmm,, its like your brains totally with it put your physical self still feels light and woozy. Like being drunk on valium without the brain losing it.... Still not sold on its recreational value yet, but it definetely enhanced my dreams and spaced me out- (but thats not particularly great),, may try it sober and earlier in the day next. I do have an anxiety disorder but I dont think gabapentins gonna work as well as valium for me.

Dude...Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes seizures.  I just prescribed neurontin  for anxiety and my psychiatrist told me it was originally FDA approved to prevent seizures. I think he knows what hes talking about.

If you're really epileptic should you know what your medicine is doing? Knowledge is power.

i've never taken gabapentin, but a friend of mine just got prescribed it along with his klonopin by his psychiatrist. evidently, the psychiatrist told him it "really makes the klonopin go off." not sure about what kind of psych we're talking about here, but is there any truth to that? 


my friend says he had been prescribed them b4 and considered them pretty useless, but his dr convinced him to try again w/ the klon and i'm wondering what to expect if i tried this combo (i take benzos daily, never tried neurontin in combo or by itself)

Hey all. I am currently prescribed 600mg/day therapeutically for GAD/SAD issues, as well as working on some of the behavioral things myself. I take 200mg/3x day.


My reactions to the drug have always been quite pronounced. The first time I tried 200mg, I felt it for sure in 30-40 minutes, not high, just different. Where I am right now, I feel like it's actually helping to give me more energy (because I'm not wasted energy on being needlessly anxious) and combats many of the nasty *physical* symptoms I get with GAD/SAD issues. For instance, I would often feel trapped and tight and nervous, had almost constant cold hands due to shallow breathing, and would in general feel quite worn out after even an hour or two around others. With gabapentin, and focusing on my own body and less on what other people are doing (I'm hyper-sensitive to social body language, etc.), I have truly made some progress.


A real indicator that I'm doing better is that my hands are warm and I feel secure in my classes now. Also, I notice people smile at me more and even talk to me, and I reciprocate, so my newfound positive energy is surely effecting the energy levels of those around me.


My question: therapeutically, is it worth it to try and bounce up to 900mg, 300mg/3x daily? I am amazed at this drug because I have been intolerant to SSRI/SNRIs and definitely do not want to use benzodiazepines regularly and become dependent on them. I am already dependent on buprenorphine, I figure. As an occasional recreational thing, benzodiazepines are the ticket for me.


K, wanted to share my experience. If you suffer from anxiety, you may look into this drug, or Lyrica.

It is more subtle (none of the drunken confidence/energy/dizziness of pregabalin) but it seems to have a broader more consistent scope. Lyrica feels great for the first few weeks or months but then it runs itself out, and has such severe rebound anxiety and withdrawals. Gabapentin is much more forgiving, doesnt rape you as much, and has more consistent and well rounded results. When lyrica came out I thought it was great but it drove me into a hole over the course of a few months. I have gone back on it several times over the past few years but I usually return to Gabapentin because I can actually manage it(usually ;D). I dont have the "take more, take more!" burning with it that I do with pregabalin, probably because  the reward isnt there and its effects are so subtle.  800mg x 3 of gabapentin does me quite fine now :D but, once again, YMMV :D

I work a physical job, on top of that the shifts are long. Hard to get into work everyday and put up the numbers they want. Gabapentin will get me "faded", put me in a good mindset to work, and last through work so I'm not sore as hell.


I like it.

I wanted to add a few things after looking through this thread:


The effect is real IMO. First times were like first times on MDMA, and  second first times (i.e., after a gap of years) were just like first times. But so far a one week gap seems to be good after each use but tolerance is there. This is probably why it's not so addictive (no problem stopping and starting). 48g  (yes, this grams) taken in a day with twitching which could get bad enough to drop something or fall but felt no damage. this level of dose has been tried before.


The tolerance issue is due to its bioavailability which DECREASES as you take more. So at low does, (< 1g) bioavailability is around  60% and the around 4g, the bioavailability is 33%. Almost pointless to take more than that. Food increases absorption by 10%.


Parachuting it might produce a more intense effect. Taking a lot of capsules (say 4g) on an empty stomach and then eating a lot of food and drinking a lot of coke produced an intense effect.  If the "come on" is intense, it's almost like a nod where the person goes to sleep for short time (around the 2hr period, for about 15minutes to up to 2hrs, weird). I wonder if it's opiate level increases (it doesn't seem like it, but it could be) due to some CYP450 competition or the gabapentin itself. 


Food at the right time tastes awesome!


IMHO, this is one of the best chemical substances one can play with. It is pretty benign and can produce intense effects at times. See the Erowid experience vaults.


Not that on fentanyl also during the second time gabapentin was prescribed. It helped me tremendously I think with WD and tapering down the patch. I went down from 50 to 37.5mcg per hour dosage with no problems at all. If I felt I had any, I just took some gabapentin.  I really think this is a great aspect of gabapentin. I think I will start another thread on this just to see if people have tried this.

Gabapentin made me gain weight. I stopped for this reason and am finally getting back in shape. I will avoid this drug because of that side effect.

I've ben taking neurontin for almost a year.  usually every other day 400X8 every 45 minutes.  I find it stabalizes my mood some and keeps me content.


HOWEVER.. I had some mscontin tonight.= and WOW. just 800X3..  I had a nice opiate buzz (no hard nodding) and the gaba feeling took over.. impressive but crappy.  gaba overpowered morphine.. shit.


other than that I take 30-60mg of oxy once a week or so and I always avoid gaba that day b/c of bioavailability issues.

well, i have been taking neurontin for several months now.  last time i went to pain management i talked with the nurse practitioner about discontinuing it, because i have felt for a while that the side effects were outweighing any benefit i was getting from it.


so i am at about half the dose i was at and my mental state has improved by leaps and bounds.  fuck this stuff.  i am so glad i decided to stop taking it.

^^^ Curious as to what your side effects are, how long you have been taking it, what your starting dose was, and what your dose now is. Oh and has it been a rough taper at all? Curious because I too have been taking Gabapentin for a loooong time (600mgx3 daily) and I dont notice much effect...and I have a lot of mental sluggishness and apathy at time that I would **love** to be able to blame on gabapentin. I love convenient scapegoats like such, but unfortunately it rarely is so simple for me.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) But anyways, I'd love to know more details of your relationship with gabapentin. It had some great mood stabilizing effects on me at first, like pregabalin but without the messy intoxication, drunken high, and pervasive compulsion to always take more. Not so sure anymore, and it is fuck all expensive.

i took it for maybe 6-8 months.  starting dose was 1800mg, raised to 2100 but i went right back down because i felt like a zombie.  that was my dose when i started to tapeer.  i'm at 900mg now.


it made me really slow mentally.  it just felt like my thought processes took forever to finish.  i could never think of the right words.  i was clumsier.  it became obvious why people refer to it as morontin.  i started to get really anxious and paranoid as well, and i was starting to sink into a depression - i felt hopeless a lot of the time.

Gabapentin is not only recreational IMO, it is also addictive. I have been on it for coming on 7 years, and the withdrawls from it are pretty fucking bad: no sleep, anxiety, shaking/tremors, insomnia, HORRIBLE FUCKING RLS...the list goes on to where you wanna take the shit just to get rid of the w/d effects! I love the stuff as a DOC and as a medication. I agree that Pregabalin is better, but they are those types of drugs that are very similar, yet also different in several key ways. I love it. I just took like 6,000mg about an hour ago, and I'm feeling great.

Not dicksizing, but it's very safe. I once took about 19g at once and was fine, just rolling balls and totally fucked up. I've never been worried like "oh shit I took too much", you know?

Good stuff. Good thread.


Oh yeah, drinking an energy drink or a soda after about 30 mins -1 hour DEFINITELY increases the effects as it hits you. I found that out way before I ever came on here and started talking to people about it.

***this post is a quasi-trip report on gabapentin's effectiveness at pain relief of migraines and/or a typical headache. i haven't read all of this thread, and i'm sure there are several posts similar to mine, but i think the kind of contribution i'm giving is essentially achieving the objective of this thread--as in, describing the benefits of this particular medicine.

***


several months ago i was prescribed neurontin as a migraine preventative, but it didn't work. i still have some left over though, and i thought it could provide relief from this bad migraine i'm dealing with right now. i heard neurontin had "recreational" effects, and right now any euphoria, analgesia, or bliss sounds a whole lot better than this migraine.


i took a 1600mg, and i feel some effects. oh, i'm also coming down from a small dose of adderall i took earlier today. i feel like any fatigue, sleepiness, and apathy are enhanced--though not necessarily in a positive sense--by the gabapentin. the "high" is a bit comparable to a slight stimulant buzz that is overpowered by a sizable dose of diphenhydramine (without the delirium). my eyes are very dilated, more so than when i'm on 30-45mg of IR adderall. i'm inspired to go and do something, like clean my room or wash dishes, but i'm so down right now that i can't muster any energy to do anything at all. i feel somewhat lightheaded. my speech is slow and sounds "drugged out", like i just woke up after a coke & booze binge to a real mean hangover; i have to actively try to speak with normal speed and intonation.


about 30 minutes after my initial dose i took another 1600mg: the last of my neurontin stash. 


time feels slowed down. it feels like i've been on this trip for at least three hours but it's been less than half that. i'm watching the eagles/vikings game and i can't believe how long it's been. it's not even halftime and i feel like i could have read a novel or two by now.


i also seem more aware of my senses and feelings, kinda like what happens with marijuana. for example, i have a lidocaine patch on my forehead, and i notice the numbness now much more than i do sober. the lidocaine also seems more powerful of a feeling than it usually is. in this case the gabapentin has been slightly useful at analgesia. i could probably pass out right now just from the synergy of these two drugs. it's interesting that i can feel this way from combining two relatively innocent medications. (side note: it took about 30 seconds to think of the word "lidocaine". surely the drug has also negatively affected my cognition)


i really want to go get a small dose (<10mg) of hydrocodone, but i don't have much left and someone said the neurontin overpowered *morphine*, of all drugs. still, the neurontin hasn't been particularly effective at relieving pain, at least not as much as i wanted it to be.


i don't particularly enjoy these feelings from gabapentin, and i don't see why people take it recreationally. however, i don't think the pain from my migraine is like muscle or nerve pain, so neurontin shouldn't really have any analgesic effects in this case. despite that, i welcome the feelings of the high as a distraction from the pain.

**3 days ago:**

 1 gabapentin (600mg) with 60mg of methadone (not mmt, just recreation), after taking methadone for several days. No potentation or noticeable effect.

**Yesterday:**

about 3 grams of gabapentin over several (4?) hours. Felt the euphoric effect, nothing comparable between anything, plus an opioid feeling for a bit (a bit different than described below, but I'm guessing this is from yesterdays methadone still in my system even though I'm out, could possibly be potenation of the smaller amount left circulating)

**Tonight:**

gabapentin taken (about 4 grams?) over 2 hours with 2mg of alprazolam at 1 1/2 hours, definitely not potentation of the small amount of methadone left in my system, also a euphoric feeling not attributable to methadone or anything. Don't feel the alprazolam too much maybe more relaxed, but that's the one drug it seems I need at least 3+ to 'feel it'. Small bud of some real awesome bud smoked at 3 1/2 hours. Can't tell any poteniation of the cannabis, or even tell I'm high.

The feeling is comparable to cannabis, opiates, stimulants, and benzodiazapines, but only certain effects. No amnesia like the benzos, no strong stimulation like methamphetamine, no opioid glorious feeling, just different. It definitely is it's own type of drug unlike anything else, no sedation as others described. I've never tried lyrica. I have a giant bottle full of at least 170 of these 600mg gabapentin. I'm gonna take a low dose for a few days, and then nothing for a bit and try again, or should I just test whether this "two day love of it" really only applies to some?

**Next tonight**

1200 mg taken, 600 more hour later. No same feeling as yesterday, lessened anxiety maybe, nothing more.

I've been taking Neurontin for about a year and a half. I've got herniated discs and such in my lumbar spine and sciatica down my right leg. My right leg is *always* a mess regardless of Neurontin. There's always some sort of annoying pain, which can increase sometimes for no apparent reason. Without the Neurontin, I have shooting pain in my leg; with the Neurontin, this is almost always controlled. I really don't know, though. It doesn't seem to help *enough,* and I'm honestly thinking of asking my pain management doctor if there's something out there better. Nerve pain is awful because it doesn't respond to pain medication. Not Lidocaine, not Oxycodone, not Hydrocodone, not Dilaudid. Meh.

I've been on 3,200mgs of gabapentin daily for 2 years...It works great as a mood stabalizer with no side effects....IN the first month of treatment i got a rather pleasant buzz from it...far from recreational imo

There is something stronger, maybe better for neuropathic pain, it's called lyrica, as mentioned in this thread, it's Neurontin's bigger, stronger, scheduled brother, your pain management doctor should have no problem trying this if your pain is uncontrolled. 


None of the pain killers you mentioned are much good at that type of pain. They're good as hell for most other pain. Hell, I've had a intolerable headache on recreational 60+ mg of oxycodone (roxi, no apap or other stuff) until I took an NSAID. Not all that stuff is meant for all things medically (for the last three I'd be happy with non medically any day).

I've known about Lyrica for a while now and I'd really love to try it. I've been, uh, seeing surgeons without actually telling my pain management doctor, so I've kind of been avoiding her. I think I'll try asking my current neurosurgeon about it in my next appointment.

i agree.  i ate much healthier when i was on gabapentin do to lack of anxiety and i still gained a bunch of weight for no reason.  it also made me very tired all of the time.  i believe it slowed down my metabolism so i wasn't able to use as many calories as normal.

I have been finding that 1.2g to 1.8g gabapentin every third day -- two off in between -- goes extremely well with my 1mg buprenorphine dose, and marijuana. My dosing schedule is light and consistent. I take 200mg every 45min - 2hr while awake.


It makes me hypomanic almost like a great feeling OC dose or a better stimulant without the body discomfort, nay, with the body *comfort* of a depressant.


I think it potentiates opioids as my pupils get extremely pinpoint when I take it on buprenorphine.

you  can overdose on these pills and also have withdrawals. They are both painful. If you overdose then you get extreme stomach cramps and you have the runs plus you vomit at the same time, it only last for a little bit but it is extremely painful. the withdrawals are worse then opiate withdrawal.

And how long did it take you using gabapentin to suffer withdrawal symptoms? I'm guessing far longer than it would take to produce opioid withdrawal symptoms.

I have mixed feelings about taking it in recreational dosages. Similar to alcohol imo, and  I lose track of time on it.  Definately feels more like morontin.  I can see how some would like it though.

No lie, I've been on Neurontin for 7 years, and the withdrawals are fucking horrible, about as bad as benzo/opiate withdrawal, but it's different, very hard to put a finger on. It makes me so depressed and I have so much pain in my muscles, that I can barely do anything. No motivation.

I take Neurontin because it is one of the greatest drugs ever made, I take it for fibromyalgia, anxiety, and bipolar mood stabilization. It works amazingly. I still need to get back on Lyrica, though, because that shit is a miracle, just like Neurontin but different. Sorry, ya'll, I'm on like 7.2 grams of Neurontin right now and I feel like a billion dollars.

There is one interesting fact that you all should know about gabapentin.  Taking higher doses of the drug makes the recreational affects fall because as the dose is increased the bioavailability falls. The only way to counter this is to eat it after a fatty meal. So those of you who think you are getting a tolerance very quick, may be because you are taking too much to overcome the "tolerance". I take 600 mg's at 3 evenly spaced intervals a day. It gives me clarity of mind and seems to make my clonazepam, methadone, and temazepam work better. However, it seems to dull the rushing effect of my alprazlam. I have heard this from others as well. I have no scientific idea about the mechanism of that. It seems like Im losing my love affair with benzos anyways. I smoke alot of cigs, and most benzos bioavailabilty fall rapidly with smoking. The clonazepam however (my favorite benzo) seems to with stand the cig smoke and also has its high increased by gabapentin. Anyone agrre/ disagree with any of this/

Thanks,

Yes, you really can get a buzz off neurontin. And a rather nice one, though it requires very high doses. I've seen my wife do 50 grams (not a typo) many times. I don't take anywhere near that dose, but it is certainly recreational. There's even one frequent poster here who finds depakote recreational. Lithium is FUCKING DANGEROUS at high dose.

I've been taking Neurontin for a while now. I think it has a lot to do with the size of who is taking it. I am 6'6" 300 lbs and have taken 6 grams of it at once. Basically it really isn't a recreational drug unless it is mixed. I don't drink anymore, but drinking on Neurontin alone will kick your ass.

My suggestion would be if you're a normal sized human being take around 3,000-3,600 mg with Flexeril and any Benzo.

40 mg of Flexeril, 2-4 mg Klonopin and around 3,000 mg of Neurontin makes me have a good day or night.

I use it to enhance my buzz when I've got a serious lack of stash going on. Also great for withdrawals. I destroy my tramadol prescription within a week or two (depending) and when I'm seriously regretting it with my runny nose and ass I take the gabapentin with the odd hydrocodone, oxycodone, or soma i come across. By itself it has mild effects on me. I prefer to take it with something else.

Mixing gabapentin with tramadol makes for a very nice buzz.  What I do is take 900 - 1200mg of Gabapentin with a single 50mg tram, and then subsequently take another tram every half hour until I reach 200 or 250mg (depending on how much I've taken that week).  Then I chill until I reach 4 hours after my initial dose, then I'll take another tram & 300 mg of the Gaba...wait a half an hour...then take another tram.


Seems to really potentiate the tramadol, not to mention I become a fucking chatterbox with amazing euphoria.


Gabapentin alone doesn't seem to really do too much for me except make me feel kinda weird.  But then again I've never taken a single dose above 1200mg.


Btw...I forgot to mention, the reason for spacing out each dose of tramadol is that the bioavailability of Tramadol goes up after each subsequent dose.  If you take all the trams at once it's really just a waste.  Believe me, I've tried.  Spacing them out however produces a great high, not to mention it lasts a really long time.

I think neurontin is quite recreational, but then again, I'm on suboxone too, so that probably plays a role in the effect. Neurontin is a strange drug as it stimulates and sedates your, according to time and mood it seems. In many ways, the way I experience gabapentin at a low-thereapeutic dosage 300-600 mg, it has an almost more opioid affect than benzo effect. When taking huge dosages, I find myself all wobly like I took a lot of xanax.


can you counter act the bioavailability by I.V ROA? This is theoretical, so no flames, I'm just curious, because wouldn't I.V provide close to 100% BA? I know gabapentin is almost 100% water soluble.

Reporting back...1500mg of Gaba last night gave me a mild mood lift about 2 hours in.  Nothing crazy but I remember feeling fairly happy and chatty.  I will say though that it made me quite wobbly (much like you said Znegative) unfortunately...which was not pleasant.  Popped the metaxalone before i got into bed but literally 15 minutes later I don't remember anything.  I woke up this morning with cell phone in hand, a headache, and a bad sore throat from probably sleeping with my mouth wide open drooling all over the place.


So yeah, moral of the story is I need some fucking opiates.

yeah, I would honestly suggest, if you don't already have a high tolerance to gabaergics, to start off on lower dosages like I said above. You get a mild euphoria, which in my opinion feels more like a weak opioid (such as hydrocodone), but then again, I take suboxone so that's likely why it affects me that way.


Taking super high dosages is really unpleasant in my oppinion. I took about 1.5 grams and went to school, and my motor skills were completely fucked up, I was bumping into people, my vision was kind of screwy (almost like I was tripping) and I also would nod out hardcore every time I sat down for more than two minutes, like when you've done way too much H.

What I do is take 900 - 1200mg of Gabapentin with a single 50mg tram, and then subsequently take another tram every half hour until I reach 200 or 250mg (depending on how much I've taken that week).  Then I chill until I reach 4 hours after my initial dose, then I'll take another tram & 300 mg of the Gaba...wait a half an hour...then take another tram.

That's what I'm talking about. Tramadol + Gabapentin is one of the most euphoric combos I've ever done, plus weed of course...and I've done pretty much everything (not dicksizing, just stating). Of course, I would take about 1 gram of tram with 7-9 grams of gabapentin, but still...fuck MDMA, I'd rather do this combo anyday. Bonus: no suicidal comedowns!

Gapapentin, like Phenibut and Baclofen are GABA analogues. Benzo's and Barbiturates increase the rate that GABA passes through the synapse. Wouldn't benzo's also increase the rate that GABA analogues pass through the synapse?

So far I've found that benzo's increase the potency of Phenibut.


Just to note: Phenibut is a miracle cure for me for many issues: stress, anxiety, nerve pain, social issues. Right now I had to up my daily dose of 800mg to 100mg to get the same effect. I'm afraid of WD's I know they will be horrible. When I tried to quit cold turkey I went through hell. I'll have to taper down. Any advice?

Villian - Tramadol bioavailability: 68–72%(Increases with repeat dosing.) Protein binding ... in 12—20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary.  Common information that can be googled if you want to check for yourself.


TheTwighlight - dude, 1 gram of trams is way way way too much bro.  You should really keep it under 400mg.  I take trams all the time (almost everyday) and even when i inch up to 400mg taken in a 6 hour window i start getting the twitches and brain zaps.  Just be safe brother.  If you space out your tram dosing like I said before you won't need to take a gram.  Try it one night, you'll be surprised at how effective it is.

I was on 1800mgs per day for about 2 months for what reason I cant remember but decided to get off.  Didn't have any w/ds.  I like Neurontin when I'm trying to stay off opiates.  It feels real smooth, not jittery like lyrica and tramadol.  Great for opiate w/ds, makes music groovy and gives me a nice dopey feeling.  Most important thing is to stagger the dose and eat something each time you dose.  Neurontin just feels safe.  You're not going to want to take too much and the after effects are minimal.

I've been taking it for 7 years in relatively high doses, and sometimes I do feel kinda...ree-ree. But I don't believe it makes me slow intellectually speaking. I just...I'm a fucking space cadet and I know it. I'm SOOOO spaced out sometimes it leads to interesting hilarity. So it's worth it. And I wouldn't trade the therapeutic value for anything.

I've been trying gabapentin and then pregabalin every few days for the past couple weeks so I can compare them side by side, and gabapentin is the winner for me.  Gabapentin seems to produce way more euphoria in me and visual disturbances (200mg last night made my bedroom look like a constantly morphing havily brushed oil painting in the dark).  Pregabalin is more comparable to a benzodiazepine in effect, which have low abuse potential for me.  There also seems to be less euphoria, but less hangover the next day as well when used for sleep for pregabalin (although hangover is subjective, neither are anything at all compared to alcohol).


As I've said pretty much a billion times, the way to get the most out of pregabalin is 150-200mg doses with small snacks spaced 45-60 minutes apart.  This is the only way I will ever take gabapentin anymore and when dosing like this the effect is incomparable to a similarly sized single dose (severe motor impairments, open eye visuals, MDMA or alcohol-like social disinhibition, euphoria).  This is because of the pharmacokinetics.  If you haven't dosed this way, try it, it's like a totally different drug.

I definitely have learned over time (for me) that with Neurontin, less = more. 300 mg gets me where I want to be, and then maybe 900 over the course of the day keeps me there. For me anything over 300 mg in a single dose works counterproductive.


Definitely feel more social and mood elevation is noticeable. The OEV's and CEV's don't always occur and seem to start when it's been in my system for many hours. It does take a little getting used to and at that point I have to make a conscious effort to keep my thoughts and body moving or I will lose track of time. It doesn't help though that my coordination is shot, lol.


Oh and maybe this is just me but I also find myself talking aloud to the walls.  8(

Hey guys, 


Not sure if anyone has posted this. I accidently found out how to make Neurontin more potent. I take a drug called Max-Alt MLT, and after I took my dose for a migrane, I took my usual dose of Neurontin. I was flying higher than I ever had on that dose in the past. But, if you are planning to get the Max-Alt. Make sure you getting one that melts. Because there is a tablet form that doesn't melt on your tongue. Hope this helps. I heart Neurontin. I'm in recovery from opiates and cannot take anything "addictive". My dr gave me Gabapentin for the w/ds and major depressive disorder. It's not a schedule so I can get multiple scripts and lots of gaba. I am soon going to try pregabalin, which I heard is much better. Anyway, hope this works for you guys....

Last night I gave my little brother 30-40mg of sumatriptan (Imitrex) for his migraine, plus 600mg gabapentin. Once his migraine subsided, he said he definitely felt good. This is also my experience with taking pregabalin/gabapentin with Imitrex.

Wondering if someone can help give me some advice


My first experience with Gabapentin was 1 g about a month ago. effects i noticed were


- more apathy than euphoria

- I talked a lot

- stumbled when walking

- weird body buzz, not bad but different, I smoked probably a gram of weed too though 

- felt slighty stimulated


I have 2 g now, I'm wondering if taking 2 g compared to 1 g will cause a significant difference or not? should I throw a bar in there with it if i'm going to?

**Gabapentin the good and the bad**


In my struggles to find good medicines to combat opiate wd's I've found gabapentin to be a godsend for relief from both acute wd and paws,


Anyone thats used gabapentin knows how extremely fast tolerance to it builds up and is a strange drug in that the more you take the less there will actually be in your system for your body to use,


to combat this one needs to stagger dose about 45 minuets apart from each other and always eat a little bit before each dose.


I've always wondered just how bad (or not) daily gabapentin use is on the internals,


When I have a bottle I will take a minimum of 10,000 mg per day,sometimes 15,000 mg


while gabapentin and it's sister drug pregabalin may not get you completely out of withdrawal forest it certainly tames the bitch down to where you can function and sleep and oddly enough keep ones spirits up if paws is getting to you.


the downsides are the high price of these meds,I'm lucky that I only have to pay around NO PRICES for 90 600mg pills of gaba,but if you don't have insurance or similar this stuff is outragously expensive even for the generic(rite aid charges NO PRICES for the same bottle I pay NO PRICES for).


I've always wondered how bad these extremley high doses of gabapentin are?

it will definatley cause weight gain big time(and you thought pot was bad for the munchies)gaba's got to be 10 times worse than weed ever was.


anyone using gaba at these doses?,dos it help you?do you think it's bad on the body?![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Wow this stuff gets prescribed for a lot of different things. I was prescribed for anxiety, my brother for pinched nerve pain, my best friend for opiate w/d and my mother for arthritis.  What is this stuff?  Most are way lower dosages than you but my buddy coming of H does about 5,000 a day, getting it through an alternative treatment program here in mpls.  Imagine that, a Minnesota treatment center that doesn't use the Minnesota Model?  Their recovery rates are astounding when compared with, say, Hazelden.  Hazelden claims (or did when I was there) an 85% success rate after 10 years.  Out of the 26 men in my "unit", I think one is sober 9 years later (several are dead).  The HRC actually achieves something like 80%.  And no book-thumping!

Neurontin got me through acute W/D from Buprenorphine, but I didn't dose 1/10th what you claim to. For me, it did exactly what you described - took the edge off physically enough to let me function in the least bit while keeping my cravings nearly entirely curbed.


Questions: Were you prescribed Gabapentin for pain after an opiate problem and were you directed to dose close to the amount of 10-15g's a day? Is this a one-time experience? How often do you experience opiate W/D's and dose with Gabapentin to alleviate? 


I certainly hope you don't use, use and then use Gaba to withdraw...


I don't know the effects that may be caused by this kind of anti-convulsive/tranquilizer consumption, acute or long term.


My gut tells me though, that if they come in 300mg/600mg capsules, reaching 15grams by taking 25 (with 600mg) or even 50 times (with 300mg) that individual amount can't be good for you. 


Because it treats nerve issues among others, perhaps it could dull your ability to fully feel everything in various parts of your body with longterm use?

I am scripted gabapentin for rls and nerve pain 600mg 3 times a day,I discovered it's ability to help opiate withdrawal by accident and desperation,


I've told a lot of people and I think many did not believe me when I told them the first time I took gaba it got me so stoned I could barely even walk,it felt better than an opiate to me,


but just like many reports you will come across it only does this the first and second times and never ever again,I mean I've taken over 6 month breaks from the stuff and still nothing,must be somthing to do with the part of the mind this stuff effects,if it felt like that everytime I'd have no use for opiates.


I gradually got to the high doses looking for relief and not so much the high,I 'd rather take gaba than subs which I'm having a terrible time with(allergic really bad)


I wish I had vats of the stuff or it was otc,I go thru a months supply in a few days![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


and yes I usually save my scripts for emergencies which is bad I know![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


the high dose don't seem to bother me but I can do 2500-3000mg of tramadol a day without any problems(oxymoron)as far as seizures go


one thing about gabapentin tho-it can alter perception in ways that are scary,


I've been fine (or thought to be fine)while on GP and had some hallucinations that make pcp and lsd kids stuff,not "good" hallucinations but hellishly frightening ones that lasted for several minuets that made me think I was being haunted


I also blacked out while driving,I was completely normal not feeling impaired in the slightest when I slammed into a parked car doing 40mph causing a chain reaction totaling 5 other cars in the process,


the emt and police thought for sure when they cut me from the car I would be trashed on somthing but they ended up just dropping me off at my house(very kind of them)


so now I'm really careful as to what I do while on GP.

Where I am at the moment in Eastern Europe they sell ampules called gabba gamma which contain 500 mg of gabapenatin. I was pescribed it for opiate w/d's and cravings after I got out of rehab here. It does wonders it kills my cravings for needles and dope. Normal tabs of gabapenatin are otc and lyrica but I usually go for the ampules.

If you're not exaggerating that number for tramadol (2.5g-3g) then maybe the Gabapentin has suppressed your CNS so much that the tramadol runs it's course without affecting your NS. 6x the seizure dosage is INSANE.

wow gabapentin otc where's my passport!!!!

No exxageration on the tram dose or the gaba,I get embarrased when I have to go thru this stuff in group,its crazy but true,


all the tram has messed me up in the mind,off of it I feel nothing emotionally and I mean nothing,


sex appeal-gone,any interest once had-gone,


I think about death and wonder why anybody even bothers to do anything at all in life,pretty fucking annoying,oh yes I do feel annoyed and angry those feelings are pretty much all I feel,really sucks bad


as far as one drug overiding the other I dunno,its all to confusing to think about


I'm off to the doc today that has scripted me bupe,man has this stuff did a number on me,hives,swelling,fever,puking and on and on,he's going to try subutex to see if the naloxone is the probem but I gotta bad feeling I just can't take bupe at all,my options are running thin,I'll post back tonight(I hope)

I actually just googled baclofen + gabapentin hallucinations and found myself here. I'm presribed 100mg 3 times a day but I do sometimes take more at night along with my zolpidem. If I close my eyes and then open them again, I absolutely hallucinate and walking in dark rooms enhances those hallucinations. As I sit here reading this, the words are going in and out. I don't plan on continuing this practice as I can see it becoming a bit too necessary to help with the sleeping pill kick in. It's fun though and I will probably do it a few more times. I am hopefully getting surgery in late May-Early June. No more gabapentin for me unless the surgery doesn't fix it. 


HA. Just as I finished tying that last sentence, I saw a cute little duck on my screen for about 10 seconds. 

Alright, enough rambling from me for now.

Gabapentin can give a very noticeable buzz.  I'm prescribed about 9 x 300mg per day,  it basically does nothing.  I don't take it every day, only on occasion.  Today I took 12,000mg (like 40 x 300mg). I'm not exaggerating.   I don't see anyone on this board taking this big of a dose.  However, I'm 230lbs, and my system can handle a large amount.  Be very careful if you are taking that much.  Little by little.  I started with 7200, then worked my way up to 12000 over a period of 2-3 hours.  I'm actually coming down from it right now and it's not too bad.  I wouldn't recommend doing this all the time, of course.  If you choose to take a high dose like I did, do it little by little and you will find your limit.  Careful is the key word.  It's very nice, makes you relax, makes you happy, a mild bit of euphoria.  


I also saw some thread about someone asking about snorting gabapentin.  I would say don't do it.  I haven't tried it, but the pills are weak, individually.  You would have to snort a mountain of it and that's too much substance.  It can't possibly be better, even if it is water soluble, still not a good idea.  Also it's not a benzo...

^ When I used to get high on gabapentin, I would dose anywhere from 12,000mg - 19,200mg. Not dicksizing, just saying it depends on the person. I've been on it for about 7 years now, and I take it responsibly now, but there was a time that I LOVED getting high on the shit. I take 3,600mg per day now, and it works wonders the way it's supposed to. Also, I wouldn't snort it simply because gabapentin is one of the most vile, disgusting chemicals on the face of this earth. I tried to snort it and threw up in my mouth instantly.

Gabapentin with coke (or any soda I think) is very effective and it comes on faster. As you probably now, normally it takes a long time (even 1-2 hours) to feel it but with coke you can speed it up.


I do end up taking high doses of gabapentin (up to 10g) whenever I reduce my opiate usage (fentanyl patch going from 50->12.5 though I'm going to be prescribed it for several years due to my condition). 


To be honest, my plan is to completely go off the fentanyl and when I get a refill each month I'm just going to extract the fentanyl out and use it intranasally and then stop for 20-25 days and then doing it again.  I'm almost done with using the patch but the idea of getting a refill every month has an addictive appeal to me. Who knows, I may just tell the doc I don't need any more scripts and I think I can walk away from it but it's hard to say. I don't do anything else (not even drink) so I think the once a month opiate abuse at low doses might be okay. Something to think about.

came across this thread while researching neurontin withdrawal.


it is NOT FUN AT ALL.  worse than klonopin withdrawal in my experience in that my mood is completely kooky...it's not just a physical withdrawal.  high irritability and a feeling of wanting to stab anyone who makes even the littlest noise.


think of a hangover but without the i-had-fun-the-night-before-so-its-worth-it feeling.  


i was on it since 2009 at 900 mg/day and am completely off of it now for 3 weeks and still feeling withdrawal.  


i can't understand taking it for a high either.  the high i felt from it occurred and stopped 3 days after i started taking it regularly.  


for gods sakes, smoke pot or something.  this drug sucks.


plus it makes you gain weight, i went from 125 to 150 on it and then when i quit taking it lost those 25 lbs and 5 more.  so i guess is some really stupid way you could lose weight from withdrawing from it.  


the only upside to it imo is that its cheap as chips

Gabapentin just made my life so much easier coming off of fentanyl after about a year on the patches at 50mcg/hr. I tapered down to about 12.5mcg/hr and then jumped off. I did this Friday midnight and it's now nearing 72 hours and I don't feel much though yesterday was the hardest and I got my gabapentin refill this morning and took 8g (that's 8000mg) and went to sleep for about 6 hours (also with tizanidine---this stuff knocks me out all the time) and feel absolutely great to be frank, surprisingly great. I attribute this to gabapentin! Until I had gabapentin, I was feeling mild WD but it was intense enough to be bothersome but once the gabapentin high was restored, the WD went away.


The high is extremely prone to tolerance, so just on Fri and Sat gapabentin had lost all its effectiveness for me but I was without it for about 40 hours and then took a megadose and it worked. 


I will write more about my experience in the withdrawal thread in a few minutes (search for bluedom).

Just updating. I'm now off fentanyl for two weeks. But I've really not felt much WD (except day 2) since I moderated it using loperamide and gabapentin. Gabapentin was great for week 1, but then I had to take 10-15g just to feel something. Then I switched to loperamide (doses of 60mg, 120mg, 170mg which was too much, and then 30-40mg every few hours kept post acute WD at bay).  


After being off gabapentin for a week, I took 3g of gabaneptin and I feel fantastic. This is really happiness in a pil I think. And watching the entire Matrix series on it (currently on the Animatrix) is fantastic.


I will stay on gabapentin for a week and then go back to the fentanyl for a few days and then switch back to gabapentin. This is my plan for the summer. (That and saving the world. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

And then combining gabapentin with medical THC seems to work really well. A really nice subtle trip and then in terms of pain (damage to spine and vertebrae which is self healing for which I am prescribed 50mcg/hr of fentanyl which I am off of), it is better than opiates I feel. With opiates, even though the pain is gone, I still feel stiff and I am reluctant to bend my back. But with this combo, or perhaps just mainly the medical THC, not only is my pain gone but also I seem to have much smoother movements with my back and I move normally. Has any experienced this? Opiates vs. THC for pain? I need to search that...

I'm sure this has been posted in here, and I'm looking through the thread to find the answer, but if someone could answer me before I find that it would be helpful.


I'm prescribed benzos, however, they usually disappear quite fast, and until my next script I have a very limited supply of which I can only take a few near the end of my month. I never get withdrawals, so that's not a problem.  However, I was able to early this morning take several benzos to help with the comedown (or force a comedown) or adderall + some other problems, and be able to sleep.


I'm happy to say that right now I've got a nice benzo buzz going on, and although I get a lot of benzos, by the time my next script rolls around I'm back to being able to feel them good. I only took a few, of a strong benzo, however, I'm feeling that nice feeling ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Will taking gabapentin ruin that feeling?


I know they are both gaba agonists, however, they work differently in that gabapentin isn't a benzodiazepine, and the benzos obviously are. I'm not sure which sub sets of gaba they work on off the top of my head, and need to look that back up, but will they have a nice synergy? Or will taking to much somehow bump the benzo's out? Or just override them?


Or is it like trying to take vicodin on top of suboxone which just won't work since suboxone has a much higher binding affinity?


Thanks for the help ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't recall the specific receptor that gabapentin binds to, but I am fairly sure I recall that it is not the same as benzodiazapines. So taking the two together should not produce any competition for binding.


The two are somewhat related (mainly that benzo's and gabapentin seem to substitute partially for each other in withdrawal) though, and share a lot of the same effects... so its possible that using one may reduce the effect of the other due to tolerance, but that is just something I am deducing and may be incorrect on.

Gabapentin is great for synergizing with benzos. If you normally do not feel euphoria from alprozolam and clonazepam, gabapentin will change that.


By itself, the effects are weak. At 1100 mg I experienced noticeable, uplifted mood. Increased talkativeness and a pleasant body vibe.


You could say it had social anxiety cutting effects. Better than my klonopin as it did not make me sleepy.


It's definitely a great "Base" drug if you're experienced with RX drug combinations.

This is like the best stuff for buprenorphine withdrawls ! It's to the point where you can feel the withdrawls start to fade away after you take some... It takes about 3 hours to really kick in... your thought processes get a little more abstract. 


The only complaint is my ability to read is highly affected. 


What is your experience with addiction to gabapentin? I want to make sure I don't get addicted to it. I know its about dose and length of use... 


My rule of thumb is no more than 300 mgs every 4 hours at the most... which works out to 600 every 8 . That small dose is amazing for treating post-opiate withdrawal (PAWS) . I went from not being able to funtion to being able to go back to work in 2 days from neurontin.

I took two 800mg tabs with my daily methadone dose this morning (95MG liquid concentrate) and the buzz was very noticeable and quite enjoyable!  I didn't think that I would like the Gabapentin, but while I was waiting for my bus to go to the clinic to dose this morning I met a young man from boston.  Apparantly Gabapentin is really popular in the new england area and this young man gave me four 800mg tabs to experiment with.  The buzz could be compared to being a little tipsy on alcohol, and it synergized well with the methadone.  I would recommend it to anybody on MMT who wants to enhance their dose a little bit.  This medication is one that you will develop a tolerance to very fast so be careful!

How much should I take to get a buzz if I am non-tolerant? Well maybe there may be some cross tolererance from the Phenibut (3 days a week) and Ettizolam (2 days a week).

I only read a few of these posts as this thread is 11 pages long; but I read something about gabapentin interacting with morphine. Would it not be safe to take morphine if prescribed 300mg gabapentin BID?

That's pretty much an impossible question to answer, bud.


What dose of a benzo, low-high? What benzo? What effects are you looking for? Are you looking to mellow out or get throwed as fuck?

Doesn't much matter. Just a dose that would potentiate a benzo dose. I doubt the variance between benzos would matter much, sure they work differently but rarely that differently. How about a range to potentiate a mainly anioxlytic style benzo at a moderate dose leading up to high dose? I'm basically wondering if a gram or more is needed or if 400-800 mgs would potentiate a dose and it will be recreational use mainly so it doesn't matter if I end up drooling a bit.

Well, you see, gabapentin has a high and a feeling all its own. So, what I was getting, I suppose is this: are you trying to get high on a benzo *AND* gabapentin, or just the benzo w/ a lil bit of potentiation?


If you just want a little boost, 400-800mg would be good. I would personally recommend 3-4 grams with your recreational dose of a benzo.

Never had Gabapentin before, have just ordered some from an online pharm site.  

Am thinking of combining it with Etizolam (benzo type) and with Poppy Tea.  What sort of dosage should I try?


Have slight Benzo tolerance and I weigh around 210 pounds.

ime start off with 1200 mg and work your way up.  Think about using naproxen and caffeine too.  Also think about spacing out the gabas and the etilaam

I was wondering what is the best way to take gabapentin for recreational effects? Should I take one big dose or should I spread it out? If so at what time intervals? Should I eat it with food or without food? Should I take it with soda or something acidic or no? Just to clarify I am using the 300mg capsules of Neurontin.


Also, are there any potentiators for gabapentin? Will grapefruit juice work?

funny i was looking up something on zolpidem and saw this. WARNING: Gabapentin is NOT enjoyable for everyone. I still have a shitload after finding I must be allergic. I have back pain that is bad at night  when i sleep otherwise fine. my opiod tolerance under prescription was 240mg a day of oxycontin. My pain specialist wanted me to try this. I tryed it at holiday time. had me start out slow. i was haveing bad side effects before I could get to a dose that is effective for pain. this doesnt work like normal pain killers. Anyway, I was having ringing in my ears and when i talked it sounded funny when i woke up. I felt useless. I actually started crying for no reason, feeling depressed, almost suicidal. pretty much, "if this is how I am going to feel to replace opiates. i might as well shoot myself" feeling. I was swithcing from oxy to morphine at same time but i know withdrawals and this was not them. 


What I would say to compare to someone is..if you find 2 bottles of DXM cough syrup a good feeling than  maybe you will like. I love psycedelics, opiats and benzos, coke ,  good meth (haha anymore) and I did not enjoy this in small dose..I got to 2 pills 2x daily and had to stop. Sadly as opiates make it a pain in the ass to work overseas...ireally wish it would have owrked out,, now i am starting nortyiptline..hopefully it works well


Be carefull, peace

My Gabapentin arrived, along with Baclofen that I ordered.


Started off by taking 600 mg with my Poppy Tea, it enhanced  the sedation from th Poppy Tea.


Yesterday had 1800 mg of Gabapentin along with 4 mg of Etizolam.  Was niely sedated, but crashed out siiting at my PC.  Think the Etizolam overpowered the Gabapentin a bit, so in the future may try a higher dose without Benzos.


Today got high on Poppy Tea, took that at 10:45 this morning and took some Gabapentin at 3 pm.  Now I've been seriously nodding mainly in front of my PC.  Am going to give the Gabapentin and Benzos a rest for a few days, as I can easily potentiate my poppy tea with other things such as anti-histamines and Grapefruit juice.

I'm prescribed Lyrica(Pregabalin), which is by far better than Gabapentin in my experience. Both drugs are quite similar though.  I find the best method to get effects is to only take them every 3 days as tolerance ruins it very fast.


       I'm currently on 200mg Pregabalin twice a day. So what I do is save 400mgs a day for 2 days, then on the third day take 1200mgs on an empty stomach first thing in the morning, washed down with a strong coffee and a multivitamin. This may be too strong for some people, but for me its a perfect dose.


       I would strongly advise not taking Gabapentin daily if you want to get good recreational effects from it.

I started using Gabapentin recently.  On Friady had 2800 mg with 1 mg of Etizolam.  Very sedating and euphoric, gave me the kind of nod normally just reserved for strong opiates!


Am trying to use Gabapentin just once a week to keep tolerance down.


Does anyone know if these have cross toleranace with Benzodiazepines?


Cheers

Gabapentin goes well with a low dose of Benzos.  Had 3000 mg last Friday with 1 g, experienced sedation with an awsome sence of well being.  Took 2 to 3 hours to kick in fully.  Got the impairted performance, the I was getting auditory hallucinations.  I the crashed out at my computer and work up at about 6 in the moring.  Had an afterglow the next day.

I like taking ~1gram of gabapentin when I am going on a meth or coke bender. It keeps me from getting the painful crampy muscle tension from large dosages of stimulants and also also cushions my come down and keeps my headaches to a minimum.

Figured id throw my 2 cents in... just got out of rehab for heroin addiction and was given 100 mgs of neurontin 3 times daily and 600 mgs at night for RLS along with trazadone for sleep and my prozac too. I have yet to find any use for the gaba except maybe to calm my nerves when i start getting the twitches of wanting to get a bag of dope... ill take 1200 mgs and calm down on the couch. I guess you could say it is like a mild benzo like diazepam but not with any recreational effects. I will try 1800 mgs and see if that makes a difference but I doubt it... prolly just get sleeping.... maybe with some antihistamines could get kind of a nod feeling maybe idk

Hi everyone, I hope that I'm not repeating a question that has been asked a bunch of times before in this thread, but I used the search engine and didn't find what I was looking for. So, I have been on gabapentin for anxiety (off label) for about a year now, and I'm ready to quit it completely after my finals. I am getting more and more problems with it, especially with rebound anxiety if I miss a dose, tolerance, and very uncomfortable physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms even when I try to taper down. They are: cold sweats/chills, heart palpitations, paralyzing anxiety, insomnia, depression, fatigue... They go away if I take my dose again/or a higher dose.

You need to taper, I was on it for 8 months 3200mg a day for neuropathic pain. Drop 300mg off your dose every week until you're down to 100mg then jump off. That's the best way, it can seriously mess you up if you reduce too slow. I had bad side effects from it anyway, and pregabalin which is a shame as I was hoping it would help my pain but no it turned me into a zombie, made my panic attacks worse, made me shake and affected my coordination, the pregabalin actually made me fall alot of times which caused me to hurt my already injured parts. I got same off low doses as high doses and my body never got used to it. 


Good luck and remember to drop as slow as you can to keep withdrawals to a minimum.

Yeah man, gabapentin caused me some of the worst w/d I have ever felt from *anything*, and that says a lot coming from my ex-junkie ass. It was like Suboxone; except it wouldn't end. After a month Sub w/d got significantly better. After a month of gabapentin w/d, it had not eased one bit (take in mind I had been on 2400-3600mg/day for 8 years). I was plagued with agoraphobic anxiety, cold sweats and chills that were as bad as any opioid w/d I'd ever had if not worse, inability to find words and worse short-term memory problems than when I was on it, pretty severe depression, lack of energy, and flu-like muscle pain. Like I said, it wasn't any better after 30 days. I gave in and have been on it since. (I've probably gone into w/d from it ~5 times over the years).

Yes. I find with gabapentin, when taken properly in sequential doses and when you can achieve that great, clear euphoria (sometimes with CEV of moving, watery organic forms), the next day usually has a grand afterglow too. It helps with sleep and when you wake you feel refreshed.


Also, about the psychedelic effects of the drug - they fascinate me. I find once I get to that great glowy place with gabapentin, if I close my eyes it's almost like being able to go inside mini lucid dreams with vivid, spontaneous visuals. I like to lay on my bed and let the visuals happen, sometimes drifting toward sleep, other times remaining relatively conscience and aware.

I actually had my one and only seizure while taking this drug (prescribed) with Welbutrin (prescribed to help quit smoking). It wasnt until I mixed in a mild opiate...but i wont take any of those together till this day because its the only seizure i had and the dr said theres a slightly higher chance of having a seizure when mixing the anti with the Gabapentin...(dont ask me why he prescribed them together then, perhaps he was just hopefull that I wouldnt be the 1%) Jerk.

Hey out there. Im new to this so if this is in the wrong thread, I apologize. I was on Gabapentin for a couple of months as a last resort to treat my blood clot pain in my groin. The pain is intense and runs my life. 3 months ago I was put on methadone. Well, I still have a bunch of gabapentin left from last year with refills still legit. My question is, will the gabapentin boost the methadone effects a bit? Ive tried tagament and grapefruit but it doesnt work for me. I was excited to see in this thread that some people have had success at combining these two. I guess Ill try it and see. Im only gonna start at 300mg a day I guess. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

Glad to report, methadone and gabapentin mix well. My tolerance is low and Im tryin to keep it that way. Im taking 900mg of gabapentin a day and 40mg of methadone. I take them both together 4 times a day. I can sure tell a difference in pain management. Im still in a lot of pain and would rather another opiate but I have tons of gabapentin. Bout 2 hrs after dosing, effects kick in. Not too strong but better than nothing. Gabapentin good!!

Yeah gabapentin really does potentiate the body high with opiates, and it's great to use for withdrawal or whenever you're tapering. I'm surprised to hear so many people experience withdrawal from gabapentin. I mean, it makes sense being a gabaergic and all, but I took about 1,200 mg or more a day for half a year and had no problem quitting cold turkey. I guess I'm lucky though.


The thing that pisses me off, is that for some reason, gabapentin has completely lost its recreational value to me. When I first started taking it, a low dose would make me feel speedy, and higher dosages felt like a sloppy Xanax high. Now, if I take any dosage above 600mg, I just feel awful from it. My motor functions become sloppy like I'm drunk, I get a slight body high that feels like the body high from THC, and I become very paranoid and confused. It's so strange that the drug seems to affect me in a COMPLETELY different way now, then it did about a year ago.


In the end though, I can't complain, it's made tapering down on my suboxone so much easier than if I didn't have it. I bet that if I could have a week to hole up in a shitty hotel and detox, I could get by with just the gabapentin and maybe some diphenhydramine.

Yup, I agree with you Znegative. Ive never taken enough gabapentin for a high of its own but it sure makes my methadone stronger. Im up to 900mg a day which might go up Monday when I see my Doc. I have used gabapentin when I ran out of pills in the past and It does really help with withdrawal. It did for me anyway. Still at a 5 on the pain scale. Trying to find other things that will help too. Methadone is very hard to boost, as everyone knows.

Let me assure everyone here that all at once is the way to go. Then stagger afterwords if you please. Unless you're not looking to get fucked up, because gabapentin will most assuredly fuck your ass up if you dose several grams with little/no tolerance to the drug.


When I first started using the drug about 8 years ago, the highs I experienced was as euphoric and amazing as MDMA, no lie. Different, but the body high...holy shit. Seriously, like 10 hours of straight-up full-body waves of pure ecstasy. The mental high was that of being totally disinhibited, but not to the point where I would wake up the next morning being told shameful stories of the night before, i.e. benzos. Very sociable, energetic even, but still "downered-out", per say. It's very hard to explain. On top of that, there's no comedown and it lasts *all fucking day*.


Downsides are really nothing but some pretty scattered/blurry memories of being high. But most of them are there. Never blacked out on it, that I remember anyway (lol obviously). If taken regularly, like a medication, it most definitely causes some fairly serious short-term memory issues...if you even care. I don't having been a benzo addict for the last decade nearly (I'm 4 months off them now). I don't know what having a good memory even means, so that side effect could be worse. It's not as bad as benzo-memory, so I'm not complaining.


I'm rambling because I'm really high on bupe right now, so I'm gonna go, but I'll be back to check the thread later on. Peace & Love, yoos guys.

Gabapentin takes the edge off of most stimulants and puts me to sleep rather nicely, but it makes me foggy headed all the next day, and I almost ALWAYS wake up too early after a night of being put to bed by good old mexican gabapentina.


I'm curious to know if the bioavailability is increased by plugging it? Just wondering.

**Gabapentin**


so, i can't see my psychiatrist until late next month to get on my normal med regime. there is an emergency psychiatric room i can go to where i was offered gabapentin and vistaril once, but never got the script because i was so angry they wouldn't give me what i need. (you have to sit there for HOURS with loons. GREAT for anxiety - just to get treated like a junkie for needing klononpin).


anyway, i am wondering if i should go back. i know vistaril doesn't really do shit for me, but i don't know much about this gabapentin. i just asked a friend who says it works "fairly rapidly", but i assumed it was like an ssri. where you take it over a period of time and just have to *guess* if there is a difference. 


experiences please? i understand not everyone who has used it has an anxiety disorder, so if you have one that would be more helpful, but all experiences are welcome.


do you *feel* this working? does it really kick in fast? is it stronger than vistaril? 


i really want to get as much info as possible before i go back to that hellhole to get a prescription.

If you use the search engine, you'll find a gabapentin mega thread that has a lot of helpful information on it.


Gabapentin is not like an SSRI. I believe it is sometimes prescribed as a mood stabilizer, but more often for neurological pain, and for it's anti-seizure capabilities. Like benzodiazepine's (Xanax, clonazepam etc..), Gabapentin works on the same receptors (GABA), though it's kind of unclear as to what it actual does. For anxiety, gabapentin can definately be used. It's not as good as Xanax, clonazepam or diazepam IMO, but it's great for when you don't have access to those drugs. It kicks in after about 20 minutes when taken orally, and last a pretty long time. The one thing about it that sucks, is that once you reach a certain dosage (somewhere around 2 grams I believe), taking more of it will actually decrease how much actually gets absorbed. So the best way to use it for anxiety, I found, is to take it as needed, and if you must take it every day, than keep your dosage low, like 600mg/day.


Hope that helps some.

thanks, i'll search that now.


 i went ahead and got the prescription. besides the four and a half hour wait, it was tolerable up until the last part, when the woman who gave me my discharge papers was a complete and utter cunt. i'm usually a pretty reasonable person, but i called her a fucking bitch as i left. i have zero tolerance for people who work in the mental health field and use it to take out their own issues by treating the patients like shit. it is SO hard to find a good psychiatrist. fucking hell, i hate the mental health industry. while i was waiting this idiot came in who was trying to get oxy's there! that's part of why people like me who actually need controlled substances can't get them.

Gabapentin does not work on GABA. It was developed as a GABA analogue but it doesn't seem to work on the same receptors (likewise with pregabalin---it's a total coincidence they actually ended up being among the greatest discoveries by Pharma in recent years)! It's exact mechanism of action is unclear.


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin#Pharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin#Pharmacology)


For me, it takes two hours for gabapentin to kick in. If I drink coke or a carbonated beverage, it takes one hour. 


Gabapentin's bioavailability does decrease with increased dosages, but I believe it's pretty dose dependent meaning that the more you take, the less bioavailable it becomes. 


"Bioavailability for the immediate-release tablets decreases as dose increases; bioavailability is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1,200, 2,400, 3,600, and 4,800 mg/day given in 3 divided doses, respectively. Food has ony a slight effect on rate and extent of absorption (14% increase in AUC and C max ). Bioavailability for the ER tablets is approximately 75% (with food) and 42% to 65% (fasting). T max was 7.3 h (with food) and 5 h (fasting)."

Today, after half a year, I did 3600mg of Gabapentin Neurontin brand. Usually, I would buy Lyrica, but for some reason, I choose Neurontin this time.

Well, In December 2011 I did 24/7 GBL. It was and is to this date, the best drug I have ever did, even if it harms your body or kills you; I know the risks of taking GBL.


In January 2012 I had a nasty WD of GBL. I felt *very* depressed for almost a week. I still think of buying more, but I couldn't.

The point of this story, is that today, after 5 hours of ingesting the pills, I felt **like I was on GBL.** Maybe not so euphoric as I was but... the happiness, the mood lift, the music enhanced, the "warm" feeling.. I don't know the pharmaceutical way of Gabapentin... I don't know how it works, even the prospect of Pfizer says they don't know how it works, but I can assure it feels like a low dose of GBL. It is awesome.


I just wanted to share this. Now I will do some Codeine because I have read it enhances opiates.


I would really like to know how GBL/GHB are connected with Gabapentin...

Just so you realise...


Neurontin is Gabapentin and Lyrica is Pregabalin... Two completely different drugs.


GBL/GHB is a GABAb agonist gabapentin is a GABA analogue.

Of course I know that. I have read all the Wikipedia of Gabapentin, Pregabalin and GHB/GBL. But I'm not the only one who feels large doses of Gabapentin like a low GBL/GHB dose. As I said before, I would like to know why this happens. I can assure you it's not placebo. I wasn't even thinking about GBL when I did Gabapentin, yet I feel the same effects.

This surprises me. I guess I get the body high of GBL, but my mental intoxication off of gabapentin feels more like THC.

 gababpentin with benzos and opies  = mood lift, nice sedation, euphoria, but not for long, before you know it you will be in a long and deep sleep.  Oh and sex is good on Gabapentin, and you last ages.

People have found pregabalin and gapapentin to be highly promiscuous. They are predicted to bind to a ton of human proteins. So the way they exert their activity is through sophisticated network based multitargeting IMO (for now). They're targeting whole systems that regulate your body and this could include the GABA-based systems even though we know they don't bind GABA_A itself directly in vitro. Given the multtargeting nature and natural sequence variability of humans, this is why probably why you see the effect you do and others see a different effect. It is not wholly surprising at all. But I'd argue they are not exerting their activity through GABA directly but rather through other mechanisms. From Wikipedia:


"Gabapentin was initially synthesized to mimic the chemical structure of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but is not believed to act on the same brain receptors. The mechanism of action that leads to its rapid analgesic effect is simply unknown. Some of its activity may involve interaction with voltage-gated calcium channels. Gabapentin binds to the α2δ subunit (1 and 2) and has been found to reduce calcium currents after chronic but not acute application via an effect on trafficking[40] of voltage-dependent calcium channels in the central nervous system.[41] Another possible mechanism of action, reported by Ben Barres and colleagues in Cell in 2009, is that gabapentin halts the formation of new synapses.[42]"


(Hmm, interesting; I didn't know Ben Barres was looking into gabapentin.)

Gabapentin is great. So great and clean. I feel it just enhances and supplements the life around us, it does not interfere with it. It is probably my favorite compound.


Such a beautiful drug at high doses staggered. I achieve a brilliant hallucination in the mirror where I saw my soul tiling around me body. Then I rolled around on my floor and loved it. I felt so free. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I took 2.7g in 300mg staggered for about 8 hours. I did then pass out too, which was unexpected, but woke up and was still feeling it. I love how it binds to entire systems of proteins and thus affects everyone differently. What a great drug. I know there are some lovers on Bluelight of it too. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

It is a very good medication.  Not much abuse potential.  It has a calming effect, but not quite the same as a benzo does.


What are you being prescribed this for, and what is the dosage?  Also what other daily medications do you take? I can answer better if I have more info.  


It was originally an anti seizure med, but has been shown less effective in that capacity than the clinical trials led us to believe.

i find neurontin to be a very effective med...if i take 800 mgs i can feel it kick within 30 minutes..it lowers my enxiety and it also gives me a slight manic type energy..it feels very clean and i dont feel sedated on it like i do benzos..i simply feel chilled out yet i feel more pro-social on it..it doesnt hurt my libido like benzos, it seems to enhance it a little..sadly i wouldnt compare heurontin to Ghb effects and im a bigtime lover of Ghb lol...


  only downsides of neurontin is that if i take it for more than 3 days in a row, it tends to poop out..plus, when im on neurontin the last thing i would want to do it take some type of test of any sort..lol..my mind is not mush like alcohol but my meory seems impaired..all in all a very good drug..


  have you guys had success using neurontin everyday for months on end??

I've taken gabapentin recreationally for about two years now.  When I say recreationally I mean once a week at a dose ranging from 1800 mgs to 3600 mgs, taking 300 mgs every 45 minutes until I've completed my dose.  The effects are generally elevated mood, decreased social anxiety, talkativeness, increased feelings of empathy with others, euphoria, slight visual hallucinations, physical energy and ah-may-zing sex.


I've found a few things potentiate it which I haven't seen listed in all 14 pages of this thread.  


Chamomile tea -  When you first start feeling the effects, drink a nice strong cup of the tea (two teabags) or take a ground chamomile capsule.  Definately increases the euphoria and 'downer' effect of gabbies.  


Passionflower tea - basically does the same thing as chamomile tea but with more of a downer effect.


GABA supplements - although they say GABA does not cross the blood/brain barrier, I've found this to be untrue.  Mixed with gabapentin, GABA really amps up the effects.


All the above mixers will cut down on your need to dose high, thus saving precious gabapentin. :D  I notice if I'm doing gabbies with any of them, my dose will can be pretty much cut in half.

I've just started this for odd symptoms in my leg which the doctor thinks is nerve damage. ( I was in a car accident about 5 weeks ago) 


Anyway, the doctor said to titrate the dose, 300mg day 1&2, 600 mg days 3&4, and 900mg day 5 onwards. 

She didn't tell me why, and google hasn't been of much use. 


Can anyone explain why I need to slowly increase the dose?

Its because your body needs to get use to the drug. It needs to get into your system and upping the dose slowly will help keep unwanted side effects away like diarrhea. Also you may be good at 300-600mg. If so let your dr know you don't need to increase it to 900mg and that it is working. 


It's always good to introduce a drug slowly. You never really know how your body will react to a drug. If you have a reaction then it won't be as bad as taking the full amount. I hope this helps.

Maybe GABA supplements would help with the withdrawal and/or can be used during a taper to supplement while you lower your dose? I have no idea if this would help, just thinking out loud.

**Neurontin/gabapentin**


I am curious about this drug. I have been prescribed it in the past, was on a dose of 3200 mgs and am now back on it at 2400 mgs. It is the only drug that works well to manage my anxiety other than benzos which i dont take due to a past addiction. Ive heard it marketed as a 'wonder drug' that helps with depression, anxiety, pain, as well as having some antipsychotic properties and helps with opiate/benzo withdrawls). They market it as being 'non addictive' and safe for use at high doses. This is bullshit as I have become completely dependant on it, and when i go a day without taking it i feel myself getting sick. I went off 3200 mgs in the past and went through withdrawls that i would equate to a mild dope sickness. Also i have taken 4000 mgs and experienced a temporary psychosis. I am just wondering what other peoples experiences are with this drug as it seems to be (in my opinion) as bad as benzoS and i cant grasp why its marketed tge way it is, fucking evil drug companies man... Any ways im just interested to hear what other people think of the drug.

Gabapentin and Pregabalin withdrawal have been likened to a weird mix of an opiate/benzo withdrawal, with a significant amount of mood instability. Gabapentin is *not* a drug I would want to be physically dependent on, especially not on more than 600mg a day.


Your dosage is far too high, which is why you are quite physically dependent. If you require dosages that high, just switch to pregabalin (Lyrica), as it more efficiently crosses the BBB and has a higher BA, making it a more effective anxiolytic and analgesic at lower dosages, cutting down on physical side effects and cognitive impairment.


300mg Gabapentin ~= 100mg Lyrica

would you mind sharing this information with us please instead of just a statement and nothing backing it up.  not just a list of symptoms.


i believe you could be right.


i recently dropped neurontin from my schedule as i was having horrible adverse reactions to it after having used the drug on and off for a few years prior.  i would start trembling, overheating, feel nausea and almost feel stiff at some points with doses as low as 600mg,not to forget the headaches.  they were the main symptoms i experienced, though, a few others from the list you provided.


i used to praise this drug for neurological pain but not so much now.

Taking this drug at doses higher than 600mg/day for more than a few days makes me feel disgustingly cloudy and stupid. People should do more research on side effects before shoving *grams* of this drug down their throat on a daily basis.

**Neurontin!**


Hey guys!

I just got prescribed 900mg of neurontin a day, and I find that at 1800mg my anxiety almost completely vanishes.

Also, when I take 1800mg at once I feel a speedy, sensual rush followed by a mellow, less-tired benzoish high.


After years of chronic anxiety, I feel as if I can finally think clearly.

I recommend this drug to anyone who may have anxiety or mild pain... perhaps not as much as a recreational drug.

Also, since I have never been prescribed any "scheduled" or addictive drugs (such as benzos, amphetamines, opiates, ect) it is a relief to find a pill that can finally help with my anxiety, addiction, and depression that is not very dangerous.

Neurontin is almost enough to maker me swear of benzos completely! (I think I might!)


Anyone else have experiences with this wonderful drug?

I take 600mg of neurontin for anxiety/drug craving relief 1200-2100mg of neurontin for a very interesting, social buzz. I normally take it after a meal or snack, and drink a bottle of carbonated water along with it. Within about two hours, I am normally beginning to feel the effects. Have fun and be safe!

Wait until you go through a week on that high of a dosage, and see if you're still "thinking clearly." Neurontin can cause some serious cognitive impairment at high doses, worse than benzos relative to its anxiolytic potential.


I would recommend using this drug at doses of 600-1200mg at most every other day, or 600mg if you absolutely must take it daily. Short term tolerance builds very quickly with this drug, so it's best to use it no more than 2-3 times a week at a max dosage of 1200-1500mg if you want the full potential.


And, yes, as stated above, use the search engine and welcome to the Bluelight! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

300mg Gabapentin with 200mg L-Theanine down the hatch, for some neuropathic pain relief. I find these two drugs, along with pregabalin, to be amazingly effective for neuropathic pain. 


I gave a single 100mg capsule of L-Theanine to a family member when she ran out of her 300mg bid gabapentin script (forgot to refill, doesn't buse), and she felt appreciable pain relief from her sciatica; nowhere near the relief of 300mg gabapentin, but the pain relief was still noticeable.

not sure if this is allowed but i was given 4 gabapentin, just unsure of the doses. they are light yellow gel caps with no dosage written on them. i'm in the uk. i was told to just take 2. i did and i noticed a sort of manic effect, a little slurred speech, slightly unsteady on my feet and felt very chatty with elevated mood, getting to sleep was no issue either even though i suffer from insonmia. not exactly a recreational feeling but certainly didnt feel bad. thinking about redosing tonight but i would like to know the dose i am taking. 

anybody any clue? i tried google.

It's really bad practice to take madications with out knowing the dose. 


Gabapentin has yellow pills but they also have numbers in them.

Those would be 300mg each.  Anything above 300mg is a tablet rather than a capsule.

^^ they could also be 400mg capsules, since I've taken both dosages before. 


Gabapentin has recreational use for me, but only if I space out dosing by a week or two. I take what would seem to be obscene amounts to others (8000mg+), but like others have said, tolerance builds & its near impossible to overdose on.


I feel a lightness in my head with some drowsiness, & physically I get really uncoordinated, but i like  that.. lol. To each their own.

I have a very liberal doctor... he prescribes for me 800mg Gaba 4x daily and I have to use mail order prescription and get a 90 day supply each time. Doing the math.... 4 x 30 x 3 = 360 tablets. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I just got my refill the other day and the pills are huge so they came in 4 large bottles filled to the brim! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Too bad they don't do much for me except I feel a slightly better buzz when taken with my alprazolam.

^ Wow, 3200mg of Gabapentin a day *has* to have horrible cognitive side effects. They don't call it *moron*tin for nothing! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also, Gabapentin and Pregabalin greatly potentiates benzos at the cost of "dirtying" up the high and making the making the cognitive side effects of benzos even worse. Be careful with combining the two, as there is much greater potentiation with megadoses of gabapentin/pregabalin mixed with benzos rather than alcohol mixed with benzos. 


Alcohol and benzos are both positive allosoteric modulators of GABA, while gabapentin/pregs actually *increase* the levels of GABA in the brain. Gabapentin is to benzos as gasoline is to fire; you might know the limits of starting a controlled fire, but once you throw some gas on it (gabapentin), things could get messy really quickly.

**When I first used neurontin a friend had give me some 300 mg capsules. im limited to the variety of drugs i can take because im currently lockdowned on weekly no tolerance drug tests (usually 3-4 times a week) Being the drug addict i am i was quick to take them. At first it was a very enjoyable high, but it didnt last long.. around 4 hours and afterwards i became very sleepy.MAYBE


As of today i am prescribed 800 mg gabapentin and find that my tolerance to the drug is very high. recreationally i MAYBE can get high once a week on them. that is if im lucky. **

That makes sense. Anytime I would take Gabapentin I would wake up not knowing what the fuck happened. This is under the 1400mg mark too. I think 900mgs did this several times. Its hard to really count. I never liked it so I stopped. I guess the relevance is I also was taking and do take alprazolam everyday so it def fucked me up in a messy weird way.

gabapentin worked great for me at the start as well..made me much moree social, empathetic, energized, just a better mood...i would cycle it, use it for 2-3 days then stop to avoid tolerance as it seemed after 2 days it would poop out...after a few months of this i now no longer get real good effects from gabapentin..now, i can only take it for a day for its positive effects and anything beyond that i just become numb and just dulled out..

Taking 300mg every one hour, since the morning to the night, reaching the 2g, makes me incredibly high the first or two times I do it. Tolerance grows in two or three days for me.

It makes my vision super blurry and I feel floaty like I was on GBL... also, taking it with Codeine and benzos, it's incredible relaxing and at the same time euphoric, one of the best combos I ever done I think. Too bad have to wait like 2 or even 3 weeks for the tolerance to go down again.

It makes me love everything around me and everything seems interesting.

I find that 6-300mg capsules get me extremely high, like a coke high without the comedown, talkative, happy, on task with household chores ect. Lasts for hours and hours, down side extremely dry mouth but the come down is nice and mellow euphoric until I'm ready for bed. 

Also to potenate I use orange juice or citrus juice empty capsules into about a shot of juice and slam it down. It tastes awful really awful so do it quick. I can do this about twice a week if I try more tolerance is to high and I just end up sleepy. This was a major help for opiate withdrawal I had a few years back. Also greatly helps with my fibro.

Excuse me Ergicmergic, it is not so that pregabalin/gabapentin ups GABA levels in the brain its more the opposite so when you read about these two drugs then you will see that pregabalin lowers the amount of neurotransmitters called Substance P, Glutamate, nor adrenaline and GABA is also lower. I bet that there are more neurotransmitters involved with pregabalin administration, because recreationally why can a dose of lyrica make us feel good so maybe dopamine is also involved.

I'm about to start taking pregabalin instead of gabapentin again, for severe neuropathy. I just recently started taking clonazepam again, 2mg twice a day, so 2mg twice, about 8-10 hours apart.

   I guess my question is, does anyone here have any experience mixing the two, and how much is the pregabalin going to potentiate the clonazepam? I will be taking 150mg pregabalin 3x/day. So, how strong will the clonazepam be at this dose? Is there a way to find out? Will the 4mg end up feeling like 5, or maybe 6mg?

   I'm sure you all see where I'm coming from. I also take 400mg tramadol/day, and will be starting on another pain medication soon, a stronger one. I am currently tapering off methadone because I just had major surgery, but they still don't have a problem with me being on pain meds, because tramadol does NOT cut it. And methadone is a terrible, worthless painkiller.

   But anyhow, my main question is: How strong will the clonazepam end up feeling, dosage-wise?

I took this medicine 3x300mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks. Since I discontinued it I've suffered horrible symptoms, vision problems, muscle cramps, neuropathy (the pain is the worst I have ever felt, it feels like fire inside me), hypersensitivty, anxiety, insomnia etc etc. I've been bed-ridden for half a year and there is simply no sign of these symptoms ever disappearing. Can anyone who has gotten off this horrible poison tell me if it will ever end? Because if this is how it's gonna be from now on, I don't see any point in living anymore.

Toz, although gabapentin is a great drug for many purposes, it causes dependence. I have done every drug under the sun, and been addicted to all kinds of drugs (I used to be a junkie). I have said for a long time, that gabapentin has fucking HORRIBLE withdrawal symptoms that just never seem to end, until I get more of the drug. I have been on either gabapentin or pregabalin (Lyrica) or sometimes both since 2004, and I don't see myself ever getting off them. The withdrawl is like benzodiazepine & opiate withdrawal together. And the higher the dose you're prescribed, the worse it is. I was prescribed OVER the maximum amount that doctors are supposed to prescribe for a long time - 800mg 4x/day (3200mg). It worked for my neuropathy, helped with anxiety, and even helped with depression and bi-polar symptoms. But I have tried to quit several times, and after several days, I was back at the pharmacy in horrible withdrawal anxiously awaiting my refill. It's fucked up.

   So are you saying you were taking 300mg 3 times a day, or 900mg 3 times a day? The way you wrote out your dose is confusing. Either way, you are getting severe symptoms, and you need to go to a doctor and tell him or her what happened. You may need the stuff from this day forward. Or maybe even bring up pregabalin (Lyrica), which is basically gabapentin's big brother, and it works much better. All the best to you, and I hope you get to feeling better. I've been there, man. It sucks.

I took 900mg 4 times daily. I do not want to start taking it again, I've been without it for half a fucking year I mean how much longer could this crap possibly go on? On the worst days I do opiates like morphine/heroin etc but not even that takes away the pain of withdrawal completely (still!). I got it for subutex and benzo withdrawal, wanted to quit both, wanted something non (or at least less) addicting to help with withdrawal. Well I got off both, instead I got addicted to this horrible shit that was supposed to be "less addicting" than benzos/opiates. I used them for 4 fucking weeks. FOUR WEEKS, any other drug taken for such a short time would not give more than a week of misery, at most. I stopped taking them as soon as I felt uncomfortable without them. And still I'm suffering now half a year later...


I traded 2 bad addictions for one from hell.

^^something isnt adding up here...TOZ, you mean to say you took gabapentin at 900 mgs a day for 4 weeks or you took more than that(3600 mgs/day) for the 4 weeks?you then said you have been off of it for a half a year and still have withdrawal symptoms??i find that very hard to believe, im not calling you a liar i just think you typed your post out wrong...ive never had withdrawals from gabapentin but then again i take much smaller doses..

^ I agree,  in my opinion it isn't possible to suffer from withdrawl symptoms 6 months after the last dose. Gabapentin has a relatively short half-life. Did you take into consideration that maybe your neuropathy just came back and the symptoms are more intense? This plus the PAWS after being dependent on Benzos and Opiates? Just guessing here because I cannot imagine that the Neurontin is the culprit after half a year of abstinence.


While 4 weeks really is not long, the dose Toz was prescribed is a very large one so the rebound from that (if someone is prone to Gabapentin WDs), could be pretty bad but not that long.

I have taken both benzos and opiates, same doses as I used to (and higher), that offered me very little relief. None of them are the problem. These symptoms appeared after discontinuing the neurontin, not the benzos and opiates. I very much know how these withdrawal feels like.


I got no sleep tonight, pain is so bad, if I don't fall asleep within 10minutes the skin on the side I'm laying down on will burn so badly sleep will be impossible.


I googled neurontin withdrawal and found people had the same symptoms as me, some for about as long and some for even longer. But most of them had been on neurontin for years.

Believe me, people, gabapentin withdrawal can be as bad as it gets. But I've been on it 8 years...not 4 weeks. So, I tend to think there is some sort of issue with neuropathy, possibly fibromyalgia, MS, or a nerve disease of sorts. I'm having to have lots of tests done because after almost 6 years of being diagnosed with "fibromyalgia", they now think that i have a hereditary nerve disease, because of my severe symptoms.

One thing that I've learned from Gabapentin is that like buprenorphine, in the long run, you're going to be more satisfied with low dosages than high ones.


Wen I was prescribed it initially, I took 300mg in the morning, and 300mg in the evening. I did that for a week, and got a continuous anxiolytic effect with some definate mood-boosting flavor.


However, being the drug pig I was, I decided to start taking higher dosages. While it did get me more fucked up for a few days, I ended up ruining a medication that had been helping me so much. The thing is, it takes no time for tolerance to Gabapentin to develop, but it  takes *forever* for it to go back down. Luckily, I ended up giving up on taking it all together, as doses exceeding 3g's didn't provide more than any dose below that amount. I quit for about two months, and eventually my tolerance went back to baseline, though I unfortunately seemed to have lost all taste for the stuff by then.


For those of you taking such megadoses, remember, the more you take past 1.5 grams, the less is absorbed.

Let's be honest.... I have 5 300mg pills, so 1500mg in total of gabapentin. If i take this dose, am I really going to feel much of anything ? I've only ever taken it once sometime last week at and took 300mg first, then another two 300mg doses staggered a couple hours later. I was coming down from 4-FA though so wasn't expecting to feel much, just maybe lighten the comedown.


But being completely sober, should I expect anything ?

I have a prescription for Gabapentin, and some days I'll take 4200MG's with melatonin. I then wait 30 minuets, and when I can really feel it's effects I smoke a cigarette and it literally makes the relaxation effect of Gabapentin 10X stronger. When I do this, I smoke the whole cigarette, climb into bed and I'm literally asleep before my head hits the pillow.

Hmm well I'll have to try taking it then, I see no harm from trying. I don't smoke cigarettes but seeing as I have zero tolerance my dose should be adequate.

A week or so... look at the bioavailability of gabapentin with increased doses. It increases rapidly (daily) but also decreases rapidly for me. Even a day's break helps, but a two week break is like restarting from scratch almost. (You will NEVER get the original high again as many an addict knows as long as your brain has a memory of how good that high was---high expectations. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I never got ANY high at all. I seriously don't know what everyone in this thread is talking about. I have a hard time believing there is any high, just based on the pharmacology of the drug, and also of course from my one time dose of 1500mg. 


I won't ever take it again. If anything it gave me a bit of anxiety and I felt twitchy. Not at all pleasant or any "high".


Reading about the withdrawal from this drug makes me wonder why in the fucking world someone would be taking this regularly. I understand it's prescribed, but I mean for any sort of high.

It just depends on the person. I think it's fantastic. It lowers anxiety, the analgesia makes it seem like you're walking on a cloud, it causes cool visual effects, I feel a unique form of tactile pleasure, it increases sociability, muscle relaxation, pleasant sedation, and just makes me feel extremely relaxed in general. I take it as prescribed but the initial high was great.

I'm prescribed 900 mg's 3 times a day (300 mg yellow pills). I usually only take six of 'em though, the doctor just prescribed a high dose so I wouldn't have to worry about refills. I use it for my anxiety and drug cravings and it is excellent. I recently stopped drinking and abusing drugs and have around 50-60 days clean, and this just helps me feel a bit loopy to where I am not on edge every day.


I wanted to say, the bioavailability really doesn't change even if I stagger 300 mgs every 45 minutes or not. If I eat 6 at a time it's just as effective. I think 900 staggered could work better. 


Tolerance to the "high" obviously goes down but it doesn't lose much effectiveness day in and day out. I know, I used to abuse the shit out of this medicine. The big APO GAB 600 mg's. I remember the first time I did some I could hardly walk. Make no mistake, this drug can and will fuck you up if you take enough. Feels really dreamy, almost psychedelic. You feel floaty, and get a sort of weird salivating mouth. I would say it's like alcohol or benzos but it's not. Maybe closer to a barbiturate. It's a wonderful drug, I'd really like to read a study about the long term negative effects. It can make you a bit stupid and you can lose motor coordination pretty easy. But no drug is good for you, truth be told. If anybody has any more information about dose staggering I'd love to hear.

I have a brand new script for gabapentin. I went to the doctor today for RLS and told him the klonopins are not fazing me in the slightest anymore. I've been on k-pins for years and I'm immune to them... maybe permanently.


I have 100 mg capsules. He told me to take two every evening. I only took one. I want to start as low as possible so that I can use them to relieve this ridiculous syndrome I have as long as possible.


My reaction to the first time taking it is that it took so long to come on, I thought I would feel nothing. I waited a couple hours, then I forgot about it, went and watched tv and smoked a bowl.


The cannabis I have right now isn't one of the uber strong strains. I can smoke it on and off during the evening before bed, and it helps me get into a sleep zone.


I feel as if either the cannabis boosted the gabapentin or the gaba boosted the bud,


I am more relaxed that I usually get on the mid shelf strains. I feel quite stoned actually, more like I've had 2 or 3 hits of wax than personal size bowl of mid shelf.


So something is doing something. I don't know what. But my phuckin legs are not spastic tonight. And that is me winning. For tonight anyway.

just wanted to drop in and say...  FUCK YOU GABAPENTIN!!!  ahh, I am finally off that crap.  after 4 years titrated to 100mg every other day.  had a relatively mild withdrawl with some excess anxiety, pretty painful legs/RLS for a week but I seemed to sleep a lot.  tried really hard to keep a dark room and take a mg of melatonin and just enjoy my dreams.  now all I have to do is get rid of the 11 year benzo habit.  haha, working on it.  oh came off gabapentin while in the middle of a Xanax taper too.  blah.


and to the dude above me, yea weed really sets gaba off.  I, too have really bad RLS and that's why I started it.  that and gabapentin/lyrica just "seem" healthy.  they make you hungry, tired and happy..  a lot like weed.  just like most drugs though there will be a WD.  make sure to get plenty of shit done while you are on your meds.  that's the point.  you can't stay on these things for life.  well, very, very few people would consider it.

To throw in my $0.02... definitely worthwhile. & i am a former hard drug user (heroin & fentanyl- IV user. 5 yrs clean).


BUT- i am *also* on buprenorphine (subutex formula) & high doses of butalbital (a barbiturate) for back pain.


It DEFINITELY mediates the tolerance and/or feeling of "needing" both buprenorphine & butalbital. But even in 3-4 days of use I am seeing a tolerant effect.


Also, its inconvenient, in that, I must wait till i'm in my controlled environment without any obligations- otherwise i'd appear drunk or at least intoxicated (any slightest hint of me acting/being "different" & my family cries foul & thinks i absolutely MUST be fucking using. Gets pretty annoying after 5 fucking YEARS)... or at the very least, i'd appear without the fullest of my facilities in a work situation.


This is an odd chemical; some of its effects really remind me of baclofen- a GABA-B positive modulator! The psychological state just seems similar; albeit less disorientating, less nauseating, & overall better tolerated. However, unlike baclofen- it does have some hint of adrenergic stimulant effects; particularly w/ sex drive & the mode by which it causes disinhibition- it seems to *not* feel as if it comes from GABAergic action (like ethanol or benzodiazepines); its more stimulatory in its disinhibition. Mind you, its no where near IV'd cocaine. Its important to note also: baclofen HUUGELY reduced my buprenorphine intake inexplicably? Gabapentin has seemed to do this, but, not nearly as rapidly (w/ baclofen- this was around a 50% drop, from 8mg to 4mg in ~2 weeks time w/ absolutely zero discomfort! & i'm a HUUGE pussy when it comes to withdrawal symptoms, too).


**All in all, its a drug that fills certain niches; and for me? A recovering addict on Subutex & butalbital? It works! & i don't "need" my other medications nearly as much.**

I can a get good high on GABAPentin with no tolerance on 3600mg spread out in 3 1 hour 1200mg doses. Gives a weird body high like and if it gets any stronger it will be unpleasant like an borderline unpleasant body high and I forget what else soooo AMNESIA yeah.

No, you cannot inject it. IDK why you would anyway. Its necessary for Gabapentin to go through the first pass metabolism stage (I think that's what I read). Sticking it up your bum won't do much good anyway, because of the first pass business.

Its great to see that so many people have wonderful effects from it. I know that as long as I don't use it too frequently, my effects are fantastic. I get a substantial mood lift, massive increase in confidence and sociability, sex drive is fucking *outrageous* with insane erections, sexual performance is increased, but to a natural level (In other words, you can orgasm when you want), energy is off the hook, and music appreciation is increased. A dose lasts about 5 hours or so, and usually takes 1.5-3 hours to start to feel the effects. A common sign of it kicking in is you start getting sleepy. But if you don't fall asleep and keep yourself occupied, it is totally worth it. 


Also, in case my drug use, or lack thereof, comes into question, I will say that I have used *plenty* of drugs, and have been taking in some sort of substance since I was 17; I am now 28. While it hasn't been terribly consistent, I still consider myself a user. I used to be a heavy user, and am now extremely light. I've waterlined heroin, snorted/smoked cocaine, mushrooms, lsd, mdma, gaba, methadone, various opiates/opiods, 4-aco-dmt, pod tea, and others. And of course a myriad of combos. So, having gaba work doesn't always depend on whether a person has used or not. Its the same for Tramadol. Most opiate users can't get off on that stuff. But when I was taking it, I nodded INSANE amounts and for hours. The whole experience lasted 12 hours, if not longer. And I could NOT get off on pod tea, or an inexpensive dose of opiates. BTW, I took over 30 p. somniferum pods last summer. Know what happened? I got the worst case of itchies in the entire history of the human race, for about 6 or so hours. No high, nothing. That should say something. 


Anyway. Gabapentin to date is one of the most simple, yet enjoyable substances. Oh, and getting a solid dose of gaba, smoking bowls, and taking half a melatonin or a muscle relaxer will hammer you. You'll be stoned, have a nice body buzz, but still have energy enough to do stuff. Combos are great.

I completely agree with you...depends on the person. I have to take at least 3200 mg, but i feel all those things you mentioned. A nice sleepy feeling and calmness. Im more socialable and just feel good. Its not like an opiate, but its relaxing.

To echo previously stated comments: thank you for posting a thread on gabapentin!


I am on it.. 600mg 4x day (2400mg/day). At first, it was a wonder drug for me; & enjoyable as well. But more importantly- it allowed me to severely drop my daily butalbital intake (a barbiturate), helped w/ anxiety (in an odd.. benzo-ish sort of way), & it created decreased inhibitions, in an odd; stimulatory-sort-of-way (it actually exasperated my sleep issues/insomnia). I had a horny-type feeling reminiscent of cocaine or amphetamine/methamphetamine. It also was a novel and *SUCCESSFUL* antidepressant/mood-stabilizer! As i've tried/have been Rx'd all antidepressants--of all flavors, from tetracyclics to SNRIs; but excluding MAO inhibitors.


*HOWEVER*- after about a week in? These positive effects slowly faded ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) They still do, however, potentiate my buprenorphine dose (i take/Rx'd 4mg per day) ONLY if i take it prior to insufflated buprenorphine (it's the Subutex, pill formula).. that's about it, though. No noticeable impact on my butalbital intake (as high as 2000mg/day); antidepressant & mood-stabilizing effects have faded. I planned a quick taper, but, even a moderate reduction (i had ran out for ~4 days) creates extreme anxiety, not entirely unlike moderate withdrawal of butalbital or other barbiturates/GABAergics. So, i'd like to take it slow.. hopefully be able to only use it for situational purposes.


& whoever said (paraphrase) "it causes a high similar to how an antihistamine causes drowsiness" is obviously quite misguided on this medication.

benzodiazipines potentiate gabbapentin. this is fact. if u want the gaba potentiated, take the benzos first. if you want the benzos potentiated, take the gaba first but wait 2 hours for your stomach to absorb it or else it will decreas bio availability of the benzo. ever see on a bottle of gabapentin "dont take antacids within 2 hours of taking this medication"?

Gabapentin is actually a wondeful party drug in my books. To increase effects drink acidic drinks and stagger doses at least an hour apart.

The best way to take it (for me) is 300mg washed down with a double espresso. Then wait half hour, add another 600mg. Wait half hour and then another 300 with a diet coke, or an energy drink. Then smoke a cig. I only ever take 1200mg at a time, and that relaxes me enough to be chilled out and yet productive. 


Any way of lessening tolerance? Other than waiting three days?

There really is no drug you can take where time isn't the only remedy for tolerance. Every 3 days is enough anyway. Unfortunately you can't expect to be high every day as nice as that would be. Why not try phenibut? in between gaba doses The effects are somewhat similar and surprisingly, I haven't noticed any cross tolerance.

Thank you for the suggestion. I haven't heard of phenibut, but I gather I'm in the right place to find out what it is!

My routine:

eat 300mg every 10 minutes and wash it down with some soda (carbonated) also take 2 aleve or similar pills... I do this until I finally consume around 4800mg .... do this and tell me it isn't worth a damn !!

Hi, I'm just curious if anyone can provide me with some concrete guidance? IF one were to use neurontin recreationally, how would one go about it? How much would you take, and how far apart would you space the doses? Would you use soda OR energy drinks? Or both? Would you eat before you dosed or after? Or during? What about Aleve, or any other additives to enhance the experience? And after your "trip" how many days would you wait to do it again? All this is purely hypothetical of course...just as a discussion between intellectuals...![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

You need to give it at LEAST two days to get the nice, fuzzy feelings...because the tolerance to this builds FAST. Using some diet coke, or Red Bull helps a lot, as does staggering the doses. Eating doesn't affect anything for me, but I have heard that absorption is increased by s light protein snack, so get a slimjim or something in you before you take them.

Can anybody explain why soda and aleve (or any other anti-inflammatory) would potentiate the effects of gabapentin?  I have been trying it along with staggering my dose for the first time (before I always took 9.6 gram doses six hours apart) and I have noticed a much more desirable effect.  After doing much reading on this thread I understand how staggering lower doses is infinitely more effective, but I still don't understand the soda and aleve components.  Would something like grapefruit juice also be effective?  Any help understanding this would be appreciated.

Last I heard the mechanism of action of gabapentin was unknown.  Obviously for pain relief a NSAID would help it.  It is taken up quickly (affecting absorption wouldn't be a big factor) and it is excreted renally so grapefruit juice inhibiting hepatic metoblism via CYP-3A4 wouldn't make a difference.

i found pregabalin to be a brilliant pain killer when i had a trapped nerve in my neck/shoulder area. Also it potentiates the hypnotic effect of benzos massively. Im currently coming off bupe, and find that it helps a lot with the general feeling of shittyness that entails. Ive taken it 2 days in a row now, and ive never exceeded that before as i dont want a 3rd dependency.


In the past ive taken 5 or 6 75 mg pregabalin pills and found the experience to feel like a mild but scary bad trip. One taken on its own with no other problems or drugs just boosts mood IME.

I think this is quite different from individual to individual.  I have taken doses substantially larger than 1200 mg and had no trouble staying awake.  In fact, I find a healthy dose of gabapentin to be quite energizing.  I can sleep if I want to, but I rarely want to as things seem infinitely more interesting.  I do find that I sleep quite well when the dose wears off a bit.  My wife, on the other hand, can take 300 mg and will be unable to function much less stay awake.  Needless to say, she is not a fan.

Gabapentin is excellent for opiate withdrawal, and very soothing with cannabis. I take it as prescribed for chronic pain. The first time I took it (1200mg), along with my medical cannabis, I had strong waves of euphoria for about 2 hours, followed by a very satisfying sleep. Used alone it rid me of any anxiety and offered a mood lift. To echo others, tolerance builds very quickly, so the waves of euphoria turned into decent pain relief soon after my initial experience. 


If you are expecting a narcotic painkiller feel from neurontin, you are going to be disappointed. In my opinion the feeling is utterly different and completely inferior to narcotic painkillers (I used/was prescribed narcotic pain pills for 10 years). The feeling is closer to Ultracet or Ultram, IME. 


I haven't tried Lyrica yet, but I'm looking forward to it as I've heard so many good things about it.

Welcome to Bluelight.

Please don't use Swim. It is against the forum rules and does not help in any way.

Why would you want to take so much DPH to begin with? The deliriant effects at higher doses are very unpleasant and can be dangerous as it lowers the seizure threshold. Or do you have a tolerance to DPH and want to use it for sleep?


Don't know about the combo though but I would avoid the Diphenhydramine. Gabapentin helps great with sleep too.

My patent pending routine


0hr - 1 aleve / .25 protein bar /  400mg GABA / Mountain Dew 

.20hr - .25 protein bar. / 400mg GABA / soda

.40hr - 400mg GABA / soda 

1hr - .5 aleve / .25 protein bar / 400 mg GABA / soda


I repeat this every hour until I reach around 5,600mg of GABA ... I have experience ! IMO it's like being on 20mg amphetamine salt and 15mg oc without any tolerance***

Thanks. I took one so far with a Pepsi, about 1 to 2 hours ago. If I remember right these are 300mg. Broke in half and then broke into pieces with my teeth before swallowing. They taste bad but I didn't want to go thru the trouble of making a parachute due to lethargy, apathy, and general laziness. 


The effect is not too shabby - don't quite want to get up and get shit done but don't feel horrible either.. w/d symptoms much improved in general and mood lifted. My stomach still feels fked up but there's lomotil for that. About to take another gabapentin. Too bad I don't have naproxen on hand to give that a shot as well. Will def have to acquire more of these.

Careful not to use GBP too much - it has a nasty addiction that comes along with it. I've seen many people cross over to GBP from benzos and have an even harder time getting off of the GBP.


It does work in a pinch though for a few days.

Took the other pill and my w/ds were quite tolerable today. Still feeling a bit of energy and was able to deal with the kids, no prob. Kids can send you spinning in to orbit with a quickness when going through w/ds! This is not acceptable - I have to function. Thinking of getting a few of these to keep around for, like you said, in a pinch. Not effective enough to create a desire for daily use, and I personally detest benzos, but this was def a pleasant surprise. 


Very glad to have this site. Thanks.

QTF. Just today I was talking to a friend about how gabapentin is fucking horrible. I have stopped meth, coke, heroin, OC, fentanyl, xanax, klonopin, etc. and although it was very difficult sometimes, gabapentin is a drug I have decided I will no longer try to quit after over 9 yrs on it. I can't quit, and the w/d never stops. I have still felt bad after a month being off of subs, tramadol, or klonopin - but it's okay by that point. After a month, gabapentin still doesn't let up at all.

It seems to me that many of you have never even tried this drug. I guess that's a lot of people do though they just see what others are posting and agree with what they're saying without having any experience whatsoever.as an ex iv heroin addict I can tell you that this truck definitely has some recreational value.no it is not oxycodone or alprazolam but believe me take 3 grams and you're gonna feel good. It's kinda speedy a first vary social enhancing. aa good amount of euphoria. As it starts to taper off you get a more sedated relaxed feeling that last for a long time. Those of you that are comparing it to OTC antihistamines are completely retarded sorry but it's true.it's a great drug to do a couple times a month as tolerence buiilds fast. I thoroughly enjoy this neat little drug.it is actually quite safe too there's very little negative side effects and the LD50 is around 50 gram so you don't have to worry about ODing.like I said it's not an opiate or a benzo but it's a great pick me up.anything below 2.5 grams is worthless you're not going to feel the real effects. It's cousin pregabalin is gabapentin on crack. I know I'll get flame for this post and also I know there's going I do actually believe this drug affects different people in different ways. It is entirely possible that some people do not experiencethe positive aspects of the drug while others do such as myself. Just my $0.02 guys.

^^^yep, i agree, ive IVed heroin combined with other drugs and gabapentin is quite potent if used in an occasional basis..i hadnt take any in a year or so, last night took a measly 400 mgs and it gave me a nice mellow buzz but i had that somewhat manic type of energy that only ghb seems to give..the only drugs that have given a pronounced anti-anxiety effect while at same time giving you energy are gabapentin, ghb, and to lesser extent phenibut...ime gabapentins positive effects are only noticeable for 3-4 days then nasty brain fog kicks in and makes it worthless..

I've heard of dealers being charged with criminally negligent homicide for ODs but I don't even know if that's possible with gabapentin (I've taken 3.6 g in a day with little to no effect).

I sell gabapentin so not quite right that there is no street value. However there was a case in the uk where a guy sold his dad's fentanyl patches to a friend...and the friend ended up dead from OD. The guy who sold it went to prison.

WHY would anyone take neurontin as a "rec drug"?  i was prescribed this for years...about 4 or 5 years...i would...sometimes, empty the capsule & snort the powder & get a quick rush feeling, or so i thought...but i really was snorting it just because i had nothing else to put up my nose...my shrink gave this med to me for panic attacks, a long with klonipin & xanax...i was hit by a car & the mere sight of a car made me wig the fuck out...anyhow, i quit taking it cold turkey...about 10 years ago & for a few days after the fact, i did have mild seizures---WHICH SUCKED!  now, i am on rx opiate pain  meds for my fucked up back & the other day the dr. asked me if i had ever taken neurontin..LOL...i was like...'you have to be kidding me...& no, i'm not taking that shit ever again!!'

neurontin was a waste of space & money...IMO

Gabapentin should be taken off the market. The doctor who put me on it when I was detoxing methadone said it was safe and that it worked in GABA ....fucking moron. My current psychiatrist doesn't believe me when I tell him it gives me withdrawals between dosing or that you withdrawal from it period. It's understood that it works in the voltage gated calcium channels containing the α2δ subunit ..... but the lack of understanding exactly how this drug works and the various mechanisms of actions its responsible for resulting in it being prescribed for everything between epilepsy and drug withdrawal is fucking astounding. It's a shit anti-convulsant....its a weak anti-epileptic  ..... it eases nerve pain for fibromyalgia ....yet it lowers the seizure threshold with remeron .... something my doctor decided to add to my regiment wanting to KEEP ME ON gabapentin..... he admitted he recently just discovered that it has recreational value....NO SHIT .....  yet he is hesitant to prescribe me a benzo.  Gabapentin withdrawal is in its own right in-fucking-humane. Mind you I kicked being on methadone for 6 years basically cold turkey with a rapid taper. And this shit is up there with the worst. It's a different type of w/d....with symptoms comparable to opiate/benzo/alcohol all wrapped up in one lovely living hell.


[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1176314/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1176314/)


GABA B receptor activity.... yet the GABA-B receptor is not completely understood in its ENTIRITY. So its just written off as not having anything to do with it..... this shit is fucking poison. Might as well go sniff a bag of dope....at least heroin/codeine/morphine/alkaloids mechanisms of action are understood and treatable....

Just found this thread after having been clean off of Lyrica for 6 months. Just wanted to share my experience with those who are just now discovering Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Gabapentin (Neurontin). The former is a much more potent form, perhaps 6x with fewer side effects due to decreased dosage, coupled with a longer half life.


First, I am am a member of the really really enjoy it group. For both I found the body high pleasant, desensitizing, and slightly uncoordinated. Mentally, thinking is slowed, sociability is increased, overall it's quite relaxing.


I started in with Neurontin and progressed to Lyrica back in '05, after discovering it's euphoric effects and then importing a KG of the latter from China. That began a love/hate affair that lasted through July of this year.


Gentlemen, if you fall into my camp and find the effects desirable, PLEASE mind your intake, taking it no more than twice a week or less if to be on the safe side. Lyrica withdrawal is hell, one of the worst I've ever experienced. Prior to this addiction, I ditched both Klonopin and Oxy habits, both per the most common recommendations found on these forums. Yea they sucked, but were ABSOLUTELY doable without the help of others. For Lyrica, rehab was a necessity.


Let me emphasize, that at one of the most famous rehab centers in North America, they had no idea how to deal with Lyrica withdrawal. I received Librium for 1 WEEK, which dear god is just amount the time it takes for one to start fully understanding all that the sudden absence of Lyrica entails. Body and mind are simply short circuited, to the point where one can feel like everything is utterly fucked, shattered, broken. I was depressed, anxious, insomniatic, paranoid, and angry, all of these to the EXTREME. My attending physicians all thought I had several serious mental disorders, and I was actually ejected from the residential program early because they could not handle me. The night I that broke down in tears, I was escorted by security to the Psyche ER. I acted out by throwing some magazines and letting my Psychiatrist know they had no idea how to treat this withdrawal. The next day I was home.


It took about 4 months for me to normalize. During that time my mood and behaviors were erratic. I know taking Neurontin during this time would have eased the pain, but from past experience it would also protract the hellish PAWS. To summarize, understand that you will hurt like all get out. Easily on the same level as benzo/opiate withdrawal, but more of a conflation of the nastiest symptoms. The kicker of course is the duration. A week without Oxy and things subside. A month tapering off benzos and there is noticeable improvement. 3-4 months is what to expect after rocking a serious Lyrica habit, perhaps a month or two with Neurontin due to its shorter half life.


I knew most of this back in 2005, and doctors still do not have a clue. You are the patient, you are the user, so take responsibility and understand the risk associated with abuse of these medications.

Holy crap. I guess this could be said for a lot of things if abused, taking 4-5x or probably even more. 


yeah, I'm 8 days out from a sub taper and the first thing the DR suggested was neurontin. He only gave my one script for it. But he gave it to me. 


I'm taking it. I have about 3 weeks worth. I'm sure I will be fine.

I would be more than happy to elaborate.  However, the story is quite long so I will have to give you the Cliff Notes version.  I have flagged the email that notified me of this thread being posted in to remind me to look at it tomorrow  as it is 3AM and I should get some rest.

Thanks! I'm really quite interested to hear your story especially sine it involves actual damage, though i'm sorry you had to go through it at all. Far to many people post about disliking these two chemicals but rarely explain why. Think I should probably head to sleep as well as its really late, damn insomnia!

Neurontin (gabapentin) and Lyrica (pregabalin) both have a tremendous recreational use history.  In fact, the original generic gabapentin was being used so illicitly that they had to modify it and reintroduce it to the market as brand name Lyrica and make it a controlled substance.

I will keep it simple for you guys.. I take 6000 mg at one time on a empty stomach, i wait one hour and drink one 16oz green can monster and at the 1 and a half our mark i start to feel racy and then i get up and go clean my house, play my guitar and do so much things. Some might say that is to much to take but for me i tend to be in to much pain to do things or just feel like crap to do things but this stuff gets me up and i like to talk and i have a good time. Effects last 8 hours maybe a tad longer , i have gone threw WD from this stuff and it is bad, i got bad knee pain i would have to lay in the bathtub to just ease the pain, i could not sleep for days . I only get 120 300mg so i can not take such a high amount and have it last so long . I took my normal amount over a few day period and i got so sick. So now i just brake it up kinda like my fri night hang out .

I'd be super careful about telling people to take that much. You just might unknowingly hurt someone. 

So I had to say.DO NOT DO WHAT THE ABOVE POSTER SAID EVER. Not even half of that. Holy crap.

I was not saying to take what i do no way in hell, it is so freaking nuts i even have said it has to stop. I have cut back i would of gone at it hard this week but i did not. I wrote that saying you have to watch out for sure and like anything if you set to abuse it at first you will take more then you should and one day you will be at a mg dosage that is not safe. Please no one take as much as i do or did.

Recreational Guide (every 20 minutes) 


00:00 - take 2 aleve (naproxen) / 300mg gaba / eat some protein (fish or beans) / drink carbonated soda 

00:20 - take 300mg gaba / drink carbonated soda

00:40 - take 300mg gaba / drink corbonated soda / eat chili peppers

01:00 - take 300mg gaba / drink corbonated soda


repeat this until your desired dose.. for beginners shoot for 2,000 mg ... I on the other hand take about 5,000mg ***(YOU CAN NOT OD ON GABA) ***


this has given me the best results to date %)

This stuff is all fun and games, until you have to stop taking it. I was prescribed it for nuropathy, so I used it as directed everyday at first. Then I decided that getting high was more important that nerve pain, so I started to use it twice a week to keep tolerance down, and potentiated it to hell with codeine, ibuprofen, soda, coffee, nicotine etc depending on the TYPE of gabapentin high I wanted. A week ago, I decided to make a break and get clean, and healthy. So I stopped taking them. And the week that ensured was horrendous! I couldn't sleep, I felt depressed, my body ached, and I was just in a funk all day long. I only managed to get some sleep, after a shot of vodka last night. I'm not a huge drinker so that did help immensely. 


This is just my experience of it. I'm feel a little better today, probably due to getting some sleep. So, be careful with the stuff. I wouldnt say it should be banned, as it is a great pain medication, but using it recreationally can be quite risky.

how long do you normally have to be taking this stuff before you get the horrible withdrawal people keep mentioning? i started getting this in detox about a month ago and then went through my 90 x 300 mg script in about 2 weeks after coming out, so now i'm out  and was just reading about how there's a withdrawal (woops). i guess i've been on it around a month... at least 3 x 300 daily and many days a lot more over the last few weeks...

I had some withdraws after 6 months on 1600 mg a days.. Withdraw isn't bad and only last 2 days... But if you do it recreationally only twice a week I have experienced zero withdrawals. Odd substance.

I was prescribed gabapentin for nerve pain, but found that it was too effective and shut down a whole raft of neural responses, causing loss of sensation throughout the body, severe loss of sensitivity in the sexual sense and absolutely no recreational value whatsoever bar a little drowsiness, and a mild anxyiolitic effect. Now am taking pregabilin, a much superior drug, for anxiety disorders but have not felt much euphoria from it, although I did notice an increase in confidence which is listed in the list of side effects in the patient leaflet, something I greatly needed amongst other things. It's anxyiolitic effects are far greater than gabapentin, but if your gp is exploring this class of drugs for anxiety they will automatically offer gabapentin initially as it is off license and generic versions are cheap, whereas pregabilin is under licence to pfizer who can set the price anywhere they feel like and it means it's about ten times more expensive than gabapentin and all GPs these days have one eye on the budget, so if you have anxiety disorders and get offered gabapentin if I was you I'd do what I did and pressed him to prescribe pregabilin, citing previous use of gabapentin and not tolerating it very well, and am glad I did, pregabilin works quickly and within a couple of days my anxiety levels had become bearable, even comfortable. Do some research and build your argument for being prescribed pregabilin over gabapentin because for anxiety it's head and shoulders above gabapentin.

I take, with prescription, 3000mg of Neurontin, 30mg of Vicodin and 30mg MorphineSA, over the course of the day, for Peripheral Neuropathy, which is progressive, and sciatica. I also take 1mg of Ropinerol for RLS and 20mg of Baclofen, muscle relaxer, at bedtime. My healthcare provider is the Veterans Administration. My concern is that I might overdose by accidentally taking more of these drugs as they seem to affect my memory. I often can't remember whether I have taken the prescribed dose or not. At this point if I can't remember, I don't take anything for fear of overdose, unless the pain gets intense, then I will take just half of what I am supposed to. The Ropinerol and Baclofen aren't an issue as I take them right before bed. I know Morphine and Vicodin can cause problems but what about the Neurontin? Does anyone know how much would be too much? Would it cause death or perhaps turn me into a vegetable? No desire to die here which is why I am asking these questions. Thanks very much for your help.

IMO gabapentin does increase the feeling of opiates aka synergy. To me 2,000mg of GABA + 30mg oxy = 4,000mg GABA + 60mg oxy. It doubles everything so be careful.

I take 2 GABA in the morning and 2 more at lunch, then 6 when I go to bed. These are 300mg yellow capsules. That is a total of 3000mg. I take a 7.5/325 Vicodin every 6 hours. That is 30mg. I take the 30mg MorphineSA 2 times a day or every 12 hours. That is 60mg. I don't think I am in any danger if I follow the prescription but would I be in any danger if I accidentally took an extra morphine or Vicodin or even the gabapentin? I truly appreciate anyone/everyones input.

1800 mg at night, thats crazy because I was told that the "safe" medical limit of gaba per day is 2,400mg which you clearly are over! I assume you have insomnia and nerve pain, but it's interesting that you take so much at night because it takes well over an hour for the gaba to start working (you'd be asleep before then.) I'd say you're fine with the regime you currently have, but don't take extra opiates because like I said before there is an insane synergy between opiates and gaba... please just don't take any opiates at night after you take 6 gaba pills for fear of the "death sleep".

I take crazy amounts of gabapentin when I can get it. I used to be able to get 120 of the 400mg pills and they would be gone in less than a week (granted, I was sharing them with a friend). No withdrawals. Works wonders for opiate withdrawal. The first day I took them each month, I could get away with taking maybe 10 pills that day. Then your tolerance shoots up sooo quickly. Gabapentin makes me feel more energetic and talkative and I can sail thru fent withdrawals  because I don't even notice the wd symptoms when I take huge doses of gabapentin. Great drug. I've never had any wd syndrome from the gabapentin itself...

You mentioned you were also taking Baclofen, which is a strong drug and not one to underestimate. The liver should be checked regularly when using this medication, as mandated by the manufacturer.


You were given two methods already of tracking your meds. 


1. A pillbox 

2. A diary


NO ONE here can tell you whether harm will result if you "accidentally" take extra morphine, Vicodin, Baclofen or Gabapentin. That is a MASSIVE dose of Gabapentin on top of multiple other sedating medications, which you are taking at night. In combination, that is a colossal amount of interacting, sedating medication. 


What we can tell you, is these are highly dangerous drugs on their own, let alone in combination, even more so in older people and with compromised health. People on less substances and in perfect health are found dead in bed, let alone making mistakes and overdosing themselves by failing to manage their medications. This is serious buddy. 


Either use the suggestions to manage the dosing or have someone dispense the meds to you. You won't get someone here making you some kind of arbitrary promise that overdosing on what you are prescribed will be safe and such a promise would be worthless as you should sensibly realise. This is a harm reduction forum. 


Ask your prescribing physician to review these meds and inform them of your concerns so they can help you.

I have serious nerve damage to my foot, due to dislocating my hip ( I was hit by a mini van) anyway my doc had me on 800 milligrams 4 times a day, they are tapering me down now because it has stopped helping with the burning and stinging, I am going through serious depression, anxious, I didn't realize what was doing this until I took some of my boyfriends and felt fine after....I have never had any kind of euphoria from Neurontin though

You will be severely disappointed and underwhelmed. If I was you, I would take 700 milligrams and enjoy the pleasant minor opioid + minor benzo like feeling. This only happens once, however, as Gabapentin's tolerance hits you afte only the first time. 


Keep in mind, this is one of the safest meds on the market. There have been no cases of an overdose even remotely deadly.

Personally, I've found benzo's to be the best for severe nerve pain. I know, I know... benzo's are addictive etc. But seriously, they provide no euphoria (to most people anyways) and I almost never abuse them (I've found them not be psychologically reinforcing at all). Physical addiction is just a side-effect of benzodiazepines. If you take benzo's for more than a couple weeks straight - you will become physically dependent. There is no way around that. However, you will not be psychologically addictive if they are taken correctly.


Anyways, I tried everything for nerve pain. Tons and tons of SSRIS, SNRI's, Channel Blockers (which were the most effective non-controlled substance Rx drugs), antipsychotics and TCA's (both of which just made things a lot worse), and many other drugs. I was prescribed codeine for a small amount of time, but found it be ineffective after any sort of tolerance built up. But benzo's did just the opposite.


I've found that they've made my RLS and nerve pain way better as time has gone on. I no longer suffer RLS during the day, and while I would have RLS at night - the benzo's I'm prescribe for sleep stop that from happening. I no longer have to live my life in physical pain because of exhausted nerves or whatever the fuck causes nerve issues. Also, I've also found benzo tolerance to be no where near what other people have described it to be like.


Maybe that's because I don't abuse my prescriptions? Who knows... All I know is that I've been on Benzo's every day of my life since last August and they're still 90% as effective as they were when I first started taking them.


An exception to the only thing helping for nerve pain (that isn't a benzo) is Nicotine. For some reason, Nicotine has always taken away all of my nerve pain. It's incredibly effective at doing so. I wish doctors would look into this further (explore nAChR as a means of analgesia) because it seems to really work for me...

Gabapentin worked really well for me for anxiety and pain for the first week or so that I was on it. When mixed with medical cannabis it felt very much like a mild narcotic painkiller.. 


Tolerance developed so quickly that for the rest of my experience with Gabapentin I was trying to recreate what I felt that first week. I was prescribed Gabapentin for about a year. I basically thought of it as ibuprofen, and would take it when I felt particularly anxious. I had a few seizures a month ago and was tapered off of Gabapentin and put on two very strong anti-convulsants. I'm now prescribed Lyrica, and absolutely love it. It is superior to Gabapentin in every way.

I am rx'ed alprazolam for anxiety, and I do notice that it mildly helps me with my nerve pain. I've been on it for well over 2 years, so I think I'm past the point of worrying about dependency, because I know I am dependent on it. 


I was on oxycodone/apap and hydrocodone/apap for a while. The hydrocodone and apap worked great, but then my doctor decided she no longer wanted to fill that script and then put me on ibuprofen 600mg b.i.d, 100mg Gabapentin and 5mg cyclobenzaprine. I'm also on a SNRI- tried SSRIs with no success. It's quite frustrating that nothing seems to fully help eliminate my pain. Even the Norco didn't fully eliminate it, but it definitely helped more than my current regiment... 


The last time I tried nicotine it triggered my anxiety a bit, but that was a few years ago. I may look into it again.

What mg were you on, Zwanya? Did you get any of the negative side effects like weight gain? Also, did the Gabapentin cause your seizures? Sorry for all the questions, I'm just trying to get as much info as I can ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I was recently switched from Ativan to Klonopin and both have help incredibly well for my nerve pain. I've never tried Xanax to be honest, but the consensus online seems to be that it's one of the better benzo's. Problem is - it's also one of the more addicting benzos and if you start taking it every time you start feeling pain - you could develop a psychological addiction to it.


That's what I did with Ativan (took it every time I started feeling any sort of pain) and while it was INCREDIBLY effective... I had to start taking it more and more often because I would start going into bzd withdrawals... which would give me nerve pain. So they switched me to Klonopin 1 milligram twice a day (just want to point out that's a hell of a dose. Equal to 40 milligrams of Valium a day). But I no longer have nerve pain... like at all... It's been totally eliminated by Klonopin.

Even the Norco didn't fully eliminate it, but it definitely helped more than my current regiment...

I'd ask your doc if she would be willing to prescribe Tramadol. The mix of opioid + SNRI action may be even more effective than  just opioid action alone.


The last time I tried nicotine it triggered my anxiety a bit, but that was a few years ago. I may look into it again.

I personally, got up to 1200 milligrams. Long before that, I told them that Gabapentin was no longer working but they refused to change it. I, personally, experience no side-effects at all from Gabapentin other than horrible rebound insomnia and anxiety when I was 'cold-turkey'd' off of it. Those discontinuation symptoms only lasted for a week, however.


Anyways, have you tried any of the Alpha-agonists? Guanfacine was the only other non-controlled substance that really helped me with nerve pain. You could also look into that (it's trade name is Tenex.) It's usually prescribe for ADHD or Hypertension - but I found it to be very effective for nerve pain when I was on it for ADHD. It did nothing for my ADHD, but it do help a lot with nerve pain.


And yes... good ol' nicotine. Personally, I recommend that you get mentholated cigarettes if you're going to try that. Menthol itself also has some antinociceptive actions and mentholated cigarettes seem to work way better than non-mentholated ones. Also, I have also experienced increased anxiety with non-menthol cigarettes. But menthols were just the opposite - I experienced a very marked reduction in anxiety and much more power painkilling effect.

I've never tried Xanax to be honest, but the consensus online seems to be that it's one of the better benzo's. Problem is - it's also one of the more addicting benzos and if you start taking it every time you start feeling pain - you could develop a psychological addiction to it.

I had to start taking it more and more often because I would start going into bzd withdrawals... which would give me nerve pain. So they switched me to Klonopin 1 milligram twice a day (just want to point out that's a hell of a dose. Equal to 40 milligrams of Valium a day). But I no longer have nerve pain... like at all... It's been totally eliminated by Klonopin.

i was on klonopin for a while, and that helped me a ton with anxiety and pain. i stopped taking them for a brief period of time, can't quite remember why, and then when i complained of anxiety she (my doctor) put me on alprazolam immediately. i have asked her about switching to clonazepam again, especially since it has a much longer half-life, but she's dead set on me being on alprazolam for some reason. i don't really understand why. i may be switching doctors anyway or getting a 2nd opinion because that office has been pissing me off.

this was actually her suggestion after she took me off the hydrocodone/acetaminophen (cold turkey, might i add). i declined, because i tried it before and it gave me horrible auditory hallucinations. like i'd be trying to fall asleep at night, and then as soon as i would start to fall asleep i'd hear someone "say something" and i'd jerk out of my half asleep state. it was quite scary. it was about 400mg that i was taking, if i can recall correctly.

i have not tried alpha agonistis. it is something that i may consider looking into, however. what side effects, if any, did you experience from the Alpha-agonists? i'm always super anxious when i start taking a new medication, so if i know the positive effects it has had on someone, i'm usually less anxious about trying it.

have bad depression from PAWS. though never had anxiety and depression pre heroin addiction. So I know it will pass....but maybe will take a long, long time. I am prepared for this and get panic attacks. I took myself off klonopin (kicking myself) b/b by the time it kicked in my PA was gone and i was just out of it. I have requested 5-10 ativan or xanax a month for my horrible panic attacks, and I took myself off of klonopin.


Yet because I am truthful to my doctor (told them i am a opiate addict, and my relapse are anxiety based, and these relapses cause depression etc). So I guess i can't get even 5mg a month for legit panic attacks, when anyone can lie and say they are stressed. 


I got prescribed gabapentin once trying to get off suboxone. And it definitely helped with the w/d and the dysphoria. I felt like it feels kinda natural. People i know who are experienced and preach SSRI say it does shit. But i don't want to get on an SSRI if my PAWS depression will sometime cure itself eventually. 


Would this be good for PAWS depression, instead of screwing with your already screwed up neurotransmitters.

Maybe for short term periods. It's apparent intoxicating effects (not talking nerve pain/seizure indications here) build up tolerance super rapidly. When I took it I'd always feel nice and bit sleepy and energetic. If you try to use it day after day, or any length of time (week+) merely for PAWs, you'll be dependent on gabapentin, and doubly feel shitty.

This is a misconception. 


You're body is not 'screwed-up', there are no screwed up neurotransmitters - the neurons in your brain became adapted to having opioids all the time. The body ALWAYS has to keep some sort of homeostasis in order to keep you alive - so the neurons in your brain actually changed to accommodate that opiate use. 


Now that you're body doesn't have to keep itself in homeostasis with the heroin - it will attempt to reach homeostasis once again and eventually you'll feel like you did before your heroin usage.

Hey ad lib!


I was on a rather high daily dose--600mg 3 times a day--for anxiety. The side effects were pretty nasty. I gained about 10 pounds; this happened even though I eat local, whole, healthy food, exercise regularly, and do yoga almost daily. My eating/exercising habits never changed, the only element that changed was adding Gabapentin to my meds regimen. 


My skin was also quite irritated on the medication. It would become inflammed often, and I broke out in hives a few times after taking my dose.


If you have any other questions, just shoot me a message. It's no problem at all. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have a question for anyone here. How long (estimated) does it usually take to become physically dependent on gabapentin? I used it for 5 or 6 days to get off of a horrible oxycodone/kratom habit (about 1200 mgs per day average, spread out into 3 or 4 doses or so), and then upon stopping, still had some mild withdrawal symptoms so went back on just kratom (though not nearly as much), and plan to do another week or so long cycle of gabapentin to take care of most of the rest. It's been about 5 days since stopping the first gabapentin cycle, and will probably be a couple more days until starting again. I would think that I shouldn't have to worry about physical dependency from gabapentin from this level of use, right?


PS - gabapentin did work like a charm for oxy/kratom withdrawal - I plan on making another thread to go into much greater detail about my experience shortly.

Yeah, though the original "nice" feeling may be lost after a few uses, physically you'll be fine when talking in that timeframe. Many people using it for nerve pain are on this drug for far longer periods, and they generally seem to be the ones mentioning cessation symptoms. Good luck!

No one gets addicted to gabapentin in a week. Its as others have said, those who take it for years, every day, with no breaks. Even people who leave a few days between doses don't get WD symptoms. As for it being a safe drug, yes sure, but only because not much is known about it.

I take Gabapentin since 12 Days for Opioide Withdrawal. At beginning I reduce my Opioide and take at the same time the first 10 Days only 200mg Gabapentin for sleep. After the Opioide reduce to minimal doses I stopped complete with Opioide and take first day without Opioide 500mg Gabapentin through the day and night. Second day 800mg Gabapentin through the day and night and today 600mg Gabapentin. I want to take Gabapentin the next 3 or 4 Days and than stop it. So, is it possible that I became hard withdrawal from Gabapentin ?


Oh man, for Opioide Withdrawal it is godsend but after all the posts here I have fear about Gabapentin Withdrawal.

You will nto get WD from a few days of use. Mostly its people who use it for months or years with no breaks that get WD. You should be fine.

Not sure if this is the right place to post this...if not, mods please feel free to move it elsewhere where it would be more appropriate ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


So I recently got a good amount of these pills that my buddies and I are calling "Gabaprazin." They are pills containing ~400mg of gabapentin and 1-1.5mg of alprazolam.


How is this possible you ask? Well firstly it only works with the gabapentin that comes inside the capsules, I doubt this would work with the big chunky white ones. Butyeah these were made by a friend, who would make them by opening up the cap of gabapentin, dumping a tiiiiny bit of gabapentin powder out and then dropping liquid alprazolam inside the pill, then closing it back up again. The liquid alpraz was inside a PG solution that was worked out to be ~1mg per drop, and when he sold these to me "yeah, if anything these should be fat" (as in, at least 1mg of Xanax in them. I've had sketchy experiences with some pretty weak liquid alpraz and powdered alpraz before so I wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting my money.) I heard the process described, and I guess the gabapentin powder goes from being powdery to chunky and solid once having the 'praz dropped on it, and if you close up the capsule it should stay good and not degrade...


Anyway, I've been experimenting with it a bit as of late. I took one, and expecting the Xanax to kick in right away, was disappointed when I only felt very mild/near placebo effects at the 30 minute mark. I decided to take another and HOLY FUCK it hit me like a freight train, something about the way the pill is set up it takes much longer to feel the alprazolam than just taking a Xanax. Taking a Xanax kicks in quite fast, but with this stuff it takes a lot longer. It's almost like extended release Xanax in a way, with gabapentin to potentiate it. The good news is there is EASILY 1mg or more of alpraz inside these. 1 of these will get me, 2 of these will get me good, and while I've yet to take more than 2 I imagine at that level it would be pretty hard to stay awake. I also take 1-2 mg etizolam on top of these and smoke weed and it gets me feeling quite nice and cozy. And I have a pretty fat downer tolerance FWIW

I was prescribed gabap for management of phantom limb pain.  Pain wakes me up at night, and my doc said gabap would at least help with that until tolerance builds.  It seemed to reduce spasms consistent with what is reported, and tolerance did build so the sleepiness faded.  For me, I early-on got one ear plugged (doc said no relation) and later a general ringing in my head.  Later, I began to get heart arrhythmia while waiting for sleep (I was taking 600 mg a night), and these symptoms  will clear if I skip a day.  Gabapentin has a half-life of 5-7 hrs.  I was also taking oxycodone once a day, and gabap reduces the effect (so, I wouldn't take oxy *after* gabap).  In any case, on off-days my phantom spasms return.  Doc hoped to reduce oxy Rx, and I am currently trying double-dose gapab one day and oxy the next (effect of oxy seems to improve with its half-life elimination and a 24-hour break- of course a longer break would be better if I could stand it).  Gapap does have a sedating effect that I don't much like in company.  Taken just before bedtime, however, I can depend that it will kick-in and keep me sound asleep until morning.  After effects are a little synthetic compared to the natural feel of an opiate after-effect.

Gabapentin has a certain level where it cuts off. I have taken 1,000's of mg's of this and seems like no matter how many I take the high is not increased at all. I just have a belly full of pills.

Take them as prescribed. There is no high according to research I have read.

You clearly have never taken gabapentin. Or your perception of being 'high' differs to that of the recreational users of gabapentin.

There are quite discernable psychoactive effects. Increasingly talkative, increased energy, slightly lowered inhibitions, a strange kind of warmth, distinct euphoria. I never took it long enough to develop tolerance/dependency, however taking it a few times a month at high doses seems to have caused a permanent kind of tolerance. It's been 8-10 months since I've taken any, and I doubt I'd feel even a few grams of it.

Honestly 6 300s isn't enough to get you "high" or really anything, it takes a large dosage of it to get you "high" like 10 300s. And it's a lot to swallow and am interesting high, almost makes you feel as if you are drunk, and drinking soda did seem to increase the affects. Gabepentin is honestly just waste of time and really turns more into a chore to get even a slight buzz from it, hope this helps.

Neurontin was a favorite of mine for quite some time. It is like Phenibut's little brother sans the horrible acute withdrawals. Of course there is a withdrawal syndrome associated with Neurontin, but nothing like a full GABA-A/B agonist. I don't trust Pfizer though so I stopped using it. I developed neuropathy (numbness/tingling in the toes) not long after cessation, and although this is anecdotal and quite possibly unrelated it was enough to get me off them. 


The withdrawal is like a mild mix of both a GABA & opiate withdrawal that lasts quite some time. Magnesium helped tremendously (Neurontin is a calcium channel blocker) as well as tapering. 


For those looking to use this drug recreationally you must stagger your doses as only so much can be absorbed and transported across the BBB at a time. 600/mg every hour for 4 hours was enough to get me where I wanted to be without a tolerance. It definitely causes a lack of inhibitions, not so much anxiety, relieves restlessness and is pro-social with a warm subtle euphoria.


Take 600mg 30 minutes after an aleve and continue dosing the Neurontin at that dose for 4 hours.

Perfect advice. Also, to stay away from getting to the point of WD don't abuse this drug more than twice or three times a week. Leave two days between uses and it seems from anecdotal evidence, its best not to use other GABAergics along with it if you don't want those hellish WDs.

What I don't get is how you people using it recreationally got into dependency territory. I was using it that way, and it's effects diminished to almost zip if used for a few days straight, so I'd do it for a 2-4 days and then wait a month, after time it seems the tolerance may be permanent, but the effects were lost so fast, you'd have to keep taking it daily looking for that feelings and getting nothing, but still keep doing it. Or were you prescribed it too?

A lot of people who get hooked tend to be scripted it for pain, but even as a pain killer tolerance builds fast. I know someone who swears they get high on it everyday, but potentiates it with coffee, soda etc so I don't know, maybe it works of people differently.

I've been taking 900-1200mg a day for phenibut withdrawal, and it knocks out pretty much all the symptoms. I'm on day 3 and probably will go for 600mg tomorrow and hopefully be able to jump off. Might take some etizolam on day 5 or 6 and hopefully after that I'll be good.


The most I take at once is 600mg and I notice a mood lift, very slight. I'd be going crazy with anxiety if I cold turkeyed phenibut, this helps tremendously with the withdrawal.


Oh and is the half life really just 5-7 hours like it says on wikipedia? It seems a lot longer to me.

Half life doesn't always translate into the subjective effect diminishing to nothing in that time period, or even diminishing by half. Methadone has a 24 hour half life yet people say the analgesic effects last about 12 hours or so. Hydrocodone has a half life of 4-6 hours yet I always felt the stuff for closer to 8-10. It's pretty variable based on your rate of metabolism, and then your expectations on what it *should* feel like.

gabaergic withdrawal is a mixture of starved gaba receptors and upregulated glutaminergic receptors. it curbs withdrawal by stopping the hyperexcitability of neurons through calcium-channel-blockade.

gabapentin. ...the first medication to really help 'that crazybloke' with anxiety... 


[I know 'that crazybloke' personally  .. he brushes his teeth backwards]


Before that it was drinking, then trying every other anxiety med under the Sun. None of them were sustainable because a second they were working the guy got hooked and built up tolerance. ...no good 


Started at 300 mg of gabapentin t.i.d.

Now, 13 years later and that dose is now 1600 mg   t.i.d.


no panic attacks in 13 years... A med who's side effects I have never disliked. A very kind, quite safe, 

     ...but 

        HOT MOSES, it's so expensive! 

        ...ooyeah don't even think about      

           going cold turkey, that's horrible 


...still the best pharmaceutical for that crazybloke. . . ever!

You take around 5g of the stuff per day?! No wonder its so expensive!! You might want to look into Lyrica, it may be cheaper because you need to take a fair few in oder to get the same effects.

**Gabapentin withdrawal HELL**


I was reading some of the posts about gabapentin withdrawal. I have withdrawn from benzos and SSRI's with much difficulty but I didn't know that getting off of 1800mg of gabapentin would be so horrific. I was on this dose for over 5 years. My new doc wanted me off of it and cut it in half to 300mg three times a day. It has been a month now and I am having tachycardia, extreme agitation, impatience, more hyperactivity than normal. I feel absolutely so beside myself. I am being evaluated for ADHD and my new pdoc won't prescribe low doses of Ritalin because of my higher heart rate so I am also frustrated that I cannot get my cognition under control. I don't remember being so agitated as I am right now. When I went off of a benzo, it was the darkest thoughts of anxiety but withdrawing from gabapentin, I am more emotionally affected. I just picked up some magnesium citrate to see if that will help. I am already on clonazepam 1mg BID. It isn't much help. Any suggestions?

I'm tapering of benzos at the moment, with the help of my doctor of course. He put me on this as he thought it would help with my deep muscle pain, and go well with the Mirtazapine I take for depression. Definitely elevated my mood, and made me less anxious, not done much for the pain but better than nothing. I am on only a small dose of 300 mg twice a day though. This drug seems to be used for so many purposes... strange one.

I was diagnosed for sure with fibromyalgia and was prescribed Neurontin, 600 mg 3 times a day. What's the first thing I do with it?! I go crazy with it. Taking a pill every half hour until I feel effects. My question is, I'm also prescribed generic naproxen, 500 mg. Will this boost the gabapentin at all? Or does it have to be brand name Aleve?

you can use any brand name naproxen. it doesn't matter. the naproxen doesn't directly affect the gabapentin. it just acts with it synergistically to suppress hyperalgesia. 


i do this with pregabalin all the time.

Does the naproxen potentiate pregabalin?

no. synergy. not potentiation. it doesn't make it stronger (potentiate) but it acts synergistically (together in harmony) with pregabalin in order to induce a combined effect that can induce greater hypoalgesia than when both substances are taken alone.

lol gabapentin has absolutely no recreational use past the first night.  i tried 1200 the first night and was out like a light.  upped it to 1500 the second night and was up playing COD until 3am.  the body seems to grow a tolerance to its sedating abilities very fast.


as far as lyrica goes, whole different animal.  if you need sleep, pop 300 and you are done.  works every time.

Everybody says this but I call bullshit. I got a bottle of 270 300s just recently and I've been using them every day and taking them appropriately still gets me ripped after a while. Not "i'm tripping my balls off" high but definitely feeling it's effects on my nerve pain, and visuals and pleasant drowsiness. Keeps working if you know how to work it. Taking a handful of tabs at once might work a couple times, but you need to boost the BA if you want it to work after that. And Lyrica with it's higher BA in the stomach works terrifically for a long time for me. I'd use that if I could afford it. And yes, you will have to raise dose after every so long but not 5g at a time like I see some of you guys doing. Yeah that will definitely wreck your tolerance and yeah that will probably make you withdrawal. lol DUH?

idk i guess everyone is different, if it works then hey keep doing it.  but yeah lyrica is SOOPER expensive, and it's not like getting the generic really helps either.  even with insurance as good as mine i still had to pay out around $130 for 30x75mg.  at least i don't have to worry about it not working when i basically want to comatose for about eight hours.

I get a subtle speed high with 600-900 mg. I feel more talkative and awake. 


The most gabapentin I have taken was 1500 - 1800 mg while smoking a bunch of weed and i had a really weird high. Almost felt dissociative but not In a good way. Not sure if that was the gabapentin or what. Anyways I love this stuff in low doses.It worked miracles for my phenibut withdrawal aswell

Pregabalin is sooooo much cheaper in Mexico substantially cheaper than the price mentioned above. 28 150 mg pills for so much cheaper.  Like over 100 bucks cheaper.  Its still expensive here though, but not as bad in the US!

i get 90 600mg gabapentin pills for less than $10 here in the US... all you have to do is pretend you have anxiety and refuse to take anything "addictive" such as benzos ... I prefer gabapentin over benzos because not only does it give me energy it also doesn't allow me to forget my entire day like benzos tend to do ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I have 180 gabapentin 300s and I survive off them since getting off opiates/kratom for a decade. It is a miracle. Problem is when I have a giant bottle I tend to swallow them by the handful instead of staggering like normal. I love gabapentin. And I would take pregabalin if my insurance covered it but alas it doesn't.

Ive recently been prescribed gabapentin as a mood stablizer.  Im supposed to take 1 three times a day, but it seemed I built a quick tolerance.  I now take them only as needed and they work just fine.  I really enjoy taking 900 mg and smoking a joint.  I sleep like a baby.

I'm on a huge dose of gabapentin right now mixed with a dangerously high dose of tramadol. Not exactly harm reduction but the synergy is incredible. I feel like I am tripping and nodding at the same time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Messed about with this recently recreationally, as I had spares. 


Start of the month it took 3000mg, with my prescribed benzos. Just felt like I'd taken a lot more diazepam really, with some visual distortion. Very chatty.


A month later, tried again, this time had to go up to 10000mg for an effect, with my prescribed benzos. This was slightly weird, I was forgetting stuff, doing things 3 or for times, and was just generally out of it. Really not very enjoyable, my tolerance had obviously not come down that much in 4 weeks. Visual distortions more prominent, had to read with one eye like I often need to on Ketamine and opoiates. Reminiscent of that ket RC MXE... Just felt confused and kind of lost in my own house. Didn't enjoy..


I used 1000mg to potentiate 600mg of codeine (also with my prescribed benzos). It didn't do that much really, in the way of positives, but that's subjective. Just felt the nod a lot more with less of the euphoria. Was kind of bored near the end of the peak almost, as with the euphoria being less, my thoughts were quite static.


Drank wine with 6000mg, felt effects noticeably more, but not in a pleasant way. I felt annoyed and a bit confused, and often felt sick. Continued to drink beer after effects had worn off, and felt ok. I guess that's kind of good if you can't afford to buy much booze and have Gabapentin lying about?! But I wouldn't recommend it, especially from a harm reduction standpoint. Not as bad as benzos or opiates with booze I thought though, but I try to avoid drinking on nah those, except my prescribed benzos. 


Also used 900mg for a coke comedown, the coke being imported from the continent and very clean (yellowy/brown stuff). I fell asleep 15 minutes after taking my nightly mirtazapine, with the gabapentin taken an hour prior to that. Doubt it did anything for sleep, as hardly any drugs make me drowsy enough to sleep if my body can fight it now. Fucking benzos! Taper is going well though still, thank god. 


In short, good if you want to potentiate benzos especially if you have a small benzo tolerance, as unlike me you can up your benzo dose, for more effects. That was the equivalent feeling of me taking about 70 to 120mg of Diaz, or a large Xanax dose. Was talking a lot and very happy. With my tolerance that was insane, not felt a benzo type feeling like that one in over a year. That was with 6000mg of GABA and 20mg diazepam. Although I doubt the two drugs will synergies in the same way again like that. I also don't recommend you take similar doses if you are unsure. I was fine, and went out shopping quite happy, you could end up very unstable and slurring. Waking up with bruises, or even in hospital. Don't risk it, you can always take more, never less. Unless you know your own limits then do as you please.


Good for some opiate users I guess, who want to be more sedated. Unsure of it as a comedown drug, although lots swear by it. Due to my tolerance I would have to take a large number of benzos for say an amphetamine comedown, in combination this may help. Although I can't see myself on a meth comedown anytime soon haha. 


This can be a bit weird if you take it medicinally and drink or do recreational drugs, so watch out for that. Nice with weed thlugh!

Gabapentin/Neurontin effect's a lot of people differently, I personally love it's effects. I'm around 190/200LB's, and consume anywhere from 12 (3600mg) to 15 (4500mg) of the 300 mg cap's, usually taken on an empty stomach. Effect's begin around 2, or 2 1/2 hour's later, and last around 8 to 10 hours! I feel euphoric, more sociable, creative and just overall damn good, both physically and mentally. Like a mild MDMA/Adderall feeling, without the edge, or the harsh comedown, and also similar to a mild trip at the same time. Tolerance is really the only issue. It build's up FAST. My advise, start with something low and work your way up until you find a dose that work's for you, and I wouldn't worry too much about taking a lot. It's almost impossible to O.D. you have to take a really insane dose for anything fatal to happen. Test have been dome on this, with people consuming up to 49grams! and all recoverd just fine without any additional treatment. Hope this is of any help, have fun and be safe.![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Take 900mg before bed. Great for insomnia. Been taking it for a few months now and it still does the job each night. Not a benzo type effect though. Very subtle.

Gabapentin is really strange. It gives you Adderall confidence without the euphoria, makes you sleepy but not so much that you can't resist if you want to, doesn't at all impair your speech but makes you walk in zig-zags rather than straight lines unless you focus on it, makes the world shinier like a normal dose of weed;

I got the euphoria and the talkativity, the sleepiness not so much. After a year of taking high doses for like three days once a month it seems I built up a permanent tolerance. It's been at least a year, and I haven't had any recently so I dunno if it reset just yet.

Used Gabapentin to get off methadone, long story short - I ended up taking anywhere between 1800-5000mg up to twice a day. This was last year. After a slow taper im down to 300mg a day and find it difficult to drop any lower... even with the aid of clonazepam. Definitely recreational ... but I wouldnt advise taking recreational doses (1,000 mg +) more then twice a week. NMDA antagonists like zinc, magnesium and agmatine definitely helped me get this far without a sweat ... sticking to 300 mg until I can re-up on my supplements. I just took the taper reallllllllly slow because I know of the gabapentin withdrawal horror all to well... no thanks.


ALSO cant forget about KRATOM. Tremendous help indeed.

I take 900mg/day of gabapentin, and I also enjoy the closed eye visuals (it doesn't give me open eye visuals) at bedtime.  They are subtle and nice.  The sedation from my dose is very minimal.  Still, this drug is basically pharma trash--thrown at patients by psychiatrists like feces throwing monkeys--in the final analysis.  I hope I don't have withdrawals when and if I decide to quit taking it.  Only Vistaril (hydroxyzine) is more worthless of the cocktail of Rx's I'm on.

It's great to get a small calendar and keep it with your meds. Mark the time you took which ever one and you'll be fine. As far as Overdosing, everyone has a different metabolism and some drugs absorb into your system faster, some ppl with a high tolerance have passed away using their same dosing. It all depends, exp. If you're on Fentanyl, you can't eat a certain fruit. I have a cousin who's young brother (16-18) passed away after taking 8-9 hydrocodone. Rest in peace Tommy. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Probably because the doctor is an ass and doesn't want to prescribe scheduled/abuseable medication to said patient. Or maybe the patient experienced side effects (they differ even though it's the same class of drugs).

That is odd the doc would say it lowers the seizure threshhold when it is used for mild seizures and tics.

**Gabapentin**


Gabapentin is one of the hardest meds I have had to get off of. I was maxed out at 300mg X 6a day. I was put on this in the beginning on 2011 for severe nerve damage to my right foot. Well after 13 surgeries and still having nerve problems I decided to stop taking this as it wasn't helping with the pins and needles or constant burning sensation . Well it’s been a rough road and after allmost 3 weeks I still feel weird. Hot flashes, dizzy, eyes are sensitive to light and very moody (depressed). I mean this crap is not supposed to act like this. I was told this is not going to cause any problems while on or stopping this med. Is there anything I can do to get past this messed up feeling? Does anyone know how long this crap will last? What does this drug do the brain? I have quit taking many drugs including ssri and never had these feelings I have. Some days I feel good and then some days it’s like I want to find a hole and just die in it. I am a very strong minded person and have all ways been able to get past these weird feelings it’s just that every day is different!! Is there anything I can get from one of my many doctors to help with this? I live in Texas so weed is not a legal option. It does help though just wish I could get medical weed. Has anyone had these problems with gaba? I am at my wits end with all of this any help would be greatly appreciated..

Could try Lyrica, which is a newer version of gabapentin. Alot of people say it works better for nerve pain. I didn't have that result, but I have MS no my nerves don't play by the rules

Forgot to mention, you should titrate down slowly to avoid the withdraw. Tell your doc that you want to stop so he/she can give lower dose capsules, or they could try you on Lyrica and that would end the withdraw since they are similar and may actually help the pain.

Hello all long time bluelight creeper first time poster. Hopefully this is the best place to put this. I have a legally obtained perscription from my severe frost bite last year. But anyway, i had read the forums and heard mixed reviews about whether or not this could be used recreationally. So heres my night:

10Pm i took 3 300mg pills

11Pm not felling much maybe placebo stimualtion so 3 more 300mg pills

11:30 decied to dive into my 100mg pills and take 10

12Am feeling stimulated no placebo so i take 5 more 300 pills

1Am still stimulated no sedation(which i was looking for) so 10 more 100mg pills

2Am same stimulation 3 more 300 pills

3Am more stimulation so i take 10 more 100mg pills

4Am more stimulation 3 more 300mg pills(at this point i start working out pretty heavilly) 

4:30 5 more 300mg pills and more working out.

5Am im starting to get upset that the effects are not becoming sedative which i thought it would through stagering doses and i had ate snacks between doses or milk.

530 i take my 1mg perscribe klonapin.(i am recovering from a large alprazolam addiction 20mg+ a day so the 1mg is a low dose for me.)

7 am still stimulated tho through the entire night non of the stimulation was anxiety ridden. At this point i take my normal meds i take every night 400mg seraquel, .2mg clonidine, 15mg remron, 100mg vistril. Plus my 6mgs of melatonin. (If you havent guessed im an isomniac) i pop in a movie, get comfy and pass out within the hour.

This is where it gets interesting. I wake up at 12pm and my motor function is gone. Like i drank a 5th of vodka but without nasuea. I stomble around to get my other 1mg of klonapin thinking it was getting fun. I sit down and pass out with the klonapin dissolving in my very cottony mouth. 7Pm i wake up and struggle to read the time on the clock. Fuck moms home in 20minutes and im supposed to have cleaned not to mention be sober (coart ordered) motor function still completely gone i hide everything under my bed and sit down. In the next hour my motor control starts to come back to the point of maybe pulling off sobriety (not really) mom wants to go grocery shopping (fuck) im bumping into walls down the halway and sketchly making it down the stairs and outside to the car without being noticed. Within the next hour my motor coordination went back to almoat completely normal and went on my way home.

I guess the moral of my story start small 'cause this stuff has a very large varriable amount of time to fully kick in.

All in all reminded me of ghb in reverse, stimulation first g'd out 2nd if that makes sense.

I've been taking gabapentin for about 2 or 3 months. It has been great for my fibromyalgia and anxiety. My psychiatrist put me on 1-2 300mg x3 a day. I have developed new nerve pain in my legs that is really bad and I'm hoping that maybe increasing my dose will help quell that as well. Its nice with the hydrocodone for my arthritis pain.


(I know that some people try and get high on this or lyrica. I did try lyrica as a teen and it basically reduced all my motor control to nothing. I was a sober mind inside a drunk body, running into walls. It lasted a full day and it was terrible. It seems like this is a common experience for people on lyrica and gabapentin.)

Yeah like today one of my friends was going on and on about "bro that shit fucks with your GABA receptors so hard" and meanwhile I'm thinking "...actually it doesn't act on GABA at all..."


I enjoy it. Its the only thing that's helped with my anxiety since coming off a brutal 3 year benzo addiction. I thought I was gonna be too anxious to leave the house, or speak to people, forever. It helps me live a normal life and for that I'm extremely grateful. This is at 900mg/daily, never once have I been tempted to go above this dose. I didn't take any this past Friday and I was completely fine. Whereas, during the peak of my Xanax addiction, if I didn't have any all day I would be a MESS.


Some of the "withdrawal horror stories" initially dissuaded me from getting this prescribed, but I think there's a lot of over exaggeration going on. Most of the w/d reports I read are from people who have either a) never been through a REAL withdrawal in their life (im looking at you benzos and opis) OR b) people who are prescribed this but are also on a cocktail of downers, opiates, pain meds, benzos, alcohol, other meds etc and at that point, how would you even know what's causing what? I'm not saying this doesn't have a w/d component, but I cant for the life of me imagine it being as miserable as benzos.

I thought the method of action of gabapentin was unknown?


It could very well effect some subtype of gaba that is not typical of benzos.


> While the majority of GABAA receptors (those containing α1-, α2-, α3-, or α5-subunits) are benzodiazepine sensitive there exists a minority of GABAA receptors (α4- or α6-subunit containing) which are insensitive to classical 1,4-benzodiazepines,[8] but instead are sensitive to other classes of GABAergic drugs such as neurosteroids and ethanol.

So it very well could be an agonist of GABA, but your friend still wouldn't be quite right as it's exact pharmacodynamics are unknown.

Gabapentin gives me a profound sense of *calm*. It's not like a high dose of benzos, where anxiety is literally impossible. But, it makes me more comfortable in my own skin and with the way things are.

Neurotin is different than anything I've know of. It makes me hyperactive and completely carefree. It's the best of uppers and downers all rolled into one huge dose of over 2 1/2 grams. I only get prescribed the 100mg pills nowadays so I can't use it that much, but maybe that's not such a bad thing since it seems tolerance builds so fast for everyone else. It works great for hangovers and for when tweeking starts to get a little to much. And from my experience withdrawals from it isn't that bad but I was only 2700mg a day when I was rehab so I don't know about people that are prescribed higher doses. It's nothing compared to alcohol or synthetic cannabinoid detox.

Borderline drug testing question, which isn't really allowed.... but I guess it's not *really* one since there is no good reason to ever be tested for gabapentin, it isn't scheduled, and the only place it's considered a drug of abuse is inside prison. Answer: Who the heck knows, since if you *were* being drug tested for it the duration would likely be similar to if you used the half life to calculate what a potential negligible quantity (or cutoff) would be. Since most drug tests (like for cannabis and heroin) don't test for the drugs themselves (except in impaired driving - and even 4-6 grams with no tolerance is less impairing than two or three glasses of wine IMO - or death investigations where the quantity in the blood is what is relevant), they test for the metabolites to confirm use, not *how much* you use. How long it stays will be based on how much you used, but my guess is that it is less than three days (with tiny tiny insignificant testable trace amounts present longer.  I base this assumption on the fact that wikipedia states that it is not appreciably metabolized and excreted renally unchanged, so there are no highly lipophilic metabolites to stick around forever like cannabis.


This is ALL conjecture and to be taken with a very large grain of salt. And why the hell would this be of concern? I'm only answering it because there is NO reason you would be drug tested for gabapentin and I'm answering it as if a purely physiological curiosity. Mods, forgive me if you see it otherwise and edit my answer out. People get tested for drugs not on the NIDA-5 when they get caught with them as a condition of parole or the like... gabapentin is unscheduled and easy to obtain, legally, in powdered form.

And from my experience withdrawals from it isn't that bad but I was only 2700mg a day when I was rehab so I don't know about people that are prescribed higher doses. It's nothing compared to alcohol or synthetic cannabinoid detox.

It's some unique stuff to be sure, and once tolerance develops unlike other stuff it takes like 10 months+ to diminish IMO, and I never took it daily, or enough to develop a dependence on it (though to be fair when I first got the stuff I was given huge 120 count bottles of 800mg for free, guess I just took high enough doses that the duration I took it for was so short I got lucky in a way instead of taking it slowly at half a pill twice a day until I was dependant, but then again I was using it recreationally, though I got scripted 300mg twice daily for 'anxiety' (I just liked the stuff and was too irresponsible with benzos I was prescribed, again for 'anxiety' ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) and no doctor will refuse a request to switch from 1mg clonazepam twice daily to that, unless there's a damn good medical reason, or they're just too big of assholes to prescribe it off-label, and it is probably the #1 drug prescribed for things other than what it is FDA approved to treat - neuropathic pain and seizures... at least I think it is for seizures).

One of it's two indications is for treating neuropathy, and while a paradoxical pain increase can indeed occur with opioids (unlikely in this case as they mentioned it working with the hydrocodone).


Fibromyalgia is just a very poorly understood condition which the underlying cause not elucidated, and the neuropathy idiopathic (fancy word for doctors don't really know) it's possible their pain increased despite opioid and gabapentin treatment.


This is why I find paradoxical pain unlikely:

Now... if it increases when the hydrocodone is administered it could be a possibly, but it is more likely the actual pathology of the illness and not a side effect. Wikipedia lists "antipsychotics and certain anticonvulsants.[citation needed]" as causing RLS, and but it's wikipedia, has no medical citation, and if you don't have an irresistible urge to move them to calm the pain it's unlikely.


I wonder if the individual ever tried Nabilone for treatment? Just a quick glance mentions that as an effective treatment for some people suffering from fibromyalgia - it's a cannabinoid agonist (wikipedia says it mimics thc which I take to assume means it is a partial agonist, unlike some of the synthetic cannabinoids going around as recreational research chemicals).


IANAD, just my .02

Guidance on first recreational dose? I'm reading 1,000mg to 1,500mg 


I'm 'pretty' tolerant to Benzos and have recreationaly taken Pregablin in the past at doses of ~800mg per trip which was probably on the heavy side. 400mg would be more pleasurable/functional.


I plan to take it within the next few hours so any quick help would be great ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hi! I've been on Gabapentin for about a year and a half. Was scripted it in rehab following an opiate addiction. I'm currently on the max dosage (3600 mg a day), and also scripted Lyrica 100 mg 4x a day. These were through different doctors---I guess you could say I've been abusing it, because I often take more than the recommended dosage. Not drastically so (I don't get high or anything), but enough so that I'm convinced I've been made less anxious. Now I'm wanting to get off of both, or at least get down to a reasonable dosage and stop abusing them. Does anyone know of a good taper plan? My doctor and I discussed it somewhat, she said go down 600 mg of the Gabapentin a week until I'm at 1300 a day, with no change to the Lyrica. Does this seem reasonable? I'd have more faith in her plan, but she's pretty unfamiliar with Gabapentin & such. I'm scripted both off-label for anxiety. 


Thanks!

**Gabapentin & pregabalin mechanism of action**


Its not a receptor that Pregabalin and Gabapentin bind to, its blocks the ionotropic glutamate receptor (NMDA) calcium channel which is what the NMDA receptor opens. Its pretty much exactly what Magnesium does naturally or what PCP does only pcp does it much stronger. When getting off these 2 drugs I recommend taking a good magnesium supplement lile magnesium citrate or magnesium sulfate or magnesium taurtrate, NOT Magnesium Oxide as it has like a 7% bioavailibility. Also probably avoid calcium for a lil bit.

This is a very good drug if you know how to take it.  First off if you don't have at least 2400mg that would be 8 300mg caps. you are wasting your time.  If you do pop like 6 or 7 300mg cap with pop on an empty stomach.  It takes like 1 to 2 hours to peak and last for at least 6 hours.  It is a very social drug, very talkative, very happy, energized without the speedy feeling.  I got to know this drug from prison, in prison there was no opiates unless you were on your death bed, so Neurontin's were the thing.  They went for 50 cent for a 400 cap sometimes a 300 cap.  I would take like I said 7 or 8 and be straight all day in my cell.  One downfall though is you can't get high on it day after day you will build a tolerance very fast.  Best thing to do is dose every other day and you will be straight.  Snorting it has no better effect either.  Just take normal wait a few hours and you will be straight all day for sure.  Lyrica is it's big brother so if you get Lyrica it will give you the same high less pills to take, but like Neurontin you can't get high off them day after day you have to skip a day or two.  If you try to take huge amounts you are wasting it, you have to space it out.

There seems to be a divide among the opinion on whether to take the gabapentin on a full or empty stomach.  The more reliable research I've come across says that a high fatty meal increases BA.  I've been chewing my gabapentin, it tastes bad but now I barely notice any taste.  It's been a little over a week since I got my Rx.  I assume my tolerance will be too high to get any pleasure from it soon.  Right now it takes about 3000-4000mg to get a nice buzz.  I stagger my doses around 300mg every 30 min, and take naproxen about an hour or so before my first dose.  Anyone have any advice on how to continue getting the most out of this drug?  I plan on taking a break for a week or so to lower my tolerance, although I'm not sure if that will be long enough.

Does chewing the pills affect the BA, would that be the same as parachuting?  The taste doesn't bother me.

my tolerance isn't really that low, should I up it to 600mg every 45 min?  I'm in the process of dosing now lol I just took my first two 300mg in the last 90 min with naproxen and coke (the soda) and I have an egg sandwich.  idk if carbs from the bread will affect BA or aborbsion but I assume the eggs alone will help with the cola and naproxen.  so I guess I'll up it to 600mg every 45 min.  have a bit of weed too maybe that'll help but I'm at work now can't smoke for another 3 hrs.  I appreciate your response!

rather than read through this thread I am just going to ask. 


what would you say the best way to take the 400MG capsules are? I take 1600/MG every morning w/ my 8MG bupe; I usually feel "great" but it takes a few hours, which I know is normal w/ GABA, but wondering how I could speed it up (which is a question asked many times before but my brain is friend, go figure). 


I know some say just dump in a drink.. kinda gross tho, no!? I always drink a Monster Energy (or 2) every morning after I take my bupe/gaba. 


btw, lately I've been dosing phenibut come PM; my gabapentin is taken at 630AM and usually taking phenibut (3G's) around 6PM; anyone else using these 2 together? I know they are very similar but I am actually scripted my gabapentin for seizure problems, as well as keppra. the phenibut I still "buy" and use "for fun".

If you're taking phenibut every day you probably have a decent tolerance already along with the neurontin. Best thing you can do is wake up and take naproxen and throw some hot sauce on your eggs for breakfast before you dose. Naproxen + capsaicin + meal + monster energy

I've noticed when I take those white oval 800mg pills vs. my 300mg capsules, it's like the BA% is majorly increased IME. I get that drunken, sedating body-high and relaxation that I got in the early days of taking gaba. It takes far more than 800mg of the capsules to feel that way, actually I don't think it's possible to achieve that feeling w/ these 300mg capsules I'm prescribed. I feel like they don't absorb well in my system or something, unless it's a placebo/mental thing. I may ask to be prescribed the pill form for a much more effective BA% than these fucking capsules.


BBT, good to see ya around my dude. I need to get hip to the phenibut, it would be a god-send therapeutically. Just need to find a proper vendor, I already checked the local vitamin/supplement shops for any overlooked products containing β-phenyl-GABA/phenibut.

Hello all. Short time lurker, first time poster. I find that Gabapentin works in my case, 300mg, staggered 1 capsule, each hour. I stagger that up to 900 Mg - 1200 Mg and it works great. Much stronger than 900 Mg's at once. I wait a solid hour or longer, then I take anywhere from 1mg to 3mg of Clonazepam. Then I feel real good. To whoever asked about Gabapentin and drug tests, I was prescribed Gabapentin in a drug rehabilitation hospital. I hope that answers that question. I also take Lyrica. 150mg, twice a day. I like switching between the two. Sometimes I mix them, but it's nothing special. Anyone know a good time to take the Gabapentin if you take opiates?

If your using gabapentin and want effects you really should dose 1200<, that is were the best effects range. I've mixed opaites and gabapentin before. It's really not a good mix. The gabapentin totally over powers the opiates. I recomend skipping gabapentin with opaites. I totally love it alone though, it's also great with dxm, some grass and sometimes alcohol.

I just got prescribed Gabapentin again so I have a bit of a tolerance to it. For me I don't really get that high on it but do notice some effects. However when I took a 5100mg dose about 12 hours after taking a suboxone(I can get high on them), It totally potentiated the subs and made it kick back in. I actually started nodding pretty hard.So for me they definitely make opiates a stronger.


 I am also about to be prescribed vyvanse. I was wondering if the gabapentin will help alleviate some of the anxiety/jitteriness of the vyvanse to any significant degree? Has anybody had experience mixing the two?

Well I haven't mixed vyvanse, I have mixed adderall. Yes it is very good for helping anxiety caused by stim. I usally don't use a stim unless I have gabapentin. Try it out and see yourself.

Alright cool thank you. I was hoping it would because if I do any amphetamines I have to have opiates or benzos to take the edge off a bit. I'm glad my psychiatrist took that into account when I told him how jittery I would get on them.

A few methods to speed up gaba onset:


Drink something with high acidic content. Gabapentin loves that as well as fatty food.

Eating deiffently raises the BA. But make sure you don't eat to much, cause it can take 5 HOURS, no joke.

I don't feel anything off of Gabapentin, either I'm not taking a decent enough dose or I have other things in my system getting in the way of its effects. I get prescribed 300mg 3x a day. A good starter dose for someone with no tolerance would probably be 1200-1500mg in an hour, but be careful because I've watched someone completely lose their balance and fall over multiple times on this drug.

Fuck this medication.


Seriously. Fuck this goddamn pharmaceutical. 


I took it for 2 months at doses of 1200mg-2100mg per day when I was roughly 5-6 months off benzos and ambien and it has ruined my life. When I was on it, it caused major interdose w/d and horrible side effects (suicidal thoughts, major depression, severe shakiness, nerve pain, anxiety, weight gain). After finally forcing myself off of it without any doctor's help, and an urgency to stop due to the suicidal thoughts, I finally stopped the medication after two months use in March 2015.


Since that time, my life has been destroyed by endless withdrawal, both physical (shakiness, nerve pain, heart palpitations, akathasia, nonstop hair loss, stiffness) and psychological (irrational fears, derealization, anxiety, cognitive impairment, social deterioration). I have not been able to drive a car or drink alcohol & caffeine in over 8 months. This shows no sign of stopping, and the past few months have been especially difficult. 


The WORST thing about this is the fact that every doctor I go to does not believe me when I say gabapentin caused this. I have gone through hell all because I took a prescription by an outpatient center psychiatrist and it has ruined my life. I have never even gotten an explanation or an apology from them.


So, FUCK THIS MEDICATION. The biggest regret I have in my life is ever taking this shit. I just want this to fuckin stop already!!!!

Hey blue comet, I am sorry to hear about your experience. I have read about similar cases of Gabapentin withdrawal. There is a thread dedicated for that but I guess you already know that one:

[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/448441-Gabapentin-withdrawal-any-advice?highlight=Gabapentin](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/448441-Gabapentin-withdrawal-any-advice?highlight=Gabapentin)


Irrc, there were some tips and ways to lessen these horrible symptoms, but that could have been in "Drugs-Forum" or the german board I frequent.

I will look for it and then provide you the links.


Can't you try to see a doctor with some printed papers of these withdrawal reports so he can help you?


Ironically other people report having no WDs what so ever after quitting Gabapentin. But I think that depends on length of use and dose. 

It is a strange medicine for sure and its mechanism is not even fully understood yet.


I hope you get better soon, hang in there!


Z

Thanks for the reply.


I have actually shown a doctor these reports of people's difficulties with this medication (both published and online accounts) and he didn't offer any other explanation or plan of action.


All doctors offer me is more shit that will fuck with my head, like SSRIs, seroquel, etc.


I don't even know if I can ever go see another doctor ever again. The colossal damage that gabapentin caused (thousands of dollars in lost wages, months of nonstop pain and a ruined life) is incomprehendible. What's worse is that NO doctor has ever said "gabapentin did this," much less agreed with my suggestion that is is the cause of my problems. God help that doctor if I ever by chance encounter him again.

I have been on it for three years and it off and on provides more of a mood thing than a buzz. you have to continually take it when you want a buzz. take 1800mg, wait three hours and take it again same dose than three hours later take a slightly higher dosy like 3000mg.  For me i will go off it for a few days and this helps to bring back those feelings. i was hooked on it for a while, but because of its rapid tolerance usually two or three days will work and than lower your dose for a week and than try the bump up again. Works well for me. Maybe no one else. I also dose130mg methadone a day so maybe opiate potentate it a bit too.

Wow, I can't believe how many people don't get effects from gabapentin. I was an IV heroin and cocaine user for 7 years so I definitely know what feeling high is like and I get excellent effects from gabapentin in the 3,000-5,000mg range. It is actually more enjoyable for me than some benzos. Tolerance definitely develops rapidly but if you take a couple weeks off it will drop back off. Anyway, I came here looking for information on potentiating the effects of gabapentin. I skimmed the 24 pages of this thread and didn't see anything conclusive. Anyone have any ideas?

Wondering if anyone has experience with gabapentin and suboxone/subutex? Ive been on bupe maintenance the past 2 years, i take between 4-8mg subutex daily, i recently aquired a crap ton of gabapentins from a friend cuz she didnt want them and knew that i'd enjoyed them in the past. Its been a few years but i know when taking high doses of gaba in the past i enjoyed the effects, now that i am on subutex tho im concerned if there would be any interactions or how it would feel to take the two together? Been researching on google but havent found much.. any info or experience would be helpful, thanks! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I think I took suboxone and gabapentin together once but it was a LONG time ago so I dont really remember much. It doesnt do anything disastrous to you or anything crazy like that. I *think* the gabapentin does fight thru the sub. You feel a nice mixture of both. I think thats why i liked them in the first place. Because when I didn't have a sub for every day, i could take a gabapentin and i would feel it and it would help. So no crazy reactions for me.

been taking GABA at 1600/MG/day for a while now and thinking about making a stop. 


do you think there will be any withdrawals? I am also on Suboxone, Xanax and Keppra. 


w/ that said, do you think any withdrawals? today I already went down to 800 rather than 1600 and feel fine; I just do not want it to cause any seizures or anything like that.

Youll be fine coming off of them if you keep taking lower doses til you quit. It will also help that youve got the other stuff to keep you getting sick

I recently decided to stop taking opiates as my addiction was getting very strong. I've been on them for far too long. So I read somewhere that Lyrica would be good for withdrawal symptoms and I was already prescribed it but haden't taken it as I decided I didn't want to for the long term. So then I started taking the Lyrica the first day of my detox and what I read was correct, the lyrica definitely helped with my withdrawal symptoms. But here I am on day 6 of my detox and I'm through the worst of it. I want to stop taking the lyrica and I know that it is a drug that you can not just stop taking due to the fact that it has an effect on your brain, not to mention the rest of your body. So my question is if I've only been on Lyrica for 6 days and of I tapered off through 2-3days would that be enough? Does someone have any experience with this? Using it for only one week I am sure it wouldn't get my body to use to it. Any input or advice, or a shared experience would be very helpful! Thanks!


*** I am only currently on 400 MG toral taken in three doses.

Shouldn't be addicted to the Lyrica yet, though it might be masking the w/d from the opiates more than you realize....

I dunno, try cutting your dose by half for a day and if nothing bad happens see what happens when you just take nothing the day after?

Thanks, brotha. I have been using around 400/MG/day over the past week since I went on vaca and did not have enough GABA to take the full script. I am now home and just called in the full script which I will pick up tonight; I DO plan on NOT taking the GABA daily, tho. my one MAJOR concern is seizures. I have a brain tumor which tend to cause seizures in my sleep; so I do NOT want to have any seizures while coming off somewhat of a seizure med; although, I have always taken for "fun" but oh well, we'll see. 


I had enough of taking these and will try to go down to ZIP since I start a chemo drug tonight and will feel like shit anyway. 


but my sick mind still would like to take the GAGA every few days so I can get a good "feel" from it rather than just take as part of the daily meds.

AWFUL for some! Like me! I'd say it's up there with the worst of them. 

Benzos are the only thing that helped at all.

I got off GABA pretty easy; its only been a few days but I seriously did not feel a thing. 


I am on many other things, so that may have helped but how long till you usually start feeling an actual withdrawal from GABA?

Gabapentin has been a weird drug that I have experimented for about two years now. I do it about once a month for a few days straight. Those of you who get no recreational value what so ever- I have no clue how. I take anywhere from 6-8 800mg pills and I am set for the day. Talkative, stumbling like a drunk, more creative, and a bit of a dissociation type of effect.

I took 1800 mg as follows: 900 mg in a pint of water, 450 insufflated, and 450 swallowed whole. I fell asleep within 30 minutes, no CEVs.

Should I expect any WDs from a 3/ 4 day binge of ~ 2000mg per day?


Cheers.

Nah you're good.


For me, I know they are working when I start to stumble around drunkenly, you also get decent CEVs on higher doses.

I used to get CEVS from gabapentin when I first started staggering. I did 300mg every half hour until I got to 2700mg and didn't get CEVS until around the 8hr mark. I don't anymore. Has this happened to anyone else?


And has anybody staggered their gabapentin for a considerable dose like upwards of 5, 6, 7 grams (or even a small dose like 300 or 400 all day)  throughout the day? If so what was it like, and what effects did you get 8 and 12 even 16 hours into it?

It is consistent in its inconsistency in many regards. Thankfully, it always takes the majority of WDs away, but after I've been using gaba for 2-3 days daily, I stop getting any rec effects from it, no matter how big a dose I take. Then other times, it'll just hit me out of nowhere and I'll be seeing double.

I've been taking GABA for a few years now (though I never felt anything so mostly I just ended up stock piling them and giving them away). Lately I've only been taking 4 300mg with a 1mg Ativan so I can sleep however a couple of days ago after I ran out of Vic I decided to try 8 300mg chased with a shot of DXM. Fucked me up for hours. I have a pretty decent stash of GABA so today I'm trying 10 300mg without the DXM.


Does anyone get muscle twitches from higher doses of GABA?

I've been jumping all over w/ Suboxone. 


I stayed on it steady for 6 months (for seizures) @ 1600/MG/day. I sometimes would feel "good" in the early stages but wore off quick (I was also on Suboxone and Keppra). 


just recently I decided to kick the GABA and have it for "good times"; meaning ill take 3200/MG one day rather than just take it steady every day. yes, this is the "druggie" coming out of me and trying to stop my own seizure meds (I have a brain tumor). 


anyway, I felt it was easy to kick although many had horrible stories. but again, I am scripted a lot of other drugs, so that surly helped. 


since being off GABA for the last 2 weeks I feel "normal". as if nothing has changed. just yesterday I took 4000/MG of GABA in the morning and had a good day. not sure if it was a GABA good day or maybe it was just a bit more sunny than it has been around here in MA; its been snowing/raining the other day was a beautiful, sunny day. so maybe the GABA changed the weather that day, lol.

Yeah I never had a hard time coming off of gabapentin, nothing like benzo's IME though I don't doubt others suffering. This drug is weird when I first started taking it, it felt exactly like alprazolam to me, then it changed to kind of feeling like being stoned off THC and drunk at the same time with shutter vision which I find super unpleasant.

I've had positive experiences with Gabapentin in the past. I tried a few times when I first got on MMT

and noticed a strange effect even before taking my daily methadone dose. It must be different for everyone

because my sister was prescribed the stuff and had no interest in it whatsoever, didn't seem to 'feel anything'.

I suppose I'm one of those types that do, lol. For me, it is a somewhat speedy yet strangely relaxed feeling. Not

so much 'high' but more sociable and it seemed to synergize quite well with opiates, or synthetic opioids anyway(Meth)

curious about gabapentin bioavailability - apologies if this has been answered or if it happens to be a foolish question -


i read some anecdotes stating the best way to optimize gabapentin  bioavailability is to take the drug in small incremental doses approx 45  minutes apart. also read something about taking it with a high fat  meal. what is considered a small dose? 300mg - 600mg? 


assuming this info is accurate and its water soluble; 


a good way to take this med would be to dissolve it in water, pour into  milkshake, then proceed to drink the milkshake while eating a peanut butter  sandwich - correct?


thanks

You are talking to a gaba junkie and I've been on it for about five years now unfortunately. Its a hella dependency for me and I get terrible withdrawals even when making small cuts/tapers. I've taken it many different ways, but after five years this med doesn't effect me the same as it once did. 


Are you taking it therapeutically or recreationally? I think you are overthinking it a bit tbh. I do stagger my doses sometimes if i am feeling extra anxious. I have a whole bunch of issues but this is the only med I take for them. I usually take the 900 mg all at once and im fine. Sometimes i stagger but sometimes I don't have the time. I know that's considered a waste to some but it works better than 600 mg at once for me. 600 mg at once will wake me up at night bc of wd. fun stuff. 


A small dose would be 100-300 mg.  Medium dose 600-900. high dose - 1g or more. with no tolerance 6-800 mg would be sufficient. I am prescribed 900 a day now but have been on 3600 a day. Didn't do much more for me on the higher dose, but I always took it all at once. It is water soluble. 


45 min might be ideal but 15-20 min works fine. You will only get a buzz for the first couple weeks but mainly the first few days. I don't think that's related to absorption just how it works. don't worry about the meals so much but it might work better. but even if i take it all at once im fine. 


After 5 years i get a buzz now but for a long time i didn't. not the same buzz tho. 8(

in my experiance taking them all at once works better than waiting. I once popped 10 in a day but didn't feel "higher" the more I kept popping them. but after you take them your stool will be more relaxed too if you know what I mean ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

no problem. 


I think its a good drug and I can't deny that it helps me a lot. I get no side effects but I think it has affected my cognition to some degree but I've been on it five years. 


You should know that it does have a pretty shitty withdrawal and some people have a really hard time coming off of it. Can be as bad as benzos. Some describe it as a combination of opiate and benzo withdrawal. It is pretty bad for some people and I've known a few that have suffered for over a year. Some people don't get withdrawals. But it all depends on how long you've been on it and the dose you were on and your own individual biochemistry. I would take breaks to avoid dependency if I could do it over again. I get totally destabilized if I cut my dose but I have other issues going on but i am pretty seriously dependent on it.  I do think it works well for me though so Im not trying to scare you but i think thats something people should know. bc withdrawal from these drugs can be serious shiz that can take a while to heal from if you are unlucky. sometimes it takes longer than a couple months. 


It can deplete magnesium levels as well. I would supplement with magnesium glycinate or something with a good bio availability. they both are calcium channel blockers and they can compete. you don't want to take them at the same time or it will mess with absorption.   


I do think it is a good drug but I just wanted you to be aware of that.

Gabapentin has a fucking nasty dependency for sure. I ran out last month with this silly idea that I could just replace the gaba with kolonopin. Yeah that didn't work out so well and I ended up having to calling my doctor for an early refill. He of course had no problem with this as he keeps saying "gabapentin isn't abusable". lol

I posted this in it's own thread, but figured the major "gabapentin"  thread would get more coverage


Ok, long story short, I had a MILD addiction to Oxycodone variants for like a month period. I WD'd and and got clean, but thought I could chip away at once a week. well, I found out the hard way that once you're hooded you're pretty much alway hooked if you take doses too close together. I noticed I took 3 doses in a one week period and I kick started some mild symptoms (pretty much confirming I can't ever take opiates again)... I don't have it bad at all since it was very mild symptoms. just some nasty full body RLS that has been frustrating (since monday night)... I took some flexeril monday and tuesday and they worked like a charm for RLS but made me foggy as hell. I forgot I had some gabapentin lying around (300 mg pills) from my old doctor and started on a "2 in the morning, 3 at night" regime yesterday and "BOOM" all RLS signs gone till today when they crept back (and I took 2 in the morning to ease those away). my question is... how long should I take the gaba for? I DON'T want to gain an addiction to those cuz I hear the rebound symtpoms are NASTY... basically should I quit after 4 days use? 7 days use? etc... and should I taper off after the 4-7 days down to one pill a night or just quit cold turkey? I like that they fix my RLS so that I can function in teh day and sleep at night, but under no circumstances do I want to trade another addiction.

No, you will not catch a buzz off of only 600mg if you've been on them for 2 years. I've been taking them for 12 years, and I have to take at least 7 or 8 grams at once (on rare occasions) to get high on it.

I was originally scripted 900mg/day gabapentin for anxiety and akathisia. first few days felt more relaxed, less anxious, then nothing. went up to 1800mg/day ...nothing. I started to try and get off of it after 2 weeks on it since it wasn't helping my anxiety and although my overall impression of the withdrawal wasn't crippling I couldn't handle the akathisia so I went back on it. fucking akathisia. hate that shit, it fucks me up.

Can Gabapentin make you black out if taken while intoxicated? Not pass out but still be walking around and conscious? I did this recently and i fear my roomate might of slipped it into my drink, but i found a baggy of them stashed. I don't do anything asides from drinking and i am in good health, even had a full mri and ct.

I don't think so either.  It's not known for being amnestic.  And gabapentin tastes fucking awful.  Horrible.  You'd probably know if somebody put some in your drink.  Especially at the amount it takes for it to even have an effect, let alone an amount that could *possibly* lead to black outs when combined with alcohol.

I was dopesick and had these as a safety net. I took 3.6 grams right away and an hour later I was set straight. Smoked some weed and went to the gym, when just two hours early I was hugging the toilet.


Held me all day and I woke up around 7am dopesick again. Staggered this dose and took 1.8 grams at a time an hour apart. About an hour or so later I started getting these weird brain zaps and jerking motions like my brain was skipping a beat. This has happened before if I take gaba for more than one dose subsequently, but I don't have a choice because it's all I have to hold me at the moment. I almost fell on my ass and nearly spilled water all over my laptop. My arms just jerk and I can feel my muscles doing it in my legs. When it happens your entire body just skips a beat.


Anyone else ever get that from neurontin?

That sounds like myoclonus.  At high dosages gabapentin inhibits GABA release and activates low voltage gated calcium channels and can become convulsant.  You're lucky you didn't have a full blown generalized seizure.  


The 1.8 grams you staggered was a MUCH higher dosage than taking the 3.6 grams all at once due to the bioavailability issue with gabapentin.  You should be more careful with your dosing if this has happened to you before as it isn't safe and can and will - eventually - lead to seizures and hospitalizations.

Sheesh, yeah that sounds right. It felt like it was close to a seizure. I've never staggered doses before, I guess this is proof positive that it does increase bioavailability bigtime.

Yeah, if you took say 300mg every half hour, what it does is allow the full amount of the dose you take to get absorbed, so in theory, the full 3.6 grams would get absorbed.  Now if you took it all at once it's bioavailability would allow it to only absorb around only 33%.  The dosage you took isn't a lot.  Which makes me wonder why you're getting those effects at such a low dosage, as a lot people do dose upwards of 3600mg - and that's staggered too.  You must be particularly sensitive to it.  Especially since you only split it in half and took 1.8 grams all at once, an hour apart.

theGirlWithBlueHair, has brought up an excellent point (very nice). 

According to [www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myoclonos/home/ovc-20166171](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myoclonos/home/ovc-20166171) , myoclonos can be anything from hiccups to epilepsy(a metabolic condition) or a reaction to a medication.

Now that I know what it's called, I've definitely had myoclonus before. I get it sometimes if I get forced awake and don't get enough sleep. If I'm really tired it happens sometimes. I guess I am just vulnerable to it.


EDIT: Tramadol made this happen once too, now that I remember. Maybe its a serotonin issue?

It's quite common surrounding sleep activity.


Tramadol is quite notorious for causing seizures.  It's activity at the 5-HT2C receptors is what mediates this, so it's likely it's definitely serotonergic with tramadol.  It also possesses noradrenergic activity on it's own though (in addition to indirectly disinhibiting norepinephrine release via the 5-HT2C receptors), and this could be an additional mechanism.


But with gabapentin, it's the "deinactivation" of the low voltage gated calcium channels and subsequent depolarizations that release glutamate and norepinephrine that are responsible for your myoclonus on this medication.

^ IWD, after reading through this thread you probably will experience weight loss in wd.


Speaking of which, I just read through this thread.  Never had gabapentin in my life before a few days ago diagnosed with shingles.  There is a nerve pain in my back that wakes me up in the middle of the night.  Horrible.  But 300- 600 mgs of gabapentin really helps.  So I have been taking it the last 5 days only at night in those low doses.  I do not want to get addicted to it, so I am hoping such low doses for a week or two let me just walk away at the end. For now I have to utilize them.  


Great info from experienced users here.  It for sure is making me very cautious on using these since I am not a long term pain patient.  Just temporarily so this thread was valuable to me in making sure I don't end up on it for years.  So far, at these low doses it really really helps with that nerve pain.  So cautious I will be.  I may not have been as cautious if I didn't read this thread.  Thanks for sparing me from some possible addiction that could have developed.

Gabapentin will not really not like to cause an addiction per se.  It is not like cocaine or opioids. It is likely to cause physical dependence Physical dependence is just a state of physical adaptation your body develops towards a drug, it is not an addiction.


But psychological dependence can happen with any psychotropic medication, as well.

Best to take gabapentin like phenibut. 2 days on and 3 days offor u run in tolerance issues and then risk withdrawal when stopping. The tolerance spoke with gabapentin is even more extreme than phenibut.

Yeah, tolerance is a bitch.


I've just kicked heroin again painlessly, all thanks to gaba and nothing else. Problem is now I'm at a week of taking gaba every day at 2g minimum daily, usually more. Thinking about ordering tianeptine or something because I need to fill that "void" with something, and my gaba tolerance at the moment doesn't make it a viable option.

I also tried up to 3000mg which caused sedation. Maybe like a low dose benzo 5mg diazepam perhaps.  But really has no recreational potential..

This is the most accurate, as far as my experiences go.  I get the 800mg pill Rx'd and only take 2 instead of the 4 I can if I need to.  I find that these help with my pain quite a bit. But I usually take them when I don't want to take my opiate medication and it really helps with the pain and the withdrawal symptoms.  Also, it will probably help to uplift your mood, I find that it can do this if you are feeling a bit down.  It is actually used off label as a mood stabilizer.  But, it is not a recreational drug and I don't think you should even try to get any type of high out of it.  K, bud?  Good luck and stay safe.

^Gabapentin is most definitely recreational. You just have to know how to dose it. Stagger a couple grams over a few hours. 250 mgs every half hour until you reach your desired dose. A fatty meal and some pop beforehand.

Nope. More like a bit of euphoria, anixolysis, pain relief, disinhibition, sociability, etc. I don't use gabapentin as I have pregabalin which is like gabapentin's brother on a large amount of steroids. That's a pretty common side effect for a fair amount of medications though and I know I've dealt with farrrrrr worse to get highhhhhhh than a bit of loose stool.... I'd post references but if you bothered to even read most of the thread you'd see many people talk about it. It's just a mix of people using it legitimately and talking about that versus people talking about it's recreational use. Sometimes a bit of both! You will get very little in the way of recreational effects if you don't take it properly. Taking large doses ends up with you absorbing very little, whilst taking smaller amounts over a period of time yields you getting much more in your system.

been on 1600MG for quite sometime (months) for anti-seizure; I also take Keppra for this. lately I have been trying to get off Gabapentin but scared of WD's. went from 1600MG;s down to 400-800MG's/day, once in the AM. do you think I will go through WD's if i completely stop tomorrow? I Have been taking a day off or two every other morning and feel a bit UGH but not sure if its mental or an actual physical thing. I have read so many different things when it comes to WD's; some people say its the worst they had and others says its a piece of cake. well, I am an EX heroin addict and have been through TOUGH WD's w/ heroin, benzos, etc. nowadays I am on 4MG Suboxone and no trouble in life w/ drugs, so I am in no rush to be sick off Gaba withdrawals. so what do you think? should I just STOP and not be worried or should I be expecting WD's?

I honestly only get withdrawals when I'm dosing high amounts for long periods.  400mgs a day may produce no withdrawal. When I was on 900 msg I had one sleepless night and it was over. Since your on such a low dose you could prob try tapering lower. Take half a capsule or tab..take with food everyone so absorption staysthe same

I know I was overly cautious with my gabapentin usage.  12 days with one dose before bed at 600mgs for sure got rid of my nerve pain, and since I am healing I don't need it anymore.  So the last two nights I went without, not even a spec of withdrawal.  Hey, there was a post by someone in this thread that said 7 weeks on gabapentin ruined his life.  That is a strong statement and since I don't trust doctors or the pharm industry I had to take a Bluelighter's experience seriously.  I think a lot of the problems mentioned in this thread was poly drug use too. But there were also people who only took gabapentin and had problems after a long period of time on a high dose.

Good job being smart with low doses. My 90 day supply of 4x 800mg neurontins just came in the mail today (360 800mg gabapentins!!) so once again begins my battle to use my meds as effectively at the lowest doses possible while avoiding withdrawal.


For me, gabapentin at the dose I'm prescribed is *extremely recreational.* I know the way this medication interacts with my body extremely well. I can't put hot sauce on my eggs, eat them with mayo, and then drink a monster energy drink with my morning dose or I'll feel like I'm on a moderate dose of MDMA at work. I've been called into HR and sent home for being overmedicated when Ive done so.


Gabapentin brings death to any and all forms of social anxiety for me. I'm an insurance agent and it is absolutely no coincidence the way my sales numbers look. Without being too arrogant here, I'm regarded as being in the very top percentage of salesman in my office and am one of those guys that opts for all the pressure, strictly commission only, and make thousands of week for the vast majority of the time. Because the gabapentin takes all the anxiety and pressure from my job away, I quite literally at times chuckle as the managers increase the Heat on us and simply produce more.


My boss is well aware of what I'm prescribed and blatantly makes sure I'm not without my medication, as while in withdrawal from it... All my sales production goes down the drain. It's almost painful to make calls and attempt to close deals: I'll have three $1500 weeks in a row, run out of gaba, and take home $250 that week.


I'm probably the most dependent person on gabapentin on bluelight, as I rely on it to the point where I need it to make a living for myself and my fiance. Here in South Florida it is very well known that it is the best thing to have in your pocket if you're in opiate withdrawal and can't get your hands on any pills or heroin. There is a thriving black market for them on the street and I'm asked literally every day at work to sell my pills, which obviously I very rarely do as I depend on them so heavily.


So anyone thinking this drug isn't recreational needs to reread what I just said ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


I would bet any amount of cash gabapentin will be at least Schedule V in the next two years.


*pops 2 800mg gabapentin*


im curled up on my memory foam king sized hamond and Rhodes bed on my girlfriends rather large breasts getting my ears played with like a cat with an erection as every hair stands up on my neck and back.


Happy gabapentin day to me!!!

^ You're experience for sure helped me chase.  So add that thought to feeling groovy on your very happy gabapentin day. :D  It really does help when people discuss their usage, dosage and possible problems as well as positives.  It was some of your posts that made me overly cautious as well as some other peoples posts.  So thanks.  Enjoy!


I am still amazed some that some Bluelighter's know more than physicians and end up helping me more.  Very valuable info.

So the last two nights I went without, not even a spec of withdrawal.  Hey, there was a post by someone in this thread that said 7 weeks on gabapentin ruined his life.  That is a strong statement and since I don't trust doctors or the pharm industry I had to take a Bluelighter's experience seriously.  I think a lot of the problems mentioned in this thread was poly drug use too. But there were also people who only took gabapentin and had problems after a long period of time on a high dose.

Crazy when you can actually reach climax on this stuff. But that is a discussion for another day haha...


Bottomline this is my "miracle med." for me the risk of withdrawal is absolutely worth it. This is my favorite medication over opiates and benzos.

To blame gabapentin for ruining your life after being on a month and a half is a little strange. It's like the people who blame loperamide for the long withdrawals when they had been on opiates for years. There are Def  a lot of factors and if anything the exaggerated stories have made my withdrawals easier because it's never as bad as it's made out to be.

I've been prescribed Neurontin 2400mg / daily for about 6 years running.  I'm coming off this medication and scrubbing a few other things off my list as well.

I was taking 25mg-100mg avg. Benedryl to sleep, sometimes combined with 4 or 8 mg of Tizanidine.  I tapered off the Benedryl and discontinued the Tizanidine as of two days ago. 


So far WD is what I would consider minor but still apparent.  I'm taking a B vitamin supplement and Mg 400mg early in the morning 2-3 hours before my morning dose.


Started at 2400mg and then tapered 300mg / day and yesterday I am down to 600 mg (divided dose).  This is what some would consider a rapid decrease but I'm experienced in quitting lots of things (nicotine, opiates, SSRI's, SSNRI's) so my take is that I taper quickly and listen to my body... if it's too hard to stand I slow down or move back up a rung until I can tolerate the WD symptoms.  Consider me not insensitive to WD's but experienced enough to be in tune with my body's reaction and know enough not to freak out at why I feel so strange. 


I expected the insomnia (it's not terrible, just difficult to stay asleep after a couple hours). 

I have had a few days where I've been very lethargic, and it's been hard to concentrate at work. 


But a strange and unexpected effect of the WD is that I have stomach pain.  A tight knot in my upper abdomen that may be gas, as it is somewhat (not fully) responsive to a dose of OTC GasEx (Simethicone).  Of course, two hours after taking Neurontin that pain also disappears.


So besides the Mg prior or well after dosing of the Neurontin, and besides Biotin (in my B- complex vitamin), can anyone offer any advice as to supplements or activities I could be doing to ease the WD's?


I'll be honest, after putting more than 5 kilograms of this into my system over the years, I am very leery of the phase that comes after the taper, when I have to come off entirely.

If I had the pills and discipline I'd stay at 400 for a few weeks. For me the withdrawal isn't intense but I get very irritated and my skin feels nasty like being dope sick or phenibut withdrawal sick.

I love Gabapentin. Love Lyrica too.


Staggering is the ONLY way to get the euphoria from Gabapentin. Also, the sweet spot is waiting 3 days between doing gabapentin....for example if you take it on a monday, you need to wait till friday to do it again to reset your tolerance. I call these Gaba-days! But yes, I stagger all day long on gaba days and it has me feeling great all day. It does not fuck you up, but you feel really good. You never want to build a huge tolerance though!

might be of no use to anyone in this thread but when it comes to opiate detox I can't speak highly enough of its superseded friend Pregabalin, aka Lyrica, - at doses of around 600-1000mg per day it crushes withdrawals & makes things much more bearable... - if you have no tolerance be careful cause it'll knock you hard for the first few days, eg: missing the doorway & walking into the wall by accident... but seriously, off label use it hammers R.L.S. & calms the nervous system tremendously plus induces great sleep to avoid the first 4-5 days of torture... - combine that with Valium, Clonidine, Naproxen & aggressive Loperamide & it'll make detox bearable... - then add magnesium, omega 3, Choline, Inositol, a high quality multivitamin, & large doses of Vitamin C, B1, B6, B12 & it's happy days compared to crapping yourself whilst shaking & shivering... - Warning, know your tolerances & be careful with the Valium & Clonidine as they will drop blood pressure & cause heavy sedation... - when detox is over & PAWS kicks in with lethargy hit the essential amino acids & get a script for Buproprion (Zyban) - a unique NDRI that targets expanded dopamine receptors to reduce fatigue/anehondia & can help quitting smoking too as a bonus... - personally wouldn't touch any other anti-depressants or anti-psychotics as they cause rapid weight gain & sexual dysfunction... (by no means am I disregarding SNRI's for other depressions ect, just not my cup of tea at all & i'm basing this on opiate addiction recovery)

Thanks for your testimony. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Actually it is of use to me as I just by accident stumbled on the withdrawal eliminating effect of gabapentin itself.  I was given gabapentin for a nerve pain from shingles but I have been reading these threads and being cautious.  I took if for a week and stopped.  Low doses, 300-600 mgs. I was too cautious and suffered another week without any gabapentin.   But then I read an article that said shingles patients need to take an adequate dose, 2400-3000 a day.  Well, I figured I'd try that last Fri.  I staggered 600 mgs 4 times over 3 hours.  Then I for sure felt the gabapentin.  Unmistakable, not placebo.  I Went to bed, slept great and the next morning (long story maintenance addict) I didn't wake up in opiate withdrawal and went the whole day not needing my usually daily allotment until way later in the day.  If I redosed gabapentin I may not have needed it.  But I did not redose and left it at that last Fri.


Color me impressed.  And if pregabalin is stronger I can for sure see it doing the same thing.  I often heard phenibut took away withdrawal but I never had it work for me.  Actually loperamide never did squat for me either believe it or not.  My body says screw that to any BBB activity that may work. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  So all these cures or tools for withdrawal have been subjective to me.  What gabapentin did for 24 hours at 2400 mgs still has me very impressed.  I am going to wait a week and try again, halfing my daily intake and go from there.  


Saying that, I am not convinced that a medication that can take away opiate withdrawal does not work on the opiate receptors. I read here gabapentin has it's own withdrawal, but to take away opiate withdrawal that much has me scratching my head.  Maybe there is activity that is not disclosed.  I was always under the impression anything that was going to effectively take away opiate withdrawal must somehow work on the receptors in the same way.  Maybe that is not true.  (although I can hear William S Burroughs shaking in his grave over that notion)

**Gabapentin overdose**


I think I took too many gabapentin about 48 hours ago. Well I know I took too many I am now at the point of wondering how my slow death is going to play out I guess. Anyway I took 30 500mg pills over a 12 hour period. So 15 grams. I didn't throw up or anything either. My symptoms right now consist of lower back pain and pain on the front left side. I also feel weak and a tad sick to my stomach. My urine is infrequent and dark colored though honestly I have peed darker before. I mean its not kidney failure dark but I can tell they are working overtime. 


Anyway if nothing else let this be a harm reduction lesson. Keep track of many pills you are eating even if your not getting the effect that you want. Especially when they are random pharmaceuticals.


So umm what do you smart folks think? I am pretty fucking scared.

For right now , just drink lots of water and try to replenish electrolytes if youve been sweating. I think youll be fine just relax for awhile until you feel better, if you get worse go to the hospital and tell them. If anything serious was going to happen it wouldve most likely happend already, water and relax. You will be fine

is it even possible to OD on gabapentin alone? i have a document of a clinical trial involving gabapentin and it mentions an incident when a male took 49 Grams. He suffered mild non-life-threatening symptoms.


> Acute oral overdoses of NEURONTIN up to 49 grams have been reported. In these cases, double vision, slurred speech, drowsiness, lethargy, and diarrhea were observed. All patients recovered with supportive care.

Yeah I just worked up the courage to google how fucked I was. Pleasantly surprised to say the least. Theres a good chance I did damage but it seems like death is highly unlikely. I swear to god my kidneys are hurting me though :/.


I feel really stupid as well. I am supposed to know better then being this dumb. My addiction to this crappy ass drug has just gotten really severe lately though.

i wouldn't feel too bad its very easy to take high doses thinking taking more will make you feel better. IME and from what i have read. 5 Grams is the **most** you should take. The bioavailability is so low on higher doses its almost a complete waste to go over that amount in 24 hours.

Are you sure it's gabapentin even?  Do they even make 500mg gabapentin pills? I thought they came in 100mg, 300mg, 400mg, 600mg, and 800mg pills? Never heard of 500mg ones..

I am 100 percent sure its gabapentin.  Its my script. Well my stomach still hurts a little bit and my kidneys are acting like they are under stress. Still feel like shit overall. I probably should go get checked out but I don't see much point really.

It shouldn't be your liver as gabapentin isn't metabolized at all and is excreted completely unchanged in the urine.  


The fact that you took them over an extended period is helpful, because it allows their half-lives to kick in and elimination to occur by the time you started taking more.

Damn drew,that shit not good for you in that high of doses, he'll if your taking that much of gaba then it may be time to take a break from the shit and let your tolerance get lower, I know with gaba that it won't take very long just like a week or so.


When u overdose on gaba you start having seizures because I've been there, he'll I noticed that I was time traveling from isle to isle without remimbering how I got there in the first place, and when your the stocker in a grocery store you need to keep up with that shit,we'll it wasn't until an hour later that I fell out,hit my head and was rushed to uab hospital. I was getting 120 800mg a month and would go through my script in less then a week. It wasn't till I fell out that I quit taking that shit for a while.


When u start to space warp and lose memory and start jerking like you have torrettes then yea man it would be wise to contact poison controll,or 911.


Hope u get feeling better buddy ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif).

just goes to show - for newbies reading every gaba thread and seeing a post or two i made about consuming almost 30 grams over 12 hours -* everyones body is different* and even the toughest of us can fall unexepectedly. for the record, i would consider my massive intake days as overdoses as well... just not to the point of needing medical attention as i was fine 24 hours later. i was twitching uncontrollably, having blurred visions/tracers/deleriant style 'hallucinations', total loss of motor skills & coordination, cognitive impairment, inability to speak coherently, kidney pain (i only have one, but its extra large since i was born with only one it picked up the slack), weak/interrupted urine stream... so yeah thats not really fun stuff.

Thanks for this CJ.

I take Gabapentin, and I do tend to try to achieve a buzz by taking 5 times my dose.

This is enough of a scare to not do it anymore.


I hope you feel better my friend.

I'm prescribed 600 mg 4 x daily and I really want to start coming off of it so I do not get nasty withdrawals.

I have no history whatsoever of drug misuse/abuse, but do have a Wiki-length medical record on file.  Yet ER folks blow me off as "nothing wrong".  They almost let my colon rupture last Fall by "sending me home" with Lactulose. smfh


It took two more trips in and a 6 day hospital stay to fix "nothing wrong".

Good post and 100% correct.  Gabapentin is excreted EXTREMELY rapidly.  I was legally Rx'ed 3,200mgs a day for years (two 800mg pills 2x a day) before getting off of it because it stopped becoming effective after the first week, and there were times where I would take heroic dosages with no reward.

It's day 5 since ingestion and I am feeling better. My lower back still hurts but my urine looks normal now. I came clean to my psychiatrist who I have an emergency appointment with tommorow. I am praying he allows me a slow taper. 


In closing this stuff has a wide safety margin as far as dying goes. However it seems as if I have done damage to some part of my body by taking 15grams. Be safe out there people.


Peace

I am prescribed Neurontin for nervepain, but nervous to take them. About 3 years ago I was on Lyrica 300 mg a day for the same thing. They helped me a lot with both nervepain and anxiety, but hell to come off after just 6 months. I did not experience much side effects from Lyrica exept from a bit weight gain and loss of short term memory. When I started taking Lyrica I began at very low doses, as low as 25 mg and worked my way up to 150+150. The Neurontin is 300 mg and I'm adviced to take them three times a day. Are both Neurontin and Lyrica about the same when it comes to side effects and effects? I am scared shitless to throw up ? I only got Neurontin because I can't afford Lyrica and have to give this a try. Not looking to get high, but from what I can read most people do ? Just want to ease the pain without feeling drunk, high or get nasty side effects. Please help?

I want them to ease my pain in my lower back and neck. Can't use much other stuff as I am reacting with side effects from many painkilkers. I am a CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 person..... Can't do SSRI, SNRI either due to 5HTTLPR (SCL6A4) 

Just want to know from anyone who have been using both if the side effects are the same. Since I tolerated Lyrica, will I tolerate Neurontin just as much?

**Nuerontin dosing**


Nuerontin is a great recreational drug.  I take it for anxiety and bi-polar.  Works wonders if I take it as directed.  SWIM discovered taking a large dose first would bring on a super chatty and energizing buzz.  The dose would be 3200 mg.  It takes like 2 hours to kick in but last all day if you take 800 or 1600 every 3 or 4 hours after your 3200mg dose.  The downfall after like two days of doing this the buzz goes away(tolerance).  On the flip side to that if you don't take any for like 3 days you can re- dose and get rocked again.   I have a hard time deciding if I want to do the as prescribed or dose every 3 or 4 days.  This is a on going battle every month.  I didn't know eating increased the absorption till today trying that now.  Peace.....

This is a little bit old, but I'll chime in. Gabapentin (Neurontin) has a wicked broad therapeutic index. I'm not proud to say this, but I've taken grams upon grams of Gabapentin in single outings on several occasions, either due to tolerance or the intensity of my Opioid withdrawal. Myself and others are limited in our intake by the fact that acute overdoses of Gabapentin - of Pregabalin for that matter - can and do cause some pretty intense, non-epileptic, convulsive activity, ranging from loss of motor control, to full body spasms and flailing sometimes resulting in injury.


For this reason, it's a good idea to not overconsume Gabapentinoids like Pregabalin or Gabapentin, but aside from these side effects, which seem to effect only a minority of the community, these drugs are relatively safe. They're even believed to be essentially safe when combined with CNS depressants (Opioids, Benzo, Alcohol etc.), contributing in only a minor, if any, way to respiratory depression. This argument, with my references, is part of what got me my Pregabalin prescription, despite having a documented history of pretty severe substance abuse; it's practically impossible to kill myself with this shit.


Long in a short, I'm sure OP is fine now, but, acute overdose with Gabapentinoids is definitely not in the same league as say Opioids or Cocaine, so your best bet, if you think you've consumed too much, is to let someone know what's happened, just in case something does go wrong and if you notice a marked increase in negative symptoms, perhaps consult a doctor.

May I ask why you took that many pills in the first place if 800mg sets you straight? Chasing a high? Seems excessive.

I've been taking neurontin sporadically for a year now, generally to satiate heroin withdrawal but also under the "hope" of recreational effects, although they don't happen every time. I've begun to stagger my dosage because I was popping up to 4-5g at a time and it just wasn't feasible anymore.


So I've notice that three things happen when I dose neurontin. Note that no matter what, it completely alleviates physical withdrawal. The only thing that remains is the fatigue, and neurontin can make that worse at times. Anyway, 1. I get the recreational effects. The drunk/staggering that is amplified by marijuana. Sometimes I get CEVs. This only seems to happen after a break in the dosing, naturally. 2. I get sort of high, but I get extremely jittery almost like I'm about to have a seizure. I've dropped and broken dishes before because of this. It's like my arms just jerk like myoclonus or something. I've never gotten a straight answer as to why this happens. 3. I get no recreational effects at all, only relief from WD symptoms. Upping the dose does nothing but cause fatigue at this juncture.


That's my experience, hope this helps. And does anyone else get the jittering?

Hi All,

I started using gabapentin four days ago to block GBL  withdrawal, I used GBL 24/7 around 50 Ml per day for 6 months

4 days ago I start to take 3 x 300 and 1 x 600 Mg of Gabapentin per day ( 8 AM 300 mg , 3 PM 300 mg , 11 PM 600 mg for sleep ) , The G withdrawal gone really quickly , but now I am worried to end up in the same situation with Gabapentin, is this dosage  too much ? Should I stop to take it or I have to decrease the dosage gradually ? Please help,  I am really scared to have jumped from a addiction to another 


Thanks

Gabapentin withdrawal seems more dependent on how long you take it for, not necessarily how high the dose is. I wouldn't worry about taking it for 4 days.... hell those dosages are comparatively tiny to the rec. doses most people mess with.

I never had any trouble with gaba withdrawal, in fact I've just taken 600mg from an old packet from a couple of years back, to help with diclazepam withdrawal. 

It was Lyrica that was a hellish nightmare to withdraw from. GP put me on a 12 week withdrawal programme and it was still hell. I can take one or two now though and they warm me up inside so nice, I'd have over any benzo. 


Giuppy, I'd recommend 1200mg for a sleepy feeling. I'm afraid they won't act like benzos or sleeping tablets...just make you feel heavy-eyed and groggy. Pop a cople of codiene too, to get you cosy.

I find that taking less gabapentin can oftentimes make me feel better overall than taking more, that is, so long as I don't continually up my dose every several days/weeks. I have a reasonable constant dose, and when I absolutely need, a small increase for a few days. Then I drop down for a few days, until in the future when I really need to take a bit more to clam down.

Update. I have experienced lower back pain along with joint pain in my ankles since the incident. I am slowly tapering off gabapentin under the direction of a doctor with the hope of being completely off it in a few months. I really feel I have done some kind of damage to my kidneys. Maybe even my nervous system? Be careful with this drug. It has a large safety margin but it seems like it will do damage in high enough doses.

I have taken up to 10,000mgs of gabapentin on a few occasions without having any I'll effects other then drunk style dizziness for up to 24 hours. I'd do like others say and replenish electrolytes and drink plenty of fluids. Maybe hit the hospital just to be safe.

This OD happened a few weeks ago and a did hit the hospital 2 days post dose and they couldn't find anything wrong with me. I just made and appointment with a new primary care doctor for next week so hopefully he can help get to the bottom of the problem or give me a clean bill of health. Thanks to everyone who replied I will update when there is something to share.

I know my user name is Gabazilla lol, but I do have a question. I currently space out my gaba days by 3 days, in other words I take Gaba on a monday, then the next time will be a friday. Can I shorten that to two days in between and still get that good gaba feeling?

Gabapentin is commonly prescribed 600 - 900 for sleep, but is prescribed up to 1200 in insomniacs or in those going through withdrawals.  I think gabapentin can be taken safely long term for sleep as long as you are only taken in once a day.  It's half life is only around 4-5 hours, so it won't be in your body long enough for it to adjust for dependence to take place.


But to be safe, I'd say 4-6 weeks.  Then taper off by 300mgs every couple of nights, just to be safe.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

prescribed 2700mg of Neurontin and 300mg of Lyrica. I enjoy them both. Think i will save the Lyrica for Sunday. I don't take it every day for the simple fact that I dont want to get a huge tolerance. Thankfully I have insurance and so I only pay about 10 bucks for both scripts combined

Been pushing it a bit much the past few days. I've been using heroin intermittently all Summer and weathering dry spells with neurontin 300s. Came down with a brutal flu/cold sorta thing 4 days ago, had no money and no prospects and nothing but a bunch of neurontin and weed. Dosed like 4500mg two days in a row spread out throughout the day. Got a decent buzz the first night and second afternoon. Hitting the brakes a bit today, gonna try and taper back down. 


Problem is I've somehow convinced myself that I need at least 600mg when I wake up every morning, otherwise I'll feel like dog shit. I don't even know how much of this is mental, but I had no problem stopping abruptly back in early July when I used tianeptine for a few weeks...

you have to space out your dosages of gabapentin. Take 150 to 300 mg every 45 min. Otherwise you are wasting it

One time I got a myoclonus jerk so hard from gabapentin.  I was laying on a blow up mattress,  I jerked so hard I flipped the thing over with me on it.


I too would like to know the cause of these jerking movements...  Sometimes I get them quite violently. Anyone know?

Lots of physical and psychological problems that haven't let up, and were not present in any capacity prior to taking gabapentin.

How dgoes gabapentin's half-life play into withdrawal? You'd think with such a short half life it would be intense but short, however people complain of issues for weeks.


I used sporadically over the Summer to allay opiate withdrawal, although I tried rec doses a few times. If I can go 24 hours without withdrawal, does that mean I should be in the clear? Because I only took 300mg yesterday morning and I don't feel sick, at least not yet.

I had no idea of  the benefits of Gabapentin until I was prescribed it a couple of months ago for nerve pain. I'm already on Oxy, but that doesn't seem to help the pain from nerve damage in my right leg (I've had 3 hip surgeries, 2 of which were replacements). Anyway, Gaba doesn't mess me up the way a high dose of Oxy does, but it definitely helps! I do find it works best if I take a week or so off every month so my tolerance can drop, but I've never noticed any w/d, and I usually take up to 1800mg/day. I do like the mellowing side effects, I must say. I know everyone responds differently, this is just my experience. I can say that the nerve pain is much more noticeable without it!

I don't have gabapentin experience but I do have almost 3 years of daily pregabalin.  Lyrica is said to have  a half life of 6 hours which I don't think is correct but either way the  w/d is painful  and can last for months. If you haven't been using it daily for at least a few weeks I wouldn't think that you would have any withdrawal other than maybe an  increase in anxiety for a few days.

When I was hooked on gabapentin,  and I got WD symptoms,  I noticed the most noticeable ones were: sweating,  SPACINESS, confusion,  nausea,  and anxiety/panic attacks, and nightmares when sleeping. It didn't last very long though, and went away within several days,  but the anxiety/panic attacks stuck around for quite a while until I got my script refilled. 


I am now very careful with them,  I only take them as needed,  and sometimes don't take any for several days at a time.  And those days I don't take any I don't notice any WD symptoms.

I've had withdraws from gabapentin and lyrica. I went through depression a few days from each drug. I like them both for my neuropathy but running out of them sucks. Gabapentin is a little rough on my stomach but it works great on nerve pain. A good dose of lyrica makes me want to fuck.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

After I had a grand mal from mild benzo WD I was prescribed gabapentin. I'm now on 900mg daily and don't do near as much rec drugs as I used to, not even weed. It keeps me nice and levelled.

I'm taking this again to mitigate tianeptine withdrawal. The myoclonus jerks are awful. I can barely function and I've fallen on my ass twice. I flung a water bottle across the room jerking. Hate this side effect.

Nothing near you. Maybe 300-400mg a day at most. I didn't give the WDs time to take full effect so I honestly don't know how bad it would be. I preemptively started dosing neurontin as soon as I finished my last dose. Columbus Day means I won't get my package 'til tomorrow, so I'm scrambling. 


Never taken phenibut, but I'm sure it would help. Neurontin is working, I can function, but my head still feels kinda foggy. I guess that might be the antidepressant side effect of it.

I have taken 20,000 mg of gabapentin in one dose.  Using 800 mg tabs.  It used to make me fly. I believe that tolerance goes down 9% for each dose.

**Gabapentin Headaches**


So I've been getting a decent amount of relief from my Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome symptoms from gabapentin, taken at night to help with insomnia and resulting fatigue.  But the past three nights I had a headache every time, about thirty minutes after I took my gabapentin.  I also noticed that the headache came on each time after I started masturbating (sorry for the TMI, but I think it might be relevant) and I looked up sex headaches, which is apparently a thing.  This morning I also have a similar headache.  I'm hoping that the headache is not related to the gabapentin but I wanted to check to see if that is a common occurence.  

It was on the back of my head on the right side where I felt most of the pain.  It went away after one ibuprofen if that gives a good estimate of how severe.

Is this something that's possibly a dangerous side-effect of gabapentin?  Or is it more likely a coincidence?  My dad has migraine syndrome (I think?) which manifests not only with migraines but with all sorts of minor headaches etc...  Maybe I'm just genetically prone to headaches with varied triggers?

What should I do?

If you find its 100% related to the gabapentin then switching to lyrica helps and has less side effects plus its stronger. I switched from 2800mg of gaba a day to 300mg of lyrica a day. I feel way better. but I take it for anxiety.

I've heard that lyrica might be better and i'll definitely be sure to bring it up with my doctor.  wouldn't it have similar side effects to gabapentin though?

It does have similar side effects but if the headaches are unbearable on the gabapentin you're gonna want off it I presume; so what do you have to lose by switching to Lyrica. Ask the doctor and see what his/her opinion is on the situation.

They're not unbearable yet and are easily relieved by a low ibuprofen dose, I'm just concerned that it might have something to do with this med, because it's been so helpful to me otherwise with so few side effects

You might be better off just riding it out, and not changing your med if that isn't ruining your life. Way the pros with the cons and decide for yourself. Any substance that causes a depression of the central nervous system has a side effect of possible headaches, just something I have found through out the years.

*I've taken all of the nerve meds available... Pregab, Gabapentin, Neur, Lyrica, etc. Lyrica is by far the most effective imo. Helps both my anxiety & nerve pain more than the others have. Even recreationally. We're talking 12+ years of pain/nerve med trials, so I've had em all. If you can switch, give it a shot. *

i'm definitely coming around to the idea that they might not be caused by the gabapentin, because I have them while not on the gabapentin which has a short half-life and i shouldn't feel it in the AM

but it's kinda weird that I have daily headaches when I never did, so I'm kinda worried it may be the gabapentin.  I'd talk to my dr about it but i'm worried that we won't be able to find a suitable drug to treat ptlds since gabapentin was one of the simplest, most well-tolerated meds

I'm prescribed gabapentin 600mgs 4x daily. At most, it takes away about 20% of my nerve pain. So, obviously I am a little underwhelmed with it.....but, it's the best nerve pain killer that I've been prescribed...so I continue to take it.


But recently my AWESOME pain doctor(who truly cares about my health) started a whole new "section" in his pain practice.....Ketamine infusions....OH MY GOD it fucking works 1000% and lasts a couple weeks(at least for me, it varies from person to person....for some people it lasts a whole year). I simply go to my doctors office and sit in a nice comfy armchair and they put an IV in me and give me an infusion of ketamine for about an hour. It makes you trip balls and feel AMAZING euphoria(like you would expect from pure medical grade IV ketamine) and then I have someone drive me home.....very easy. 


....I highly recommend Ketamine infusions. Maybe you can find someone near you who does it. 


Good luck,


jB


*WARNING....the ketamine acts like a truth serum, except you just spout shit out without anyone having to ask you questions.....so be careful if you are more on the private side*

I don't think that my insurance will cover ketamine.  I'm also treating fatigue and insomnia (from post treatment lyme disease syndrome) more than pain honestly.  the gabapentin has been helping my insomnia for sure.  and i still get dreams/REM sleep so it seems like its not fucking with sleep architecture too much

its not that hard for me to source reasonably pure k and just do it.  I would love love love to get ketamine infusions under medical supervision as i am sort of a hypochondriac and always prefer medical grade stuff, but I never have anything like 300$ kicking around.  I'm in school and my work study money is mostly spent on food

I just checked the rules and it's just drug prices that aren't allowed, so I guess it's alright. 

The price of a ketamine infusion would be a 'drug'  price, but imo it's not a problem, so all is well ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**sublingual gabapentin**


Yes I know it would taste disgusting, but would gaba work if taken sublingually , and be safe?  Oral takes hours for it to start taking effect. Does anyone have any scientific knowledge about how this ROA might work? Can't find anything onine about it.

I have no idea.  With a dosage of 1/2-1 gram, or more, that is quite a lot of powder to keep under your tongue.  I suspect with your saliva glands pumping you would end up swallowing it anyway.  Maybe you could shove it up your butt?  I am sure at least 3 bluelighters have tried it that way before.  Anyone else?

Gabapentin is fat soluble, and as mentioned above, you would have to put a large amount under your tongue to even get an effect.  I dont believe it would work too well sublingually, but im sure if you tried, you would eventually get high.

I simply go to my doctors office and sit in a nice comfy armchair and they put an IV in me and give me an infusion of ketamine for about an hour. It makes you trip balls and feel AMAZING euphoria(like you would expect from pure medical grade IV ketamine) and then I have someone drive me home.....very easy.

That's wild as hell a doctor jumped from gabapentin to K. I've only had it one time for several days at the hospital, but that was after major surgery.


I was definitely tripping in hospital bed thinking NCIS was an amazing show but the high wasn't as..."special" as the other times off the street. Just saying, anyone who thinks they're going to get into a k-hole will be disappointed, but it's miles ahead of gabapentin lol crazy.

First of all the infusions are not an attempt to get you high. They are meant to be treatments for nerve pain(among other things) and so the goal isn't to get fucked up. I also highly doubt the doses of ketamine you got in the hospital were the same as I received during my infusion. The ketamine is being used for 2 totally different reasons in those scenarios.


Secondly...I found that the ketamine infusions actually were VERY potent and noticeably stronger than the street ketamine use I've used(which was quite pure and strong enough to cause the "k-hole" effect). For example, for the majority of my infusion, I felt as if I were traveling between and throughout different dimensions and worlds....into the past and forward into the future. In, my opinion, if it were any stronger, I don't think I would have enjoyed it. 

My doc said that 9 out of 10 patients having infusions pass out the whole time(which I witnessed during my infusion...the lady being infused next to me)...but I was fully awake the whole time...I just may not have felt like I was currently on planet earth. 


*My doc didn't "jump' me from gabapentin to Ketamine. I'm still prescribed the gabapentin, it's just the health benefits from the ketamine infusions are too good to pass on. I also had complete control over whether I wanted to try the infusions or not.*

You're not going to be able to hold that much powder under your tongue. Gabapentin is loads more bitter than xanax.

James Brown: Sorry if I came across as critical, I was just shocked when I read your post that it was being used for therapy. The thought of someone using K to supplement gabapentin was baffling to me, but you pointed out they're separate things.


But you're right, I have no idea what grade ketamine or dosage I was ever on. They had me on slow drip at hospital and on the street it was in a glass vile chopped up out the microwave, so I just sniffed it, I was told they were either cat or horse tranquilizers. 


And I see your point, on the street I couldn't even see the TV much less follow a story line for NCIS, I can get people not liking that.


But hey, I'm glad it's working out for you, sounds like you have a lot of pain and a cool doc, good luck with your pain management.

I'm trying to kick tianeptine so I got some gabapentin, and this shit is kicking my ass again with the jerking (myoclonus). I took around 3 grams yesterday to get a good start before the withdrawals hit full force, and took another gram or so at 3 am. I fall back asleep and wake up jerking like mad. I threw my water bottle halfway across the room and spilled it everywhere. I can barely type. Anyone else get this when they take high doses?

The same happens with kratom and opiate withdrawals. Clonidine helps to get sleep. Also tapering an opiate habit makes it easier though you need to be precise about dosing and timing.

I have 3 questions about gabapentin;


Would breaking apart a 300mg capsule and using the powder sublingually be stronger or weaker than popping them as a pill? 


How does it synergize with benzos? Is it just a strong potentiation of the benzo or a totally different feeling? 


And can it be mixed with Cyclobenzaprine and still feel euphoric?

I have never felt anything even resembling euphoria from gabapentin. But maybe that's just me?


Also...I have been taking gabapentin with benzo's(temazepam and clonazepam) for years and I have never felt any sort of potentiation. 

Right now I am on 600mg 4 times a day. Although I have been on different doses over the years.

Okay, so


I've been taking Gabapentin for the past 5 years, on and off..

but only during times that involve heroin withdrawal 

and the subsequent PAWS symptoms.


It is a magical substance, in my opinion, 

in that it totally kills RLS symptoms, 

the hot/cold flashes, 

and nervous anxiety that accompany opiate withdrawal..


It has no side effects that I would consider "bad".  

Even the withdrawal from it is very easy, when weaned properly.  

(I do not recommend daily Gabapentin unless you need it.)


Now, because of said experiences, 

I have also had it available for recreational use - and let me tell you, 

I really like it.  I really like how a small amount can be used

to *augment *a situation, for me.  

Instead of getting irrevocably fucked up,

I can get a smooth, even buzz from it and not have a crash, or any such thing.


This is NOT a drug that utterly consumes you 

or really *forces* the high - like Heroin or even Alcohol.

But I believe it can be psychologically addictive, especially if used daily

(daily use would include physical addiction, too)


In low/moderate doses (300-1200), Gabapentin is an excellent booster for my social interaction, and even studying.

At 1200mg, I get a warm glow and feel relaxed.  If I'm in a social situation, I even get hyper, jokey, and enthusiastic.

If I'm at home and not interacting, I just feel really chill.  Like the feeling after a good meditation session.


At high doses around 1800 and up, I get the above mentioned effects but much heavier and 

followed by some unccomfortable sedation. 


I once took around 3600 once, when I was kicking H. and had no money..

It suffices to say that I felt similar

to times I had chugged a lot of vodka...

 I felt shit-faced, and while it took away

my withdrawals, I did not like that feeling.


Lyrica - I took two 50mg caps once, while at work.  HUGE mistake.  I was so fucked up I couldn't even write my evening report

before leaving work.  I had to call a friend who lived nearby to come write it out for me. lol. 

It was like high-powered, no-nonsense Gabapentin.


Potentiation - Gabapentin takes a while to kick in, for me.  

About 2 hours to fully feel it.  

So I experimented and found 

that taking it on an empty stomach helps, with water 

- followed by a cup of coffee 10min later 

- followed by a cup of coconut milk 30min later. 

(Not sure why that helps, but that is my routine.)


Kratom - on certain days, I like to do the above routine, 

and then when I drink the coconut milk,

I add in about 3g of Maeng Da Kratom.  

That usually results in a very relaxed, happy, warm feeling.


Ginko Biloba - I take this at the coconut stage, if I need to study 

or am going to work.  Super clear thinking. Add Kratom and I get that plus energy.


It really just depends on what I'm doing when I decide to do this.

That factor determines which supplements I will take with it.

If you have any questions about this, PM me.


Take care, be careful.

After reading through this thread... I did a few tries:

First time: took six 100s, took three more every 30 minutes, until I took a total of 1500mg

Results: mild "drunk" feeling, quite a bit of dizziness and clumsiness (could NOT) find my footing, then weird extremely cool visual hallucinations when I closed my eyes-- like I was above ground flying through trees, looking down at the landscapes, it was all passing so quickly that I could feel my eyes looking down to try to focus on what was soon passing.


Second time: started with nine 100s, took three more ever 20 minutes, until I took a total of 2000 (Ran out)

Results: Completely out of my mind- spent about an hour applying layers of makeup and trying to "contour" my face (I typically don't fuss with makeup), went to town cleaning my apartment (something I NEVER do), spent A LOT of time bonding with my cats (quite enjoyable), and time-took-so-long. Not in a bad way. It was like I had all the time in the world to do whatever I wanted. Did have balance issues, pupils were quite dialated, and eyes were blood red (could be bc I didn't sleep a wink). 


Now I'm just upset I told my pain management specialist that it did nothing for my pain ... Seeing some value in it now...


Good luck!

All I know is I have post thrombophlebitis syndrome and psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. The pain NEVER ends no matter what. I take gabapentin, soma, Norco, cymbalta, remicade infusions, and prednisone to relieve pain. I do not get a 'HIGH' from any of it. At times I wish I could. I can tell a difference in my pain when I miss taking the gabapentin that's for sure. Hope this helps someone somehow.

My first day I took 1000 mgs and loved the rolling like speddy feeling. Moved up to 1200 the next day and 1500 the next. Chasing that initial high but nothing could compare to it. So my fourth day I did research and took 2000 mgs but this time I staggered dosses by a half hour each. It hit my like a tom on bricks. So high listening to music than playing ps4. I ran out and got a script a week later and am back at it. I have repeated the process and am up to 2000 mgs. Tonight I will take a staggered does of 2500mgs. Does anyone know if taking 2000 mgs+ of nuerotin for a week or longer is that dangerous? I have not really experienced and bad side effects. Just feel loopy in the morning.

**Dosing Question For Gabapentin After Short Tolerance Break!**


So I've been taking Gabapentin the last two weeks. First few days, I took 300mg a day, few days later 600mg a day for about a week, and now I've taken 800mg a day for the last 3 days.


Overall haven't been on Gabapentin long, but my question is, if I take a 5-6 day break from it, would I be able to handle one 800mg Gabapentin for my first time again for close to a week?


I started creating a tolerance and now want to give it close to a week before trying again, but am nervous to start with 800mg. That's all I have too.


I can start by breaking it in half to make 400mg and seeing where that gets me, but if it doesn't seem like enough and i take another 400mg, I'm afraid that'll also be too much due to bioavailability being stronger with low doses every 30-60 minutes.

So I'm a little conflicted here. Any suggestions or advice on this matter? Or do you think 800mg would be just enough considering that's what I was just doing for little time.


Im at 22 year old male weighing around 155lbs if that helps any.

Everybody is different. I've been put on gabapentin a few different times. 300mg, 3x p/day. The last couple of times I experienced extreme euphoria quite unlike anything I've experienced before that lasted well into the next day. This went on for about a week each time perscribed. Now I was extremely clumsy and forgetful as well. I build up a tolerance to drugs very quickly and that is definitely true with gabapentin and many users. To this day I wonder why it hit me like it did. I have an autonomic disorder and my body often reacts abnormally 2 most things. Maybe that's it?

People are pretty naive on the topic of Gabapentin. Some think it's similar to benzos, others think it's a potentiator for opiates, both are false. As it applies to opiates, Gabapentin increases bio-availability for certain opiates, it does not potentiate their effects. As far as being comparble to benzos, in high enough doses it can produce an effect similar to a benzo trance, but isnt related to benzos in any conceivable way. What gabapentin will do is potentiate other drugs like Meth or MDMA, drugs that affect GABA lvl's in the brain, hence GABA-pentin.

I should add that when used as a potentiator for substance like meth, the combined effects can be

deadly. I do not condone or advocate the use of that drug for any other reason than for what it's intended use is. To do otherwise is dangerous and reckless, and if you consider it, get to a mental health professional ASAP, as there is something seriously wrong with your nugget.

Be careful with gabapentin guys, it's not this super safe drug without side effects there's no such thing as a free lunch in nature you always pay to play .

I thought I could gobble gabas as long as I want and just taper quit whenever , I took 300 mgs some days some days 2-3 grams mostly 300-900 mgs a day . 

I quit it took 2 weeks to feel 85% and the hell you go through the first week is insanity. 3 weeks to feel 95% with another week of that 5% left making you feel slightly depressed and emotional

Wow. I have had a COMPLETELY different experience with Gabapentin. I could/can take significantly more mg's/grams a day for long periods of time and stop cold turkey with absolutely zero WD symptoms. I'm guessing that's just me though since I also seem to be the only person who has never gotten ANY sort of "good" feeling(other than slightly less nerve pain) from Gabapentin at all kinds of dose levels. Just more proof that each person really is unique and responds to different medications in different ways.

I take 900 mgs. of Gaba 3 times a day for severe nerve pain in on the bottom of my feets. It works, but I don't take it until I'm done with my morning percocet buzz for my knees. It seems to mess that buzz up in a bad way and I take 50mgs of the perc. I've tried to get high on the gaba just because I have tons of it around here, but nuttin really happens, even if I parachute 20 or 30 of the 300s. The Gaba is starting to not help my foot pain too, so would it be practical to ask my Doc (he's pretty obliging) to change it to the pregna stuff that people seem to enjoy much more. I doubt my ins, would do Lyrica as it's a name brand. I only pay 1500 bucks a month for ins. for the wife and I (I'm retired), so I get the shit dope, hell I can't even find Watson these days.

I have done a lot of research and a lot of experimentation with Gabapentin. So, here's what I found: I used to take 4.2g-4.8g, starting with 3 600mg pills and spacing the dose out every 30 min. after. This got me that desired euphoric, energetic but calm, clear-headed, numbing effect that I desired. I always took with soda. However, what I found is that I can get the same effect on much lower doses. After trial and error, I found that if I take Aleve (or something similar) 30 min before my first dose, I can start with 300mg then space out that same dosing for about 45 min each time, while drinking soda. I do this until I have reached 1200mg and then I eat well and I can get very similar effects to that of my 4.2-4.8g days. I can also take some more but it seems like the intensity of each one isn't as strong as the previous ones, though it does increase the effects a little bit. Remember, this thing takes a while to kick in, so give it some time. Usually I peak at 2-4 hours and then stay that way for about 12 hours. Tolerance will build up quick so I try to wait 24 hrs after the effects have worn off before doing this again so that I get similar effects every time. I have never had any negative side effects or withdrawals from this and I have been doing this routine for about a half a year with only 2 week breaks every 2 months. Remember, everybody is different, though. I will continue to experiment and post again if I find something new that helps lower dosage or increases the effects. Have fun and be safe in whatever you do.

Gabapentin potentiates the shit out of benzos. In my experience, taking benzos with gabapentin is almost the same as taking twice the amount of benzos by themselves.

I take suboxone, and clonopin with gaba. When I would run out of my xans. It would actually give me more energy, and better social skills, then xanax. When I ran low on my xans, U would replace it with clons and gaba, and it worked well.

I take gabapentin for nerve pain and oxycodone for break trough relief for degenerative lumbar discs. If you're looking for the ultimate buzz using your gabapentin prescription, this is what I have come up with after some serious trial and error with gabapentin dosages and percocets. 

Large and small.

Staggering a gabapentin 300mg dosage once or twice per hour works best for me. Start the gabapentin off early in the am. Like 4am  Do that for about six or seven hours or so , then drop a few 10mg percocets on that mellow gabapentin buzz you should be feeling after using the staggering method. In another hour,you'll feel just fine the rest of the day. Just a mellow yellow buzz for hours and hours.

Gabapentin tolerance as well as oxycodone tolerance plays a huge part with this method. You can probably only do this once or twice before your body adapts to the gabapentin dosage.  And of course having a high opioid tolerance to start with may affect the outcome as well. Took me a while to get it right. Months.

Experimentation  and dosage adjustment until you get it right.

Gabapentin tolerance happens extremely quickly. So as I said, this only works once or twice until you have to stop the gabapentin for a few days if you can and then try it again. 

The dosages I used may be to high or to low depending on your own tolerances. Stay safe with doing this above all else. But once you get it right, its fantastic.

As an aside, I wanted to chime in and ask if anybody else gets myoclonic jerks from higher doses of gabapentin? Back in January, I was jonesing and ended up taking around 6000mg throughout a day and I ended up having a really nasty blackout seizure after a couple of hours of jerking like crazy. I kept falling down and twisting my ankle, etc.

I'm assuming you mean from Wigan as in the city in Manchester. Well I'm not, but here is the Lyrica/ Pregabalin Mega Thread anyway. You can also use the search engine to find plenty more. :

If you have a question about the drug pregabalin I think even a yank could help you out. If you are looking for a fellow Wigan resident that has pregabalin then you are on the wrong site as even if someone were to help you out it is against the rules and would be shut down quickly.

I've had to put down a drink (just soda, no EtOH) after spilling it several times but could still walk and talk. Sometimes cannabis makes it worse IME. I was on about 5 grams IIRC. It was transient as well.

Slightly new to Gabapentin...I've noticed tiredness and a crash-like feeling few hours after staggering about 1200-1800mg.... Would Taking MORE gabapentin lift me up or make me crash harder?

Potentiate might not be the right word, but many people enjoy using them together. I always preferred either one or the other. But that was how I felt about combining carisoprodol and opioids - I always felt the Soma's buzz killed the opioid buzz. To each one's own.

It can help out some of the weaker stuff like codeine or trams but with say Oxycodone I prefer the speediness alone an save the gaba for the comedown.

Definitely stagger these boys. Every 30 mins or so with an aleve or two and a carbonated drink, coke, whatever. Plus high fat meals also add to the effect.


Naproxen Sodium increases absorption 12-15% and believe me it's noticeable. But most importantly staggering every 30-45 mins will give you a much greater effect instead of swallowing 2400 mg at one time.


As far as effects go, I would describe it like being drunk motor skill wise, but your brain is still fairly clear. On higher doses, I notice some things are more vibrant and music tends to sound a lot better. Booze will make the high really sloppy though, try to limit it to just a beer or 2.


On the potentiating/synergistic side, tramadol has a fantastic synergistic effect, although if taking large doses is recommend a benzo of some sort, either a 1 mg alprazolam or preferably a 1 or 2 mg clonazepam goes really well. Just wanna keep an eye on that seizure threshold.


Only cons I've really noticed is like what has been posted in earlier threads, tolerance builds extremely quickly. It's best to maybe dose for a day or two in a row, then wait a week. Keep that tolerance at bay and let your mind reset.


I've never noticed much withdrawal, especially on a methadone/heroin withdrawal level, not even in the same fucking realm lol. Maybe a slight bummed out feeling, but you won't be in the fetal position, dry heaving and shitting your insides out like a cold turkey 180 mg methadone withdrawal....*shudders* lol.

Hey, everybody. I've been reading posts occasionally for years, but decided to register and finally post something myself. The reason is Gabapentin. I'm totally knew to it and literally just got it and took a bunch. WAY more than recommended by almost everybody. I did so because the amounts suggested for Tramadol weren't enough for me to get some kind of "high," but when I took a TON it was kinda great; mentally, physically, etc.....I only take prescriptions obtained legally......no illegal drugs for me in almost 15 years; not because of moral reasons or whatever.......simply because I just never wanted to buy them anymore and risk being arrested. Anyway, I thought the same would be the case with Gabapentin as it was with Tramadol. I took 4500mg an hour and 30 minutes ago and I feel nothing so far. I'd be so disappointed if nothing happens, but life goes on. Anyway, should  I be patient? Is it possible that ALL other prescription drugs that could make you kind of high actually work for me, and do, in fact, accomplish that task, but Gabapentin is the lone exception? I'd really feel welcomed and that registering was worth it if anyone had any thoughts, comments, responses, etc......and, obviously, extremely grateful, appreciative, and interested too. Thanks.

Is the question that you took 4500mg of gabapentin and 30 minutes later you're not feeling anything? 


If you haven't taken gabapentin before, that is a good enough of a dose to get a feeling of how the drug affects you. Some people don't find anything particularly enjoyable or significant about gabapentin. If one has a tolerance to stuff like benzos or alcohol then there might be something like cross tolerance. 


Wait some more to see what happens. It can take a little while to really kick in sometimes, or at least for the effects to be noticeable (going for a walk can make the effects more obvious). Keep in mind gabapentin is really nothing like tramadol, so don't expect the same kinds of effects.

Thank you. One of the things you you touched upon is EXACTLY what my primary concern is.......can my unfortunate high tolerance to several other prescription drugs (benzodiazepines, opioids, etc....) be rendering Gabapentin essentially ineffective even though I have never before even taken this drug? It's now been 1 hour and 45 minutes since I took it.......still nothing. Thanks again though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Wait a second.......it's just over 2 hours.......something mild is happening......I'll be patient as suggested. I've read people saying it can take 2 hours. I'll give it all day........I can't help but wonder that even though I took 4500mg that maybe it just still wasn't enough......I should have doubled that (ha)......kidding but kinda serious. I probably would have but things that I've read other people write dwindles my courage.......I understand though; people write with good intentions and don't want to see other people hurt themselves. Nevertheless, I'm naturally still very curious if there is anyone or if anyone knows of anyone else that has taken a MASSIVE quantity of Gabapentin to get high? And did it work? Was it successful? Thanks for any response

I agree with you, toothpastedog......I'm not expecting much recreationally at this point. It's been 2 hours and 15 minutes now and it's so mild that I'm not even sure if it's real. It's like getting ripped off buying fake acid in high school and you and your friends think it's kicking in for like the first hour but nothing happens (ha)

I think you're misinterpreting what I'm saying and my intentions. I'm not looking for attention; I'm looking for information. I've never taken Gabapentin before, I took a lot earlier, and I thought it would work.......and it isn't. I was just asking people with experience and knowledge of the drug if they had any thoughts. I'm not sure what's unusual or obsurd or offensive about that.......odd reaction there, but no big deal

Oh........just reread and realized that post wasn't addressed to me; it was meant for someone else. I'm new to this. My bad. Anyway, last thing to say about my disappointing endeavor into Gabapentin. In moronic desperation, I took 2400mg more of Gabapentin and, also, added 12mg of Xanax just now (cause I saw that several people recommend that)........I took more and added Xanax just in case there's still a chance of me having the great day I was hoping for......I guess I'm not ready to surrender the fantasy (ha)

Hey Shawnsheen, Welcome to BL. Gabapentin can be a very subtle drug, where it really shines is aiding in withdrawal from opioids and to a degree benzos IMO. The transporter system in your GI tract/ gut responsible for absorbing gabapentin is easily saturated by high levels and will only let so much into your bloodstream at one time. Anything over about a gram /1000mg during any 30 min period will just dose your toilet. While eating a little protein & fat and/or taking Naproxen sodium (Alleve) can help, the best method is to just take some in a stagger, every 20-40 mins. Also taking four+ grams at once can cause unpleasant diarrhea IME. Personally I prefer 800mg every 30mins, it takes about 90 mins to start reaching full effect and lasts for a few hours depending on stagger time. Your mileage may vary.


On a side note be careful when taking "tons" of Tramadol. It carries the risk of seizures in doses above 400mg. No bueno.

Thank you so much to Jekyl Hydrid and to Nicholai. The information was abudent, and it's obvious you guys know what you're talking about. Sincerely, thdnk you for taking the time to share your knowledge. Also, thank you to Nicholai for the warm welcome. I also really appreciated the fact that you said that I get the type of day I was hoping for.......that was really cool. Anyway, I would love to tell you both that things worked out but the did not ![☹️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2639.png). After I took another 2,400 mg and 10 mg of Xanax in hopes this might work.......it did NOT. In about an hour after that I fell asleep for six hours straight. No high, no fun, disappointing day........I'd love to tell you it worked out, but it didn't. If I'm smart, in a few days, I'll follow the advice given to me by both of you (Jekyl Hydroid & Nicholaii) and maybe that will result in the pleasant high, great mood, and peaceful day that I was looking for............anyway, everything you guys said benefits and informs me........I know more now than I did before.  I'm grateful ![✌️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270c.png)

I took 2 300mg gabapentin and waited around 20 minutes, popped another, waited 30 minutes and popped another, its been an hour and i still feel nothing. This is my first time trying them and thought spacing them out would give them more time to disolve. I weigh around 160, should i continue to wait or???

No that's a good stagger, you might want to eat a snack or have a small glass of milk. As strange as that sounds Gabapentin is treated like an amino acid in your system and fat/ protein actually helps with absorption as well as naproxen sodium. After that if you still don't get much out of it you might have to accept that it's not going to do much for you. It's a strange drug and in some it can be very mild compared to benzos or opioids. If your daily regimen already contains other gabaergic meds then I would feel even more certain about the previous statement. Give it some time but don't be disappointed if it doesn't rock your world.

Oppie1025, I leaned literally today that the most unique thing about Gabapentin is that you can literally take too much, and it actually makes it not work at all. I'm new to Gabapentin, and if you read my posts from earlier today I recorded what I took, when, and the result. I took 4,500mg and it didn't work.......several hours later I took 2,400mg and Xanax cause I hear that might help achieving the desired high. It was a huge mistake. I took all of those and just fell asleep for 4 hours.....,no high, no fun. However, around 11pm, my ridiculous, dangerous, and stupid Irish stubbornness kicked in and I was like, "F" it! Screw it! Do I took more, but this time Intook 2,400mg on its own with no Xanax. The calm, relaxed euphoria I spent all day trying to find has FINALLY arrived mildly.........just 12 freaking hours too late. Anyway, there are a lot of people writing and responding about Gabapentin that know WAY more than me. BUT, the one thing I can swear by is that if you take too much it becomes legitimately null and void........for whatever reason it did not work at all. Most drugs the more you take the more fun you have.......Gabapentin is fussy, difficult, and strange. Nevertheless, I will make another attempt with it at some point. There are, in deed, great stories many about people having great times taking it. Thus, my advice, although I'm probably not that authorized to really give advice since today was the first time I took Gabapentin too. Despite that, I am convinced and can almost promise you, that Gabapentin require kinda strick ways to take it. Plenty of knowledgeable people claim they know the secret" (ha). Some are probably right. Anyway, the only DEFINITE thing I can add is that more does not mean better. There are certain amounts of Gabapentin that work and other's don't. I suggest a little adventure to find the most honest, experienced, and knowledgeable  person you can find. There is the correct way to take it and you get a nice euphoric high; I've been around people on it......trust me, they're having fun. Lastly, a reminder, and this is the one thing that a Gabapentin rookie knows for a fact.,,,,,,,,taking a TON of it, specifically, I took throughout  the day, a total of 11,400mg.......and only right now I feel slightly sedated, calm, and comfortable.......but still not high. I hope my mistakes help you out. Best of luck, amigo

I woke up, took 2400mg and pretty much got what I was looking for with the Gabapentin (sort of). No euphoria, unfortunately, but I am in a great mood. I shaved, showered, put on some nice clothes, and had that "ready to face the day" feeling. Look, I'll take what I can get (ha). I'm a writer.......,,..specializing and focusing mainly on speech writing, on assisting high school kids with the writing portion of the SAT, and helping high school kids with their college essays, as well as helping college kids with their essays to get into graduate school and medical school. I only mention this just because it's important that I have a positive "let's start the day kind of attitude" when I meet with clients........particularly because my clients are scared, nervous, and feel like they're under a tremendous amount of pressure. Did you guys know that valid and legitimate studies tell us that the second most feared thing by Americans (after death, of course) is, in fact, public speaking? I mention this because it's very important that I exude a calm, relaxed confidence in these situations..,,,,,and I'll be honest, prescription drugs help. Tramadol is the BEST for that.....,I save it for the highest paying jobs......that will usually involve assisting someone running for office or a retirement speech from someone who ran a large and successful company that has anywhere from hundreds to thousands of employees. I also take a TON of Xanax and even opioids on rare occasions. To be perfectly honest, I'd like to take illegal drugs, but I'm too scared to get in trouble. Being arrested for buying drugs would make a TON of people not hire me.......so I get all my prescription drugs from generous doctors. Anyway, I got off track. Like I said, I'm in a great mood, but I am angry that I wasted all that Gabapentin yesterday. From reading what different people wrote, it seemed like toothpastedog and Jekyl Anhydride seemed to have interesting ideas. Jekyl Anhydride seemed to have a real systematic approach that he thought would breed success with Gabapentin. I'll pay attention to the things he said and hopefully says again.......maybe they'll work for me! Toothpastedog shares the same skepticism I have........the thought that, "hey, it just might not work for you"........he seems to know what he's talking about and is probably right, BUT, I'm not giving up yet!.......which is probably stupid. I'll look for suggestions from Jekyl Anhydride, and any others with suggestions on how to take Gabapentin and, well, essentially get high.......

Shawsheen, go back a little in this thread and look for my post on March 16th. Keep in mind, I'm 5'9" and 160. However, that tactic has worked well for me, haven't found a better way to do it and I love the stuff. Like I said in my previous post, everybody is different, so you may not get the same results but I suggest giving my method a try and see how it works out for you. Look forward to hearing how it went.

Indeed they do, I do in fact.  Not as such, it was prescribed more as a "please leave my office" thing, but I continue to take it since it's done more for me than years of sertraline/Zoloft or booze have done.


Script is 600mg x  3/day.  Typically I actually take 2400mg/day, which means I run out before the month is up.  I pretend that I do this intentionally to prevent tolerance from developing.


It is quite good for my run-of-the-mill social phobias, and the more general angst about life.  I don't really get, and don't know, probably wouldn't help with, acute panic attacks or nasty cases of agoraphobia or anything.  In fact, it's so glacially slow it would probably be one of the last to be recommended for attacks.


If you want to be say, more talkative at the company picnic and seem sober, really just 1200mg works (no tolerance) for me, and probably less is still effective.  

That's definitely the threshold for that "sense of well-being" some people call a "high" and get the kids all excited about.


Of course, some people fall asleep at 300, and others don't react at all.  It is a strange one.

Prescribed  600mg 3x daily for chronic paresthesia, anxiety, and insomnia. I do find when I take it as prescribed, my anxiety goes down and I'm a bit more chatty and alert. It doesn't do jack for the paresthesia, unfortunately. My wife says I act drunk on it, may be so. In large doses, gabapentin does have an intoxicated feeling, but it is not pleasant. Would rather drink alcohol. 


There is side effects. I do not like the drowsy, limbs feel heavy feeling. Honestly, not a fan of this medication. Remeron did more for anxiety, I plan to go back to it.

Is there cross tolerance with Benzos?

Na i was dissapointed getting only 100mg because I have to eat more whereas if I had a bigger dose it would save me money. 

What is the duration & how long does it take to kick in? 


Is it anything like Lyrica because I have had Lyrica in a massive dose cant remember how much but it felt like i was drunk i was literally bumping into walls when walking.


Ive also read a few reports of people getting seizures from Gabapentin.

I haven't read of gabapentin use itself causing seizures. It's a pretty benign medication. The withdrawal from it if you become dependent might lower the seizure threshold, but using it doesn't seem to. Unlike pregabalin, where higher doses can cause a seizure. The subjective experience of pregabalin and gabapentin have a lot in common though.

Type in google 'gabapentin seizures' and you will see lots of reports of people having seizures and not just from withdrawal. 


On another note: I took 1200mg with 2mg Alprazolam three hours ago and feel a bit relaxed. Dont know if it made me more social as im not in a social situation.

I admit I haven't and probably won't do that search.  Just look at the URLS to these stories, or at the ads on the page, and you'll get an idea.  I think class-action lawyers copypasta random drugs and diseases to find clients. 


Gabapentin and pregabalin are both anti-epilepsy, reviewed: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114206/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114206/)


A survey of epilepsy specialists in 2017: "Compared to the 2005 and 2001 surveys, there was increased preference for the use of levetiracetam and lamotrigine, and decreased preference for the use of phenytoin, gabapentin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine."


But then, *high doses* of lots of things might cause a seizure.


Haven't tried pregabalin/Lyrica, but my understanding is they fixed a lot of the kinetics problems.  Meaning it's more potent.  Otherwise same mechanism.


Your gabapentin experience would just be a bit milder than the pregabalin, and take three hours longer to happen.  BUT it's whole lot cheaper, at least. 


I don't know why food would come up.  I don't get munchies or anything.  You do not have to eat weird things with them, or anything at all.

It is hardly guaranteed, but a high enough dose probably could lower your seizure threshold. But that would be a massive dose, exponentially higher than what one would normally be tolerant to. Pregabalin gets into issues over 600mg, but gapabentin doesn't seem to get into particularly dangerous territory even at 10,000mg. 


If one was already prone to seizures or has had them before, I'd suggest being caution just because it is the smart thing to do. But from what know about gabapentin it isn't a significant issue like it is with something like tramadol or pregabalin.

Yeah, Mr. Dob, these things don't cause seizures at any level, unless you mixed with other drugs or had a seizure disorder already.  This includes gabapentin and pregabalin/Lyrica.  


The exception is tiagebine, which is what you were taking when you had your seizures.  Overdoses of that are associated with seizures.  It works in a completely different way from gabapentin and pregabalin and benzos.


So: 

Tiagebine OD: seizures maybe

Gabapentin OD: no seizures

Pregabalin OD: no seizures

Benzo OD: no seizures

Lamictal OD: no seizures

It's a damn shame how quickly tolerance builds to this med. I make sure to take days off, but if I do it a few days in a row, I end up needing a ridiculous dose to get any kind of high. Like today, I've taken about 6,000mg, which is an insane dose. After I've taken a break for a week or so, I only need like, 2,500mg. How fucked up is that? Tolerance to gaba builds so damn fast! And I wish I could find a doc who'd be willing to give me a ketamine infusion for my nerve pain, but I doubt I could find one, and even if I could, at $300 or so a shot, there's no way on God's green earth I could afford it!

I totally agree, it really amazed me how tolerant I became so quickly to gabapentin. I went from needing only 800mg to get all the desired effect to 4g in a matter of weeks. Towards when I stopped needing to use gabapentin I was sometimes taking 20g a day. And I never used it frequently enough to become dependent or have to go through withdrawal, only tolerant. Never experienced anything quite so dramatic regarding tolerance, not even opioids.

Do not snort them, awful burn, awful drip, awful taste and it does not do anything more than just swallowing it would, plus you have a heap of powder in the capsules and would end up with atleast 5 fat lines to do..

Gabapentin has generic manufacturers now and is relatively cheap and being unscheduled, receiving multiple scripts wouldn't be overly difficult. I went through a similar dose escalation like Toothpastedog and while I didn't quite reach 20g I was way up there for 8-9 months and payed for it with a rather prolonged nasty withdrawal syndrome that cost me a pretty cool friend on this site. Although I wasn't using it at first and did have a years worth saved up or my habit would have been more conservative.


 Point being it really does build tolerance insanely fast and I get more out of it by using it in week long spurts but I'm not using it for herpes zoster neuropathy or anything like that.

I was only taking those kind of insane doses/binges occassionally mind you. With insurance the stuff was super cheap, although I can't justify those kinds of doses any which way.

Really. 20 grams of Gabapentin is insane. At those doses, is the high the same as on Pregabalin?

The high from that dose is essentially the same as a "more reasonable" dose of like 4g, only point of taking so much is tolerance. And even then the effects aren't particularly strong. I tend to prefer the effects of gabapentin to pregabalin though. Side effects of high doses of pregabalin were rather odd and uncomfortable (and high doses of pregabalin are more like at and over 900mg, not multiple grams), whereas I didn't notice any similar degree of uncomfortable side effects with those unreasonably high doses of gabapentin.

Without a tolerance that should get you pretty good. At least as far as gabapentin' effects go (some find them more pleasurable than others). Avoid driving or otherwise operating machinery. I never found capsules or parachuting to make a different FWIW. And give it a good few hours to fully kick in before you adjust your dose or add something else.

I tend to find it made a bigger or more noticeable difference with doses on the more moderate side (that does apply to this situation though). But that is always a good idea with gabapentin, very true. Most medication IMO actually (not all of course, but I find a lot of pills tend to irritate my gut, and a little food can help a lot with that).

Clinical trials have shown that your system can absorb 1,600 mg at a time but 800 is probably far more efficient. 30-45min windows seems to be what the consensus says and IME works well also. Just remember it can take 2 hours to fully hit and that a lot of people get plenty out of 300-900 mg.

Gabapentin is an anti-convulsant prescribed for those with seizures and restless leg syndrome, among other first-line uses. I am prescribed for the off-label use to treat anxiety, but it's completely different than benzos. In terms of heightening its effect I'm not positive, but my initial thinking is that any way to augment it is very mild, or perhaps, psychological. I have tried snorting it, and have loaded up on it, but it honestly wasn't much different in feeling than taking 300-600. I wanted to get off klonopin and replace it with a non-controlled substance, and it's really worked for me. So if you're looking to get "high" off it, I don't find it really works that way. But, if you need to calm down, or mellow out, it really is a great, safe, way to get that.

I get it for free lol.  800mg pills, a bottle of 90 per month.  Insurance.  However my insurance would not cover Lyrica like that and it would be insanely expensive.  I don't take the gabapentin anymore, maybe a couple times per month I'll take 200mg and I'll feel it and it will help with anxiety and depression.  I had to go through some withdrawal because I was also taking 10,000+mg per day for a while.

So I've been experimenting with gabapentin over the last three months. Between 2014 and may of 2017 i used various benzos medicinally and recreationally. 

Tolerance to gaba like drugs is a bitch. This effected gabapentin efficacy tremendously. 


Today I took 1800mg total staggered over about an hour and a half about 45min after dinner. about two and a half hours after dosing I felt very warm in my face and a slight headache but nothing that resembled euphoria, I actually started to get intense cravings to drink alcohol, but luckily I didn't give in to them. 


About three and a half hours after dosing I smoked a tiny bit of pot and ate some protein and bam... I started to feel the more positive effects, mood elevation, sociability etc, but nothing that was major... just a subtle feeling good. 


As I write this it's been roughly 6 hours since I dosed and I feel slightly energetic but not anxious.

Conclusions: gabapentin is a strange drug. The come up takes forever, and one has to really plan their day around taking it to achieve the desired effects at the right time.  I'm interested in exploring higher doses but I feel the effects are too subtle to have any meaningful recreational value if taken alone. I really suggest smoking pot with it

I took a two month tolerance break and I’m disappointed in the outcome. Now my buzz is milder than before the break. I take naproxen, drink carbonated drinks, eat food, and stagger dose 300mg every 30min till I hit 4,800 mg. What happened?

could you give us an idea of how you are reducing your gaba intake?

Sometime in the last 9 or so months my doses went up from 1800-2400 mg area to now roughly 4800-5000/day. 

Since I realized how awful I feel I have cut down just whenever I can bear to--- meaning it's random

 Some days I can manage at 1500 mg. Other days I take none at all. Other days I take anywhere up to that full 5000. I believe I estimated one day I used 6000.

 The reason it's so haphazard is because I cant keep track of anything or concentrate anymore. 


Withdrawal is awful so I can't seem to just say "ew! " And walk away. I have only been taking it for 3 years. Doctor jumps it up massively every time I say it's useless.

yeah, your taper needs to be regimented, you can't chop and change it or you'll feel ill.

have you heard of the ashton manual? google it and go to chapter 2. altho its mainly designed for benzo tapers i'm sure it would work for gabapentinoids also

Gabapentin acts on anxiety & depression by blocking  calcium channel-mediated release of stress hormone catecholamines (epinephrine & norepinephrine) by the adrenal glands when triggered by nerve impulses from the amygdala in your brain after a threat is perceived. A threat can be a predator near you, something remembered or something heard.

You should pop 900 mg. then take 300mg every hour or half hour until they are gone. i have read everything you said. Citric Acid is the main thing in Soda that breaks it down faster, i believe. The main rule I have seen is to take an initial large dose. then stack the doses. I am prescribed 2400 a day, I take 1200 mg in the morning and then like 300 every 2 hrs or so after that. keeps it flowing. If you did take the other 3 , you would essentially be wasting them.

> **What's it feel like?-**It varies from person to person. I don't want to tell you to go out and take 2500+mg.. Begin with a low dose to see how it effects you. I'm no MD but I can tell you that if it's your first time you should begin with 1-3 to begin with (900mg). It has the same sort of effect's of xanax, ghb, and hydrocodone. With a THC buzz. It makes me feel really dream like, and smooth high. When I take high doses I tend to drop things, and have a small twitching problem. 
> 
> **Best way to take it!-**I don't want you to go and do this to every gabapen capsule you have. I normally will empty the contents of the capsules into a square of toilet paper and parachute it. It tastes **WORST** than ecstasy/mdma! Gabapentin tastes horable!!! So be sure to swallow it before it bust's open in your mouth!
> 
> **Cool things about Gabapentin!-**There have been reports by methamphetamine addicts that gabapentin alone in doses of 1200 mg at bedtime taken for 40–60 days has been effective in reducing the withdrawal symptoms and almost eliminating cravings or desire to use methamphetamine. It also helps those addicted to prescribed pain medications and takes away withdrawal symptoms.
> 
> **Is it addictive?**-Yes, it is. it's withdrawl effects are verry similar to benzo/alocohol withdrawl symptoms. (Only after long term use.)
> 
> **So what's it feel like again...?-**Although gabapentin is not a controlled substance, it does produce psychoactive effects that could lead to recreational use of the drug. However, it is widely regarded as having little or no potential for misuse. Pregabalin, a gabapentinoid with higher potency marketed for neuropathic pain, is a controlled substance, under Schedule V of the United States' Controlled Substances Act.

  So, what would happen if I took Vyvanse with Gabapentin? I was on Vyvanse before but not with Gabapentin. Like many have described above I have felt great talkative and full of energy.....but then I was losing my tolerance. Im on 2400 mg a day, but I stupidly mess with the doses. I  have just been prescribed Vyvanse 30 mg again. Does the Gabapentin potentiate the Vyvanse or the other way around? It would be nice to hear from someone who seems to know what they are are talking about ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I tried 2,000 mg in one shot just before dinner & after 2-3 hours got a great buzz with disassociative effects that lasted 6-8 hours. No different or even less the next night with 3,000 mg.


When tripping with the 2K mg I felt wonderful & played on the computer. Definitely not for driving. Probably great for sex. I think taking anything more than 2,000 is just wasting it.


After reading comments here will try next time after eating & in staggered smaller doses over 2-3 hours.

Just to clear the air, not bagging, but I've eaten 30 300mgs gabapentin and I only weight 145 lbs. Yes I was very disoriented but no overdose. The next day kinda sucked I felt like I was drunk, and this stuff makes you retain fluid so I weighed and extra 8 lbs in the morning....But other that that I was fine.

so my first experience with gabapentin that did something was last week... i staggered 1200mgs over two hours, and was happily greeted with a high that was probably on par, as pleasant as any benzo or opioid ive ever taken. 


so ff to like two days ago, im reading all of these reports of ppl taking 3600!!!! mg, so i tried it. 


WAYYYY too much. i couldnt walk, and when i smoked weed, i suddenly could no longer even crawl or do anything... if i tried to grab an object, it would be as though i just had a stroke or something; i couldnt control my motor function. i also couldnt think... it was pretty unsettling, although my heart couldnt race. it literally took me five minutes to shuffle around to my wastebin to hurl. it took everything in me. 


once i vomited, my motor skills were back to normal, or at least back to what the lighter dose of gabapentin had me at. 


seriously, IMMEDIATELY after i puked, my motor skills and cognitive function returned. 


is that normal? why? how?

Just FYI, the point of returns-that're-more-trouble-than-they're-worth is probably above 2400mg/day.  If you're new to it and don't feel anything pleasant at that dose, you never will; if you feel good at that dose, you won't feel any better with more.  You'll just start dosing the toilet and reduce your tolerance further.


So of course I've done at least 3600mg over 16 hours or so, not at the beginning of fresh non-tolerance.  Really no added benefit, def. doesn't make me barf.


But then at the usual 1800mg, I can get higher than any prescription, abused or otherwise, that I've otherwise abused or tried, seemingly at random.  Still didn't make me barf though.  


And another but, there are people who say 100mg puts them to sleep, so it's definitely got a range of reactions*.


As for barfing and then immediately feeling better, you have gotten drunk and barfed before, right?  Or ate something nasty, fought it, gave in and barfed, and immediately felt better?  Yeah, that's how people's bodies work, nothing unusual about that.  


Your brain will actively work to make you feel terrible in order to get you to barf, since it detects some chemical in your blood it thinks is poison, and is usually right.  So besides the relief of your brain shutting up, it'll sometimes reward you with a shot of endorphins, you know, for your trouble.

But then, people say they get high on benzos, and I just don't believe them.[/td]

I like this medication. It was easy to get prescribed and gives a nice weird sweet high at about 3 grams. I've been off it since yesterday and woke up from a great sleep and took another handfull this morning. Life is a soft cartoon now. I have a dr appointment tomorrow and will try to get lyrica prescribed for obvious reasons. Say peace.

So it's pretty much undeniable that gabapentin has a downward dose-absorption curve but this gives a bit of an idea to the somewhat slow clearance. It peaks at 4800 but Several grams really is inappropriate for this med anyway.

Gabapentin works for me for about 2 or 3 days then I need a 4 day break.  I'm currently on a 2 month stay in chongqing China and here Gabapentin is sold OTC in boxes of 48 x 100mg capsules and it's really cheap. Also memantine and many anti depressents are OTC you just need to Google the Chinese name and get a picture of the box to show them.

So to make a long story short I was on 600mg?s of oxycodone a day (600mg?s) at my highest but tapered to 360 and then changed to bupe 24mg?s a day, I?m on day 30 of bupe and yesterday I was prescribed gabapentin to help with my pain. Last night I took 1,800 mg of gaba with my nightly dose of 2mg klonipin. After an hour or so I felt so good. I was amazed! After a month of bupe hell I finally got a mental brake from all the depression I was going through. This stuff was absolutely recreational for me, I played 3 tournies on pokerstars and had a blast right before the best sleep I?ve gotten in a month!! Just my 2 cents.

I'll be the first to admit my body reacts oddly to a lot of things.    Benadryl is a guarantee to put me to sleep.   Anywhere from .25 to .5mg of Xanax and I have no choice but to sleep.   Lorcet, Lortab, etc often hype me up.    Sudafed can give me a serious case of the shakes.   With that in mind I seem to be the oddball here on how long gabapentin will keep giving you a buzz.   I have a prescription for 300mg 3 times a day to help with fibromyalgia.   I rarely take it that often however as for me the positive effects plateau and then taper off after a few months of taking it.    The "seriously stoned" effect never went away.     Since the fibro has taken so much away already in what I can do physically I avoid anything that messes with my ability to think and reason since it's the only thing about the way I used to be I have left.   And yes even it has taken a hit from the fibro and I refuse to let it be affected any more.

Does this withdrawl only happen at higher doses? The honey badger who sometimes sleeps in my garbage can has gone on and off this many times in the last 6 months and is taking 600mg/day and had zero side effects when she stopped cold turkey.  Everything she's read about it says it's not addictive but it does help to alleviate anxiety and depression which may increase changes of prolonged use.  


Could you elaborate please?

I have a quick question. I've been taking gabapentin for over two months at the dose of 1800mg spread out the day. I tried to get off but withdraws were horrendous (something between a benzo and opiate detox). I thought bc I hadn?t been on too long id be okay, but no. Now I'm doing a relatively fast taper. My question is I have a bunch of keppra, would that be of any help for detoxing off gabapentin? I have kratom but that does nothing if I haven't taken my gaba does. I will get some somas for the insomnia. If I had known, I never would have start taking this.

I don't know about keppra, but I doubt it. Haven't tried Soma either but I guess it can help a bit though I have never heard of anyone...


Never had a gabapentin wd but a few pregabalin wd, in my experience they are cross tolerant though that's argueable. Best option is IME Clonidine, a hypotensor used as well in opiates withdrawal. 

I find Baclofen useful too, and then probably Phenibut should be too.

I heard someone recommending hidroxizine but I have never tried it.

Benzos and Z-drugs are better than nothing. Try not to trade addictions. And all the tapper you can do the better, I find very difficult slow tappering and always opt for a quick one, to each its own.

It definitely doesn?t lower the seizure threshold, as it?s an ANTI-SEIZURE drug. Lol. Your doctor needs to do more research obviously. 


i would also be very wary of her advice/info on anything else; whatever she says immediately do research on the anything she said and compare it to the plethora of anecdotal reviews on these sites - if a high percentage of people say the same thing about a drug, and it?s different from your doctors advice, I?d consider switching doctors if possible.

Clonidine is amazing, especially for opioid withdrawals. Makes the WDs a much easier  to cope with. 


It?s also great for sleep and one of the strongest pills to ever knock me out fast.


It?s also decent for anxiety, but only in doses of half a 0.1mg.... oh and it?s a tiny pill. 0.1 will knock you right out. 


Another good WD drug is Hydroxyzine Pamoate. Almost like clonidine but just a little weaker - it?s a first generation antihistamine but since it causes medium to heavy sedation it?s off label for sleep, anxiety and WDs. It potentiates opiates, BUT BE CAREFUL AND KEEP ALL YOUR DOES LOW AND SAFE. SERIOUSLY!


When I take Hydroxyzine Pamoate for a potentiater, it?s a 25mg capsule. I then take 1-2  10/325 Percocets, and that combo feels like I actually took 4 of the Percocets. But like I said, if you?re not opioid tolerate THEN KEEP YOUR DOSES LOW. PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

I've been on gabapentin more then a month now, i seriously dont hope im gonna be getting bad WD when i taper off. Even tho i know i should have started the taper a while ago. The combo of meds I'm on now is making live so much more functional and pleasing that i dont really wanna stop with my current dosages but guess sooner or later  (hopefully sooner) i will have to start my taper and see what happens. But so far anything is better then an opiate wd.

I've been reading this thread, and it has evolved quite a bit from the early posts. This stuck out to me, mainly because I personally had a habit of 8 80mg OCs a day, back before the OPs came out, powdered with a microplane and taken IN. You can work your way up to almost anything dose (please don't quote that out of context) given enough time. Now, what is correct about your statement is that anyone who doesn't have an opioid tolerance or even those with, but not a high one, would almost certainly die from that large of a dose. I know this is my first post here, but I've been a bluelight and erowid reader for many years, and I consider myself a psychonaut. I've always been the one who researches and tests things first, before jumping into the deep end, and this site has provided me some excellent information over the years.


I found this thread after searching for Gabapentin, which I have a fair amount of experience in using recreationally, and what I can say for sure is that with this drug, moreso than most I've run into, it really depends on the person. Not just your own unique biology, but anything else you may be on, or anything you have done in the past. For me, gabapentin is like a mild MDMA euphoria, with OEVs/CEVs, dose dependent, and I build a tolerance pretty quickly, even with escalating doses. I haven't had the time to literally read this whole megathread, but this is what I know, apologies if I'm restating something that's already been posted (I'm almost positive I am in some way)


Dosing is most effective in 300-600mg intervals, roughly 35 minutes apart, until the desired dose is achieved.

For whatever reason, high sugar food seems to increase my body's absorption when taken together.

Gabapentin works miracles for opioid withdrawals, almost eliminating them, in my case (not from the 640mg/day OC habit I spoke of earlier)

I find that clonidine and caffeine really potentiate the positive effects I get from a mild to moderate dose (1200-3600mg)

I have a much greater craving for nicotine, and it is supremely satisfying to smoke or vape once I've come up.


I'd be happy to help in any way I can, as this just happens to be my interest for the moment, and I love sharing any information ive acquired through the years. I'm really happy I finally registered, and I hope to be here a long time. ?

Gabapentin's big brother, Lyrica ( pregabalin) is an anti-epileptic drug/ anticonvulsant, and a far worse offender for lowering seizure threshold at higher doses.

This is an old post, but I want to correct it anyways. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant, and thus raises the seizure threshold.

If it burnt out neural pathways permanently then it would not be approved for long term use for epilepsy and as a mood stabilizer. We  now have data on hundreds of thousands, if not millions of persons using this drug for long periods of time - I believe this would have shown up in the data by now. I could do the research myself, if I knew how doctors would diagnose and code for "burnt out neural pathways", which is not really a thing.

^Its a gray area but some believe that, say, if you detox from opiates or Benzos while taking gabapentin, sure you have an easier time stopping opiate wd but the circuitry that fueled the addiction largely remains until it "burns out" i.e: you don't get better to the extent you would with a CT withdrawal and upon stopping the gabapentin, all the symptoms of the original addiction remain.


I'm not necessarily sure if thats true or not. And gabapentin even when it's abused rarely results in a true WD. You'd need to abuse it for a long period of time and actively be using it to mask the symptoms of another drugs withdrawal. The thing is, what I've seen  is that alot of drug users don't necessarily even realize it's withdrawal at first, they might think it's anxiety  or depression or recurring chronic pain, stress. Which if you abuse any drug enough it becomes indistinguishable from those conditions. It does make the entire process more manageable since gabapentin is cheap as chips and in no short supply and legal. If it can cause "tremors" it can cause seizures as well- I've felt this side effect with chronic dosing of phenibut and chronically dosing lower doses of alcohol for opiate/meth p.a.w.s. They feel "healing" or beneficial to be high on them because they reduce wd and side effects of long term drug abuse, but that's precisely why they're addictive. And quite frankly they're handed out like candy, I don't care if they're supposedly not addictive, noone should be taking a pill that gets them high when they're trying to withdraw for good from opiates or benzos

So I've eventually got to trying this drug this past fortnight. A brief summary of effects so far:


**The time it didn't work**


I bought some of this to help with phenibut tapering, and obviously tried to chase the high. I took 2100mg and it just kind of stopped working at some point and completely wore off (after 2-3 hours). I'm not sure if this is something to do with the absorption point somehow actually blocking the effects - anyone?


My other theory is that I basically took too much too early, so it simply stopped gaining momentum due to the maximum absorption point being reached, and then a line or two of ketamine blocked the effects. Now this might sound strange, but I have found that with phenibut a single line of ketamine can completely block low-moderate effects for the entire day. Anyway, it left me totally bored so I took some 2c-b and had a life changing experience about why I was bored. Plan to write a trip report about that, but on with the gabapentin summary. FTR, yes I did stagger my doses by 30-40 minutes and ingested fat sources/carbonated drinks.


** The time it did work**


The other day I took four 300mg doses. They were spaced by 35 minutes apart, other than the last - which was 42 minutes (I lost track of time). 1200mg in total. About 1-2 hours later I had 1500mg aniracetam & 300mg CDP choline.


What an incredible, totally functional drug experience. I have ADHD (inattentive type) and I felt so focussed and motivated, constantly thinking what to do next, in the best way possible. I went to the gym, and totally blitzed my workout, doing everything to (seeming) perfection. I took a detour to run to my field for liberty caps (psychedelic mushrooms) and my mood was just so incredibly positive and uplifted. I was totally socially functional, cracking jokes/flirting with the woman that served me in the post office, eye contact and smiles at people I walked past, stuff like that. I felt socially in a very dominant (but not arrogant) position; just well on form, basically. I remember taking the piss out of a (very sarcastic) lad I know at the gym who was standing about (again) and implied I thought he was the receptionist, which gained a few laughs at him. Everybody even clapped at my efforts!!! (no not really; honestly that last parts a joke)


The body high feels to me a bit like a just sort of low level but very present glow. I wouldn't be surprised if people are appalled at the comparison, but the body high feels like a low dose or come up phase of mushrooms or LSD. Kind of like an a-typical energetic flow. It is also comparable to a working dose of quality rhodiola rosea, and I guess it also has similarities to about 1000mg phenibut - but the body high isn't quite the same, and is noticeably different. This feels more, dare I say, organic, not at all pushy or ampy/stimmy, but somewhat stimulating and cognitively enhancing.


So yeah, absolutely quality drug. I'm on it now and it's not as powerful; the prior experience was three days ago so I assume I still have tolerance. I've taken a bit more and it started working more effectively.


It's a shame I can't do this every day, but tolerance will literally not allow that, so I have no fear of addiction (although obviously that's still a possibility). Very nice, functional drug though.


I'm interested though - I'm sure I've seen people say that higher doses feel a bit like a cross between ecstasy/being drunk. Is this correct? What sort of dose is required, because I had nothing of the sort at 2100mg.

When you take a big dose - like 4000mg, without any tolerance, it feels like a cross between ecstasy/being drunk. If you can, get the 800mg tablets they are the best for getting fucked up on.

So what's the consensus on using this for benzo or thieno withdrawal? Stuck at a mid dose etizolam with nothing but itself and gabapentin to alleviate the discomfort and I'm more inclined to rapid taper while taking up to a gram of neurontin a day. Its an anti epileptic and when I inpatient detoxed from benzos I was fed this on the side. 200Mg 4x a day. 


I plan to just ride out a week and eat neurontin 4x a day to help me not seize during a rapid taper with etiz. I never have seized yet but this is one hell of a binge I've been on say 300+mg etiz over 1 or 2 months daily dosing no breaks. With heavy near daily drinking on top.

While the gabapentin will help with comfort the effect will wain after a several days to a week as gabaP tolerance grows incredibly fast. The gram to 12-1400 mg per day at the end might be your best bet.

I would stagger 300-400mg doses of gabapentin every 30mins. It takes 2+ hours for the GP to start really working. Adding the Soma and Lorazepam will probably put you to sleep. I'd enjoy the GP and ..maybe.. take the Lorazepam by itself when the GP begins to wear off.


The Soma I'd split into 350mg doses and consume with at least a couple hours between doses. If you take everything at once you'll waste 2/3 of the GP as your system can only absorb around 500mg per 30-40min due to AA transporters.


Taking the Soma and Lorazepam at once will just put you out... if you're lucky. Without even getting into the dangers, by spacing everything out you might actually enjoy it vs being a zombie and sleeping it off on a couch.

But gabapentin works as an anti-seizure medication. For instance, if someone wants to do ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) for depression, a lot of places won't offer you ECT if you're on gabapentin because they have to raise the voltage to reach seizure level, and raising the voltage increases other side effects.

Just got my hands on Neurontin, I've had earlier experience with these, but just wondering if I mix it with some tylenol 3s and a little weed, what kind of high am I lookin at? Is is gonna be any good, or just a waste of my other goodies??

Hey man, welcome to Bluelight! We actually don't directly provide people with instructions regarding "how to get high". That's a matter of personal preference and only you will ultimately know what you want. The only way to find out is to try.

For instance, if someone wants to do ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) for depression, a lot of places won't offer you ECT if you're on gabapentin because they have to raise the voltage to reach seizure level, and raising the voltage increases other side effects.

Yeah, but Benzo withdrawal produces a different type of seizure to the type that Gabapentin control. Gabapentin does not help control Tonic-Clonic seizures - which is the type of seizure produced by Benzo withdrawal.


It's probably already been mentioned somewhere on the previous 37 pages of this thread... But, if you have a tolerance to Pregabalin.. it renders Gabapentin almost useless IME.

If I take gabapentin 3 days row on 1,5g dose/day and have 3-4 days break, is it enough not to get physically depended on it ? Going to use it for wd from opioids, but not wanting to get addicted to gabas, I use benzos on these 3-4 day breaks. Does pregabalin make you much faster physically dependable than gabapentis, so it's better to use gabas than pregs for wd's?

So I'm new to Gabapentin, this being only my second week on it. I don't have enough yet to try large doses (last week I was on 100mg 3 x a day and starting today I'm on 200mg 3 x day).

This is how I potentiate it; please let me know if I am missing anything or if I'm doing anything wrong:


Step One: I take 500mg Naproxen with a can of Coke Zero or Dr Pepper (soda's that have carbonation + caffeine)


Step Two: I wait an hour and then take: 200mg Gabapentin, 60mg Dihydrocodeine, 50mg Cyclizine, 50mg Quetiapine and 400mg Depakote and another can of soda and a tablespoon of vegetable oil (I hate large meals or greasy/fatty food so I substitute the oil instead)


Step Three: 45 minutes later, I take 200mg of Gabapentin and 60mg Dihydrocodeine


Step Four: Repeat Step Three until satisfied.

Im gonna be honest and admit i didn't read through the whole thread but my question is, has anyone ever tried the extended release of gabapentin that is dosed at 600-800mg a tab. Plus will you lose a lot of the chemical because of the poor bioavailability or does the ER version increase the bioavailability ? Im looking at dosing the 800mg ER 2-4 a day in 6 hr intervals. So anyone with exp or knowledge or insight of this would be greatly appreciated.

It would seem the short time it takes for physical tolerance to develop would make it very physically addicting?

My understanding is that the recreational use of Gabapentin is short-lived, as one develops a tolerance quickly. Is this true? I am currently taking 2,000mg-plus a day.  Doesn't seem to do anything, even when mixed with other stuff. Thoughts?

I take 600mg Gabapentin. I usually take a 2 to 3 day break from them so I don't develop a fast tolerance to them. But I can definitely feel a mild withdrawal on the 2 day mark. A bit of anxiety and sweats. I usually have a small meal with something carbonated to drink. Works every time.

That's super smart. I wish that I had the self control to do so. I'm prescribed 3200mgs a day for severe spine related nerve damage and pain. I am starting to only over take them (to catch a buzz) when I have been on a lowered dose or none for a couple or few days. I am an addict or as I like to call it, self indulgent, so the sub-conscious need to take more than I need is overbearing at times. I have suffered some uncomfortable side effects. Even  the side of my right thigh is numb to the touch, but I just don't feel that I could go without. I am in the process of improving self control or even having my husband hide them for me. But I always warmly anticipate the lovely GabbyLand.

Does Grapefruit/juice work on Gabapentin the same way it does on opioids? And, if so is it JUST grapefruit or do other citrus fruits also work, even if to a lesser degree?

For tolerance/avoiding physical dependency - each script I get is supposed to last 28 days (though I usually try and get it 3 or 4 days early), but actually lasts me about 14 days, so (even with getting me script a few days early) on average I go without it for about 10 days, once a month.

I was recently also prescribed Lyrica at 50mgs by my ortho to see if it would helped with pain more than Gabs. So, for a few days I put them aside and tried this supposedly better option. First day I was slightly nauseous then very, VERY loopy. I'm talking blah, blah, blah, look at my hand loopy. I also was not functional and productive like my gabbys do. Day 2:  function returns, nausea leaves and I have no pain. I've found the wonder pill! Day 3 and Day 4 etc etc...pain and functioning increase is felt less and less so is the nice anxiety decreasing buzz. I expect to loose these things but not so very very fast. If I must choose, I will choose my gabbys.

What was your dose of gabapentin?


I was on pregabalin 600mg/d for months until I overdid it (1.2+g/d) and got no more effects at all from it so I quit. Without any withdrawal. This brought me to the theory that higher (post therapeutical) doses of pregabalin might actually be easier to quit because of two different effects of pregabalin, first a GABAergic by inducing an enzyme converting glutamate to GABA and then later as dosage rises a glutamatergic by inhibiting its reuptake by some transporter. These two effects work against each other.


Unfortunately I can't answer your question but I wonder about whether my theory might be true and people could avoid withdrawal by pushing the dose towards the max, getting a nice trip as a cherry on top.

It seemed to last a while for me. I had jumped on gabapentin in order to get off of fairly large doses of pregabalin (900mg/day), then switched to equivalent doses of gabapentin (can't remember perhaps 1800mg a day) and then over a few months completely tapered off of the gabapentin. I was absolutely fine during the day mostly, not much anxiety etc. But at night, the insomnia was soul crushing, and it went on for months, getting either very little or in many cases absolutely no sleep. After something like 80 days of little sleep i gave up and got some phenibut. Been on that shit ever since.


I regret turning to phenibut. I should have acquired some seroquel and knocked myself out until I could sleep again.

Yes, sleep and anxiety are the only two effects that are serious. I get sudden bouts of moderate excess-sweating off and on as well as nausea, diarrhea and trembling, but I can cope with those.

I hear you on the Quetiapine.

I'm managing to bring the symptoms down somewhat by taking 50mg Thorazine 3 or 4 times a day for anxiety and 75mg of Trazodone at night for sleep.

I've deleted it because I have no prove than my own case and think it isn't safe to recommend high dosages. 


But about the conversion, it's on Wikipedia:


> However, pregabalin has been found to produce a dose-dependent increase in the brain [expression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression) of [L-glutamic acid decarboxylase](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-glutamic_acid_decarboxylase) (GAD), the [enzyme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) responsible for [synthesizing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis) GABA, and hence may have some indirect [GABAergic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAergic) effects by increasing GABA levels in the brain.[[69]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-books.google.com-69)[[70]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-70)[[71]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-71)
> 
> Click to expand...
I'm not completely sure now if glutamic acid is glutamate, I think before it stated glutamate to GABA. Saturation of this enzyme would explain why low doses of pregabalin are sedating while it becomes a stimulant in higher dosages. The other mechanism beside a2d Ca channels, GLT-1 transporter blockade is on pubmed somewhere

How did I never know of this thread before? I was gonna make a thread asking for a Gabapentin megathread and only found this when I searched "gabapentin megathread" just in case one did exist but was dormant or something.


Happy to be here and try and read through all these posts. Gabapentin is actually probably my favourite drug right now. I think maybe even more than morphine right now :/ or at least equal

VERY untrue. Gabapentin is literally an anti-seizure drug.

Wow, reading these posts Gabapentin seems to either do almost nothing for people are A LOT. I feel really lucky to be in the latter group. I wonder why some drugs are so much that way?

The only other one I can really think of is Tramadol. Personally, I get NOTHING from it even at very high doses, but it's amazing to some people. Although I do wonder if, with Tramadol, it's people who are on anti-depressants (especially SSRIs or SNRIs) who feel very little from it as I think it's mild SNRI effects combined with it's mild opioid effects is what makes it so good for some people. Like if you're mildly-moderately depressed and then you're suddenly given an opioid that is a low-key anti-depressant to boot.

Ah, the ONE negative for me with it is that it makes my myoclonus way worse (dose-dependant). I have it mildly anyway, but Gabapentin definitely makes myoclonus worse.

Gabapentin for me is more for a relaxed Half drunken feeling where pregabalin a more stimulating drunken feeling, weird. Bur both works great for me and lately when I use Gabapentin I use the ER version that works like a bomb.

I have been on and off gabapentin since 2005. At first I had a very euphoric reaction. Now, I'm on Lyrica and it barely reduces the chronic pain that I am in.  Crazy how our bodies can change !

From what dose(s) of gabapentin to what dose(s) of pregabalin?

No way a doctor here just maybe insight from experiences with these substances.

Oh brother, yes. I have a script. If you open the capsules and swallow the powder with some lemonade or something like that (as the powder tastes chemically af, like meth tbh) then you feel it within 5 minutes instead of 1-2 hours and it hits 5x stronger easily. I need 500mg when taking normally to feel anything and if I crack open one 100mg capsule and swallow the powder i feel like I took a full xanax bar.

> Hey!!!! Let me tell you some stuff about Gabapentin(Neurontin).
> 
> **What is it?-**Gabapentin (Neurontin) is a GABA analogue. It was originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy, and currently, Gabapentin is widely used to relieve pain, especially neuropathic pain.
> 
> 
>

> 
> 
> **So why was it made?**Gabapentin was initially synthesized to mimic the chemical structure of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but is not believed to act on the same brain receptors.**Sounds a lot like GHB/GBL****GHB-gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, a neuroprotective and depressant drug**&**GBL-gamma-Butyrolactone** Hmmmm.. They sound very alike!
> 
> **What's it feel like?-**It varies from person to person. I don't want to tell you to go out and take 2500+mg.. Begin with a low dose to see how it effects you. I'm no MD but I can tell you that if it's your first time you should begin with 1-3 to begin with (900mg). It has the same sort of effect's of xanax, ghb, and hydrocodone. With a THC buzz. It makes me feel really dream like, and smooth high. When I take high doses I tend to drop things, and have a small twitching problem.
> 
> **Best way to take it!-**I don't want you to go and do this to every gabapen capsule you have. I normally will empty the contents of the capsules into a square of toilet paper and parachute it. It tastes **WORST** than ecstasy/mdma! Gabapentin tastes horable!!! So be sure to swallow it before it bust's open in your mouth!
> 
> **Cool things about Gabapentin!-**There have been reports by methamphetamine addicts that gabapentin alone in doses of 1200 mg at bedtime taken for 40–60 days has been effective in reducing the withdrawal symptoms and almost eliminating cravings or desire to use methamphetamine. It also helps those addicted to prescribed pain medications and takes away withdrawal symptoms.
> 
> **Is it addictive?**-Yes, it is. it's withdrawl effects are verry similar to benzo/alocohol withdrawl symptoms. (Only after long term use.)
> 
> **So what's it feel like again...?-**Although gabapentin is not a controlled substance, it does produce psychoactive effects that could lead to recreational use of the drug. However, it is widely regarded as having little or no potential for misuse. Pregabalin, a gabapentinoid with higher potency marketed for neuropathic pain, is a controlled substance, under Schedule V of the United States' Controlled Substances Act.
> 
> Recreational use of gabapentin produces a varying number of effects including euphoria, appetite stimulation, incessant talking, physical and mental stimulation which result in varying degrees of drug-induced productivity. Diarrhea/stomach discomfort is commonly reported with heavy use.

It tastes identical to meth/ice to me and similar to mdma (as they both taste almost the same to the tastebuds).

Yea... For anyone saying it makes your seizure threshold lower aka making it more likely you could have a seizure you must be reading words upside down or subscribing to eternal opposite day. Gabapentin prevents seizures and was created specifically to do so. It DOES NOT give you seizures it prevents and stops them. STFU.

I don't know specifically what the guy you guys are responding to is talking about with lowering seizure threshold when mixing with antidepressants, but I feel like it's very, very important for *everyone in this thread* to understand that gabapentin overdoses (which is what most people are doing when they use it recreationally) **can absolutely cause seizures.** Yes, even though it is used to prevent certain types of seizures, it can cause seizures. In people who do not have epilepsy. On its own.

Seen a lot of talk about this gabapentinoid in specific.


From my years experience the best way to use it for recreational purposes is to take breaks between using and the longer the better. And to also stagger it there is a big difference in feeling it and outcome of the overall effect.


For me just a small quite line but I normally dose like this


200mg caps every 20 min till desired dose

300mg caps every 30-45mnin till desired dose

400mg  every 45 min till desired outcome.


No tolerance I would aim for 1600mg-2000mg


And also remember when you start feeling it and you think it's weak or need to dose more wait. After they all reach peak levels one after the other you'll understand why. 


Where pregabalin is all a one-off hit, gabapentin is a slow build up and then oop you fuct

I had jumped on gabapentin in order to get off of fairly large doses of pregabalin (900mg/day), then switched to equivalent doses of gabapentin (can't remember perhaps 1800mg a day) and then over a few months completely tapered off of the gabapentin. I was absolutely fine during the day mostly, not much anxiety etc. But at night, the insomnia was soul crushing, and it went on for months, getting either very little or in many cases absolutely no sleep. After something like 80 days of little sleep i gave up and got some phenibut. Been on that shit ever since.

80 days, thats insane. ive only had a taste of that, thank god. it happened to me and i was taking much less and less frequently, 300mg every couple days or so. i would get bad sleep every other night. even with gabapentin on those off nights. eventually i decided to drop the pregabalin altogether so i could maintain some semblance of sleep health. dropping it cold turkey even at that dose was something i only did once. terrible restlessness that could only be alleviated with doing cardio or benzos. lasted a few days.

also i dont see a lot of people talking about synergy but gabapentin has great synergy with lots of different kinds of drugs. its best with fairly stimulating drugs like amphetamine or LSD. when combined with stimulants it can get downright psychedelic. i had a pretty psychedelic experience on a moderate dose of NEP with like 1.5g gabapentin. makes for great landing gear but also adds to the experience, unlike benzos, which typically mostly take away from it for me.

I find Gabapentin and Caffeine (but don't overdo it with the Caffeine) have amazing synergy. Both help with each others (sometimes unwanted) effects, like the Caffeine counteracts excessive drowsiness from the Gabapentin and the Gabapentin prevents anxiety or jitteriness you might get from the Caffeine.

I think Caffeine actually *potentiates *Gabapentin, but I don't know the hows or whys of it.

Both help with each others (sometimes unwanted) effects, like the Caffeine counteracts excessive drowsiness from the Gabapentin and the Gabapentin prevents anxiety or jitteriness you might get from the Caffeine.

agree! but you just reminded me of an important discovery i made: that modafinil and gabapentin had zero synergy and actually just made me uncomfortable. so, its not all stimulants that synergize

Modafinil is not a true stimulant.

> 
> **What is it?-**Gabapentin (Neurontin) is a GABA analogue. It was originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy, and currently, Gabapentin is widely used to relieve pain, especially neuropathic pain.

> 
> 
> **So why was it made?**Gabapentin was initially synthesized to mimic the chemical structure of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but is not believed to act on the same brain receptors.**Sounds a lot like GHB/GBL****GHB-gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, a neuroprotective and depressant drug**&**GBL-gamma-Butyrolactone** Hmmmm.. They sound very alike!
> 
> **What's it feel like?-**It varies from person to person. I don't want to tell you to go out and take 2500+mg.. Begin with a low dose to see how it effects you. I'm no MD but I can tell you that if it's your first time you should begin with 1-3 to begin with (900mg). It has the same sort of effect's of xanax, ghb, and hydrocodone. With a THC buzz. It makes me feel really dream like, and smooth high. When I take high doses I tend to drop things, and have a small twitching problem.
> 
> **Best way to take it!-**I don't want you to go and do this to every gabapen capsule you have. I normally will empty the contents of the capsules into a square of toilet paper and parachute it. It tastes **WORST** than ecstasy/mdma! Gabapentin tastes horable!!! So be sure to swallow it before it bust's open in your mouth!
> 
> **Cool things about Gabapentin!-**There have been reports by methamphetamine addicts that gabapentin alone in doses of 1200 mg at bedtime taken for 40–60 days has been effective in reducing the withdrawal symptoms and almost eliminating cravings or desire to use methamphetamine. It also helps those addicted to prescribed pain medications and takes away withdrawal symptoms.
> 
> **Is it addictive?**-Yes, it is. it's withdrawl effects are verry similar to benzo/alocohol withdrawl symptoms. (Only after long term use.)
> 
> **So what's it feel like again...?-**Although gabapentin is not a controlled substance, it does produce psychoactive effects that could lead to recreational use of the drug. However, it is widely regarded as having little or no potential for misuse. Pregabalin, a gabapentinoid with higher potency marketed for neuropathic pain, is a controlled substance, under Schedule V of the United States' Controlled Substances Act.
> 
> Recreational use of gabapentin produces a varying number of effects including euphoria, appetite stimulation, incessant talking, physical and mental stimulation which result in varying degrees of drug-induced productivity. Diarrhea/stomach discomfort is commonly reported with heavy use.

That's really interesting that it helps with amphetamine cravings. I am an amphetamine addict, but im not on meth. I take Adderall and benzedrex nasal inhalers (containing propylhexedrine which is chemically similar to meth.) I am also prescribed gabapentin 800 mg three times a day as a mood stabilized, but I don't really take them that much and I'm on such a high doss that I have tons of them. I have tried everything to quit amphetamines and I can't stop no matter how hard I try. I wonder if high doses of gabapentin could help me. I usually can only stay clean for about ten days before I finally give in to my overwhelming cravings. I'm not gonna get into it but my life is really terrible. Maybe I can find some relief with gabapentin. Thanks for the info.

So the my experience with Gabapentin is that if I take 2 800mg I catch a little energy buzz. The 3 now 3more in hour, the effects will be greater and it will make my energy buzz last longer. Soda it’s the caffeine, although taking that much Gabbys you don’t need anything else. I got prescribed first for my back pain. Years later they were given to me for depression, it actually helped a little. My experience if you take just like 300mg you might get drowsy. But if u take over 1,600 gives me a lot of good energy- but you can only do that once in a while, cause your body will not react to same dosage anymore. I just take 600mg in morning for my back pain. And guys out there if u take over 600 to 800mgs it causes ED.

Gabapentin on it's own isn't what I'd call recreational. BTW using it with booze...bad idea. The doses I see people talking about taking here are wild. I take the stuff for neuropathy (phantom pain) and it doesn't work great on that. I'm prescribed 2400mg a day. 4 600s. Taking more in any fashion hasn't ever given me a fuzzy feeling. It makes my mouth twitch and limbs and makes my vision weird at high doses but thats it. Everybody is different though.

Does anyone know the bioavailability of intranasal gabapentin? Is snorting possible or effective.

Nope, ineffective.  It just doesn't have enough of a punch for there to be any noticeable difference with quicker ROA's, if you can even get grams of the shit up your nose.


There is a reason why Gabapentin is such a great "potenator".  Its mechanism of action on the α2δ calcium channel subunit would enhance the effects of most types of drugs.


I first took it in 2010, 1600mg, I loved it, felt like a mild opiate combined with a mild benzo without the blacking out.


Problem is tolerance develops in like literally 3 days, so it becomes useless on its own, but still good as a potenator.


Unfortunately i've been prescribed it for a very long time, it still helps with my neuropathy, but i get horrible withdrawals after 2 days without it.
