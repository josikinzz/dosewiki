DESCRIPTION #
 
[Ketamine Images](https://erowid.org/ketamine_images.shtml)
 
Ketamine is a dissociative anaesthetic, developed in the mid 1960's, used primarily for veterinary anaesthesiology. Although Ketamine is not used medically on humans much because it induces psychedelic episodes in patients, it is still used for some limited human applications because it does not depress breathing or circulation. 
 
 Ketamine is used recreationally primarily as a snorted white powder and for therapeutic and psychedelic use it is often injected intra-muscularly (IM). Its effects range (at lower doses) from mild inebriation, dreamy thinking, stumbling, clumsy, or 'robotic' movement, delayed or reduced sensations, vertigo, sometimes erotic feelings, increased sociability, and an interesting sense of seeing the world differently to (at higher doses) extreme difficulty moving, nausea, complete dissociation, entering complete other realities, classic Near Death Experiences (NDEs), compelling visions, black outs, etc. Ketamine is also known for being more psychologically addictive / compelling than most psychedelics and it is not uncommon to hear of users who take it once or more daily.

[Dose](https://erowid.org/ketamine_dose.shtml) #
 
Depending on the concentration, form, and method of administration, recreational doses of ketamine range from 30 - 300 mg. The dosage range for insufflated (snorted) ketamine varies widely from about 15-200 mg. With doses higher than about 50 mg it is advisable to be lying down. I.M. (intra-muscular injections) ketamine dosages are generally between 25-125 mg. Oral use usually requires more material, ranging from 75-300 mg.
 
Price #
 
sold for $50-150 USD per gram at parties & events, sold for $20-50 USD per gram for larger purchases, wholesale, or among friends.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/ketamine_law.shtml) #
 
Ketamine is illegal to possess in the United States without a prescription or license. It was made a schedule III substance in August, 1999. Prior to that time sales were regulated by the FDA but possession was legal. Ketamine is controlled in many countries.<

[History](https://erowid.org/ketamine_timeline.php) #
 
Ketamine was first synthesized in 1962 by Calvin Stevens at Parke Davis Labs while searching for PCP anaesthetic replacements. He named it "CI581". In 1965 Ketamine was discovered to be a useful anaesthetic and was first used recreationally by Edward Domino who coined the term "dissociative anaesthetic". Ketamine was used for anaesthesia because it suppresses breathing much less than most other available anaesthetics, but in the 1970's patients began to report unwanted visions while under its influence. In 1978, John Lilly published his book "The Scientist" and Ketamine popularity grew through the 1980s until in 1995 the DEA added Ketamine to its "emerging drugs list". In 1998 & 1999, Ketamine was lumped by media and legislators with GHB as a 'date rape drug' and a 'club drug' and was emergency scheduled by the DEA on August 12, 1999.

The Experience:
 
Tripping; K-ing; The K-hole
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/ketamine_effects.shtml) #
 
The full ketamine experience is somewhat different than many of the psychedelics because of its nature as a dissociative. At high enough doses, users find themselves completely removed from their surroundings and disconnected from their body and sensations. Descriptions of the experience vary, but many describe alternate planes of existence, fully enveloping meetings and conversations with non-existant people or beings, and life-revelations.
 
Onset #
 
I.M. (intra-muscular injection) Ketamine generally takes 1-5 minutes to take effect. Snorted ketamine takes a little longer at 5-15 minutes. Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, oral ketamine can take between 5 and 30 minutes to take effect.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of ketamine last approximately an 30-45 minutes if injected, 45-60 minutes when snorted, and 1-2 hours if used orally.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
[PROBLEMS](https://erowid.org/ketamine_health.shtml) #
 
Negative physical effects can include dry mouth, respiratory problems and nervousness/racing heart. Many people also experience nausea and/or vomiting on ketamine, which can obviously be a problem when taking an anaesthetics or sedatives. Supervision of higher dose ketamine experiences by a sober sitter can help ensure that an unconscious participant doesn't have problems with vomiting and/or breathing. 
 
 Two psychological difficulties which seem to come up for those who use ketamine regularly are paranoia and egocentrism. There are many reports of regular users starting to see patterns and coincidences (synchronicities) in the world around them which seem to indicate that they are somehow more important or integral to the world than others. This same sense of the world focusing on the user can also feed into a sense of paranoia. 
 
 Irritation to the bladder and urinary tract from heavy use of ketamine may occur. There is increasing evidence that frequent ketamine use (even under medical supervision using pharmaceutical ketamine) can cause short or long term pain, difficulty urinating, and other related problems.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do not drive. Do not swim. Avoid bodies of water - At least two deaths has been recorded where an individual took a bath after using ketamine, and drowned.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Ketamine has the potential to be psychologically addicting. Some individuals who use it regularly find it difficult to stop or control their own use.

DESCRIPTION #
 
The effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine are generally reported to be pleasant, though if they are unexpectedly intense, they can be distressing. A well-known effect of ketamine at higher-range doses is the "K-hole", where the user is removed from reality and set adrift in an introspective dream-like world, often involving complete dissociation, immersive visuals and out-of-body experiences. At higher doses, the user can be incapacitated and unresponsive, or uncoordinated and erratic, appearing unwell to the uninitiated eye. Nausea and vomiting may also be present. 
 
 While ketamine is not known to be physically addictive, prolonged use could be tolerance-building as well as leading to psychological dependency.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[insufflated, repeated] "[...] it was like I was pushed back a bit out of reality, making everything feel distant and even slightly unreal, typical dissociation. Everything seemed to be in a different angle, including myself. Also a certain unique visual distortion was noted, some grain and especially in the dark things seem to pull / slide in certain directions while never actually truly leaving their place. I often also physically feel this pulling and sliding too, especially if dosage increases, eventually if the dosage is high enough I will slide out of reality entirely, but this time the dose wasn't high enough for that so I would just feel like I floated around a bit, feeling unattached from my body the world and even certain parts of the mind." -- [Exp 89492](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89492)

Ketamine Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
Ketamine Hydrochloride is most commonly used as a veterinary anaesthetic. It is generally injected intramuscularly, but can also be taken orally, rectally, or snorted. Much of the ketamine used recreationally is diverted from legitimate pharmaceutical sources in liquid form. Powdered ketamine is usually the result of drying liquid ketamine. 
 
 Food should not be consumed within an hour and one-half before ketamine use, and should be avoided for longer periods of time if possible as nausea and vomiting are not uncommon. As always, it should be noted that dosages and reactions vary greatly depending on the individual. Following are charts showing approximate ketamine dosages in mg (by administration type). 
 
 
**Nasal / Insufflated Oral Rectal Intra-Muscular**
 
---
 
 
**Insufflated / Nasal Ketamine Dosages**
- by body weight: approx total
- Threshold | .1 mg / lb | 10 - 15 mg
- Light | .15 mg / lb | 15 - 30 mg
- Common | .3 mg / lb | 30 - 75 mg
- Strong | .5 - .75 mg / lb | 60 - 125 mg
- The K Hole | 1 mg / lb | 100 - 250 mg
 
 Onset : 5 - 15 minutes 
 Duration : 45 - 60 minutes 
 Normal After Effects : 1 - 3 hours 
 
 
 Powder for nasal use are produced by gentle boiling off of solution. Nasal doses are highly unlinear next to oral and IM doses. The effects are quite different at low doses. A low dose nasally will be short and much different from a comparable oral dose. 
 
 One method described with nasal use is to insufflate (snort) 25 mg in each nostril, wait 5 minutes and repeat until desired dosage is reached. 
 
 Ketamine is often used in 'bumps' or small amounts of the powder insufflated from either a specialized micro-spoon, a specialized 'bullet', or eyeballed small piles. Bumps from bullets are commonly 30-50 mg, although their size varies by size of spoon, make of bullet, and individual. Users should be extremely careful when using a new method of sizing bumps. 
 
 Ketamine dissolved in saline solution (usually at 10% concentration) is also used intranasally. Although racemic ketamine is occasionally prescribed medically in the United States as an adjunct to other pain management strategies, there is no FDA-approved racemic ketamine nasal spray product and it must be produced by a compounding pharmacy for prescription use. 
 
 Beginning in 2019, a nasal spray formulation of S-ketamine was approved in the United States for specific clinical indications.

**Oral Ketamine Dosages**
- by body weight: approx total
- Threshold | .3 mg / lb | 40 - 50 mg
- Light | .6 mg / lb | 50 - 100 mg
- Common | .75 - 2 mg / lb | 75 - 300 mg
- Strong | 1.5 - 2.5 mg / lb | 200 - 450 mg
- The K Hole | 3 - 4 mg / lb | 500 + mg
 
 Onset : 5 - 20 minutes (depending on stomach contents) 
 Duration : 90 minutes 
 Normal After Effects : 4 - 8 hours 
 Oral doses are prepared from a powder by placing the powder in a cup and pouring about 1 cm of hot water (tap should be ok) in it and stiring to solution. The remainder of the cup is filled with an acid such as orange juice. Ketamine itself tastes quite bad. 
 
 
---
 
 
**Rectal Ketamine Dosages**
- by body weight: approx total
- Threshold | .3 mg / lb | 40 - 50 mg
- Light | .6 mg / lb | 50 - 100 mg
- Common | .75 - 2 mg / lb | 75 - 300 mg
- Strong | 1.5 - 2.5 mg / lb | 200 - 450 mg
- The K Hole | 3 - 4 mg / lb | 500 + mg
 
 Onset : 5 - 20 minutes 
 Peak : 30 - 60 minutes 
 Duration : 1 - 2 hours 
 Normal After Effects : 1 - 4 hours 
 Some who choose the rectal administration route use a syringe with the needle removed. The desired dosage can be put in the syringe, inserted (using lubricant) and injected. Rectal use is similar to oral in that it has a lower peak, but longer duration. 
 
 
---
 
 
**I.M. Ketamine Dosages**
- by body weight: approx total
- Threshold | .1 mg / lb | 10 - 15 mg
- Light | .15 mg / lb | 15 - 30 mg
- Common | .2 mg / lb | 25 - 50 mg
- Strong | .5 mg / lb | 40 - 100 mg
- The K Hole | .75 mg / lb | 60 - 125 mg
- Anaesthetic | 1 mg / lb | 100 - 200 mg
 
 Onset : 1 - 5 minutes (depending on dose and injection location) 
 Duration : 30 - 60 minutes 
 Normal After Effects : 2 - 4 hours 
 It is common to have muscle pain when injecting larger doses of liquid Ketamine into muscle tissue. The pain can continue for several days if it is not administered properly. The muscle soreness can be somewhat controlled by using a very fine needle (25-29 gauge) and by injecting very slowly. Too large a needle (low gauge) is painful. Too small a needle (high gauge) is too delicate and can bend. [Thanks to 2020 contributors who have helped us improve our info about preferred gauges.) It should take 10-30 or more seconds to inject a dose into a muscle. If you feel it begin to sting, slow down the injection rate. IM and IV administration generally produce a higher peak, and a shorter overall duration than other methods. 
 
 
**I.V. Ketamine Dosages**
- Anaesthetic: 1 - 4.5 mg/kg body
 
 Onset : 1 - 4 minutes (depending on dose and injection location) 
 Duration : 30 - 60 minutes 
 Normal After Effects : 2 - 4 hours 
 Although some recreational users do inject ketamine I.V., it is uncommon to inject ketamine intravenously. It is commonly used medically for surgical anaesthesia via IV. The book 'Introduction to Pharmacology' by 'Mary Kaye Asperheim and Justin Favaro' 12th edition chapter 12. Page 107.

Ketamine and Health
 
by Erowid
 
Ketamine blocks nerve paths without significantly depressing respiratory and circulatory functions, and therefore acts as a safe and reliable anaesthetic. An overdose of ketamine will knock a person out, as if in an operating room (that's what it's used for after all). This is also likely to cause nausea. 
 
 **Contraindications and Combinations** 
 Ketamine should not be used in combination with respiratory depressants, primarily alcohol, barbiturates, or Valium. Ketamine has been used without negative interaction effects with cannabis, LSD, nitrous oxide, dextromethorphan, and MDMA, although combinations are not recommended and are generally unnecessary given the strength of the ketamine experience. It does not have a build-on effect with hallucinogens and will generally overpower other drugs. Some people use nitrous oxide during ketamine's onset and comedown periods. 
 
 **Effects** 
 Unpracticed trippers may be somewhat overwhelmed by the effects of stronger doses, although in general fear that may come up is likely to be only episodic (unlike LSD trip and other drug paranoias). Food should not be consumed within an hour and a half before the trip, and should be avoided for longer periods of time if possible. Nausea is likely and more pronounced when users try to get up and move around within the first 90 minutes after injection. A peculiar sort of loneliness can occur, so many people prefer to be with people they are close to. It is best to have a sober monitor or experienced user at hand. 
 
 **Habituation & Addiction** 
 Some people with a steady supply or a large quantity of ketamine encounter problems with habituation. One ketamine user recommends that people set a limit on use *before* ever trying it so they can have a benchmark against which to judge usage levels. Write down the limits. What do you think a reasonable maximum usage would be: once per month? once per week? twice per day? Check in regularly with pre-K usage limits and (if possible) have someone who can be confided in about use and who can act as an external sanity check. While not common, it is not unusual for people to fall into patterns of use much higher than they expected. John Lilly is a classic example of a person who ended up using A LOT of ketamine, but there are many others. Using once per day or more may also cause long-term problems. We have received at least one report of a person who used ketamine once to twice per day for six months, and a year and a half later felt that he had done permanent damage to himself, experiencing persistent flashes and streaks in his vision. 
 
 Mostly the dangers are more subtle - a type of psychic dependence on ketamine, paranoia, and egocentricism. Many people who use ketamine heavily experience a new perspective on the world which seems to be quite egocentric and conspiratorial. Ketamine can increase one's sense of connection between events, synchronicities, etc. This, when interpreted in certain common ways, can lead people to believe that external events revolve around themselves ("if that happened that way, and this happened this way, both of these things must be about me"), and then, further, that people and events are working in some heretofore unseen concert, which may be either sinister or just novel. Pay special attention to these kinds of thought patterns and ask the question: "what is most likely true" instead of "what may be true." 
 
 **Ketamine and Alcohol** 
 Erowid has received consistent reports that being drunk and then taking even small amounts of ketamine results in nausea, vertigo, and "the spins" with vomiting and dysphoria being quite common. Having an active alcohol buzz is considered a strong contra-indication with ketamine. 
 
 **Ketamine and Bladder Health** 
 In some cases, chronic ketamine use has been associated with urinary tract symptoms that can include increased frequency of urination, urinary incontinence, pain during urination, passing blood in the urine, and reduced bladder size. In several reported severe cases, surgical intervention to remove the bladder was deemed necessary by clinicians. The wide dose-response range leading to documented cases suggests that individual responses to ketamine may be idiosyncratic and unpredictable, making it unclear what level and frequency of use may lead to urinary problems. Nevertheless, frequent ketamine users may want to cut back on their use, and all ketamine users might want to moderately increase their intake of water and pay attention to even minor urinary symptoms. 1 
 
 **Ketamine and Breathing** # 
 Although part of ketamine's utility as an anaesthetic is that it does not suppress breathing as strongly as most other anaesthetic agents, it can cause some changes in breathing, including deeper, slower breathing and brief lapses in breathing rhythm. Primary breathing-related dangers with ketamine use are an unattended user inhaling ('aspirating') vomit or suffocating because they are so sedated and pain responses are suppressed. 
 
 According to a case report by Breitmeier et al., "Ketamine induces characteristic changes in breathing patterns, causing both phases of deep, less frequent breaths with brief apnoeic episodes as well as phases of sighing inspirations with high tidal volumes and an end-inspiratory plateau. The apnoeic episodes are most likely a result of hyperventilation [37]. Ketamine is also associated with increased salivary and bronchial secretion, coughing and laryngospasms combined with raised laryngopharyngeal reflex and there can be a danger of aspiration in patients who do not have an empty stomach. Its effect of increasing intracranial pressure makes ketamine less suitable for use in patients with neurosurgical intervention." 4 
 
 **Ketamine-related Fatalities** 
 While fatalities with ketamine as the sole cause are rare, they are not unheard of. 2 , 3 , 4 More commonly, however, other substances are involved in addition to ketamine. Depressants such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB or alcohol can amplify ketamine's suppressant effects on breathing and heart rate, possibly causing cardiovascular and respiratory functions to slow dangerously or discontinue altogether. In one fatality case, where the death was attributed to ketamine in combination with another dissociative anaesthetic and tranquiliser known as Tylazol, the autopsy revealed cardiomegaly (enlargement of the heart) and hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen). 5 In another case, asthma was listed as a joint cause of death along with ketamine, 3 again most likely due to the respiratory suppressant effect of the substance. 
 
 Anaesthesia-levels of ketamine in an unsecured setting could lead to a fatal accident, such as bathtub drowning 6 , 7 or suffocation. Ketamine users who are very unconscious and begin to choke or have problems breathing should be put in the [Recovery Position](https://www.google.com/search?q=recovery+position) (rolled on their side with upper arm and leg folded over, mouth so it can drain, but neck extended to facilitate breathing). 
 
 See [Ketamine-Related Fatalities / Deaths](https://erowid.org/ketamine_death.shtml) for a more in depth discussion of documented ketamine-related fatalities.

Ketamine
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Ketamine**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule III
- CLASSIFICATION: Depressant
- SCH. DATE: Aug 12, 1999
 
Ketamine was unscheduled up until August 1999. In early July 1999 the DEA added Ketamine to schedule III with an emergency ruling...which took effect August 12, 1999. Ketamine is now federally illegal to possess in the United States without a license or prescription. 
 
 
 Ketamine nasal spray was approved by the FDA in 2019 under the brand name Spravato containing only the enantiomer esketamine, as a therapeutic drug for "treatment-resistant depression. See [FDA Press Release (Mar 5, 2019) Ketamine is being studied for medical utility around the world. The medical research may eventually result in changes to the legal status. Because ketamine is an approved drug in most countries, it is already being used "off label" for treatment of depression and other indications in clinics around the world.](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-nasal-spray-medication-treatment-resistant-depression-available-only-certified)
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Over the past two years, ketamine has been scheduled in many states, and laws are pending in many more. Now that Ketamine is federally illegal, it is expected that most states will also eventually schedule it. If ketamine is not scheduled in a specific state, all prosecutions for possession or sales would have to happen at the federal level.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
In January 2016, the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended that ketamine not be placed under international control. [ [read more](https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/160215h.aspx) ]

Sweden #
 
As of July 1 Ketamine is a schedule IV (4) drug in Sweden. This scheduling happened because MPA got many reports of abuse during the spring of 2005 and MPA thus considered ketamine misuse to be an escalating problem.
 
U.K. (United Kingdom, UK, Great Britain) #
 
As of June 10, 2014 the UK made ketamine a Class B drug. See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1106/pdfs/uksi_20141106_en.pdf](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1106/pdfs/uksi_20141106_en.pdf) . Previously, ketamine became a Class C drug as of Jan 1, 2006. See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4564606.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4564606.stm) and [OPSI.gov.uk](http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20053372.htm) . The move had been expected since a spring 2004 ACMD report that recommended moving ketamine into Class C. 
 
 Prior to Jan 1, 2006, Ketamine was not controlled in the U.K. under the Misuse of Drugs Act, making it legal to possess. However sales and distribution were controlled under the Medicines Act making it illegal to sell or distribute without a license.
