## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1,4-benzodiazepines. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a 1,4-azepine.

### Background

Temazepam, like many other similar and related benzodiazepines, acts as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulator and is capable of eliciting a variety of actions including sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
.
Although the chemical synthesis of temazepam was established by 1965
9
, mainstream contemporary use of the medication did not occur until it's legitimate use as treatment for insomnia was accepted and approved later on. In particular, before temazepam saw regular prescription use in civilians it was - and still is - employed by the US military as a sedative-hypnotic medication to be taken by soldiers, pilots, etc. to obtain the necessary rest required for medical recovery or scheduled maneuvers and operations
10
. Regardless, temazepam has become one of the most frequently prescribed medications internationally and sees millions of prescriptions every year. Unfortunately, however, given its frequent use and the inherent nature of its pharmacological effects, temazepam - like many other benzodiazepines - possesses a high potential for misuse and is genuinely capable of developing drug tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction in users.

### Indication

Temazepam is specifically indicated only for the short-term management of insomnia
Label
,
12
. Furthermore, such management is generally predominantly associated with the symptomatic relief of transient and short-term insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings and/or early morning awakenings
13
. In particular, the official prescribing information for temazepam typically specifies that the instructions issued for dispensed prescriptions of the medication should indicate specifically that patients are only expected to use the therapy for short periods of time - usually 7-10 days in general
Label
,
13
. Subsequently, treatment with temazepam should usually not exceed 7 to 10 consecutive days and nor should it be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply
13
.
Some regional prescribing information also notes that temazepam may be used for premedication prior to minor surgery or other related procedures
12
.

### Pharmacodynamics

Temazepam is a benzodiazepine used as a hypnotic agent in the management of insomnia
Label
6
,
7
,
12
,
13
,
14
. Temazepam produces CNS depression at limbic, thalamic, and hypothalamic levels of the CNS
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
. Temazepam increases the affinity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for GABA receptors by binding to benzodiazepine receptors
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
. Results are sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
.
In sleep laboratory studies, the effect of temazepam was compared to placebo during a two week period
13
. The studies demonstrated a linear dose-response improvement in total sleep time and sleep latency with substantial drug-placebo differences apparent for total sleep time and for sleep latency at higher doses of temazepam
13
. Regardless, REM sleep was ultimately unchanged but slow wave sleep was decreased
13
.
Moreover, a transient syndrome, known as "rebound insomnia", wherein the symptoms that led to treatment with temazepam in the first place recur in an enhanced form, may happen on withdrawal of temazepam treatment
13
. The possibility of this occurrence is in part why long term use of temazepam is not recommended due to worries over tolerance and dependence wherein patients' bodies become physiologically accustomed to the regular presence and pharmacological effect of higher and higher doses of the benzodiazepine used
13
.
The duration of hypnotic effect and the profile of unwanted adverse effects may be influenced by the distribution and elimination half-lives of the administered temazepam and any active metabolites that may be formed
13
. When such half-lives are long, the drug or its metabolite(s) may accumulate during periods of nightly administration and be associated with impairments of cognitive and motor performance during waking hours
13
. Conversely, if half-lives are short, the drug and metabolites would be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to sedation or CNS depression should be minimal or not present at all
13
. However, during nightly use and for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop - which may also contribute to the possibility of 'rebound insomnia'
13
.
Consequently, if the drug has a very short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency (for example, in relation to benzodiazepine GABA(a) receptor sites) may occur at some point in the interval between each night's use
13
. This sequence of events may account for certain clinical findings reported happening after several weeks of nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics, including increased wakefulness during the last third of the night and the appearance of increased daytime anxiety
13
.

### Mechanism of Action

GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator

### Absorption

Studies demonstrate that between 90 to 100% of an orally administered temazepam dose is absorbed, making the medication very well absorbed
13
,
12
. The oral administration of 15 to 45 mg temazepam resulted in rapid absorption with significant blood levels achieved in 30 minutes and peak levels at 2-3 hours
13
,
12
. In particular, direct studies following the oral ingestion of 30 mg of temazepam revealed measurable plasma concentrations were obtained 10-20 minutes after dosing with peak plasma levels ranging between 666-982 ng/mL (with a mean of 865 ng/mL) presenting approximately 1.2-1.6 hours (with a mean of 1.5 hours) after the dosing
Label
. Finally, a dose-proportional relationship was established for the area under the plasma concentration/time curve over the 15 to 30 mg dose range
Label
.

### Metabolism

First-pass metabolism of temazepam is minimal at approximately 5-8% of an administered dose
13
,
12
. Nevertheless, temazepam is principally metabolized in the liver where most of the unchanged drug is directly conjugated to glucuronide and excreted in the urine
13
,
12
. In particular, the primary metabolite present in the blood is the O-conjugate of temazepam
Label
,
13
,
12
. Less than 5% of the drug is demethylated to oxazepam and subsequently eliminated as the glucuronide
13
,
12
. Regardless, the glucuronides of temazepam have no demonstrable CNS activity and it is believed that no active metabolites are formed in general
Label
,
13
,
12
. Since temazepam mainly undergoes Phase II conjugation reactions, it is proposed that it is devoid of CYP450 interactions.

### Half-life

The terminal half-life determined for temazepam is recorded as being between 3.5-18 hours, with a mean of 9 hours
13
,
12
.

### Toxicity

Manifestations of acute overdosage of temazepam, as with other benzodiazepines, can be expected to reflect the increasing CNS effects of the drug and include somnolence, confusion, and coma, with reduced or absent reflexes
Label
12
,
13
,
14
. With large overdoses, respiratory depression, hypotension, and finally coma can occur
Label
12
,
13
,
14
.
Benzodiazepines like temazepam might cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Transplacental distribution has in the past resulted in neonatal CNS depression following the ingestion of therapeutic doses of related benzodiazepine hypnotics like diazepam during the last weeks of pregnancy
Label
12
,
13
,
14
.
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk
Label
12
,
13
,
14
. Caution should, therefore, be exercised when temazepam is administered to a nursing woman
Label
12
,
13
,
14
.
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established
Label
12
,
13
,
14
.
Lower doses of temazepam, like 7.5 mg is recommended as the initial dosage for patients aged 65 and over since the risk of the development of oversedation, dizziness, confusion, ataxia and/or falls increases substantially with larger doses of benzodiazepines in elderly and debilitated patients
Label
12
,
13
,
14
.
No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in animal studies although hyperplastic liver nodules were observed in female mice exposed to the highest doses of temazepam
Label
12
,
13
,
14
. The clinical significance of this finding is not known
Label
12
,
13
,
14
.
Fertility in male and female rats was not adversely affected by temazepam toxicity studies

### Mechanism of action

Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
.
Subsequently, benzodiazepines like temazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells
6
,
7
,
13
,
14
. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution documented for temazepam is 1.3-1.5 L/kg body weight - and in particular, 43-68 L/kg for the unbound fraction
12
.

### Protein binding

It has been recorded that about 96% of unchanged temazepam is bound to plasma proteins
13
,
12
.

### Route of elimination

Following a single dose, 80-90% of the dose appears in the urine, predominantly as the O-conjugate metabolite, and 3-13% of the dose appears in the faeces
Label
13
,
12
. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted unchanged or as N-desmethyltemazepam in the urine
Label
13
,
12
.

### Clearance

Studies regarding the clearance of temazepam have recorded the values of 1.03 ml/min/kg and 31 ml/min/kg for the clearance of total temazepam and the clearance of unbound temazepam, respectively

### Actions

### Curator comments

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA(A) function by binding at the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits. Of the 6 α-subunits, only 4 (α-1, -2, -3, and -5) participate in the formation of this binding site. The above target is a collection of all α- and γ-subunits that are known to participate in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids and steroids (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). Exhibits low catalytic activity for the formation of catechol estrogens from 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2 (PubMed:12865317). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation and hydroxylation with double-bond migration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Contributes to the wide pharmacokinetics variability of the metabolism of drugs such as S-warfarin, diclofenac, phenytoin, tolbutamide and losartan (PubMed:25994031)

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Bioavailability: 96%[3]
- Threshold: 2 mg
- Light: 5 - 10 mg
- Common: 10 - 30 mg
- Strong: 30 - 40 mg
- Heavy: 40 mg +[2]

**Duration:**
- Total: 7 - 8 hours[2]
- Onset: 30 - 60 minutes[2]
- After effects: 3.5 - 18.4 hours[3]
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Temazepam** (trade name **Restoril** ) is a short-acting [psychoactive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychoactive) substance of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class which produces anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, muscle relaxant, [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) , and amnesic effects. Temazepam, like other [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , binds to specific sites on the GABA A [gamma-amino-butyric acid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gamma-amino-butyric_acid) receptor.

Temazepam is used for the short term treatment of severe and debilitating insomnia and as a preoperative sedative. Oral administration of temazepam in humans resulted in rapid absorption, a fast onset of action and symptomatic relief. Significant blood levels were achieved in 15-30 minutes post-ingestion with peak levels achieved within 30 minutes to 3 three hours. Temazepam is effective for both inducing sleep and for maintaining sleep.

It's worth noting that [the sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) can be potentially dangerous or life-threatening for individuals using regularly for extended periods of time, sometimes resulting in seizures or death. It is highly recommended to taper one's dose by gradually lowering the amount taken each day for a prolonged period of time instead of stopping abruptly.

## Chemistry

Temazepam is a drug of the benzodiazepine class. Benzodiazepine drugs contain a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring, which is a seven membered ring with the two nitrogen constituents located at R 1 and R 4 . The benzyl ring of temazepam is substituted at R 8 with a chlorine group. Further, the diazepine ring is bonded at R 5 to a phenyl ring. Temazepam also has a hydroxyl group bonded to the 3-position of the diazepine ring.

Temazepam is a white, crystalline substance, very slightly soluble in water, and sparingly soluble in alcohol.

## Pharmacology

Benzodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site and magnifying the efficiency and effects of the neurotransmitter [gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) by acting on its [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of temazepam on the nervous system. When temazepam binds to the GABA A receptor, it causes the Cl - ion pore to open more frequently. The [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) properties of benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors.

Its main pharmacological action is to increase the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA A receptor. This causes sedation, motor impairment, ataxia, anxiolysis, an anticonvulsant effect, muscle relaxation, and a reinforcing effect. As a medication before surgery, temazepam decreased cortisol in elderly patients. In rats, it triggered the release of vasopressin into paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and decreased the release of ACTH under stress.

In a single- and multiple-dose absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study, using tritium-labelled drug, temazepam was well absorbed and found to have minimal (8%) first-pass drug metabolism. No active metabolites were formed and the only significant metabolite present in blood was the O-conjugate. The unchanged drug was 96% bound to plasma proteins. The blood-level decline of the parent drug was biphasic, with the short half-life ranging from 0.4-0.6 hours and the terminal half-life from 3.5–18.4 hours (mean 8.8 hours), depending on the study population and method of determination.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of energy level alterations, this drug has the potential to be extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit down and generally feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out instead of engaging in physical activities. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)**
- **[Decreased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_heart_rate)**
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - Temazepam is known to cause feelings of heaviness in the body. This effect can range from motor impairment and difficulty moving at lower doses to complete lethargy or inability to stand up or move at high doses.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - The euphoria felt on temazepam is significantly stronger than that felt on other [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) such as [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) . ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of temazepam can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of temazepam is described by many as one of intense sedation, relaxation, anxiety suppression and decreased inhibition. It contains a large number of typical [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - The euphoria felt on temazepam is significantly stronger than that felt on other [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) such as [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) .
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Although this compound primarily suppresses anxiety, it also dulls other emotions in a manner which is distinct but less intensive than that of [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) .
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at heavy dosages.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Temazepam primarily suppresses short-term memory, resulting in forgetfulness, and/or disorganized behaviors.
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - At heavy doses, temazepam can cause confusion. This effect is a result of the drug suppressing basic cognitive functions at heavy doses, such as comprehension, memory, and reasoning skills.
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - Due to temazepam's heavy sedation and lethargy, doing any type of activity that requires moving, or high amounts of effort may be difficult to do on this compound, especially at higher doses.
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - Temazepam is known to cause slurred speech and difficulty communicating words in a clear fashion.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

Temazepam had the highest rate of drug intoxication, including overdose, among common benzodiazepines in cases with and without combination with alcohol in a 1985 study. Temazepam and nitrazepam were the two benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose-related deaths in an [Australian](/w/index.php?title=Australia&action=edit&redlink=1) study of drug deaths. A 1993 British study found temazepam to have the highest number of deaths per million prescriptions among medications commonly prescribed in the 1980s (11.9, versus 5.9 for benzodiazepines overall, taken with or without alcohol). Temazepam has a fatal toxicity index (FTI) that is higher than some tricyclic antidepressants, and has also caused overdose and death without combining it with other CNS depressants, which is almost unheard of amongst the benzodiazepine class of drugs.

Another 1995 Australian study of patients admitted to hospital after benzodiazepine overdose corroborated these results, and found temazepam overdose much more likely to lead to coma than other benzodiazepines ( [odds ratio](/w/index.php?title=Odds_ratio&action=edit&redlink=1) 1.86). The authors noted several factors, such as differences in potency, [receptor affinity](/w/index.php?title=Affinity_(pharmacology)&action=edit&redlink=1) , and rate of absorption between benzodiazepines, could explain this higher toxicity. Although benzodiazepines have a high [therapeutic index](/w/index.php?title=Therapeutic_index&action=edit&redlink=1) , temazepam is one of the more dangerous of this [class](/w/index.php?title=Chemical_classification&action=edit&redlink=1) of [drugs](/w/index.php?title=Drugs&action=edit&redlink=1) . The combination of alcohol or opioids and temazepam makes death by alcohol poisoning more likely.

Still, temazepam has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substances. These include [volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) .

### Dependence and abuse potential

Temazepam is extremely physically and psychologically addictive. Temazepam is considered to be significantly more addictive than other benzodiazepines.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7-14 days. However, in certain cases this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. For more information on tapering from benzodiazepines in a controlled manner, please see [this guide](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm) .

[Benzodiazepine discontinuation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) is notoriously difficult; it is potentially life-threatening for individuals using regularly to discontinue use without tapering their dose over a period of weeks. There is an increased risk of [hypertension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypertension) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and death. Drugs which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal.

Temazepam presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , meaning that after its consumption all benzodiazepines will have a reduced effect. Temazepam also has cross-tolerance with all barbiturates, meaning that after consumption, all barbiturates will have a diminished effect.

### Overdose

Benzodiazepine overdose may occur when a [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) is taken in extremely heavy quantities or concurrently with other depressants. This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) since they work in a similar fashion, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABA A receptor, thus their effects potentiate one another. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABA A receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer . Benzodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly and properly.

Symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include severe [thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration) , [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , coma or death. Benzodiazepine overdoses may be treated effectively in a hospital environment, with generally favorable outcomes. Benzodiazepine overdoses are sometimes treated with [flumazenil](/w/index.php?title=Flumazenil&action=edit&redlink=1) , a GABA A antagonist , however care is primarily supportive in nature.

### Dangerous interactions

Although many drugs are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2-methyl-2-butanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-methyl-2-butanol) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - It is dangerous to combine benzodiazepines with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of benzodiazepines, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of benzodiazepines will be significantly increased, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) as well as [other effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Subjective_effects) . If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only dosing a certain amount of benzodiazepines per hour. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if hydration is not monitored.

  "wikipedia": `# Temazepam
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temazepam*

Temazepam, sold under the brand name Restoril among others, is a medication of the benzodiazepine class which is generally used to treat severe or debilitating insomnia. It is taken by mouth. Temazepam is rapidly absorbed, and significant hypnotic and anxiolytic effects begin in less than 30 minutes and can last for up to eight hours. Prescriptions for hypnotics, such as temazepam, have seen a dramatic decrease since 2010, while anxiolytics, such as alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam, have increased or remained stable. Temazepam and similar hypnotics, such as triazolam (Halcion), are generally reserved for severe and debilitating insomnia. They have largely been replaced by z-drugs (zopiclone, zolpidem) and atypical antidepressants (trazodone, mirtazapine) as first line treatment for insomnia.
Common side effects include drowsiness, motor and cognitive impairment, lethargy, confusion, euphoria, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include hallucinations, hypotension, respiratory depression, abuse, anaphylaxis, and suicide. Use is generally not recommended together with alcohol or opioids. If the dose is rapidly decreased withdrawal may occur. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Temazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and hypnotic. It works by affecting GABA within the brain.
Temazepam was patented in 1962 and came into medical use in 1969. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 208th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

In sleep laboratory studies, temazepam significantly decreased the number of nightly awakenings, but has the drawback of distorting the normal sleep pattern. It is officially indicated for severe insomnia and other severe or disabling sleep disorders. The prescribing guidelines in the UK advise the prescribing of hypnotics to two to four weeks and longer to be avoided, due to concerns of tolerance and dependence.
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended the use of temazepam in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia. It rated the recommendation as weak, the quality of evidence as moderate, and concluded that the potential benefits outweighed the potential harms. The guidelines found that temazepam at a dose of 15 mg reduces sleep latency by 37 minutes (95% CITooltip confidence interval 21 to 53 minutes), increases total sleep time by 99 minutes (95% CI 63 to 135 minutes), and provides a small improvement to sleep quality. The improvements in sleep latency and total sleep time were numerically much greater than any of the other included sleep medications, including eszopiclone, zopiclone, zolpidem, triazolam, estazolam, quazepam, flurazepam, trazodone, diphenhydramine, gabapentin, among others.
The United States Air Force uses temazepam as one of the hypnotics approved as a "no-go pill" to help aviators and special-duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness. "Ground tests" are necessary prior to required authorization being issued to use the medication in an operational situation, and a 12-hour restriction is imposed on subsequent flight operation. The other hypnotics used as "no-go pills" are zaleplon and zolpidem, which have shorter mandatory recovery periods.

## Contraindications

Use of temazepam should be avoided, when possible, in individuals with these conditions:

Ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements)
Severe hypoventilation
Acute narrow-angle glaucoma
Severe hepatic deficiencies (hepatitis and liver cirrhosis decrease elimination by a factor of two)
Severe renal deficiencies (e.g. patients on dialysis)
Sleep apnea
Severe depression, particularly when accompanied by suicidal tendencies
Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances
Myasthenia gravis (autoimmune disorder causing muscle weakness)
Hypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the benzodiazepine class

### Special caution needed

Temazepam may cause harm to the fetus. The safety and effectiveness of temazepam has not been established in children. Benzodiazepines also require special caution if used in the elderly, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.
Temazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. The smallest possible effective dose should be used in elderly or very ill patients, as a risk of apnea and/or cardiac arrest exists. This risk is increased when temazepam is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress the central nervous system (CNS).

### Misuse and dependence

Because benzodiazepines can be abused and lead to dependence, their use should be avoided in people in certain particularly high-risk groups. These groups include people with a history of alcohol or drug dependence, people significantly struggling with their mood or people with longstanding mental health difficulties. If temazepam must be prescribed to people in these groups, they should generally be monitored very closely for signs of misuse and development of dependence.

## Adverse effects

In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

### Common

Side effects are typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines, though temazepam has more pronounced CNS depressant effects, and include somnolence, sedation, dizziness, fatigue, ataxia, headache, lethargy, impairment of memory and learning, longer reaction time and impairment of motor functions (including coordination problems), slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, blurred vision (especially in higher doses or in those with low tolerance), and inattention. Euphoria was a reported side effect with its use, which is uncommon or not ever reported amongst benzodiazepines. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, temazepam had an incidence of euphoria of 1.5%, which is considered rare. Feelings of euphoria, pleasant sedation, and inner feelings of peace are reported by those who abuse drugs, particularly in those who use temazepam intravenously. It has the highest ratings reported among benzodiazepines by recreational drug users. Drug users tend have a higher preference for temazepam over other benzodiazepines. The three most common reasons for temazepam preference were due to speed of onset, that a it was 'strong' and that it gave a good 'high'. Anterograde amnesia is also common, and respiratory depression in higher doses has proven to be fatal, even when temazepam is taken alone. In medical literature from Australia, Ireland, the UK, Canada, and the United States, temazepam is the only benzodiazepine which has been fatal in overdoses without combination with other CNS depresssants. This unique feature is due to the toxicity of the drug, which numerous studies have ranked it as being most toxic.
A 2009 meta-analysis found a 44% higher rate of mild infections, such as pharyngitis or sinusitis, in people taking Temazepam or other hypnotic drugs compared to those taking a placebo.

### Less common

Hyperhydrosis, hypotension, burning eyes, increased appetite, changes in libido, hallucinations, faintness, nystagmus, vomiting, pruritus, gastrointestinal disturbances, nightmares, palpitation and paradoxical reactions including restlessness, aggression, violence, overstimulation and agitation have been reported, but are rare (less than 0.5%).
Before taking temazepam, one should ensure that at least 8 hours are available to dedicate to sleep. Failing to do so can increase the side effects of the drug.
Like all benzodiazepines, the use of this drug in combination with alcohol potentiates the side effects, and can lead to toxicity and death.
Though rare, residual "hangover" effects after night-time administration of temazepam occasionally occur. These include sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions which may persist into the next day, impaired driving ability, and possible increased risks of falls and hip fractures, especially in the elderly.

### Tolerance

Chronic or excessive use of temazepam may cause drug tolerance, which can develop rapidly, so this drug is not recommended for long-term use. In 1979, the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse stated that most hypnotics lose their sleep-inducing properties after about three to 14 days. In use longer than one to two weeks, tolerance will rapidly develop towards the ability of temazepam to maintain sleep, resulting in a loss of effectiveness. Some studies have observed tolerance to temazepam after as little as one week's use. Another study examined the short-term effects of the accumulation of temazepam over seven days in elderly inpatients, and found little tolerance developed during the accumulation of the drug. Other studies examined the use of temazepam over six days and saw no evidence of tolerance. A study in 11 young male subjects showed significant tolerance occurs to temazepam's thermoregulatory effects and sleep inducing properties after one week of use of 30-mg temazepam. Body temperature is well correlated with the sleep-inducing or insomnia-promoting properties of drugs.
In one study, the drug sensitivity of people who had used temazepam for one to 20 years was no different from that of controls. An additional study, in which at least one of the authors is employed by multiple drug companies, examined the efficacy of temazepam treatment on chronic insomnia over three months, and saw no drug tolerance, with the authors even suggesting the drug might become more effective over time.
Establishing continued efficacy beyond a few weeks can be complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between the return of the original insomnia complaint and withdrawal or rebound related insomnia. Sleep EEG studies on hypnotic benzodiazepines show tolerance tends to occur completely after one to four weeks with sleep EEG returning to pretreatment levels. The paper concluded that due to concerns about long-term use involving toxicity, tolerance and dependence, as well as to controversy over long-term efficacy, wise prescribers should restrict benzodiazepines to a few weeks and avoid continuing prescriptions for months or years. A review of the literature found the nonpharmacological treatment options were a more effective treatment option for insomnia due to their sustained improvements in sleep quality.

### Physical dependence

Temazepam, like other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause physical dependence and addiction. Withdrawal from temazepam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which resembles symptoms during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur from standard dosages and after short-term use. Abrupt withdrawal from therapeutic doses of temazepam after long-term use may result in a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Gradual and careful reduction of the dosage, preferably with a long-acting benzodiazepine with long half-life active metabolites, such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam, are recommended to prevent severe withdrawal syndromes from developing. Other hypnotic benzodiazepines are not recommended. A study in rats found temazepam is cross tolerant with barbiturates and is able to effectively substitute for barbiturates and suppress barbiturate withdrawal signs.
Rare cases are reported in the medical literature of psychotic states developing after abrupt withdrawal from benzodiazepines, even from therapeutic doses. Antipsychotics increase the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal effects with an increase in the intensity and severity of convulsions.
Patients who were treated in the hospital with temazepam or nitrazepam have continued taking these after leaving the hospital. Hypnotic uses in the hospital were recommended to be limited to five nights' use only, to avoid the development of withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia.

## Interactions

As with other benzodiazepines, temazepam produces additive CNS-depressant effects when coadministered with other medications which themselves produce CNS depression, such as barbiturates, alcohol, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, nonselective MAO inhibitors, phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, skeletal muscle relaxants, antihistamines, and anaesthetics. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline has been shown to reduce the sedative effects of temazepam and other benzodiazepines.
Unlike many benzodiazepines, pharmacokinetic interactions involving the P450 system have not been observed with temazepam. Temazepam shows no significant interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, erythromycin). Oral contraceptives may decrease the effectiveness of temazepam and speed up its elimination half-life.

## Overdose

Overdosage of temazepam results in increasing CNS effects, including:

Somnolence (difficulty staying awake)
Mental confusion
Respiratory depression
Hypotension
Cyanosis
Impaired motor functions
Impaired or absent reflexes
Impaired coordination
Impaired balance
Dizziness, sedation
Coma
Death
Temazepam had the highest rate of drug intoxication, including overdose, among common benzodiazepines in cases with and without combination with alcohol in a 1985 study. Temazepam and nitrazepam were the two benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose-related deaths in an Australian study of drug deaths. Of the two, temazepam had higher number of deaths, and only temazepam was fatal as the lone drug in three cases, while all cases of nitrazepam deaths were due to mixes with other CNS depressants. Alcohol, heroin, and prescription opioids, with morphine being the opioid with the highest mortality rate. A 1993 British study found temazepam to have the highest number of deaths per million prescriptions among medications commonly prescribed in the 1980s (11.9, versus 5.9 for benzodiazepines overall, taken with or without alcohol).
A 1995 Australian study of patients admitted to hospital after benzodiazepine overdose corroborated these results, and found temazepam overdose much more likely to lead to coma than other benzodiazepines (odds ratio 1.86). The authors noted several factors, such as differences in potency, receptor affinity, and rate of absorption between benzodiazepines, could explain this higher toxicity. Although benzodiazepines have a high therapeutic index, temazepam is one of the more dangerous of this class of drugs. The combination of alcohol and temazepam makes death by alcohol poisoning more likely.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The main pharmacological action of temazepam is to increase the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor. This causes sedation, motor impairment, ataxia, anxiolysis, anticonvulsant effects, muscle relaxation, and a reinforcing effect.
As a medication before surgery, temazepam decreased cortisol in elderly patients. In rats, it triggered the release of vasopressin into paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and decreased the release of ACTH under stress.

### Pharmacokinetics

Oral administration of 15 to 45 mg of temazepam in humans resulted in rapid absorption with significant blood levels achieved in fewer than 30 minutes and peak levels at two to three hours.
In a single- and multiple-dose absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study, using tritium-labelled drug, temazepam was well absorbed and found to have minimal (8%) first-pass drug metabolism. No active metabolites were formed and the only significant metabolite present in blood was the O-conjugate. The unchanged drug was 96% bound to plasma proteins. The blood-level decline of the parent drug was biphasic, with the short half-life ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 hours and the terminal half-life from 3.5 to 18.4 hours (mean 8.8 hours), depending on the study population and method of determination.
Temazepam has very good bioavailability, with almost 100% being absorbed following being taken by mouth. The drug is metabolized through conjugation and demethylation prior to excretion. Most of the drug is excreted in the urine, with about 20% appearing in the faeces. The major metabolite was the O-conjugate of temazepam (90%); the O-conjugate of N-desmethyl temazepam was a minor metabolite (7%).

## Chemistry

Temazepam is a benzodiazepine. It is a white, crystalline substance, very slightly soluble in water, and sparingly soluble in alcohol.

### Synthesis

Pharmacologically active metabolite of diazepam, q.v.

N-oxides are prone to undergo the Polonovski rearrangement when treated with acetic anhydride, and this was illustrated by the synthesis of oxazepam. It is not surprising that the N-methyl analogue (1) also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam (2). Care must be exacted with the conditions, or the inactive rearrangement product (3) results.

## History

Temazepam was synthesized in 1964, but it came into use in 1981 when its ability to counter insomnia was realized. By the late 1980s, temazepam was one of the most popular and widely prescribed hypnotics on the market and it became one of the most widely prescribed drugs.

## Society and culture

### Recreational use

Temazepam is a drug with a high potential for misuse.
Benzodiazepines have been abused orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential; the more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the 'popularity' of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was 'strong' and that it gave a good 'high'.
A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.
A 1985 study found that temazepam and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than a variety of other benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over all the rest of the benzodiazepines included in the study.

#### North America

In North America, temazepam misuse is not widespread. Other benzodiazepines are more commonly prescribed for insomnia. In the United States, temazepam is the fifth-most prescribed benzodiazepine, however there is a major drop off from the top four most prescribed (alprazolam, lorazepam, diazepam, and clonazepam in that order). Individuals abusing benzodiazepines obtain the drug by getting prescriptions from several doctors, forging prescriptions, or buying diverted pharmaceutical products on the illicit market. North America has never had a serious problem with temazepam misuse, but is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the illicit trade of temazepam.

#### Australia

Temazepam is a Schedule 4 drug and requires a prescription. The drug accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary in Victoria. Due to rife intravenous abuse, the Australian government decided to put it under a more restrictive schedule than it had been, and since March 2004 temazepam capsules have been withdrawn from the Australian market, leaving only 10 mg tablets available.
Benzodiazepines are commonly detected by customs at different ports and airports, arriving by mail, also found occasionally in the baggage of air passengers, mostly small or medium quantities (up to 200–300 tablets) for personal use. From 2003 to 2006, customs detected about 500 illegal importations of benzodiazepines per year, most frequently diazepam. Quantities varied from single tablets to 2,000 tablets.

#### United Kingdom

In 1987, temazepam was the most widely abused legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom. The use of benzodiazepines by street-drug abusers was part of a polydrug abuse pattern, but many of those entering treatment facilities were declaring temazepam as their main drug of abuse. Temazepam was the most commonly used benzodiazepine in a study, published 1994, of injecting drug users in seven cities, and had been injected from preparations of capsules, tablets, and syrup. The increase in use of heroin, often mixed with other drugs, which most often included temazepam, diazepam, and alcohol, was a major factor in the increase in drug-related deaths in Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1990–1992. Temazepam use was particularly associated with violent or disorderly behaviours and contact with the police in a 1997 study of young single homeless people in Scotland. The BBC series Panorama featured an episode titled "Temazepam Wars", dealing with the epidemic of temazepam abuse and directly related crime in Paisley, Scotland. The trend was mocked in the 1995 Black Grape song "Temazi Party" (also called "Tramazi Party").

### Medical research issues

The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine published a paper expressing concerns about benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, the benzodiazepines and the Z-drugs used as hypnotics in humans. The paper cites a systematic review of the medical literature concerning insomnia medications and states almost all trials of sleep disorders and drugs are sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, while this is not the case in general medicine or psychiatry. It cites another study that "found that the odds ratio for finding results favorable to industry in industry-sponsored trials was 3.6 times as high as in non–industry-sponsored studies". Issues discussed regarding industry-sponsored studies include: comparison of a drug to a placebo, but not to an alternative treatment; unpublished studies with unfavorable outcomes; and trials organized around a placebo baseline followed by drug treatment, but not counterbalanced with parallel-placebo-controlled studies. Quoting a 1979 report that too little research into hypnotics was independent of the drug manufacturers, the authors conclude, "the public desperately needs an equipoised assessment of hypnotic benefits and risks" and the NIH and VA should provide leadership to that end.
