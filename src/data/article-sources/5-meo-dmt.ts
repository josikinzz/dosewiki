**5-MeO-DMT** (**5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine**) is a powerful psychedelic tryptamine. It is found in a wide variety of plant species, and a single psychoactive toad species. Like its close relatives DMT and bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), it has been used as an entheogen by South American shamans for thousands of years. In modern times, however, it is primarily acquired in its pure form through the use of online research chemical vendors.

When used as a drug in its purified form, 5-MeO-DMT is vaporized, insufflated, or injected and is active at a dose of as little as 2 mg. 5-MeO-DMT is active orally when taken with an MAOI, but according to numerous reports this combination is extremely unpleasant and has a strong body load.

In terms of its chemistry, 5-MeO-DMT is made up of a tryptamine backbone, with a methoxy group substituted onto carbon R5 and two methyl groups substituted onto the nitrogen RN1 and RN2. 5-MeO-DMT is a methoxy derivative of DMT. It is also the O-methyl analogue of bufotenin (5-HO-DMT) and occurs in many organisms alongside of this compound.

In terms of its pharmacology, 5-Meo-DMT’s psychedelic effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. Specifically, this molecule shows high affinity for the 5-HT2 and 5-HT1A subtypes. Additional mechanisms of action such as reuptake inhibition of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine are involved also.This can result in 5-MeO-DMT becoming dangerously toxic when combined with MAOIs, RIMAs, SSRIs stimulants or any substance which acts as a releasing agent or reuptake inhibitor of neurotransmitters.

5-MeO-DMT is *O*-demethylated by polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to an active metabolite, bufotenin.

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 5-MeO-DMT can be broken down into ten components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to its often relatively mild accompanying cognitive and visual effects, 5-MeO-DMT seems to have by far the most proportionally intense and overwhelming physical sensations found within the known psychedelic experience. These individual components are complex, overwhelming and equally capable of being interpreted as either extremely pleasurable or uncomfortable.

- **[Enhancement of tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Enhancement_of_touch)** - This particular component is perhaps the most overwhelming sensation within the entirety of the 5-MeO-DMT experience. It increases the intensity of tactile sensations to such an overwhelming extent that it induces a sustained and repeatable full body orgasm within every nerve ending across the entire body. The experience of this results in the perception of having a difficulty sustaining the act of breathing. It is worth noting, however, that this is not a genuine or dangerous experience of respiratory depression and is perfectly safe.
- **[Physical euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Nausea)**
- **[Increased bodily control](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Increased_bodily_control)**
- **[Loss of motor control](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Loss_of_motor_control)**
- **Bodily pressures**
- **Skin flushing**
- **[Changes in gravity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Changes_in_gravity)**
- **[Loss of temperature regulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Loss_of_temperature_regulation)**
- **[Increased bodily weight](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Increased_bodily_weight)**

**Cognitive Effects:**

The most prominent of 5-MeO-DMT’s cognitive effects generally include:

- **[Current mind state enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Current_mind_state_enhancement)**
- **[Mindfulness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Mindfulness)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought connectivity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Anxiety](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Anxiety)**
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Time_distortion)**
- **[Direct communication with the subconscious](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Direct_communication_with_the_subconscious)**
- **[States of unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:States_of_unity_and_interconnectedness)**
- **[Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)**
- **[Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Delusions)**
- **[Amnesia](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Amnesia)**

**Visual effects:**

The visual effects of 5-MeO-DMT can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to its consistently overwhelming and intense accompanying cognitive and physical effects, 5-MeO-DMT seems to have some of the most proportionally underwhelming visual effects found within the known psychedelic experience.

- **[Visual acuity enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Visual_acuity_enhancement) and [Visual acuity suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Visual_acuity_suppression)** - 5-MeO-DMT is equally capable of both decreasing and increasing visual acuity. The outcome of which effect will manifest seems to be chosen almost entirely at random and is largely setting dependent.
- **[Colour enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Colour_shifting)**
- **[Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Drifting)** ([Morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Drifting#Morphing), [Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Drifting#Breathing), [Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Drifting#Melting), [Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Drifting#Flowing)) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as identical to DMT in its style, highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **[Geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Geometry)** - The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip does not usually occur and never extends beyond level 7 at its highest state. It is very similar to DMT although significantly smaller in size and more likely to manifest in darkness or without distractions. In terms of appearance, it can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Effect:Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally organic and digital in feel, structured in organization, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equal in sharp and soft edges, small in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in depth and consistent in its intensity.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 5-MeO-DMT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which generally include:

- [Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Enhancements)
- [Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Distortions)
- [Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Hallucinations)

**Natural sources:**

**Colorado River toad: **The Colorado River toad (Incilius alvarius), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad, is a psychoactive toad found in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. Its skin and venom contain 5-MeO-DMT and bufotenin.

The toad’s primary defense system are glands that produce a poison that may be potent enough to kill a grown dog. These parotoid glands also produce the 5-MeO-DMT and bufotenin for which the toad is known. Fresh venom can easily be collected from these glands without harm to the toad. To do this, obtain a flat glass plate or any other smooth, nonporous surface of at least 12-inches square and hold the toad in front of the plate (which is fixed in a vertical position). When the desert toad is stroked near the parotid glands in the neck region, there is a squirting out of this venom. When it is allowed to dry on a hard surface it takes on the texture of rubber cement. It contains up to 15% 5-MeO-DMT, as well as N-methyl-5-methoxytryptamine, 5-MeO-NMT and Bufotenine, which have their own entries. In this manner, the venom can be collected on the glass plate, free of dirt and liquid released when the toad is handled.

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 5-MeO-DMT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychedelic community who have tried 5-MeO-DMT suggests that although physically intense, this substance is well tolerated and physically benign just like other tryptamines. There are no known negative health effects attributed to trying this substance at low or heavy dosages and it has a long history of usage dating back thousands of years.

Deaths from 5-MeO-DMT are rare but, as a powerful monoamine reuptake inhibitor, injury can occur when excessive doses are taken or when taken with drugs such as MAOIs, RIMAs, stimulants and any substance which act as a releasing agent or reuptake inhibitor of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. This has resulted in well documented deaths^ that are easily avoidable and could have been otherwise prevented.

There is a strong tolerance gained after a single dosage of this compound. This diminishes effects greatly if one tries to redose but returns to base line levels within 24 hours.

**Legal issues:**

- **Denmark:** As of December 1, 2004, 5-MeO-DMT was legally restricted to “medical or scientific purposes”.
- **Gemany:** As of December 1, 2004, 5-MeO-DMT was legally restricted to “medical or scientific purposes”.
- **Greece:** 5-MeO-DMT became a controlled substance in Greece on February 18, 2003 [EU Legal Database].
- **New Zealand:** 5-MeO-DMT is Schedule I (Class A) in New Zealand.
- **Sweden**: *Sveriges riksdags* health ministry *Statens folkhälsoinstitut* classified 5-MeO-DMT as “health hazard” under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated “Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health”) as of Oct 1, 2004, in their regulation SFS 2004:696 listed as 5-metoxi-N,N-dimetyltryptamin (5-MeO-DMT), making it illegal to sell or possess.
- **Switzerland**: 5-MeO-DMT is Schedule I in Switzerland.
- **Romania**: 5-MeO-DMT is illegal in Romania since February 2010.
- **USA**: 5-MeO-DMT was added to Schedule I, effective January 19, 2011. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, 5-MeO-DMT is an A-Typical psychedelic which although interesting, remains very consistent and repetitive in comparison to other tryptamines such as DMT itself. It is worth trying for the sheer physical intensity and euphoria of it but I would not recommend this substance to anybody who is looking to experience genuine psychedelia.

Basics

DESCRIPTION #
 
5-MeO-DMT is a psychoactive tryptamine which was first identified in the mid 20th Century as a chemical in a South American plant entheogen. It is a common constituent of many different plants and has been used traditionally in psychoactives snuffs such as Yopo from the Anadenanthera colubrina seeds, Epena from Virola sap, and some ayahuasca-type brews where 5-MeO-DMT containing plants are used as admixtures. In the other parts of the world, including the U.S., 5-MeO-DMT is mostly encountered as a crystalline chemical and smoked, snorted, or swallowed for recreation and/or insight. 5-MeO-DMT is sometimes confused with its more well-known cousin N,N-DMT (usually just called "DMT") which can lead to disasterous results because of the large difference in appropriate dosages (5-MeO-DMT's dosage is perhaps 1/10 to 1/2 that of N,N-DMT, depending on individual reaction). 
 
 5-MeO-DMT has been called just "5MEO", but as other "5-MeO" (methoxy group on the 5 position, such as 5-MeO-DiPT) psychoactives have become known this shortened name is slowly losing its usefulness. 5-MeO-DMT's effects are much less visual than N,N-DMT's, with many users reporting no visual distortions at all. The experience itself is sometimes characterized as 'the void'. 
 
[ [Main 5-MeO-DMT Vault](https://erowid.org/5meo_dmt.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/5meo_dmt_dose.shtml) #
 
The standard dosage range for smoked 5-MeO-DMT is between 2-15 mg; for insufflation the dose range is 5-20 mg. These are very small amounts of material and should be measured extremely carefully. Many people achieve full world-shattering effects at as low as 3-5 mg (8-12 insufflated) and it is not uncommon for individuals who smoke 20-30 mg to have psychological and mental difficulties lasting several weeks.
 
Price #
 
Occasionally sold at parties for 1-20 USD per dose. Available from exotic chemical suppliers for 150-250 USD per gram, somewhat higher from underground sources.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/5meo_dmt_law.shtml) #
 
5-MeO-DMT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, making it illegal to possess without a license as of Jan 19 2011. Sales or possession could be prosecuted under the Analog Act, although only one case of prosecution has been brought to our attention. 5-MeO-DMT is now controlled / illegal in a number of countries including Denmark, Germany, Greece, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and Romania.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/5meo_dmt_chemistry.shtml) #
 
5-Methoxy-N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a naturally occurring chemical in the tryptamine class. It is related structurally to N,N-DMT, Bufotenine, Psilocybin, and Psilocin.

[History](https://erowid.org/5meo_dmt_timeline.php) #
 
In the early 1950s, 5-MeO-DMT was identified as one of the main psychoactive ingredients in 'cohoba' snuffs used in the northern Amazon basin. Its use in the form of snuffs and brews has been documented as early as the 8th Century A.D. from a burial site in Northern Chile which found snuffing paraphernalia and traces of N,N-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and Bufotenine. Other archeological sites have also uncovered seeds of 5-MeO-DMT containing Anadenanthera species from around the same time period. Its use as a recreational psychoactive has increased through the 80's and 90's.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
5-MeO-DMT; 5-MeO.
 
The Experience:
 
Tripping; The Void.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/5meo_dmt_effects.shtml) #
 
The smoked 5-MeO-DMT experience is short, but generally incredibly intense. Onset is fast and furious, sometimes compared to being launched from a cannon. It is a fully engaging and enveloping experience of visions (actual visual effects less common) which varies greatly from one individual to the next. Users report profound changes in ontological perspective, experiencing the void, the shattering of the universe, frightening and overwhelming forces, complete shifts in perception and identity followed by an abrupt return to baseline. Because of the nature and intensity of the experience, users are almost always seated or lying down with someone nearby to take the pipe as the experience begins. Unlike with N,N-DMT, few users report significant coherent visual effects. 
 
 The insufflated 5-MeO-DMT experience has a slower/gentler onset, with effects building over 20-45 minutes, and aftereffects lasting for 1-3 hours. Users report being better able to integrate the intensity and insights achieved from this method, with more clarity of thought, and time to explore those thoughts. As with the smoked method, dose response is extremely variable, and a heavy dose can be equally difficult, with aftereffects lasting hours or days.
 
Onset #
 
When smoked, 5-MeO-DMT generally reaches full effects within 10-60 seconds of inhalation. Insufflated, effects come in generally within 5 minutes.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of 5-MeO-DMT last approximately 5-20 minutes when smoked, 30-45 minutes when insufflated. For many people there is an additional period of time (1-2 hrs) before fully returning to baseline. Some people find the 5-MeO-DMT experience difficult to integrate and experience unsettling thoughts and feelings for days after use.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
[PROBLEMS](https://erowid.org/5meo_dmt_health.shtml) #
 
One of the primary physical problems encountered with smoked 5-MeO-DMT is the harsh nature of the smoke which can cause throat and lung irritation. Integration of the experience can also cause difficulties for some individuals, especially at higher doses. Difficult integration periods can lead to anxiety, difficulty focusing on daily tasks, preoccupation with the experience, difficulty sleeping, etc. Generally these effects dissipate on their own over the course of a few days but there are reports of persisting problems.
 
Contraindications #
 
- The effects of smoked 5-MeO-DMT are dramatically increased if used by individuals currently taking MAOIs. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not stand up. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 5-MeO-DMT as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
5-MeO-DMT is neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 5-MeO-DMT use. Using 5-MeO-DMT a second time within a few hours is likely to lead to a significantly diminished experience the second time.

5-MeO-DMT Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
5-MeO-DMT is a short acting tryptamine very similar in nature to DMT. It is often found as very small white crystals (like salt) and is generally smoked/vaporized and less commonly insufflated. Dosages are very sensitive. People react very differently to different doses, and insufficient measuring instruments add to the risk. Some individuals have world-shattering effects with less than 5 mg.
 
WARNING: The wide variation in reactions to this and other substances can lead to overwhelmingly intense and frightening experiences even at very low doses.

5-MeO-DMT (5-Methoxydimethyltryptamine)
 
Health
 
by Erowid
 
NOTES #
 
5-MeO-DMT is a chemical not associated with major physical health issues unless combined with MAOIs. The primary health risks associated with the use of 5-MeO-DMT are mental health problems, like lasting Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)-type reactions where people feel shocked for days, weeks, months, or years after their last use.
 
WARNINGS #
 
- Lung / Breathing Issues When smoked, there is the risk of causing discomfort or pain from inhaling the chemical vapor. This could be a result of pH or heat. We have one report, which was also published in *The Entheogen Review* , of a woman who experienced severe lung pain smoking 5-MeO-DMT. Although risk of this is generally low because the dosage smoked is usually less than 20 mg, smokers of 5-MeO-DMT are cautioned to be aware of this issue.
- Short Term Unconsciousness / Non-Responsiveness Short term (1-10 minute) non-responsiveness or unconsciousness is frequent with smoked doses over 8-10 mg or insufflated doses over 15-20 mg. Sitters are extremely important. If 5-MeO-DMT smokers move around during the peak, they can be clumsy, fall, or knock things over and hurt themselves. The peak passes quickly and most users prefer to remain sitting or lying down for the 3-10 minutes of intensity.
- Contraindication : 5-MeO-DMT and MAOIs Although 5-MeO-DMT is present in some plants used in [ayahuasca](https://erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca.shtml) and in some ayahuasca brews, Erowid has received several reports of very troubling physical reactions in people who have ingested 5-MeO-DMT with MAOI harmala alkaloids. There appears to be the risk of severe hypertensive symptoms, overheating, [serotonin syndrome](https://erowid.org/ask/ask.cgi?ID=2981) , etc. It is important to note that the profile of these risks are not fully understood, because the long history of use of brews containing some amount the two in combination. 
 
 A case of a 17-year-old male was reported to us in December 2002. He ingested an extract of Syrian Rue and then smoked an unknown (but large) dose of powdered, chemical 5-MeO-DMT. He quickly became non-responsive and fell to the ground, began convulsing (myoclonic jerking), and his sitter called an ambulance for help. He was found to have had a pulse of 180, blood pressure 200/125, and temperature 106.0 F. These levels are dangerously high. He was minimally responsive but became wildly agitated upon stimulation (even just speaking to him). He was treated with diazepam and transferred by helicopter to a Boston area hospital. The patient may have suffered lasting damage to his kidneys and [rhabdomyolysis](http://members.tripod.com/~baggas/rhabdo.html) . A formal case report of this incident was published in a 2004 issue of the *Journal of Toxicology & Clinical Toxicology* titled ["Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Poisoning Resulting from Internet Misinformation on Illicit Substances"](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6411) . 
 
 In December 2004, we received an unconfirmed report of a death related to the ingestion of 200 mg of 5-MeO-DMT with some amount of "yage". This death was later described in the case report ["A Fatal Intoxication Following the Ingestion of 5-Methoxy-N,N-Dimethyltryptamine in an Ayahuasca Preparation"](https://erowid.org/references/6778) in the November/December 2005 issue of the *Journal of Analytical Toxicology* , and the follow-up commentary ["A Demand for Clarity Regarding a Case Report on the Ingestion of 5-Methoxy-N,N-Dimethyltryptamine in an Ayahuasca Preparation"](https://erowid.org/references/8598) was published in the July/August 2006 issue. 
 
 We have also received some reports from groups experimenting with making pharmahuasca using 5-MeO-DMT who have said that they had much higher incidence of bad reactions with 5-MeO-DMT than with *N* , *N* -DMT. They discontinued using the 5-MeO-DMT.
- Lasting Anxiety and Sleep Disruption Erowid has receied several reports from those who have smoked 5-MeO-DMT who experienced intense panic attacks, lasting chronic anxiety, and sleep disruption/insomnia triggered by a single session of smoking 5-MeO-DMT. It is unknown how common this reaction is.

U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**5-MeO-DMT**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I(effective Jan 19 2011)
 
5-MeO-DMT was added to Schedule I effective Jan 19, 2011. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license. 
 
 See [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/2010-31854.htm](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/2010-31854.htm) . 
 
 Leading up to its control as a Schedule I drug: On August 21, 2009, the DEA entered a proposed rule change in the [Federal Register (Volume 74, Number 161)](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-20204.htm) to Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. It is extremely likely that this rule will become final and 5-Meo-DMT will become Schedule I in the United States. On October 28, 2009, the DEA extended the comment period to November 27, 2009. See [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-25939.htm](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-25939.htm) .

*TiHKAL Entry #38*


## SYNTHESIS
To a well-stirred suspension of 11.7 g LAH in 350 mL anhydrous Et2O there was added, in small portions, a suspension of 18.5 g 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethylindol-3-ylglyoxylamide in 200 mL hot benzene. The last of the solids were rinsed in with anhydrous Et2O and the mixture held at reflux for 1.5 h. After cooling with an external ice bath, the reaction complex and excess hydride were decomposed by the cautious addition of H2O. The inorganic solids were removed by filtration, the filter cake washed with additional Et2O, the filtrate and washing were combined and dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvents removed under vacuum. The residue was distilled at the KugelRohr to provide a colorless fraction distilling at 160â170 Â°C at 0.6 mm/Hg, that crystallized on cooling. There was thus obtained 12.8 g (78%) 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) which on recrystallization from hexane had a mp 69â70 Â°C. The hydrochloride salt can be made by passing a stream of hydrogen chloride gas through an Et2O solution of the base. It, upon recrystallization from EtOH/Et2O, had a mp of 145â146 Â°C.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 8 mg, smoked) âI was blown away, far away I might add, but only for 10 minutes and effects were gone by half an hour. During this episode mental activity was almost absent. I canât say I wasnât âimpressedâ in some way, though it wasnât exactly what I expected. I had read reports with statements varying from âdwarfs + elvesâ to âconk on the head,â the latter of which relates more closely to my experience.â

(with perhaps 10 mg, smoked) âOnset was gentle, perhaps over 15 minutes. I felt like all of my blood had turned to concrete. There were no noticeable visual effects, but my hearing was slightly diminished. The whole experience was over after 1 hour.â

(with perhaps 15 mg, smoked) âI took a hit from the pipe with five-methoxy in it, and after the 8 to 10 seconds it took to carry the chemical to my brain I remember starting to fall over from my sitting position. My normal physical perceptions dissolved away from my awareness. My ears started to ring and I started to float off. I was acutely aware of a certain resonation of my aural perception, an electrical buzzing that fluctuated in synch with my visual perception. What I saw can only be described as a fantastically subtle multicolored phosphene, completely filling every area visually available. I say it in this way because I was simultaneously losing contact with my body, I could not tell if my eyes were open or shut, although I initially had the feeling that they were darting back and forth, from side to side. These feelings and sensations built up in intensity very quickly, a matter of seconds: I can remember this feeling of building intensity up to a point, and then I was not there in my body or in time. In the 10 to 15 minutes that my body was under the influence of the drug my mind was completely referenceless, there was no way for my consciousness to limit or gauge the stimuli my being was barraged with. I remember switching to a perception where the endless and intricate phosphene was love and the energy of light. I called upon those forces within my being to realign and submit, to let go of all the cogent fears and just exist â¦ and that innate decision saved me a lot of psychic damage. What is most outstanding about the way it feels is an inability to judge in any way, by any method of the mind â¦ it is unconquerable, as deep and profound as a totally unconditional love that is life. What a trip, huh?â

(with 15 mg, smoked) âAt about 60 seconds after I smoked this free base, I beheld every thought that was going on everywhere in the universe and all possible realities while I was wracked out with this horrible ruthless love. It scared the hell out of me. When I could see again (15 minutes later) it was almost as if there was an echo of a thought in my head saying that I was given an extremely rare look at the true consciousness of it all. Iâve never been hit this hard since then. A definite ++++.â

(with perhaps 20 mg, smoked) âThis is a very strong hallucinogen. A twenty minute experience. For me it was like adding the MDMA experience to DMT. DMT for me is terrifying (I still go back though) and I must really think about it before proceeding. The 5-MeO-DMT was much more relaxed, a kind of cosmic consciousness type of experience. I broke into a space similar to DMT but it was more like receiving grace. I felt a little shaky (tremor-like) coming down.â

(with 25 mg, smoked) âI placed 25 mg of 5-methoxy-DMT in a stainless steel one-quarter teaspoon and vaporized it over a cigarette lighter collecting the smoke in an upside-down funnel. All smoke was inhaled; the taste was mildânone of the plastic taste of DMT. About 10 seconds or so after inhaling the last of the smoke, it began with a fast-rising sense of excitement and wonder, with an undertone of âNow youâve done it,â but dominated by a sense of, âWOW, This Is IT!â There was a tremendous sense of speed and acceleration In perhaps 10 more seconds these feelings built to an intensity I had never experienced before. The entire universe imploded through my consciousness. Itâs as if the mind is capable of experiencing a very large number of objects, situations and feelings, but normally perceives them only one at a time. I felt that my mind was perceiving them all at once. There was no distance, no possibility of examining the experience. This was simply the most intense experience possible; a singularity, a white-out (as opposed to a black out), I have little memory of the state itself. I have no memory, for example, of whether my eyes were opened or closed. After some seconds or minutes , it started to fade and came to resemble a merely intense psychedelic state. Here I had the feeling, a visualization of being part of the universe of beings, all active in our daily, interwoven tasks, still moving at an incredible rate, and with a longing for a single group/organism awareness and transcendence. In a few more minutes it faded to an alert (+one) state with an additional sense of awe and wonder, relief, and a strong feeling of gratitude toward the universe in general, for the experience.â

(with 30 mg, smoking) âI placed approx. 30 mg of 5-MeO into a pipe, and smoked it, in one toke, without a second thought. An instant later, I was crawled up on my bed (in the fetal position) with my eyes closed, squirming around, screaming (in my head) âFuck! You killed yourself!â I repeated this several times, very fearful of death. I didnât see anything, while my eyes were shut, except for a bright white light, that which you see after staring at a bright light. The only other âvisionâ was one in my mindâI came to the realization that my life would be wasted if I died there. This showed me all of my scripts being discarded and nothing good happening ever again. It was a glimpse into my future, if I died. I concentrated on breathing and that helped me survive (mentally). I walked into the living room and placed a CD into the stereo, and as the first song started, my attention span disappeared, and I walked back into my bedroom. To my surprise, forty minutes had passed, in what I remembered as mere seconds. This scared me, thinking that maybe I had blacked out. I felt the effect for about an hour, it slowly faded away.â

(with an unknown but large amount, smoked) I observed the subject pass very quickly into an almost coma-like state. Within seconds his face became purple and his breathing stopped. I pounded his chest, and breathed for him, and he seemed to emerge in consciousness, with the comment, âThis is absolute ecstasy.â He stopped breathing a second time, and both heart massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was provided. Again, he recovered and managed to maintain a continuing consciousness and achieve a partial recovery. In the awake condition he was increasingly lucid, but on closing his eyes he became possessed with, what he called, âThe energy of terror.â He could not sleep, as upon closing his eyes he felt threatened in a way he could not tolerate. Three days later, medical intervention with antipsychotic medication was provided, which allowed the recovery of an acceptable behavior pattern in a few more days.

(with 35 mg, orally): âNo activity.â

(with 0.25 mg, intravenously i.v.): âA real effect.â

(with 0.5 mg, intravenously i.v.) âI felt the effects distinctly within a minute, along with some pain at the injection site. In a few minutes I felt a very distinct calming and stilling of my mind. While I could have carried on a conversation about anything and didnât feel the least bit stoned, I found the feeling very recognizable.â

(with 0.7 mg, intravenously i.v.): "This was basically a +1 experience. After a few instances I felt its motion, very gentle waves. I was thinking about thinking about the experience, about writing about it, and so I was experiencing myself as both observer and editor. This was not overwhelming, but gentle."

(with 1.3 mg, intravenously i.v.) âIn a few seconds I was participating in exquisite, full body, teeth-chattering shivers that lasted in all about 10 minutes, nearly the duration of the effects. The sensations seemed to come more from my head region, whereas my âfull blownâ experiences of smoked 5-MeO-DMT seemed to emanate from my center and heart.â

(with 2.3 mg, intravenously i.v.) âI remember having a perspective of knowing I was aware and, if not from the start of the experience then very soon into it, knowing I knew I was aware. I thought I was an ocean. I donât remember where I first lost continuity of consciousness (this is a little like a black-out from hard liquor) but I remember being aware of the sounds I was making apparently some time after I began vocalizing. Around the time I thought to change these sounds as I pleased, I also noted with brief wonder that the sound was continuous, not changed by my breathing. I sang my way back.â

(with 3.1 mg, intravenously i.v.) âI vocalized effortlessly. I was getting in touch with my body. I said, âTurn off the lights,â and âI love you,â and then I lost it. I was amazed later to find a roomful of people who had been frightened by the noises they had been amazed to hear, and I was amazed to be told I had made.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
5-MeO-DMT was first observed in a member of the Rue family (Rutaceae) called Dictyoloma incanescens. Now it is recognized as a major component of a number of South American snuffs. The snuff called cohoba is generally associated with plants of the Piptadenia and Mimosa genus, and as they are largely DMT-containing, they are discussed under that entry. But there are other snuffs, such as yakee and yato (in Colombia) and paricÃ¡, epenÃ¡ and nyakwana in Brazil, which should probably be discussed here. The plants used are of the Virola genus, containing trees most plentifully found in the Amazon basin.

There has been a long-standing and never-to-be-resolved disagreement amongst botanists as to the best way of classifying plants. There are the morphotaxonomists, who insist that species assignment should be based primarily on appearance, and there are the chemotaxonomists who feel that the natural composition should be a deciding factor in the distinction between species. But the ultimate requirement for morphology is to find the plant in bloom, and for chemistry, to have some analytical capabilities. Often, neither luxury is available in the jungles of the rain forest. A major contributor to the Virola snuffs, Virola theiodora, is a good case in point. Two plant sources, both gathered in Brazil, have been found to have radically different compositions. In one, 5-MeO-DMT is substantially the only alkaloid found in the bark, whereas in the other, DMT is the major alkaloid. But both have DMT almost exclusively in the young green shoots. Are they the same species? Another plant used in some of the snuff preparations is Virola calophylla, where the bark, root, leaves and shoots all run about 90% DMT as the alkaloid content. Yet, the alkaloids in the root and bark of Virola rufuta consist of some 95% 5-MeO-DMT.

The inquiries into metabolic 6-hydroxylation as a prelude to biological activity have been made with both 5-MeO-DMT and the corresponding primary tryptamine (see below). 6-HO-5-MeO-DMT has been shown in several animal models to be pharmacologically less active than its parent compound. See the discussion under DET for the role that this metabolism played in some early clinical studies.

Removing one of the N-methyl groups provides N-methyl-5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-NMT), which has its own entry. Removal of both methyl groups from the nitrogen gives 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-T) which has been explored most extensively by Soviet researchers as a treatment for exposure to radiation; this aspect of its action is discussed and expanded upon in the commentary under Melatonin. It is also known by the trade name Mexamine and has been looked at as a potentiator of centrally active drugs. Here, as with the simpler N,N-dialkyltryptamines, the metabolic introduction of a hydroxyl group at the 6-position (to give 6-HO-5-MeO-T) leads to a lowering of pharmacological potency. And again, no human studies have been reported.

A true academic challenge exists with the many studies of 5-methoxy-DMT (as has been mentioned under DMT, different drug, same problem) which have involved drug mixtures. The second drug, added to the tryptamine, is almost always a monoamineoxidase inhibitor such as harmaline, either as a chemical (in most clinical studies in the Northern Hemisphere) or as the plant decoction (in most jungle uses in the Southern Hemisphere). The challenge is, just how should one classify these observations? Under the first drug modifying or being modified by the second? Under the second drug modifying or being modified by the first? Or should the mixture be treated as a variable thing in its own right?

Since the mixture invariably shows properties that neither component can show alone, it is obvious that the combination is a major classification component. When the harmaline component is a plant mixture containing harmaline, a common name that is used is Ayahuasca. This can be any of a large number of carboline-containing plants (or even harmaline itself) combined with a really wide variety of amines ranging from the tryptamines to mushrooms to such diverse materials as Jimpson Weed components. These combinations are usually unknown as to exact composition, and they will be discussed in a chapter devoted to just this combination, entitled âHoasca vs. Ayahuasca.â On the other hand, when the components are discrete compounds, the process is much more controlled (in the experimental sense rather than in the effects sense) and these combinations are gathered in the recipe for harmaline.

There are a couple more entries for 5-MeO-DMT, one very important one, and the other quite trivial. There is a drug-use phenomenon that is often referred to by the popular title of âtoad-licking.â The toad involved is the Sonora Desert Toad, also called the Colorado River Toad, and carries the binomial Bufo alverius. It is not the closely related marine toad Bufo marinus, as some people have insisted, prompted by the early Olmec and Mayan iconography. Of course the licking myth is newspaper hypeâit is the venom that is active, and it is smoked. When the desert toad is stroked near the parotid glands in the neck region, there is the squirting out of this venom and when it is allowed to dry on a hard surface it takes on the texture of rubber cement. It contains up to 15% 5-MeO-DMT, as well as N-methyl-5-methoxytryptamine, 5-MeO-NMT and Bufotenine, which have their own entries.

And here is the trivial entry. I involved myself in a small Australia/toad incident when I recently visited Sydney. There is a consistent historical record of the axiom âthe road to Hell is paved with good intentionsâ in the effort to import solutions to problems that were the unforeseen consequences of earlier imported solutions. I canât remember the decade-by-decade record but as I remember it involved, amongst other things, dogs, rabbits, viruses to control rabbits, and maybe mongooses. And cattle. Cattle had been imported in mid-century as a desired agricultural commodity, but it could not be predicted that their cow-plops would not deteriorate. There were domestic dung beetles, but they appreciated kangaroo droppings (raisin-sized) rather than cow-plops (birthday-cake sized). So the eggs of a cow-oriented dung beetle were brought in about 1970 and, after weathering the usual quarantine, were released into the ecosphere. Another beetle came in without invitation with the importation of agricultural cane. Hitch-hiking along with the cane was a cane beetle, and it had no natural enemies. The beetle proliferated, and as a solution to this infestation there was brought in a âcane toad,â the Bufo marinus (the marine toad, not the desert toad, to the eventual disappointment of the drug-oriented subculture) which was believed could provide some control over them. Well, it turned out that the beetles lived at the top of the cane stalks, and the frogs lived at the bottom. The toad didnât eat the beetles, but they did successfully reproduce and multiply, because they, too, had no natural enemies. They are today sweeping across north-eastern Australia.

In the middle of downtown Sydney, right alongside Hyde Park at Williams and College, there is the Australian Museum, with a super library of natural history which I wished to use in the pursuit of the Aborigine use of red beans. And there was a special exhibit on display of the frogs and toads of Australia, with histories, photographs, and occasional sound tracks of croakings. I spotted a panel devoted to the origins and short history of the Bufo marinus. And right in front of it was a little old lady diligently reading the text which said, approximately, that a virus was being developed at some research laboratory in South America, that would be specific for this toad and which would bring the problem under control. I wondered to myself, but just loud enough for her to hear, if this was the same virus that could cause the AIDS syndrome in the Wallaby?

She looked at me for a moment, turned, and walked away. Maybe, just maybe, another rumor of unknown origin has been launched.

**5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine** (also known as **5-MeO-DMT** ) is a [naturally-occurring](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naturally-occurring) [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is structurally related to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and [5-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-HO-DMT) ( *bufotenin* ) and is reputed to produce the most powerful and intense psychedelic states within the entire class. 5-MeO-DMT produces its effects by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain, although the precise mechanism is not known.

It is distributed in a wide variety of plant species as well as in the venom of a single toad species ( *Incilius alvarius* ). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Although little is known about its history, it is believed to have been used in South American shamanic practices for centuries. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] In modern times, both the extracts of the toad venom as well as synthetic powder form are used, primarily via [vaporization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporization) .

The synthesis and psychoactive effects were documented by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his 1997 book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"). Recent studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce mystical experiences and there is growing interest in exploring its potential therapeutic effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . 5-MeO-DMT's psychedelic effects are best compared to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) in terms of intensity (extreme) and duration (very short). However, it generally lacks a [visual geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) component and tends to produce more [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) as well as even stronger [transpersonal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transpersonal) or mystical-like effects (e.g. [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) ) than DMT.

Additionally, both mental and physical side effects are reported to occur more often with 5-MeO-DMT. These effects include significant [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) and [dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria) as well as [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [bodily discomfort](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) , and are often described as challenging and overwhelming.

Unlike DMT, which has been shown to possess minimal physiological toxicity, 5-MeO-DMT's safety profile is much less established. A small number of deaths have been linked to its use and appear to be a result of physical overdose. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Some reports suggest it may cause serotonin toxicity when combined with certain substances such as [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) ; it may also have cardiotoxic properties. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Anecdotal reports suggest that this substance is only suitable for users with extensive experience with powerful psychedelics (e.g. [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , and [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) ) and trained in their safe use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

5-MeO-DMT or 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is a ring-substituted indole [alkaloid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkaloid) molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to a terminal amine group via an ethyl side chain. 5-MeO-DMT is substituted at R 5 of its indole heterocycle with a methoxy (MeO) functional group CH 3 O−; it also contains two methyl groups CH 3 - bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (DMT).

5-MeO-DMT is the N-substituted methyl homologue of [5-MeO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-MiPT) and [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) , although it radically differs in its effects.

### Endogenous presence

5-MeO-DMT has also been shown to be produced endogenously in the human body in trace amounts, although its biological function, if any, is unclear.

## Pharmacology

5-Meo-DMT's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are primarily believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT1A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . Specifically, this molecule shows a high binding affinity for the 5-HT 1A subtype and relatively low binding for the 5-HT 2a subtype. Since common psychedelics are thought to primarily elicit their effects through 5-HT 2a receptor activity, the drug’s binding profile and how it results in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

Additional mechanisms of action such as [reuptake inhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibition) of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) are also thought to be involved to an extent. This can result in 5-MeO-DMT becoming dangerously toxic when combined with [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMA) , [SSRIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/SSRI) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) or any substance which acts as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [monoamine neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter) .

5-MeO-DMT is *O* -demethylated by polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to an active metabolite, [bufotenin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bufotenin) .

## Subjective effects

In comparison to its often relatively mild accompanying cognitive and visual effects, 5-MeO-DMT seems to have by far the most proportionally intense and overwhelming physical sensations found within the known psychedelic experience. These individual components are complex, overwhelming and seem to be equally capable of being interpreted as either extremely pleasurable and euphoric or uncomfortable and dysphoric.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - Perhaps the most remarkable sensation present in the 5-MeO-DMT experience. It increases the intensity of physical and tactile sensations to such an overwhelming extent that it can induce a sensation of sustained and repeatable full body orgasm within every nerve ending across the entire body, to a degree not found within any other psychedelic substance. The experience of this can result in the perception of having a difficulty sustaining the act of breathing. However, this is not a genuine or dangerous experience of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) and is considered to be safe, although studies into this phenomenon are lacking.

- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Nausea is perhaps more pronounced and consistently produced on 5-MeO-DMT than any other psychedelic. It is not uncommon for users to vomit while in an unconscious or semi-conscious state, which is one of the reasons supervised usage is always advised. However, some people report experiences with minimal or brief nausea. When nausea does occur, it typically disappears after the come up phase.

- **[Skin flushing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Skin_flushing)**
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of 5-MeO-DMT can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to its consistently overwhelming and intense accompanying cognitive and physical effects, 5-MeO-DMT seems to have some of the most proportionally underwhelming visual effects found within the known varieties of the psychedelic experience. 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement) or [Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - 5-MeO-DMT is equally capable of both decreasing and increasing visual acuity. The outcome of which effect will manifest seems to be chosen almost entirely at random and is largely setting dependent.
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** ( [Morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) , [Breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [Melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [Flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) ) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as identical to DMT in its style, highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip does not usually occur and in notable contrast to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , does not extend beyond level 7 at its highest state (though some experiences involving nonvisual 8b have been reported). It is vaguely similar to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) although significantly smaller in size and more likely to manifest in darkness or without distractions. In terms of appearance, it can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally organic and digital in feel, structured in organization, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equal in sharp and soft edges, small in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in its intensity. 5-MeO-DMT is unique in that in breakthrough doses, it uniquely tends to result in [8B Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) . ### Cognitive effects

- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- **Note** : For a number of individuals these effects are consistently more reproducible and powerful with smoked or vaporized 5-MeO-DMT than they are with other “classical psychedelics” such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , this is most likely due to its very intense but relatively short-lived effects. These components are unique to 5-MeO-DMT in that for a majority of its users they are significantly more likely to manifest during "breakthrough" experiences as opposed to sub-breakthrough level trips.

## Routes of administration

### Vaporization

When taken in its synthetic powder form, 5-MeO-DMT is typically [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Vaporization) , but can also be insufflated (although this is discouraged), and is active at a dose of as little as 2 mg. It has been suggested that it possesses roughly 4-5x the potency of DMT.

### Oral

As with DMT, 5-MeO-DMT has been demonstrated to be active orally when taken with an [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) , but according to numerous reports this combination tends to be extremely unpleasant, producing a strong [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) in addition to the risk of hypertensive symptoms and [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) , and is therefore strongly advised against. On both physical and psychological levels, it is considered to be substantially less safe than [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Natural sources

### Colorado River toad

The Colorado River toad ( *Incilius alvarius* ), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad, is a toad found in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. Its skin and venom contain 5-MeO-DMT and [bufotenin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bufotenin) (5-HO-DMT). Fresh venom can be collected without harm to the toad. This is done by stroking the parotid glands in the neck region onto a flat glass plate. The venom will take on the texture of rubber cement on drying, which can then be smoked. This product contains up to 15% 5-MeO-DMT, as well as [5-MeO-NMT](/w/index.php?title=5-MeO-NMT&action=edit&redlink=1) and [bufotenin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bufotenin) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

#### Dosage

Assuming that an average of at least 10% of the venom is 5-MeO-DMT:

- **Threshold:** 10 - 20 mg
- **Light:** 20 - 50 mg
- **Common:** 50 - 100 mg
- **Strong:** 100 - 200 mg

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 5-MeO-DMT do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 5-MeO-DMT has a limited history of documented human usage.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are unlikely to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Like other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelics) , 5-MeO-DMT is considered to be non-addictive with a low abuse potential. There are no literature reports of successful attempts to train animals to self-administer 5-MeO-DMT — an animal model predictive of abuse liability — indicating that it does not have the necessary pharmacology to either initiate or maintain dependence.

Tolerance to the effects of 5-MeO-DMT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 1 hour for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2 hours to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MeO-DMT does not have a cross-tolerance with other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MeO-DMT psychedelics will not have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **2C-T-X** - Both classes of compounds can be unpredictable alone.
- **2C-X** - The 5-MeO psychedelics can interact unpredictably to potentiate other psychedelics.
- **Cannabis** - May increase the risk of negative psychological effects such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **DOx** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions, particularly increasing the risk of unpleasant physical side effects.
- **MDMA** - Some of the 5-MeO tryptamines are a bit unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care.
- **Mescaline** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions.
- **NBOMe** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. This combination is best avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **Cocaine** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **DXM** - Little information exists about this combination.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **aMT** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **MAOIs** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **PCP** - Little information exists about this combination. May increase risk of psychosis and excessive stimulation.

Deaths from 5-MeO-DMT are rare. However, as a powerful [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (MRI), injury can occur when excessive doses are taken or when taken with substances such as [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMAs) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) and anything which act as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . This has resulted in well documented fatal poisonings that could otherwise have been prevented.

## Effects
The effect depends very much on the set and the setting. Blood pressure and pulse increase, pupils dilate. Detachment of the body from the mind and ego dissolution are common, near-death experiences also occur relatively often, especially when high doses are consumed. The perception of time changes greatly during intoxication. A few minutes can be perceived as very long and intense. In addition, different feelings such as fear, euphoria, etc. can be experienced within a short period of time. Consumers report immersion in very "bizarre" worlds in which connections between being, environment and matter arise. Physical perception can also be influenced, in that one feels weightless or thinks one is falling.
With 5-MeO-DMT, the potential effect is greater, but less optical than with DMT.

## Dosage
MeO-DMT must be dosed very carefully, as even a few milligrams more can cause a very intense and unpleasant effect, which can result in psychological and mental problems lasting several weeks.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The risk associated with the use of 5-MeO-DMT is mainly psychological and depends on the personality structure of the user. The perceptual changes during a trip can be so intense that especially inexperienced users feel overwhelmed by the flood of impressions. The perception of sudden emotional outbursts can also be perceived as rather disturbing and overwhelming. At high doses, such psychological side effects can be felt for days to weeks. If the rules of the set and setting are not followed, there can be false reactions, loss of orientation, panic, paranoia and horror trips. Physical side effects include nausea, vomiting, increase in heart rate, slightly accelerated breathing, increased blood pressure, pupil dilation, increased salivation, tremors, restlessness, headaches and movement disorders.

### Long-term Risks
Permanent disturbances in self- and reality recognition are possible. The view of the world can be permanently called into question, which can make it difficult to cope with everyday life. Latent (hidden) psychoses can be triggered.

## Safer Use
- Only consume when you feel good. If you are afraid of the strong effects, do not use. Do not use if you are afraid of the substance.
- Do not use 5-MeO-DMT alone! Take it in a safe atmosphere and together with experienced people you trust.
- Take 5-MeO-DMT while sitting or lying down, as physical perception and ability to move are impaired during intoxication.
- Dose carefully at first. If there is no effect, increase the dose the next time. Do not add more on the same day.
- The consumption of MAO-inhibiting foods such as matured cheese, smoked fish or meat, sauerkraut, tofu, chocolate etc. should be avoided before and after consumption.
- People with high blood pressure should not consume 5-MeO-DMT.
- A trip with 5-MeO-DMT should remain an exceptional experience. Make sure you take long breaks from using 5-MeO-DMT and talk to others about your experience so that it can be processed.

5-MeO-DMT is a psychedelic tryptamine that appears to be an endogenous drug. It can be found in many plants and is also produced by the Bufo alvarius toad.

The drug has been used for centuries in South America and the Caribbean. To this day, it is used by indigenous groups in the form of intranasal snuffs.

It can produce fully dissociative psychedelic experiences, similar to DMT. However, 5-MeO-DMT is far less visual with its effects and seems more likely to cause terror/anxiety responses.

**5-MeO-DMT** was first discovered in *Dictyoloma incanescens* and later was isolated from *Anadenanthera peregrina* as well. It occurs in a very large number of plants, often in association with [N,N-DMT](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/N,N-DMT). Its effects are somewhat more potent than those of N,N-DMT. When the two are administered simultaneously, 5-MeO-DMT more quickly occupies the specific receptors. 5-MeO-DMT is a natural neurotransmitter in the human nervous system. When 5-MeO-DMT (10 to 20 mg) is smoked or vaporized and inhaled, the effects are almost immediately apparent, are incredibly extreme, and last about ten minutes. Many people report having shamanic experiences with this substance as well as experiencing states of enlightenment and the clear light of nirvana (Metzner 1988). The Colorado River toad (*Bufo alvarius*) is native to the area around Tucson, Arizona. These toads spend nine months of the year underground, buried in the mud that keeps them protected from the burning desert sun. The toads emerge from their hiding places with the first rains and begin their courtship (Smith 1982,97-100). They remain visible for only three months. Like all toads, Bufo alvarius develops mucous secretions in two glands that are located on the neck The secretions of the Colorado River toad, however, do not contain bufotoxine, the toxic substance that is found in the secretions of most other toads. Instead, the dried mass contains 15% 5-MeO-DMT (Erspamer et al. 1965, 1967). The native tribes that lived in the North American Southwest made fetishes of this Bufo alvarius. However, it was only in recent times that the toad's cultural importance and its psychedelic use were discovered, or more likely rediscovered (cf. Davis and Weil 1992). The toad is "milked" by being held firmly without being crushed. Both glands are then massaged gently until a fat stream of the secretion squirts out. The secretion is caught on a piece of glass, where it is allowed to dry and crystallize. The yellowish crystalline mass then can be scraped off, mixed with different herbs (such as damiana [Turnera diffusa] ), and smoked. The toad, which is released unharmed, is quickly able to replenish the loss in its secretions. When taken orally, Bufo alvarius secretions are apparently toxic, whereas they are not poisonous when smoked (Weil and Davis 1994). Davis and Weil have suggested that the dried secretions of Bufo alvarius were traded to Mexico in preColumbian times and that the priests and shamans there smoked or used it in some other manner (Davis and Weil1992; cf. balche', bufotenine). In Arizona, there is now a Church of the Toad of Light, which uses the secretions of Bufo alvarius as a sacrament (Most 1984; Ott 1993,396*).

5-MeO-DMT, also known as 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, as well as O-methylbufotenin or mebufotenin, is an atypical psychedelic drug, entheogen, and alkaloid of the tryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine families. It is found naturally in a wide variety of plant species, and is also secreted by the glands of at least one toad species, the Colorado River toad (Incilius alvarius, formerly Bufo alvarius). It may occur naturally in humans as well. Like its close relatives dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), it has been used as an entheogen in South America. Slang terms include five-methoxy, the power, bufo, and toad venom. The drug has been described as the most powerful psychedelic and, by journalist Michael Pollan, as the "Mount Everest of psychedelics".
Adverse effects of 5-MeO-DMT include sickness, vomiting, headache, chest pressure, fatigue, anxiety, fear, terror, confusion, paranoia, crying, loss of awareness and motor control, and reactivations. The drug acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, among others. However, 5-MeO-DMT differs from most other serotonergic psychedelics in having much greater activity at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor in addition to the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. In relation to this, 5-MeO-DMT has been described as an "atypical" psychedelic and as producing subjective effects notably distinct from those of DMT and other psychedelics, for instance having a relative lack of visual effects. Nonetheless, 5-MeO-DMT reliably produces mystical experiences in most people who take it. Like DMT, 5-MeO-DMT is only active non-orally and has a very rapid onset and short duration. However, 5-MeO-DMT is 4- to 20-fold more potent than DMT in humans.
5-MeO-DMT was first described by 1936, was first isolated from natural sources by 1959, and was first reported to be hallucinogenic by 1970. The use of 5-MeO-DMT-containing toad venom was first described in 1984. It is a controlled substance in some countries, for instance the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The drug is used recreationally and several deaths have been reported in association with its use. Use of 5-MeO-DMT is rare compared with other psychedelics, with only 0.003% of the United States general population having reported taking it in 2019 (compared to 8.5% for psilocybin). 5-MeO-DMT is being developed for potential use in medicine in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression.

## Use and effects

5-MeO-DMT is used as a recreational drug and as an entheogen. It is not orally active, requiring a parenteral route such as smoking to produce effects. Other non-oral routes such as intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, rectal administration, sublingual administration, or intranasal administration have also less commonly been used. In addition to non-oral administration, 5-MeO-DMT can be combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as the reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) harmaline to allow for oral activity and a much longer duration than it would have otherwise. However, combination of 5-MeO-DMT with MAOIs can also result in accidental overdose, including instances of serotonin syndrome and death. In addition to pure synthetic 5-MeO-DMT, it is often used by smoking in the form of the venom taken from the Colorado River toad (Incilius alvarius, formerly Bufo alvarius and also known as the Sonoran Desert toad).
In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists 5-MeO-DMT's dose as 6 to 20 mg smoked or 2 to 3 mg by intravenous injection and its duration as 1 to 2 hours. Other sources state the dose of 5-MeO-DMT to be 2 to 15 mg smoked and its duration as 5 to 20 minutes or 12 minutes typically. It has been described as having a steep dose–response curve. 5-MeO-DMT is not orally active at doses of up to at least 35 mg and is almost always used via smoking. The onset of 5-MeO-DMT smoked is 8 seconds to 1 minute, with peak effects occurring after 2 to 3 minutes, although some report an onset or build-up of as long as 10 to 15 minutes. The main effects when smoked last about 10 minutes, with a total duration of 20 to 60 minutes. Taken by intravenous injection, the onset of 5-MeO-DMT is within 1 minute and the duration was 10 minutes in one instance. With harmaline doses of 70 to 150 mg orally, 5-MeO-DMT becomes orally active at doses of 10 to 25 mg, the onset is 15 to 18 minutes, peak effects occur after 1.5 hours, and the duration is at least 3 or 4 hours. In addition, harmaline at sufficient doses such as 150 mg or more can add its own hallucinogenic effects to the experience.
The effects of 5-MeO-DMT have been reported by Shulgin. The perceptual effects included no noticeable visual effects or sensory involvement, not seeing anything whilst eyes shut except a bright white light, inability to see in general, multi-color phosphene visuals filling entire visual field, a certain resonance of auditory perception or electrical buzzing that synchronized with visual perception, slightly diminished hearing, ear ringing, feeling barraged by stimuli, rush, and a tremendous and intense sense of speed and acceleration. Other effects included a "white-out" or "singularity" experience (as opposed to a "black-out"), mental activity almost absent, mind completely referenceless, cosmic consciousness type of experience, feelings of and longing for connection and transcendence, feeling like one is experiencing all possible thoughts and realities simultaneously, feeling like one is experiencing a very large number of objects, situations, and emotions all at once instead of only one at a time, feeling like one is an ocean, intense depersonalization, impressive recall of early memories and emotional significance of these memories, time constriction (such as experiencing 40 minutes as mere seconds), and insights.
Effects related to spatial and bodily awareness included altered body perception, normal physical perceptions dissolving away from awareness, loss of contact with one's body and surroundings, feeling like one was not there in one's body or in time, feeling like all the blood in one's body had turned to concrete, and not being able to tell if eyes were closed or open. Emotional effects included a sense of excitement, feelings of awe and wonder, feeling amazed or "blown away", feelings of love and energy, feelings of ecstasy, emotions synchronized with visuals, strong feelings of gratitude for the experience, feeling overwhelmed, feeling "scared the hell out", feeling the "energy of terror", screaming in one's head, fear of death, feeling like one had died or killed themselves, feeling at risk of psychic damage, and relief upon coming down. Further effects included an intensity greater than anything one has experienced before, simply the most intense experience possible, feeling like the entire universe had exploded through one's consciousness, feeling like there is no possibility of examining the experience, an inability to judge by any method of the mind, feeling conked on the head, little or no memory of the experience, and loss of continuity of consciousness like a black-out from too much alcohol.
Behavioral effects included falling over while sitting, curling up in a fetal position, squirming and writhing around, making frightening noises, and alarming other people. Physical side effects included physical weakness, shakiness, tremors, shivers emanating from the head, center, or heart, and slight nausea. The taste when smoking was described as mild, with none of the plastic taste of dimethyltryptamine (DMT). In the case of an unspecified large overdose smoked, the person lapsed into a coma-like state, their face turned purple, they stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated multiple times, and they experienced a several-day psychosis necessitating antipsychotics.
5-MeO-DMT was described by Shulgin as being remarkably potent, more potent than DMT, and as having a slightly faster onset than DMT when smoked. More specifically, it is 4- to 20-fold more potent than DMT. The drug is said to be a very strong and quite intense hallucinogen. There is an ability to break through to a similar space as DMT, but it is said to be "more like receiving grace" and to be much more relaxed than DMT and less terrifying. One report commented that 5-MeO-DMT was like adding the MDMA (ecstasy) experience to DMT. 5-MeO-DMT was one of the only psychedelics in TiHKAL that resulted in a plus-four experience on the Shulgin Rating Scale. Another psychedelic tryptamine that produced similar effects to 5-MeO-DMT was 5-MeO-MiPT at sufficiently high doses smoked. 5-MeO-DMT seems to be like a cross between DMT and 5-MeO-pyr-T in terms of its effects. The latter shares many commonalities with 5-MeO-DMT, but has few or no psychedelic effects and has pronounced negative effects. Other 5-methoxytryptamines like 5-MeO-DET and 5-MeO-DPT were plagued by dose-limiting side effects that resulted in Shulgin having an unfavorable impression of them, whereas 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-DALT produced only light psychedelic effects.
In other published sources besides TiHKAL, the subjective effects of 5-MeO-DMT are described as distinct from those of DMT and other psychedelics. Whereas DMT is described as producing more "information-rich" experiences, with "rich sensory phenomenology", visuals, and experiences of encountering entities and visiting other worlds, 5-MeO-DMT is described as having a relative lack of visual effects, producing a sense of "nothingness", and causing experiences that are said to be "content-free" and sometimes known as "whiteouts". These experiences have been described as "beyond ordinary human comprehension", with a subjective impression of a void or amnesia of the experience. In spite of this however, some have described the experiences as orgasmic, ecstatic, and blissful, whereas others have described them as terror or "information overwhelm". As with DMT and other psychedelics, the experiences with 5-MeO-DMT are often described as overwhelming, profound, spiritual, religious, and/or mystical. The experiences of 5-MeO-DMT have also been related to the experience of ecstatic seizures. 5-MeO-DMT has been described as the most powerful psychedelic and by Michael Pollan as the "Mount Everest of psychedelics".
The phenomenology of 5-MeO-DMT given intransally has been formally clinically studied in a phase 1 clinical trial more recently. It is described as having a rapid onset of 8 to 15 minutes, a short duration of 45 to 60 minutes, distinctive subjective effects from other psychedelics, a relative lack of visual effects, strong emotional and bodily experiences, emotional breakthroughs, and personal insights, among other effects.

## Adverse effects

5-MeO-DMT has various possible adverse effects.

## Overdose

There have been cases of death with 5-MeO-DMT. The estimated lethal dose of 5-MeO-DMT relative to a typical recreational dose in humans is unknown. The median lethal dose (LD50) in animals varies widely, ranging from 1 to 5 mg/kg i.v. in sheep to 48 mg/kg i.v. in mice. In one case, combination of 5-MeO-DMT with harmala alkaloids, which act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as well as with other drugs, resulted in death. However, the exact contribution of 5-MeO-DMT in this case is difficult to determine.

## Interactions

5-MeO-DMT can be strongly potentiated by combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). In addition, it can become orally active with an extended duration in combination with MAOIs. These interactions have the potential to result in serious toxicity and death.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

5-MeO-DMT is a methoxylated derivative of dimethyltryptamine (DMT). While most common psychedelics are believed to primarily elicit psychological effects through agonism of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, 5-MeO-DMT shows 1,000-fold greater affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. In line with its affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, 5-MeO-DMT is extremely potent at suppressing the firing of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neurons. Further, its activity in rats was attenuated with the selective serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635, while selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist volinanserin failed to demonstrate any change. Additional mechanisms of action such as inhibition of monoamine reuptake may also be involved in its effects.
Similarly to other serotonergic psychedelics, 5-MeO-DMT is a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors, among others. It shows pronounced biased agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. The drug is 4- to 10-fold more potent as a hallucinogen than DMT in humans. In contrast to most serotonergic psychedelics however, it has been said that it is unclear that the hallucinogenic effects of 5-MeO-DMT are principally mediated by activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. In any case, 5-MeO-DMT does still activate the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and does still produce psychedelic effects. It has been proposed that 5-MeO-DMT be considered an "atypical" psychedelic. This relates to the fact that 5-MeO-DMT has 100- to 1,000-fold selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and that the actions of 5-MeO-DMT appear to be primarily mediated by serotonin 5-HT1A receptor activation. For example, the potencies of drugs substituting for 5-MeO-DMT in drug discrimination assays is well-correlated with their serotonin 5-HT1A receptor affinities, and the discriminative stimulus effects of 5-MeO-DMT are attenuated by serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonists. However, there is partial generalization of 5-MeO-DMT to the selective serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist (–)-DOM in animals. In accordance with the preceding findings, 5-MeO-DMT is reported to produce notably distinct subjective effects compared to DMT and other psychedelics in humans.
Although 5-MeO-DMT shows dramatically higher affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor than for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the situation appears to be very different in terms of its actual activational potencies at these receptors. Its EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration values have been found to be 1.80 to 3.87 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and 3.92 to 1,060 nM at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. For comparison, the EC50 values of DMT were found to be 38.3 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and >10,000 nM at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor in one of the same studies. Hence, 5-MeO-DMT appears to be similarly potent or as much as 200-fold more potent as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor than of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. In addition, 5-MeO-DMT is 10-fold more potent than DMT as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
Besides the serotonin receptors, 5-MeO-DMT is an agonist of the melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors. Unlike DMT, 5-MeO-DMT is not a ligand or agonist of the sigma receptors. In contrast to certain other tryptamines, 5-MeO-DMT is inactive as a monoamine releasing agent, including of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. However, it is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with an IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration value of 2,184 nM. Conversely, it is inactive as a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = >10,000 nM).
Similarly to DMT, but in contrast to most other psychedelics, like LSD and psilocybin, there appears to be very little development of tolerance with 5-MeO-DMT. In fact, there may even be sensitization to the effects of 5-MeO-DMT. The lack of tolerance development with 5-MeO-DMT may be due to biased agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. More specifically, 5-MeO-DMT activates the Gq signaling pathway of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with much less potency in recruiting β-arrestin2. Activation of β-arrestin2 is linked to receptor downregulation and tachyphylaxis.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

5-MeO-DMT is not orally active and must be administered parenterally.

#### Distribution

5-MeO-DMT is lipophilic and is thought to easily cross the blood–brain barrier. Accordingly, 5-MeO-DMT readily accumulates in the brain in animals with levels higher than in blood. This is in notable contrast to bufotenin (5-HO-DMT or N,N-dimethylserotonin) and serotonin (5-HT), which are hydrophilic and have varying degrees of peripheral selectivity.

#### Metabolism

Bufotenin is an active metabolite of 5-MeO-DMT, formed by O-demethylation by cytochrome P450 CYP2D6. Bufotenin notably has much higher affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor than 5-MeO-DMT itself. However, bufotenin does not seem to be extensively produced from 5-MeO-DMT in the brain. In addition, peripherally formed bufotenin is less able to exert central effects due to its relative peripheral selectivity in terms of crossing into the brain. Hence, the involvement of bufotenin in the psychoactive effects of 5-MeO-DMT is uncertain.
The metabolism of 5-MeO-DMT can be dramatically reduced and its levels markedly augmented and prolonged by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). In addition, MAOIs allow 5-MeO-DMT to become orally active in humans. Combining 5-MeO-DMT with MAOIs has sometimes resulted in serotonin syndrome and death in humans.

#### Elimination

The elimination half-life of 5-MeO-DMT, administered sublingually, was found to be 28 minutes.

## Chemistry

5-MeO-DMT, also known as 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine derivative. It is the 5-methoxylated derivative of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the N,N-dimethylated derivative of 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT; mexamine), and the O-methylated derivative of bufotenin (5-HO-DMT).

### Properties

5-MeO-DMT has a relatively high experimental log P of 3.30.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 5-MeO-DMT has been described.

### Analogues and derivatives

Analogues and derivatives of 5-MeO-DMT include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT or 5-MeO-T), 5-MeO-NMT, 5-MeO-MET, 5-MeO-DET, 5-MeO-MPT, 5-MeO-EPT, 5-MeO-DPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-EiPT, 5-MeO-PiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-MALT, 5-MeO-DALT, 5-MeO-pyr-T, 5-EtO-DMT, 5-MeO-2-TMT (2-methyl-5-MeO-DMT), EMDT (2-ethyl-5-MeO-DMT), psilomethoxin (4-hydroxy-5-MeO-DMT; 5-methoxypsilocin), 5-MeO-AMT, α,N,N,O-TeMS (5-MeO-α,N,N-TMT), 4-MeO-DMT, 6-MeO-DMT, 7-MeO-DMT, and dimemebfe (5-MeO-BFE), among others.

## Natural occurrence

### Plants

There are various known plant sources of 5-MeO-DMT.

### Toads

Incilius alvarius, formerly known as Bufo alvarius and also known as the Colorado River toad or as the Sonoran Desert toad, is a noted animal source of 5-MeO-DMT, first described in Bufo Alvarius: the Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran Desert in 1984 by Ken Nelson (writing under the pseudonym of Albert Most). Smoking the parotoid secretions of the animal produces a powerful and short-lived psychedelic experience. The smoking of I. alvarius secretions should not be confused with the urban legend of toad licking. Since 1983, the animal has become a popular source of 5-MeO-DMT for recreational or spiritual purposes. Unfortunately, this increased demand and use of the toads as a source of 5-MeO-DMT has put strain on their populations. Concerned with the ecological impacts of the growing use of I. alvarius secretions as a source of 5-MeO-DMT, Ken Nelson would later advocate for the use of synthetic 5-MeO-DMT and conservation of the Colorado River Toad.

### Fungi

Fungal sources of 5-MeO-DMT include Amanita citrina and Amanita porphyria.

## History

5-MeO-DMT was first synthesized by Toshio Hoshino in 1935. It was isolated from the flowering plant Dictyoloma incanescens in 1959. The drug was subsequently isolated from numerous other plant, fungal, and animal sources over time. The behavioral effects of 5-MeO-DMT in animals were first reported by 1961. In 1965, 5-MeO-DMT was reported to be the main component of the hallucinogenic snuff known variously as parica, epena, or yakee that is prepared and used from the resin of the Virola theiodora tree by indigenous people in Northern South America. It was isolated from the toad Incilius alvarius (formerly Bufo alvarius and also known as the Sonoran Desert toad, Colorado River toad, or simply bufo) by Vittorio Erspamer by 1965.
Alexander Shulgin briefly reported that 5-MeO-DMT was hallucinogenic in humans, via parenteral but not oral routes, in 1970, with additional details published later on. Albert Most, real name Ken Nelson, was the first to describe the use of Incilius alvarius toad venom as a psychedelic in his published pamphlet Bufo Alvarius: the Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran Desert in 1984. Subsequently, Andrew Weil and Wade Davis, in part citing the pamphlet, described the psychoactive effects of the toad in the scientific literature in 1992. In addition, they described the finding as the first instance of a psychedelic from an animal source to be discovered. Recreational use of the toads, beyond the pamphlet, was encountered by the late 1980s and became a media sensation. 5-MeO-DMT became a controlled substance in the United States in 2009.

## Society and culture

### Names

5-MeO-DMT is the common informal name of the drug and an acronym of one of its chemical names. Mebufotenin is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name. Other names can include O-methylbufotenin, O-methyl-5-HO-DMT, and O,N,N-trimethylserotonin.

### Religious use

The Church of the Tree of Life, founded in California in 1971 by John Mann but now defunct, declared the use of 5-MeO-DMT to be a sacrament. From approximately 1971 to the late 1980s, 5-MeO-DMT was discreetly available to its members. Between 1970 and 1990, smoking of 5-MeO-DMT on parsley was probably one of the two most common forms of ingestion in the United States.

### Legal status

#### Australia

As a structural analog of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-MeO-DMT is a Schedule 9 prohibited substance under the Poisons Standard.

#### Canada

5-MeO-DMT is legal for personal use and possession in Canada, though sale, distribution, and other activities involving the substance are illegal under Canadian federal law.

#### China

As of October 2015, 5-MeO-DMT is a controlled substance in China.

#### Germany

#### Sweden

The Swedish government classified 5-MeO-DMT, listed as 5-metoxi-N,N-dimetyltryptamin (5-MeO-DMT) in their regulation SFS 2004:696, as "health hazard" under the Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) in October 2004, making it illegal to sell or possess.

#### Turkey

5-MeO-DMT has been controlled in Turkey since December 2013.

#### United States

5-MeO-DMT was made a Schedule I controlled substance in January 2011.

## Research

Preliminary clinical findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT might have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.
A 2019 European study with 42 volunteers showed that a single inhalation of 5-MeO-DMT produced sustained enhancement of satisfaction with life, and easing of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A 2018 study found that a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT induced neurogenesis in mice.

### Depression

5-MeO-DMT is being developed and evaluated for potential therapeutic effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Biopharmaceutical company GH Research has sponsored a completed phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and phase 1/2 study in TRD patients where 87.5% of patients with TRD were brought into remission on day 7 in the phase 2 part of the study. GH Research is currently planning a phase 2b study in TRD patients and have received approval for studies in patients with bipolar II disorder and a current depressive episode and patients with postpartum depression.
In February 2025, GH Research announced that their Phase 2b clinical trial of GH001, met its primary endpoint in patients with TRD. The trial demonstrated a placebo-adjusted reduction of 15.5 points on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at day 8, with 57.7% of patients achieving remission compared to 0% in the placebo group. The trial also met all secondary endpoints, and the treatment was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported.
Beckley Psytech in collaboration with King's College London is evaluating the safety and tolerability of intranasal 5-MeO-DMT in healthy subjects, in a phase 1 study. Beckley Psytech CEO Cosmo Feilding-Mellen sees a potential in the short-acting nature of 5-MeO-DMT compared to psilocybin: "Requiring one or two therapists to sit in a room with a single patient for the entire duration of an MDMA or psilocybin experience, which is essentially a whole working day, is probably going to be very resource-intensive and expensive. There is already a global shortage of psychotherapists, and this poses a potential bottleneck to patient access in the future."
Ultra-short-acting psychedelics like dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and 5-MeO-DMT may be advantageous compared to longer-acting psychedelics like psilocybin in terms of practicality for use as therapeutic interventions in clinical settings.
Concerns have been raised about the potential use of 5-MeO-DMT in medicine due to the extreme and frequently challenging natures of the experiences.
