Isoproscaline or 4-isopropoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is an analogue of mescaline. It is closely related to proscaline and was first synthesized by David E. Nichols and colleagues. It produces psychedelic effects.

## Use and effects

Little is known about the psychopharmacological effects of isoproscaline. In his book PiHKAL, Alexander Shulgin lists a psychedelic dose as being 40–80 mg, with effects lasting 10–16 hours.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The mechanism that produces the hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects of isoproscaline is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines.

## Chemistry

Isoproscaline is in a class of compounds commonly known as phenethylamines, and the full chemical name is 2-(4-isopropoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of isoproscaline has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of isoproscaline include mescaline, escaline, proscaline, allylescaline, and methallylescaline, among others.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

Isoproscaline is unscheduled in the United States; however, because of its close similarity in structure and effects to mescaline, possession and sale of isoproscaline may be subject to prosecution under the Federal Analog Act.
In the UK, its highly likely that this compound would be covered by the "phenylethylamine amendment" to the misuse of drugs act likely rendering it a Class A controlled drug.
