I went ahead and consolidated a lot of the existing threads as there were just dozens of them over the years and I wanted to shrink the size of the directory, so instead of 15 or whatever I brought it down to a manageable 3, and opened V.4 starting here. 


Thanks to all of my predecessors, in particular CH, for all of the work put into compiling this information about this useful substance that has saved so many peoples lives and assisted so many in their recovery from opioid addiction.

Week two of zubsolv starts today. Still going smoothly, been taking it as prescribed, 5.7mg 2x a day. I used to just dose mg 16mg Suboxone all at once, but I'm hoping that dosing twice just gets me more coverage throughout the days instead of just having one large more strong dose.

Hi, I know I'm in the wrong forum but there aren't many people on. I have been off Fetty for almost 4 days. I drink and in going through alcohol withdrawal. Would Suboxone help with the alcohol withdrawals? Please help

I've been on 8mg Suboxone for almost 6 months. My Dr. asked me to try lowering the dose. I don't intend to quit and still feel good on the current dose. I would like to get to 4mg and stay there for life. This morning I made my first cut. Just a 1/2 mg. I would like to hear from somebody with the experience. Someone who has already been through this process. How long (approximately) should I wait before increasing the tapering to 1mg? Without having withdrawal symptoms like depression or insomnia. ![🤔](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png)

If you are able I would cut .5 mg every two weeks.   shouldn't even notice it really.

It won't alleviate the alcohol withdrawals completely but could bring you some comfort. Suboxone helped me immensely when I was going through severe benzo withdrawal. Just as long as you're far enough removed from opioid use which is sounds like you are.

Unfortunately I am not. After just 3 days I quit tapering. Headache was so intense and I don't have anything to ease the pain. As I quit oxy and codeine all that is available is paracetamol and ibuprofen. Which is a joke. Maybe is 8mg a perfect dose for me? I'll talk to my Dr. but I know that he will suggest Sublocade, which is out of question. I prefer to have control over my life but when you get an injection you are helpless for the next 30 days.

Hey man, I have been through it, and I cut down from 16mg to nothing in the period of a month or so maybe. And I was on it for a similar amount of time, in fact I have done that at least twice now. I never experienced crippling headaches or any issues and I never dropped in as small of amounts as just .5mg, but that is just my experience. 


If you really aren't ready to come off it, or off of that dose, there is no reason you should have to or that your doctor should be making you. If your doctor is insisting maybe you ought to find a new one, because that's not fair to you.

Thanks mate. That's exactly what I think. My Dr.  is really a good guy and he won't force me to tapper it down if I'm not ready. But I will give it a try one more time when I feel that I can do it. I'm not in a hurry and most of my problems have gone away. I am more than happy to feel like this until the end of my life. Small side effects like a constipation are easily managed.

I will give it a one more try when I feel ready. First I have to figure out is the headache results of my tapering or is it something else? I have a long history of the sinuses problems so it's maybe it? Anyway, "don't fix something that is not broken" is still my favourite. All the best mate. ![✌️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270c.png)

Anytime. Yeah I've dealt with the constipation in a super terrible way, I get it really bad. My regular doc prescribed myralax, but I've heard some bad stuff regarding potential toxicity of that medicine, so I'm now wary to take it daily. But I basically have to have something for it. Otherwise it gets... Ugly. 


So I've got some senna and milk of magnesia as well, I'm gonna see how those work out for me.

Soak 5-6 pitted prunes in a glass of water. Just enough to cover them. Leave it all day and in the evening eat the prunes and drink the water(which will turn into juice) Do it regularly and see does it help?

Don't buy the juice in the supermarket. It's not pure and doesn't have enough fibre. Soaked pitted prunes are much more effective, healthier and cheaper. Just put them in glass and cover with water. (In the morning). In the evening eat the prunes and drink remaining water. That's all. Try to do it on the regular basis. I was on oxy and codeine for more than 10 years and this stuff made my life easier. Stool softeners from the pharmacy didn't work at all.

Hey, I'm curious what you've heard about mirilax?

I too had it prescribed for dealing with the constipation of subs. But I quit taking it after a year or two cause I felt subconsciously that there probably was something toxic about it & now I see your comment here.

We don't have that in Australia, but I  use something similar called Movicol. It's a stool softener. It comes in little satchets which you mix with water and take 3-4 times per day. Sometimes it's work after the day 1,but usually you have to take it for a 3-4 days. If its an emergency and nothing else works I use [Dulcolax](https://dulcolax.com.au/products/suppositories/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlp3y9JeL-gIVjAkrCh2DlQ9REAAYASAAEgIqqvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). It's a bullet shaped piece of vax(or something similar) which you have to put down there. It's not a pleasant feeling but it works within 30 minutes.

No, not particularly. I've actually decided to start tapering off now. Tired of being trapped in the cycle.

Zub has a higher bioavailabilty formulation, so the doses are lower but still equivalent. For example 5.7mg zub is 8mg Sub. The tablets for Zub just dissolve easier, work better, and don't taste like ass, in my experience anyway.

Interesting! I wonder how ZUB compares to parking a SUB buccally as if it were a little ball of chewing tobacco, between your cheek and gums of your jaw, then dripping a drop of EVERCLEAR in the same spot, then pushing against your cheek with your finger to push the bupe into the openings being made in those parts of your mouth by alcohol? Lol, seems so complicated when I write it out! 

Am I the only one to ever try this, this poor-mans Zubsolv? Lol!

Hi Man67,

It's just a shot in the dark. I figured that it would work better since it appears that bioavailability is quite increased by adding a tiny bit of alcohol, and because the best way to let the bupe coat your mouth for the longest amount of time is to park it like a chew between the lower gums and the cheek.


It seems that placing the strip under the tongue only rarely goes as hoped. Only if your mouth is exceedingly dry and your are super dehydrated does sublingual placement make sense. But that's not a fun state to be in IME (dehydrated). Better to be fully hydrated AND improve bioavailability to the max ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I always rinse my mouth with a tiny bit of water before taking Subs. Should I try it with the dry mouth (when I wake up)?  Is it Bupe more potent that way? ![🤔](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png)

lol, not certain. At the end of the day, making it less bioavailable could help keep tolerance low, so I find the best path to take a mystery.

After my tolerance for oxy jumped from 40mg. Day to hundreds all of a sudden I knew I was in shit, with no supply available and no detox’s either I went and took morphine witnessed everyday at a pharmacy through this clinic here. anyways it’s become a huge hassle  and now I’m more than happy to not have to witness dose my morphine everyday and be done with all this… they sold me on suboxone finally I guess I cab have a month prescription and get some freedom so here we are 


Just started suboxone micro induction a few days ago, I’m up to 2 2mg tablets twice a day now. It jumps up pretty fast to an eventual dose of 24 daily within 6 more days… i was and am taking 1200mg of Eslon and about 200-300mg of oxy snorted a day. Eventually it’s all getting cutoff when I reach maximum dose, Now I got a couple questions guys i really need a clear answer on. 


How do I get the least naloxone while taking my suboxone? Swallow spit? Rinse my mouth out after? Etc


What’s the best time to take my suboxone? I’ve been taking it about 11 hours after my last morphine dose, then I take one of my twice a day morphine doses after. This way in my mind the suboxone is coming when I’m at the peak possible withdrawal.. being as I take it twice a day and so on.. get it? 


Ok any other tips would be good I know exactly zero people on this stuff so I’m counting on you guys haha. Most of my buddies that use just buy a lot of fent at once and smoke it as they like. I’m the only guy who kept spending thousands a month on oxy roughly 7grand a month

Not sure about Naloxone but plenty of people use a spit method. I tried and haven't seen any difference. Even if you manage to do that you won't get high. They have Sublocade injection which is pure Bupe and it's taken once a month. Nobody got high so far. You will get the best effect if you take your strip on an empty stomach. That's why l take it first thing in the morning. Right after l wake up. And remember the golden rule of 15. No food or drink 15 minutes before taking Subs and 15 minutes after the strip disolves. Good luck! ![✌️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270c.png)

I try to keep the strip as far as possible from my teeth. Every single one has a filling and l'm afraid that the acid is gonna ruin them. I wish l have enough money to fix them or put an implant. So under the tongue remains my only option. I heard that some people mix it with water in a tiny spoon and then snort it. Anybody tried that method? ![🤔](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png)

I just got started on suboxone yesterday.

Going from MS Contin to Suboxone.

It is rough.


Will this incessant sweating stop?

is that just at first or maybe it is due to pain? IDK.

My body is not liking this but it is all I can get now.

No reason at all for this torture if you are not in chronic pain.


I wish I could just be rid of this but that is not an option anymore.

Don't worry about the sweating. I was the same for the first 2-3 months. The most important thing at the beginning is to figure out the right dose. My Dr. got me started at 16mg and I am now at 4mg. I tried going down to 2mg but it was too low and my chronic headache was killing me. Everyone is different so you are the one who will decide what's right for you. And by the way, larger dose doesn't mean bigger high. On the contrary. Good luck. ![✌️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270c.png)

Honestly, I am feeling better in a lot of ways.

My sex drive is kicking back in, I can move better, and I actually have less back and leg pain.

I feel alert and good right now.


The suboxone has made me tired for last 3 days, but I was exhausted after going through 8 days morphine and gabapentin withdrawal.

Just don't give up. The begging is the hardest part. When you figure out the optimal dose everything will be much better. You don't have to wait for your Dr. to tell you when to start tapering. You can do it yourself. But remember, do it slowly. No more than a 25% at the time. For example if you tapper down from 8mg don't try to immediately go to 4mg. First get to the 6mg and stay on it for a week. Then you can go to 4mg. Bupe is a powerful stuff and side effects can be very uncomfortable. Also try the spit method for the headache. Put the strip under your tongue and keep it there for at least 15-20 minutes. After that try to get all your saliva together and spit it out. It helps a bit. All the best. ![✌️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270c.png)

Hi, just wanted to show support for your ordeal! I have been on several different doses of sub, including 16mg, where I am today. I did not notice that lower doses = bigger euphoria. I think the key is to let it be in the background of your life and instead focus on finding new interests or hobbies that are also euphoric in their own way, like playing an instrument or building an IG account full of photos of whatever... one benefit of building your tolerance to bupe's effects is that you can dose lateer at night without it keeping you from falling asleep, or I should say, that is what I've found.

Thank you. Very much. ![❤️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2764.png)

I am sending you some love, for your ordeal as well.

It has been a journey.

It still is.


Every bit of advise and support is priceless. 


I found the same as you, regarding the suboxone.

I am needing 16 mg every 8 hours right now.

I already used like 1 or 2 too many pills.


Thanksgiving was hard to get through.

It stressed me out some, with all my relatives looking at me and just the noise, the kids, too much food and stimulation for me right now. I bailed out on the 2 episodes of The Grinch.

That is okay though. I went and had a nice dinner and stuff. 

It is surreal to me right now.

It feels like I have been in a coma for 10 years and am just coming around.


I need to take this slow.

This is going to be a process.

One that I do not want to mess up.

I want to be better. 

I am so glad I want to and am doing better. 

Just need to not let the holidays wreck me.

I always have a hard time with the holidays.

I agree that I need to let this be in the background and to find new hobbies.

I love music. Maybe I will take up an instrument. IDK...

I am going to have to think about what I would like to do.

It is amazing that I feel good enough to play an instrument or something...

I feel the same way.

I always have a problem at Christmas.

It is a lot of pressure. 

I prefer to hang out on my compiter island. ![😁](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f601.png)![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)


Well, I am worried because I have got to go back to the doctor on Monday.

I barely have enough Subutex to make it till Then. 

I will have to take half of what I have been til Monday. 

Worried I will have withdrawal from that.


I have been needing 24 mg every 8 hours, so twice a day- 24 mg of Subutex.

I went back after 7 days and told her this and she said “oh, good!”.

But she wrote my prescription out for one 8 mg pill 3 times a day. 

So, that is less than I have been needing.

I am trying to manage chronic pain and just came from 90 mg a day morphine.

I think she will give me a new script. ![🙏](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f64f.png)

But, I am worried the pharmacy won’t fill it.

They will if it is a dosage adjustment right?


Hell me guys.

How long can I squeeze out of Suboxone before having withdrawal from that?

16mg was my initial dose after being 15 years on Oxy. And it worked. Never felt any withdrawal side effects. According to the studies Suboxone has a ceiling effect. Quote: "Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect, i.e., **the linear relationship between the dose and the effect disappears at doses greater than 24 mg per day**." According to this you should be fine at the current dose. 24 mg occupies 97% brain receptors so anything more than that should make no difference. Good luck ![✌️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270c.png)

ps. I am also most comfortable on my "compiter island ". I have no desire to communicate with people at all.

I believe it could. 

I've never witnessed it first hand, but pharmacologically speaking, both the bupe & naloxone in a Suboxone should be able to help reverse a full agonist OD, because it will rip it off the receptors.

Bupe takes a long time to kick in. That person has a high chance to die if your going to wait on Bupe. Under the tongue is like 30-60 minutes. You will need a narcan injection or nasal spray. 


If someone tried this on me when I oD on fent, I'd be dead im sure. 


Also I've seen this asked a lot on reddit. The answer is no. Too long to kick in. Unless you can manage to iv it.

I’m where H is H and doctor who told me that saved enough people for me to think that’s not bs in case of H od..


Surely nartlexone is 100x times better but it’s not available like in US so if someone OD’s and has just bupe around it could still save life. Certainly better than just calling ambulance and waiting who knows how long.

Obviously you would need to use the bupe/naloxone intranasally or IV.

Not at all. All that is left in your mouth is pure naloxone.

I take 90mg morphine a day but since I don't have a prescription it is burning a hole in my pocket. There's these TRANSTEC 20mg patches of bupe that last a week. I suffer from chronic pain but also want a bit of euphoria/some sort of antidepressant effects. Is there a buzz from bupe at such low doses? And how good it Is for pain?

Tyvm in advance.

Sorry to be the one to tell you, but highly unlikely on both counts

your  senses being familiar with full agonists you may feel a little tickle at first but will fade into oblivion


Possibly a little anti depressant effect after months of nothing

Yes of course.


But it depends on many things.

Do you have a current tolerance to morphine & full agonists?

If so, then all you're going to get is some withdrawal relief from buprenorphine.

If you have low to no tolerance currently though, then yes, you will get high/antidepressant effects from bupe at low doses.

It won't be the in the your face, totally blissed out feeling that you get on full agonists though.


And the pain relief is a lot more subpar than full agonists, but it's there in some aspects. You can up the dose for more pain relief too, but the higher you go, the more you risk blocking other opioids for atleast 48hrs.


I've seen people with no tolerance completely nodding & puking their guts out on as low as .5mg of bupe for over 12hrs.

It's a potent, but less euphoric partial agonist & I think you'll be disappointed with it. But it's nice to have around for withdrawal purposes or a rainy day.

I'll always prefer full agonists, but I'd say buprenorphine is an OK opioid for when you wanna just stay stable & save your money, etc.. 


On a scale, If heroin was a 10 and codeine was 1, I'd place buprenorphine at about maybe a 3  or 4 as far as pain relief/recreation goes.

I'm fucked up then, I've been an IV user for years. My tolerance rn is low, but im no newbie to opiates. My guess is, I'd probably feel it for a couple days and then just wd relief. Mhmmm, still it's an option tho. Perhaps I could try one patch and see how it goes.

Hate to be the one to say it man, but if you've got an IV morphine habit that bad, I would try and just get stable on a maintenance med for a bit. It does kind of ease the pain of withdrawal if done right. But that stable feeling is actually nice in a sense after going months/years however long with the up/down well/sick lifestyle that comes to being addicted to opioids. 


I found it eventually still became a crutch for me that I still didn't want. I tapered off completely and was opioid free for a while. But now I've been back to dosing kratom somewhat regularly. It's a difficult line to walk man, being an opioid addict.

It's either that or kratom. I found a couple kratom vendors in my country. What about thst? If it's any good, which kratom color should I go for? I want the most sedative/better for pain one,  I heard the red one is the best for that.

Which kratom strain do u recommend? I'm about to buy 100g tomorrow, first time I'm gonna try it after all these years. I'm not iving rn, I USED to and ocasionally do the ODD shot but I'm currently stuck on 90mg morphine pills. It's drilling a hole on my pocket tho, that's y I'm asking for alternatives. I'm looking at either bupe or kratom to get off the morph for a while.

Yeah it can't hurt to at least give it a shot!

The low doses in the patches won't block any other opioids either, so you won't have to worry about that. That way if you decide bupe isn't for you, you can go back to full agonists.


Keep in mind though that like 0.02mcg of buprenorphine is equivalent to like 10mg of morphine. So you could actually raise your tolerance to morphine if your bupe dose goes too high and for less effects. Bupe is extremely potent. 2mg is equal to like 80mg of oxycodone or some shit  like that. Although it won't give the same level of pain relief as 80mg of oxycodone, it can still raise your tolerance to that level.


Also, buprenorphine is a kappa-antagonist. It's theorized that kappa antagonism can help with depression through blocking dynorphins, which are responsible for making you feel dysphoric & shitty. So if it's truly some anti-depressant effect you're after, you might be able to appreciate this quality, as most other opioids do not share this kaapa antagonism.


But you're right. I bet it'll feel alright for a day or two but after a few days, bupe will probably just make you feel tired, if that.

If your tolerance is low right now though, you might be able to enjoy it. 


When I used bupe with low tolerance, it actually had me nodding hard. Even while standing up at work one day. lol

There were times I use to buy buprenorphine instead of heroin, cause it was cheaper & with no tolerance bupe can feel almost as good & keep you from feeling sick for longer. 

But once you're used to it, it becomes one of the more boring & unreliable opioids. 


Good luck man! Hope it works for you for your wallets sake!

I'm actually looking into kratom now, the red strains have caught my attention and it's even cheaper than bupe. I wanna get back on my feet and stabilize myself, like [@deficiT](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/185147/) said living on that rollercoaster of UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN it gets quite tiresome. Until i can't reach a maintenance suitable dose of something I can't be productive or do my own shit. All my attention goes to how the fk am I gonna get money for the next pills. And tbh sobriety is not an option for me anymore, just hope kratom works.

Good luck with the kratom man!

I've never been able to get it to work. I mean it has effects for me.,but they never feel like "opioid" effects.

I've tried a million different brands, from organic online vendors to crappy headshop kratom. It has never done fuck all for me, even without a tolerance.

I've tried a  kratom extract shot before & it definitely had some mild opioid effects, but I still couldn't see how it would totally satisfy a heavy opioid user.

And it was like $10-20 bucks for that 1 shot (which would get expensive quick for me) And I couldn't imagine having to down something that nasty tasting every 4hrs. lol

But everyone's different, so..

Kratom has a pretty short half life though.

So if you're looking to get away from the up & down dosing, you're still gonna have to dose it every couple of hours.

And depending on what type of kratom you have, it can be disgusting choking back all that plant powder every few hours.

You'd probably have just been better off sticking with bupe due to it's long half life, if it's the ups & downs you're worried about.

But give it a shot.

Even kratom doesn’t last long that doesn’t mean you need to do it many times a day. You do if you want to be high all the time but it’s totally possible to take it once or twice a day an keep it that way.


Passing trough bupe WDs would be a thing first for sure. And it isn’t likely that bupe didn’t ruined it for a long time to come, but still might be worth trying.


As for your case where bupe ruined you high on tramadol. I think bupe ruins pretty much any other opiod in reasonable doses for a very long time even after you stop it. And it ruins other opiates very fast too, you don’t even need to get addicted to it.

Idc about the dosing, as long as I'm not sick. Red vein kratom

I actually meant more about the lifestyle of being stressed the fuck out about where to get the moneyfor the next fix, then ure high for a few days, then ure fucked up 3 days wding, then ur up again, then u fucked up again etc. THAT KINDA UP AND DOWN rollercoaster bullshit

I don't mind redosing 2-3 times a day and don't mind about the taste either. Nothing can taste worse than tramadol fucking drops.

You say that now lol, most.people I've seen try and take kratom, even mixed in a beverage don't like it. They tend to like the effects though. I remember the first time I had kratom my opioid tolerance wasn't nearly as high, it felt like it had me nodding and everything.

Cool, sounds more like you just wanna disagree with any opinion I give, so do whatever you want.


Kratom's weaker than buprenorphine anyway, so if you didn't like bupe, don't expect much from kratom. Especially any "antidepressant" relief.

I mean you said at first you wanted antidepressant effects, now it's just 'withdrawal relief' & then it's because of the money, etc.... So which is it? Cause I think I touched all of those boxes anyway in  my answers.


Unless kratom is free where you're at, you're just gonna be burning a hole in your pocket to stay well on that, when any given dose of buprenorphine can last 24-48hrs. You say you don't care about dosing, but you also say you don't wanna be burning a hole in your pocket by having to dose all the time. So both statements contradict each other & come off like you're just being condescending toward me.


I literally have bags & bags of kratom sitting around. If it actually did anything worth while, it wouldn't still be in my possession.


Kratom is literally so weak that it's still legal here in the US. If it was even comparable to genuine opioids, it would have been made illegal along time ago.


We went from, "*Does buprenorphine cause a buzz/antidepressant effect"* to *"Oh I don't care about a buzz! I just want to get away from the up & down dosing*" to "*I don't care about dosing, I'm trying to save money!*"......... Okay, you just sound like a dick really at this point. Especially considering I answered all of those "concerns" with what would be the better option.


Do whatever you want though, I don't care. I was just trying to be helpful. I mean you asked on a public forum lol And I have extensive experience with both. Kratom couldn't even keep me well in buprenorphine withdrawals, let a lone rid of me of depression. But if you think it'll help you with a full agonist, then all you can do is try for yourself anyway. Buprenorphine is more versatile in that you can get a buzz from it if you're having a bad day & really need one or you can just stay well with it & it's a good mood stabilizer if you suffer from severe depression. Kratom is too weak IME for a person with a love of full agonists to really enjoy it.  Not to mention it's full of other NON-opioid alkaloids that you'll be feeling as well. Including opioids antagonists & dopamine blockers. Unless you stick with pure kratom extract. At least tramadol has an active full agonist metabolite & can last up to 8hrs, so it's worth the taste. 


But if you'd rather gulp down grams & grams of plant powder every day, for less effects than you'd even get from tramadol or buprenorphine, then go for it!!!  I encourage you to knock yourself out & form your own damn opinion. Instead of asking on a public forum & then treating the person who answers you, like they don't know what they're talking about. Again, good luck. Actually scratch that, I really don't give a shit.

If we were still living in Reagan's America in the 1980's kratom would have been declared a "narcotic" and outlawed just like cannabis.  But natural substances are harder to make illegal.  I think the AKA's presence, the fentanyl crisis, and yes the fact that kratom is not too strong (I would not say weak though) is why it is still legal.  Also money talks.  Didn't Thailand undo the illegality of kratom too?  (not sure)


I do know people that thought kratom was too weak for them for sure.  It worked for me to keep me clean.  I latched onto regular powdered leaf and made it work.  Opiate effects compared to say oxycodone are weaker, but the pain killing effect can be pronounced.  In fact ibuprofen and kratom mixed works better than 20 mgs of oxycodone for me. But I started this last round with zero opiate tolerance, did not use it to stop other opiates so I don't have lingering withdrawal from a stronger opiate.


Now saying all that I have yet to try bupe.  Never once.  In my younger days the only option was methadone.  Makes me wonder if bupe was a treatment in the 1980's.  I do not recall being offered it or anyone that was on it then.  Just methadone.


Once I do finally try bupe I will start with like .5 mgs.  I will act as if it is very strong and not overdo.  I read the stories of opiate naive people taking a few milligrams and it was too much.  While I never want to go on bupe for any long term I still want to try it.   I do have a kratom tolerance so that should help it not be too strong.

I mean, cannabis, psylocybin, opium, mescaline, are all natural substances that are illegal. So I'm not sure what you mean by 'natural substances are harder to make illegal'. Cause they had no problem making all those things illegal & I'm sure there's plenty more. They're unable to patent natural substances though.


I think kratom survived here in the US due to people rallying against the FDA/gov when they tried to ban it (which shows it does help some people), but also due to the fact that it's incredibly weak & you can't really fatally OD on it.


Buprenorphine is technically 40x stronger than heroin & morphine even, if we were to speak of potency. It may not have the same full receptor agonism that heroin or morphine has, but it will attach to the receptors a lot tighter & can agonize way more receptors at once than heroin or morphine do. For example, at like 16mg of bupe, all of your bodies opioid receptors are completely covered. But if your receptors were completely covered in a full agonist, you'd be dead.

So definitely don't underestimate how potent buprenorphine is.


I would start with even less than .5mg if you try it & give it 2hrs to peak & if you feel you need more, then you could add more.


Years & years ago when I first tried buprenorphine, I only had a tolerance to tramadol (which is stronger than kratom & is a full agonist) and even just .5mg of buprenorphine had me nodding so hard that I couldn't even stand at work without looking like I was about to pass out every few seconds.


Buprenorphine is not really a drug you wanna jump from kratom to. It would be like doing a weak line of ritalin & them jumping on meth to solve your ritalin problem. People with little to no tolerance can technically OD on buprenorphine. Usually a non-fatal OD, as in bupe is so strong that you might even just spend the 12hrs after taking it, puking & wishing you hadn't taken it. So definitely be careful there. If you wanna try something stronger than kratom, I'd go with tramadol or hydrocodone if you can find it. Or if you're severely addicted to kratom & want off of it, then bupe might be able to help some one like that. But I'm not joking when I say going from kratom to bupe is a pretty huge leap. People assume that just because bupe is a partial agonist & doesn't provide much euphoria, that it's "weak". But it can be just as strong, if not stronger than any other opioid, including the side effects, it just won't feel as good as if you took a full agonist.


For example, like 4mg of buprenorphine is equal to like hundreds of milligrams of oxycodone. It will never give the same high as hundreds of mgs of oxycodone, but it's still going to give you a similar dependence to that much oxy & also raise your tolerance. So if you use bupe, you can probably say goodbye to any effects you're getting out of kratom. I knew some one who only had a 20mg a day oxycodone habit & they started taking 4mg of bupe everyday for it, which honestly was probably overkill & only increased his opioid dependence, not helped it.


I just can't in good faith recommend somebody with a kratom habit do buprenorphine. But I also might just be making assumptions here & maybe you have a lot of history with full agonists too, I dunno. But bupe is too strong for people with only kratom history & not as enjoyable as other opioids. But everyone can make their own decisions. If you do use bupe, just keep in mind it's crazy potency!!! I don't think having a kratom tolerance is gonna matter much. Buprenorphine doesn't always exhibit total cross tolerance either. For example, I've had buprenorphine put me down for a nap, even after a several day heroin binge one time. Theoretically bupe shouldn't have done shit other than help withdrawal after using heroin for a few days, but it still sedated me & put me to bed because of the cross tolerance issue.


In the pamphlet I always got with my suboxone, it always mentioned about a girl who died from a mere 2mg of suboxone and nothing else. So having little to no tolerance to bupe & messing with it can be risky. You're less likely to OD on bupe though once you have a tolerance to it or full agonists.


I think buprenorphine was around in the 80's, but it was mostly used as a painkiller in Europe in  microdoses. And then in the early 2000s, they approved high doses for addiction/maintenance here in the US.


Anyway, I don't wanna sound like an overly concerned mother here though. lol


But people should definitely remember....

If you have little to no tolerance = *buprenorphine is going to be hella strong, even dangerously so, probably make you sick even if you dose too high*

If you have a tolerance (to full agonists) or even dabbled with them on & off = *bupe is just going to keep you mildly well & will be underwhelming*


Be safe BL'ers!

> 
> **What:** Suboxone = buprenorphine/naloxone. Bupe is a partial agonist(mu) and antagonist(kappa). Bupe has higher mu affinity that most opiates, including some antagonists(naloxone, naltrexone). Its higher affinity allows you to shoot suboxone tablets. It also may cause precipitated withdrawals if you are dependant on other opiates. Also, its higher affinity blocks the affects of other opiates when taken in conjunction with bupe.
> 
> 
> 
> **Dose:** Depends on tolerance. 1-2mgs is a typical recreational dose for someone with no tolerance. If you're using bupe to taper off of another opiate, you should dose once you're experiencing wd's(typically 36-48 hrs. for most opiates). Start with 2-4mgs and dose at 2mg increments every 30-45minutes until a dose holds you. Most people take their full dose once a day.
> 
> 
> 
> **Withdrawal:** Typical physical and psychological symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. Insomnia, chills, diarrhea, depression, anxiety, lacrimation, sweating, increased heart rate, etc. They are not as strong as a full agonist's symptoms, but may last longer. Physical symptoms last 1-2 weeks on average and psychological symptoms may last months.
>

> **Frequently Asked Questions**
> 
> 
> 
> Q: **How long after my last bupe dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> A: It depends on what dose of bupe you were taking and how long. The short answer is 36-48 hours, though it may certainly be less, or more than that. Caution should be used when dosing, as you will still have a tolerance but it will not be as high as it was when you first got on bupe.
> 
> 
> 
> Q: **I'm thinking about switching from methadone to bupe. At what methadone dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> A: Most places recommend being at 30-40mgs of methadone when switching. That may be hard to achieve since that level is lower than the recommended therapeutic maintenance level. Also, you'd have to wait at the very least 36-48 hours before your last methadone dose to switch in order to avoid precipitated withdrawal.
> 
> 
> 
> Q: **Is bupe good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> A: Yes, it may help with depression and anxiety. It is not currently prescribed for either and its effectiveness has not been studied for long term use for either. You may be able to get it prescribed off label for depression/anxiety, but its not likely to happen. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=7714228) is an article on PubMed about a study on bupe being used to treat depression.
> 
> 
> 
> Q: **Is bupe recreational?**
> 
> A: Yes. Although it is rarely the preferred opiate for people who have experience with full agonists, a few people do prefer it to full agonists (i.e. morphine).
> 
> 
> 
> Q: **Can you overdose on buprenorphine?**
> 
> A: Yes you can, but typically not by itself. Buprenorphine causes respiratory depression which may lead to death, but typically wouldn't do so in a healthy individual, unless you combined other CNS depressants with buprenorphine, like benzodiazepines, alcohol, barbiturates, and other downers. The person most likely to OD on bupe has a low(if any) tolerance to opiates and may have taken another depressant. A buprenorphine overdose may not be reversed by naloxone(or naltrexone for that matter) due to bupe's higher affinity. Diprenorphine may reverse the overdose, but it is not regularly stocked by emergency personnel or hospitals. If a proper antagonist isn't available, the person suffering an overdose may be maintained with assisted respiration.
> 
> 
> 
> Q: **Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on bupe?**
> 
> A: This depends on what dose of bupe you're on. You will most likely be able to shoot through a low dose of bupe (1-2mgs). Though some might be able to expect the full effects of the opiate you're shooting through with, it is often only partially felt for many people. Even at higher doses, if you take enough of the opiate you may feel it. This is not recommended, as you may overdose before reaching the desired recreational effects. It is better to wait until bupe is no longer effecting you, or to stick the course with bupe treatment.
> 
> 
> 
> Q: **How come you can IV Suboxone? Isn't naloxone going to put you into withdrawal?**
> 
> A: No, naloxone will not put you into withdrawal. If you are using heroin or a full agonist, and then use Suboxone, you will go into precipitated withdrawal if you don't wait for regular withdrawal first. If you are otherwise already on buprenorphine, IVing Suboxone will not put you into withdrawal. This is because buprenorphine has greater receptor affinity than naloxone does

> 
> Q: **Is Suboxone safe to IV?**
> 
> A: In essence, you should not shoot Suboxone. Unless you have enough patience and money to afford and use micron filters, Suboxone or Subutex, like any other pill, has risks when IVing. Missing a shot of Suboxone or Subutex may be more detrimental to your health, when compared to shooting out of a sterile ampule, or pure drugs in sterile water. Please read up on injection complications regarding pill based drugs, like Subutex, in the [Case Studies thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=445570). It is better, if you are truly intending on IVing buprenorphine (outside of the ampule version Buprenex), to read up on my [Micron Filtering Mega Thread and FAQ](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=481622) and then purchase the necessary supplies to help enable a safer shooting experience for yourself.

> 
> Q: **How good is bupe as an analgesic? What are the pain-killing properties like in comparison to other opiates?**
> 
> A: This may vary from individual to individual, but what I can say for the average person, you will probably find that it is about half as good feasibly speaking as an analgesic (pain-killing) medication, compared to an equipotent dose of heroin, morphine, oxycodone, and so on. I have talked to several people who are pain patients, and they have a general consensus that while full agonist opiates are much better in the pain killing department, buprenorphine does help considerably when taking off the edge in mild to somewhat moderate pain cases. For people with moderate to heavy or severe pain issues, buprenorphine can do but only so much.
> 
> 
> 
> Q: **If I am a pain patient, can I utilize buprenorphine?**
> 
> A: Yes, it is possible. It will be most likely you will combine a compatible drug, like tramadol with it. However if you are going to combine full agonist opiates like morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, heroin, and so on, you are probably going to want to take a dose of buprenorphine first, and then once the effects are going, you can use other full agonist opiates on top of buprenorphine. However, you can't take another dose of buprenorphine until the full agonists have left your system. This is why if you're already dependent on full agonist opiates, it's better not to use buprenorphine as well (as you may go into precipitated withdrawal). If you have mild to moderate pain at best, and it flares up sometimes but doesn't at others, then you may be able to combine both buprenorphine and a full agonist on the days you need to, and then on the days you don't, you can stick to strictly buprenorphine.

WTF did the doctor put me on such I high level for when I was just messin around now and again with snorting bupe, bit of oramorph, lots of tramadol, codeine, in my past smoked heroin but never got reeled in and the final one that made me cry for help was taking maybe like 300-500mg of dihydrocodeine from which I had withdrawals from but was seeking help in the form of him maybe weaning me off them slowly. 


I am shitting bricks as I don't want to be on it. 


Now im parked on 16mg of bupe from day 3 of me starting it.

I have been on 16mg as well. It generally isn't necessary, and yeah, the constipation for me became a bloody mess. I would ask for a dose reduction, 8mg should hold you just fine, and honestly, it'd probably be better to just do a little taper and come off subs completely, if you think you can handle that and not jump back into other opioids. But if you think you'll relapse, there's no shame in maintaining on subs, you just ought to lower your dose. 


I have been opioid free for a couple months now and things, well they're not great but that's mostly personal, but physically I'm starting to feel a lot better. I've always had stomach problems and they came raring back, but at least I'm not shitting blood everyday like Suboxone can do to you.

I also was put on Buphrenorphine / Subutex for a ridiculously low dose codeine habit in the UK.  (8mg per day for for 180mg of codeine per day.).  Come down as much as you can asap then jump off it.

Hi. I got put on subutex in april last year, went up to a ridiculously high dose, 28mg, and stayed on that for about 8,5 months.

Was so tired, had intense kidney pains, hormones all fucked up (no period for like 3 months at a time) and the list goes on and on.

Started tapering 3,5 months ago and is now at 3mg/day. Just gotten stable on this dose. 

I've dropped my dose, waited 3-5 days until I get stable and then I've for the most part immediately dropped again. Hasn't been comfortable but hasn't been too bad either.

I just can't wait to finally be free from this substance.

I'm still not stable on 3 mg, woke up in pain this morning. It's the worst drop so far so id take away 0.5 or 0.25 mg at a time instead of 1 if I was you. 


Yeah my mind wanders all the time but been taking Methylphenidate, gabapentin and ketamin the last few weeks to manage the symptoms. But you just have to accept craving stuff 24/7 I'm afraid, its just about how loud the cravings are. Maybe it's not that bad with lower dose drop though. Im just stubborn about not increasing when I've gotten down lower.

Gabapentin has helped a bunch.

Hopefully you'll get your dose down [@bonomoopiojo55](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/384563/)

Yesterday I finally felt stabilised at 3mg, (from 4 to 3mg) it took maybe 10 days to not wake up not in withdrawals. 

But feeling okay of course made me want to make another drop so I only took 2mg in the morning and 0.5 at night yesterday.

Didn't feel too shitty today after waking up, but I'll guess tomorrow and the day after will be a bit harder.


**Thinking of just jumping off, take 1, 2 days on gabapentin and diazepam, then switch to oxys for 7-10 days, high dose first days, then go lower and lower, then be off it completely.

I'll have access to real oxys, and it is NOT unlimited access. That's what makes me think I could actually make this work.

 What do you guys think? **

I've read up on it several hours yesterday, and sadly it seems like I would have to suffer for a month if jumping on anything above 1 mg, and then not feel alright for several months later either. Tapering seems like the only sane solution that and I'm quite disappointed about that. I just want off this. 8-9 months on 28mg is just insane for a 3 month heroin habit ![😭](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f62d.png)

28mg for a 3 month heroin habit is definitely crazy! 


Hell there's not even a real need to put anyone on bupe for a 3 month long heroin habit honestly. But the whole Suboxone thing is just a racket now. 

As you've probably seen, sub withdrawals can last over a month because of how long acting it is. Even if you jump off lower doses. 


I once went a week without any subs & I didn't sleep that entire time. It was pretty awful. You'll definitely need a taper. 


You could always try to take the lowest sub dose possible one day, see how many days you can go without it & then take that same small dose again & then repeat. Maybe eventually you'll find that you don't need another dose after a couple days. 


I've been on bupe 10 years & I'll probably never get off of it at this point. I'm okay with being on opioids permanently myself, I just wish I had more options than just crappy bupe every day. It's such a mixed/crappy opioid that some days I DO wish I wasn't on it, but then other days I'm like "fuck that, I could never stop". 


I wish you all the best though!

I have a hard time not taking it in the morning and night, but I've noticed that I can go lower much faster by dosing this way instead of the whole dose at once in the morning. Already down another half mg now actually.

Your method will probably be great for when it's time to get of completely though. I can't wait for the day when I realise I haven't taken it in weeks. ![❤️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2764.png)

Still on 2mg. Since the last jump didn't even phase me I'm just toughing this one out. Nightmares and stuff, and those morning wd's are back if I'm not dosing late at night. A little harder since I've quit the k and having a small tolerance break from the gabapentin (...a few days XD)


I want my brain back NOW, please leave buprenorphine you're not wanted here

Kratom couldn't even keep me well in buprenorphine withdrawals, let a lone rid of me of depression. But if you think it'll help you with a full agonist, then all you can do is try for yourself anyway. Buprenorphine is more versatile in that you can get a buzz from it if you're having a bad day & really need one or you can just stay well with it & it's a good mood stabilizer if you suffer from severe depression. Kratom is too weak IME for a person with a love of full agonists to really enjoy it.  Not to mention it's full of other NON-opioid alkaloids that you'll be feeling as well. Including opioids antagonists & dopamine blockers. Unless you stick with pure kratom extract. At least tramadol has an active full agonist metabolite & can last up to 8hrs, so it's worth the taste.

I encourage you to knock yourself out & form your own damn opinion. Instead of asking on a public forum & then treating the person who answers you, like they don't know what they're talking about. Again, good luck. Actually scratch that, I really don't give a shit.

lol, me too. Going to toss these bags of kratom taking up room in my freezer. Like you, I found it to be a needless risk, mainly health possibilities like stomach cancer or something like that. Who knows what pesticides they use in the part of the world this sit comes from?!

Kratom is total trash. lol 


The extracts I can see people actually enjoying a bit, but even those are pretty mild at best. 


I'll take buprenorphine over kratom any day. And I'm not a huge fan of bupe either. lol

Although kratom would do nothing for me at this time (thanks suboxone), I recall it being a definite opioid with constricted pupils and gravelly voice increase. That was when I was only taking 45 mg/day morphine sulfate though.  It seemed better than norco/vicodin due to zero monitoring by a doctor.

It must be incredibly variable.


I've tried so much different kratom over the past 10 years & I've never felt anything resembling an opioid high or euphoria. At most, it would make me a little drowsy & I'd have to lay down, similar to opioids, but wasn't enjoyable or anything in the slightest. Everyone is different though I guess.


For me, the least to best opioids I've done would be *<least>* loperamide, tianeptine, kratom, poppyseed tea, buprenorphine, hydrocodone, tramadol, propoxyphene, methadone, heroin *<best>*

I'll leave fent off that list cause I'd just prefer not to use it ever again whether it's better than kratom or not lol

I love this so much. 


I had been on relatively low doses of bupe but taking it IN always from 8mg tablets. For maybe a couple of years. Through various personal circumstances I have very slowly tapered from about 1mg a day back in November last year to currently 0.6mg currently. I split this dose up into a morning and night dose but am considering doing just one of those. 


I am so eager to jump off. I did try to quit completely last weekend and while I think I could tough it out if I absolutely had to, I am lucky to have a good supply to keep going slowly with. 


When I was trying to jump to nothing last weekend I noticed wd symptoms came in waves. Bupe seems to be a bit cruel in that you might feel fine for the 24-36 hours of quitting but when it comes for you - jeez. Mostly sweats, chills, nausea sometimes and definitely felt like my guts were starting to wake up lol. But I would rate it 3/10 in terms of discomfort. Idk it’s all subjective I guess. 


I feel much camaraderie reading everyone’s posts and experiences here. Sorry if my post is kind of weird and rambling, or not quite forum etiquette. It’s my first time. ![😅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f605.png) the post I quoted i inspired me.

If I were you [@Sitting Kiwi93](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/581024/)  I'd taper down to 0 since you have access to it. I've read for hours and hours all over the web and it seems like that is the best option. 

I've been wanting to jump off as well but changed my opinion after all the horror stories. You are on quite a low dose already but  as I said since you have access, just taper down. Patience is key with coming off this substance it seems. ![🩷](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1fa77.png)


Also some extra tips: start exercising, meditating and eat omega 3, cut down on ultraprocessed food and nurture your relationships. It will help a ton. 


I'm down to 1mg now. 0.7 some days. I've tapered quickly up until now though so I still have residual wd symptoms from my taper, like intense night sweats. But I've feel like my "connection to the rest of the universe" is coming back. I'm also dreaming again, even though I'm still smoking cannabis! That's huge for me, I've missed it so much.

Yesterday morning I had taken 0.3 mg bupe, and about 12 hours later in the evening I thought I wanted to try taking some oxy to see how that would suffice me, I snorted 5mg and swallowed 5 ans actually got the tiiiniest little effects from that, before it leveled out to something non noticeable. But I actually fell asleep without my second bupe dose with the help of that oxy. I could've taken more and I wanted to when feeling those effects but I'm glad I stuck to it. 

At first, I started my taper from 28 mg bupe to be able to take other opiates again, but these 4,5 months have changed my mind about it. I mostly just want to get off opis complex, due to how shitty this taper have had me feeling. But feels nice to be able to indulge once in a while even on a low dose bupe. 

Don't know what I'm rambling about. Some kind of accountability post I guess. 

These kinds of "testing my opiate receptors"(![🤣](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)) bullshit stuff are what leads to serious relapses

You've been doing an incredible job! Way more courage than me! 

But if your goal is to avoid opioids altogether, then definitely be careful with your oxy vacations! All it takes is getting those good euphoric feelings again & you're back to wanting it all the time. Hell, for some one like me, the post-acute withdrawal symptoms I'd have if I quit opioids would mean I'd go nuts. It'd be dangerous for me to come off of opioids altogether at this point. 


Do you ever find that the lower doses of bupe give you a buzz at all? I've seen a lot of people talk about how when they tapered down to these smaller doses, it started giving them a buzz. And it's very possible due to bupe's weird pharmacology of being a mixed agonist/anatagonist. If you really crave an opioid buzz & don't wanna be messing with oxy or full agonists, then maybe taking a little bit extra of your bupe some days can provide a mild buzz & maybe help with that craving. 


Either way, you're doing great! I have no idea who you are or anything about you, but I'm proud of you! People who've never been through opioid withdrawals have no idea what it's like. And it takes so much courage, strength & commitment, that you should be proud of yourself as well! 


Take care my friend!

First of all, shooting suboxone tablets is super bad. Second of all, it's higher affinity means you don't even need to shoot it at all. lol Just rub some on the inside of your mouth or snort it & you'll get high.

I completely agree. Shooting suboxone, even Subutex, should be avoided at all costs. People are still gonna do it, but it should be said that its still a nasty habit and a dangerous past time to engage in.

Today is the day to start getting back on the bupe, after a week of oxy. since I may have a urine sample a week from now. Went on the oxys for fun but stayed this long bc of stomach pain. Some days I was on 40mg but due to the pain I didn't find any enjoyment and I'm happy about that. It's been expensive as well. The last 2 days I've been on 20-25mg and took 0.15-0.20mg bupe with my last 5mg oxy. 

Pain is better now btw it was due to excessive ketamine use.

Hey thanks for your encouragement. I have slowly crept up to a slightly higher dose since my last post, if it weighed 0.010g before, it’s been weighing 0.013g. Just because the tablets I have currently are so damn hard to break unlike previous ones I’ve used. I’ll have to be more diligent about it. Maybe it’s my sign to just go for a once a day instead of twice. To clarify, I’m not talking about 0.013g bupe, but rather what the broken off piece of tablet itself weighs.


I began exercising June 2023 (I’m one of those Peloton weirdos lol) and while learning to meditate is a work in progress (my brain is like a hamster wheel), I do find some breathing exercises help, such as alternate nostril breathing. I could always eat more omega-3 but also take a good vitamin stack including a fish oil too.


I have had many life changes in the last year particularly, but luckily one side effect is that I am closer with my family and my siblings children, who are at such a fun wonderful age! It’s great to bond. ![🩷](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1fa77.png)


I always felt that taking sub caused me to sweat more easily. It’s hard to explain but I notice now that I am on an almost zero dose, I am so much less sweaty even through the heat waves in my area! I totally understand the dreams coming back, it feels like they are in full force too. So intense that even good dreams aren’t really pleasant. I think I am also processing some traumatic experience too though. I hope your dreams are pleasant!

I don’t check in here every day but I enjoy reading everyone’s posts, so I like your updates even if you think you’re rambling! Sorry you’ve been having stomach pain, but damn when I read that you tapered down from 28mg my jaw almost hit the floor, that’s seriously amazing and I’m as proud as I could be without knowing you irl lol. 


[@DeathIndustrial88](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/529974/) I feel like bupe is pharmacologically one of the weirdest medications. Maybe I feel that way because of how little research there seems to be or how little it’s talked about though. While I can’t say that I personally have gotten any super noticeable buzzes on the lower doses throughout my tapering, I do find that any time I have taken a larger dose (accidentally, curious, etc.), it’s always been a misfire and regrettable. It seems “more is better” doesn’t necessarily apply to bupe. Maybe you are referring to a small dose bupe + something like oxys but I wanted to throw my 2¢ in. I like your posts too and you seem pretty knowledgeable!

Im at approximately 0.6-0.7mg buprenorphine a day now, Ive taken maybe 0.5 (0.25 in the morning and 0.25 in the afternoon, its now 9 in the evening) could I take some methadone and feel effects of it or should I wait until tomorrow? I probably should. 

How much should I take to feel euphoric effects?

I stack shit on top of my .5 intranasal(24hr dose) - 1mg all the time.  Or at least I used to.


Fent, Trams, and too much oxy will break through or synergy quite well minus the oxy, that one really is just a waste but if you are blasting 2 or 3,  30mg pharma roxi after about 12 hours from a very smallsub dose, then ya at least for me I would feel a bit fantastic..


Also yes you do get a buzz like energy when lowered down and stable at .5- 1mg doses possibly 2mg ...any higher your back to zombie land.

Ive been on 20/25mg methadone a day for 3 days now, would I get precip if I take a bupe dose now 15 hours after last methadone dose? Or should I wait? But even if I was on just 0.7mg bupe it shouldn't be all the way out of my body yet right since it only been 3 days?

I'll probably wait at least until tonight so it has been 24 hours

I think you need to wait still, possibly 36hrs or whenever you are kicking bad, I would say you are good to go, BUT wait for another response I have no experience mixing methadone and bupe or the switch...plus idk I guess my body is lucky, or the bupe is just still stacked in my system(which I'm sure it is) but I used to try to wait 12-24hrs and end up using oxy which really is a waste, by the 2nd day of using oxy I usually feel if much better, but yeah strange and lucky shit is after the oxy is gone and that next morning WD starts, subs kill it, without ever ever experiencing precipitated WD...NOW if was using hella oxy every day for a month or two,  I probably would get precipitated


But yes for sure wait bc methadone has a long half life too....unless the synthetic part means it may have synergies with bupe like,tramadol, kratom then that would be awesome buttt I doubt it and pcw is something to handle with care in order to avoid it

Yeah okay thank you for your answer, ill probably give it a few more hours then. Im at the 27 hour mark now and starting to yawn, have runny eyes etc but it could just be because its night time. When I've switched between oxy and bupe it hasn't been a problem but the half life is way shorter then methadone so. 

I should've probably be taking a tiny bupe dose with my methadone, ill probably do that next time to not loose all of it on my receptors. 


[@Opana313](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/565342/) When you switched to oxy, what doses of buprenorphine where you on and how high oxy dose did you need to feel anything?

That’s not strange at all. That’s how it works. I use nitazenes nearly daily along with my suboxone. I keep dosing my sub to keep some bupe constantly on my receptors, so I never have to worry about PWD.

I waited 30 hours (thats when the sneezing started)and then took 0.4mg bupe and didn't get PWD. Probably bc I was only on the methadone for 3 days so if anyone has been on it longer than that id recommend waiting a bit longer.

Next time ill dose some bupe along with it.

Im having quite annoying wd's from the methadone even though I've taken my bupe, so I I'm happy I wasn't on it longer than 3 days. No sneezing or anything but cold sweats, joint pain and just an uneasy feeling. I'll probably be okay tomorrow though. Don't want to raise the bupe dose anything so just have to deal with it. 


The reason im continuing on the bupe is to have some accountability with urine samples, and some extra ![💵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f4b5.png) but I don't think ill be on it longer than a few months more. In that time ill probably be able to taper down to 0.00mg and have a painless transition to being opiate free.

I screwed up big time guys, was so set on not having drugs showing up in my UA but forgot to take a lot of bupe so was negative on that. Have to go every day now ![🙄](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f644.png) and theyll send the test on analysis. I have a doctors appointment on Wednesday and depending on what they say ill probably just quit there? I can taper with what I have home since I'm at such a low dose it doesn't even show up, right? I take less than 0.7mg a day. I can't bare going here every day to take 16 f-ing mg that I don't want or need?

I’d honestly just quit where you’re at. I’ve jumped off a much higher dose, after being on it for years. It was completely doable. You will be fine.

Thank you, thats reassuring to hear if I choose to quit. Ive taken a larger doses today and will tomorrow as well, since ill provably have to leave a urine test on wednesday as well.

The strange thing is I took both gabapentin (1800mg) and ritalin (20mg) yesterday and was negative on those as well? But both those and the bupe should show up in an analysis right? Since I've taken 0.7-1mg the last 7 days? (7 days ago I had that 3 day methadone paus so I've taken bupe for 14 months before that)

So maybe I take my meds and stay of the drugs until they get the analysis answer and then decide what to do.  Its the extra income I need, thats the thing..

 I would expect Ritalin to show on a test, but I doubt Gabapentin will, unless they specifically test for it. 


Again, I’d seriously drop your dose of bupe and just quit. Unless you mean that you’re selling the bupe for the extra income. In which case still quit, honestly.

Ive benefitted a lot from going there and leaving urine samples as well since I don't have any self control when it comes to usage, and the fact that my other meds are prescribed from there as well. That makes it harder to just quit there

I wasn't so clear about this but I'm not selling [@Helpmeescapethis](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/528319/)  its my work, when I take drugs in the way I was doing the last few months, I just baarely work the days and hours I'm supposed to. I need to leave those urine samples to keep myself in check. Now I've actually been there every day I was supposed to.

But its a wierd feeling taking so much bupe again (2-4mg/day), the first days I really liked it, I still like it a bit but the euphoria is dissapearing again. Its super wierd since I've just gotten anxiety from it for so long. Right now Im just trying to accept amd coming to terms with going to the clinic every day. Still need it unfortunately.

Great question.  Since switching either way didn't matter, I found myself stacking BUT if i was only one 1mg oral maybe 2mg I could feel 30mg or more my style ar least 60mg Oxy intranasal but short lived so to speak.  Sounds not bad but then of course you re-dose and found my self going through 5 or 6 30s in a 16hr time.


Oddly I found that after a good break from everything but the 1mg bupe, I even felt 40mg hydrocodone exceptionally well, almost potentiate but probably placebo.  


I have wasted a lot but yeah after at least 24hrs and feeling shitty without bupe, a real 30 usually could do the trick but as far as legs...back to bupe.  Glad to be down to .5 intranasal..been skipping days and can feel the others even better but the block effect still remains. 

I really need to say no more to oxy and kick this sub..idk why I feel like it will be intolerable but shit the beginning sure dose!

Quitting subs is cake once you’re down to that low of a dose. My longest period of sobriety resulted from hopping off at 2mg. Which wasn’t great, but so much of it was in my head. I wasn’t afforded the luxury of focusing on it, so I actually made it. 


I say go for it, and don’t look back.

So im on the monthly buvidal injection and yes I can still get high. Off quite  small amount too just not to the extent I was when bupe free. 

Im looking at trying hydromorphone soon and am really curious whether I will get the rush or the feeling im so looking forward too. I have no idea how non-intravenous usage would work as id guess part of the reason I still am able to get high is the large amount of dug entering my system rapidly. 


This is totally not harm reuction but I also often take a benzo beforehand and that gets me a lot higher. I also find the day after a night on meth or coke I get MUCH higher!

Hi. I'm an older man with a substantial history of opiate/opioid use. I managed to leave H alone for several months whilst on a 100mg methadone dosage but as I gradually reduced the cravings returned as has the IV heroin+benzo+pregabalin use. So my doc is quickly reducing my methadone over a couple of weeks to get me down to 30mg so as to avoid pwd. Now I'm hoping to move over to subutex as prescribed but my nagging IV fixation has got me thinking about IV Bupe use, ideally using wheel filters. What I can't discover is, when on 16mg Bupe daily, what sort of dose might commonly be injected and would I experience a greater effect from the bupe after IV rush? I'm asking as I understand that Id get a greater bioavailability IV.

Bupe injecting can lead to a viscous cycle. Yes it feels very good imho but one should stay away from it due to its inherent dangers. It destroys vein tissue as well as causes abscesses if injected poorly. 


Nowadays I don’t IV. But I take 4mg SL and then use 3mg up the nose to boost the effects and it is quite euphoric NGL. Almost as good as IV or IM but honestly even tho nothing is as good as the needle you should stay away from it. Just a friendly warning

Oh yes, I'm well aware of the risks. I used to be prescribed Methadone in a form which was injectable and once you've used that route it becomes very hard to leave it alone. I'd still like the information though  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)
