I was fortunate enough to come across some "changa" recently. Changa is a combination of herbs that contain an MAOI and are infused with DMT... the experience is a LOT like Ayahuasca and far more grounding and insightful than smoking DMT on its own. I find it extremely enjoyable, too. It's gentler, less freaky, lasts longer, and yet it goes very deep.


Here's a link with more info. [http://forums.mycotopia.net/showthread.php?t=12180](http://forums.mycotopia.net/showthread.php?t=12180)


Now that my changa has almost run out (I have only 1 dose left) I am wondering how to transform my modest DMT stash into changa by adding some MAOI to it when I smoke it. If anyone else has tried this or is going to try this, please post here. 


I will probably try smoking DMT with peganum harmala seeds sometime soon, and if that doesn't work I will try with Passionflower. If thatdoesn't work, I'm gonna have to find some other MAOI-containing herbs...


peace+love

You could always add a small ammount of freebase harmine to the remaining nn,dmt.

I've smoked DMT with passionflower before, with no appreciable change or alteration in the effects, except perhaps a slightly calming quality. Tastes nice though..... How certain is anyone that passionflower/s contain sufficent harmine anyhow?

Passionflower doesn't contain enough harmine if you smoke the plant matter. It requires an extraction or tea to be sufficient for its MAOI qualities.

Not to get off topic, but I am very experienced with Passion Flower, and I haven't seen any sufficient MAOI activity.

You should do a simple A/B extraction of the rue seeds before you smoke them... it will work a hell of a lot better, and won't taste like smoking wood, like smoking the seeds does(I've tried both)


I have never heard of this "changa" before, although, a few years ago, after my first ayahuasca experience, I had a bit of tea left over, and my friend thought it would work if we just evaporated the tea to a powder/paste and smoke it.... in short... no effects were felt and it clogged up a nice bubbler...

You could try melting your DMT on a plate under some boiling water... then adding the herbs and then stirring, and then let dry. 


The passionflower contains a small amount of harmine, and harmine when smoked, you only need micrograms to create 50% MAO-A inhibition.


I pulled this from a thread on forums.ayahuasca.com from "doctorcito"


> Have you ever read at which concentrations harmine is plainly efficacious as a MAO-A inhibitor in vivo? It's in the low nanomolar range: if smoked, absolute doses in the 100 µg-1 mg range may achieve 50% MAO-A inhibition and beyond. Furthermore a recent study with a caapi extract found it was 100 to 1000 fold more potent than harmine alone as MAO-A inhibitor (Schwarz et al. 2003, in comm. bibliog.).

Also, people find that for whatever reason, the DMT and ayahuasca vine/leaf people often put in their changa, seem to amplify the effect of the herbs that one uses in the mix. 


This concurs with the way that ayahuascaros use various admixture herbs in their  ayahuasca brews, and the effects of these herbs are amplifed when combined with ayahuasca. 


Pretty magical stuff...

T. McKenna talks a lot in True Hallucinations of smoking Caapi nto potentiate mushrooms for what thats worth.


Folias, I've often wondered whether so called 'herbal 'highs' such as damiana, pasiflora, mugwort etc. (which have very little 'psyoactivitiy to me at least) have reputations as 'highs' because they have been used as admixtures in aya brews....

Would be interesting to smoke such herbs whilst under the influence of DMT and try to judge whether it had an effect...or before maybe...might be a good way to relax before a DMT trip anyways, to puff on a little passionflower...

One of the most interesting things I learnt in the Amazon was how many different plants they use with ayahuasca... ayahuasca is seen as some kind of activator of the other plants... some of these plants are used for healing of the physical body, some of them for magical or shamanic purposes... but often they would not consider using the plants by themselves because the ayahuasca vine seems to potentiate them quite considerably or regulates their power.  


For example, they don't use, nor would ever use datura by itself, but in an ayahuasca brew, they use a small amount of datura flowers (usually), to make a brew more visualy full and expansive. 


Mullein is a key herb used in changa, because it is a lung herb and herbs the body to deal with the harsh DMT smoke... also, I have heard of people having very profound

lung healings with this material too.

i realy think your on to something here. did a minor search. found mullien floating around somewhere in cyberspace. anyone ever heard of it, and imperticularly as an additive to make the smoke smoother on your lungs and posible healing effects on the lungs. chek it out tell me whats up. some caapi leaves infused with a couple hundred mgs of my freind dmt and a few nice additives like the one above might be quite a great mix of plants

I've noticed that mugwort and scullcap (strongly brewed in  teas) when on LSD hada noticeable effect- but I can't discount my knowledegd of what these herbs werea lleged to do.


I have smoked DMT on mullein too (I can think of many who would have ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)), and can't say my lungs are worse because of it. I've never smokeda lot of mullein, but I've mixed it with weed just for kicks.

Check out the entheogen.com forums, it is a favorite as a base for cannabis free smoking blends. There is a ton of info on it over there.

So is mullein a good candidate to make changa or not?

If not whats is a good herb to infuse DMT and harmaline crystals into?


Mullien is not too harsh, thats what i like about it (seems to be the main ingredient in spice gold and the spice-a-likes).

Would spearmint work good?


Also can someone reresh my memory on how to  infuse DMT onto an herb.

thanks.

Changa as  starter carrier, add nnDMT to 70% std, b.caapi, 5% DPT. administer to those who say they 'have had DMT'. 1 bong. film reaction. dont get egotistical from all the thankyous. white light will prevail.

hi everybody,me and a couple of friends discovered changa a couple of years ago,ive smoked it while on ketamine,which was very interesting to say the least lol...this year i was fortunate enough to get hold of a couple of acid tabs,me and my friends also made a brew up with caarpi,mushrooms and blue locust flowers,we ate green and blacks chocolate ,when i was peeking from the acid and shrooms i smoked some changa,it made the effects of the changa last for about half an hour! in that half an hour the ayahuasca spirit gave me some kind of reiki,it was a very real and magical amazing experience,for 2 years my back had been in a bad way from scaffolding,the day after the healing my back was sorted out and has been ever since, we had read that the chocolate works as a maoi,it did along with the shrooms and acid,if you like changa youve gotta try my recipe lol-light and love

DMT + harmaline hcl + cannabis


DMT + b caapi leaves + cannabis

freshly dried leaf works well - accounting for seasonal variation in alk. concentration - it tends to provide for a more relaxed, cushion-type experience, but for ceremonial grade blends, vine shavings from a particularly wisened caapi. in choosing your caapi, go for the vine pieces that still are not completely dried through and will resist being twisted against their natural helical curve.

shakti what purpose would snorting achieve? My understanding is you want it in your stomach literally to do its work.

How can smoking an MAOI get anywhere near enough into your body to create an MAOI effect? 


Are we sure it's not the placebo effect people are noticing?

^The harmala alkaloids are active at very low doses, sub-milligram, when smoked or so I have read. My thing lies in the fact that MAOi needs to occurr before the DMT enters for the inhibition to prolong the effects of changa; obviously a fair bit of DMT is still chewed up by MAO A as changa's effect, while longer lasting the plain n,n,DMT, isn't all that much longer as much as stronger.

^at stated concentrations, the overall experience is in most subjects prolonged by the caapi to ~60+ minutes, with the out of body component lasting 15-20 minutes, active psychedelia for ~45 minutes, subjectively perceived 'off baseline' for up to an hour - and longer in some cases. 


i would also be amiss not to mention the prolonged medicinal and antidepressant effects which i believe are due to the unique pharmacospiritual profile of DMT/caapi blend, examples of which include disappearance of 'voices' aka auditory hallucinations in a borderline paranoid schizophrenic patient for up to 2 weeks following 1-time administration; complete disappearance of fear of death specifically and fear in general in a preoperative patient with an aesophageal tumour; total cessation of OCD symptomatics in a number of cases, again with one-time admin and general feedback that significant antidepressant action is noted for up to a week following the respective ++++'s.


very very far from even the most active of placebos ;-)

^Interesting (particualrly the reduction in voices under schizophrenia). Are you saying the MAO inhibiton contributes to this anti-depressant effect, or moreso the experience? DMT is easily the most therapuetic tool.

harmaline definitely works smoked! but after a few times I would have to say I don't recommend it, because it does feel like an irritant to lung tissue.


I would prefer to swallow a capsule of harmaline and then a few moments (15 mins?) later smoke some DMT.


this works best for my goals (potentiation/lengthening the trip).

Freebase whatever your smoking if you smoke it....


would the MAOI reach the brain and have the effects it needs before the DMT trip was over?


that said, has anyone done some MAOIs and then smoked DMT? that would be one hell of a ride...

ok, lets think a bit. for *oral* ayahuasca, since the DMT is rapidly broken down by gut and hepatic MAO, *oral* MAOI is required - the caapi - whose alkaloids are also partially subject to metabolic breakdown before producing the desired inhibitory effects. bioavailability via oral shows a wide variability depending on individual metabolic nuances. 


this however is not the case with the *smoked* ayahuasca - this ROA bypasses the gut/liver MAO altogether, delivering a hefty dose of caapi alkaloids (as pointed out by Folias above, caapi is orders of magnitude more potent as a MAOI than harmine) in tandem with the DMT right across the ol'BBB. 


the experiential/cognitive/behavioral states described by neuropsychopharmacologically trained individuals and by those who also sampled the constituent crystal in same doses sans caapi confirm transitory but almost complete MAO inhibition which certainly makes sense from the potentiation and prolongation perspectives.

Well, as I see it there are two reasons.  If you're going to smoke the dmt, then you're bypassing the gut MAO, so to inhibit the mao in your gut is pointless.  If you snort the harmine then it wont be caught up in you gut and will work to inhibit the MAO in your cns, thus having a more pronounced effect on your experience.

^that's cause you are not privy to the secret world domination plans of the Russian elfmagick alchemist enclaves ;-)


the key to the mystery is of course carefully encoded within the very lyrics of the Chunga-Changa song itself, if every 2nd vowel on odd-numbered lines were to be substituted for the 23rd pictoglyph of *the* infamous proto-meso-sumarian script and thus onbackwards, and the resultant text folded 4xacross, tied neatly with a virgin whale's tooth hair and burnt at midnight of the second full moon of the month and the smoke signals produced ran through a stack of Crays in your basement, all shall be revealed

I have never understood the obsession with gut MAO. I mean, I can understand that people focussed on this when this was the only place we knew MAO existed, but we've known about CNS MAO for many years now so it is time for a rethink!


Administration methods that bypass the gut and take the tryptamine/MAO directly to the brain have been shown to work well before the MAOI has time to reach the gut. I think the smoked MAOI/DMT combo is the best proof yet that gut MAO is mostly irrelevant. I encourage anyone who still has doubt to try this method for themselves before commenting so that they can argue from a position of experience rather than from a position of theoretical nitwittery as is so common on this forum.


Changa hits hard and hits well before one exhales, which provides a timeframe well in line with other drugs that act directly on the CNS such as smoked crack, meth, nicotine, dmt, etc. These substances are taken up in the lungs from where they go back to the heart and then to the brain and body. If a body pass was required for the MAOI to work then an additional 30-60 seconds would be the absolute minimum required [much longer if the body pass has to be followed by another brain pass]. 


I hope we can finally put the gut MAO obsession to bed and focus on the CNS MAO.

The MAOI effects aren't what 'hits hard and hits well'. The beta-carbolines are centrally acting psychedelics and intoxicants in and of themselves.

actually, if you were to smoke the equal amount of dmt by itself you would not get the same strong effects. ie the smoked MAOI allows more dmt to get to the brain even within those first 30 seconds.


But you are right about your second part. some beta carbolines are active in their own right and can be smoked for immediate effect

Thanks tabaluga for clarifying this issue!


Key Changa herbs (according to "The Chocolate Beast")


- Any sort of mint

- Mullein or Coltsfoot

- Ayahuasca vine and/or leaf

- Passionflower

- Damiana

- Justica Pectoralis

- any kind of psychoactive lily or lotus


Ratios depend on alchemists preference. 


Many people are just using ayahuasca leaf/and or vine... this is nice and strong for full breakthrough, but is not a calming, smoothing, easy to smoke, alchemically amplified herbal combination of Changa as a blend of different herbs, which work in synergy.  


Also, some report blend concentrations at 30/40% DMT... for full breakthrough, this is fine, although something like 20/25%, with the sweet spot being 22.2-23%, is more useful for all circumstances and occaisions! To go deeper, just smoke more! the 2nd smoke (say half an hour later) will always be stronger too! 


Also, Vodka can be used to dissolve more than just your brain!

I know and didn't dispute that. The effect you feel from smoked changa though has nothing to do with MAOI inhibition. Only the 8-24 hour aftereffects are due to the MAOI inhibition. The immediate effects felt when you smoke changa without DMT are a result of the beta-carboline psychedelics which happen to be the same chemicals with MAOI activity, like harmaline.


MAO inhibition leads to a gradual climb in brain levels of catecholamines, giving an antidepressant effect mostly.


MAOI and psychedelia are two separate aspects of the herb. You can't feel MAOI acutely.

Ok, now I get what you were trying to say. however, you are wrong. If you divide the changa mix into it's dmt component and it's beta carboline component then you do not get anything much from smoking the beta carboline component, other than maybe some antidepressant effect for the enxt day or so.


So, obviously if you combine an inactive dose of beta carboline and a small dose of dmt and you end up with a BIG dmt effect then this effect is due to MAO inhibition.


And why are you only referring to MAO inhibition causing a spike in catecholamines? MAOA inhibition works mostly on tryptamines and has little to do with catecholamines.


And you are also wrong about not feeling MAOI acutely [obviously you need a monoamine to feel it though]. Injecting small doses of moclobemide gives virtually no effect, yet doing so together with dmt will amplify the effect of the dmt multifold.


Seems you are quoting from some very outdated and largely irrelevant medical texts.

Changa is usually Caapi vines impregnated with extracted DMT, iirc. If you want to make it, you'll need to do an extaction. It's easy enough, but you'll need some pure chemicals.

If you don't want to extract the bark ayahuasca is your only option as far as I know.

Yea you will need the DMT in freebase form to smoke it, making this process difficult without using pure chemicals

OK so no need to buy pure chemicals, but they are required (DMT) via extraction..


Can that be done at home without blowing things up or burning the place down?

You will absolutly need to use some sort of chemicals.....


you can probably find a food safe solvent to use though.


I know there are lots of different food safe extractions, but I dont know if I have read a tek for making changa that is food safe...

Definitely.  As long as you do your research thoroughly (look through several extraction teks for different methods/advice) and are careful to follow directions very closely, as well as take safety precautions like safety goggles and gloves etc it can be done at home fairly quickly and easily.  


But doing your research and taking the time to be safe is very important.. without these things there can be disastrous results (it does involve working with caustic and flammable chemicals).


If you are thinking of doing it once you have researched a little if you have any questions feel free to private message me!

If you have a food-safe solvent that you can use to dissolve the DMT, you can use that to impregnate it onto the changa.

If you can use it to pull the DMT from the NaOH solution, you can use it to redissolve the DMT to soak into the Caapi. I think I've seen a tek using d-limonene, so yeah that should work.

What about smoking Yopo seeds?  This is supposedly an effective way to use DMT/5-MeO-DMT.


> Effects of Yopo

> With sniffing the effects start in 5 minutes and last for 30 minutes. Small doses of Yopo (2-3 seeds) will generate light euphoria and minor (with eyes closed) hallucinations. Larger doses (4-5 seeds) will generate euphoria, stronger hallucinations and loss of bodily control. When smoked, the experience resembles that of smoking pure DMT. A smaller amount is needed in order to feel the effects, which start in a matter of just a few seconds. The peak lasts for three to ten minutes and will stop after twenty to thirty minutes.

So **how** is smoking Yopo compared to smoking extract?

i would think that a simple alcohol or acetone extraction of your DMT containing plant would be fine for making changa... no need to get to pure DMT.  dosing would be a little trickier to figure out but still doable.

In the process of making my first batch of changa. I'm using caapi leaf covered in 10x caapi vine extract. 50% dmt by weight. I've had DMT enhanced leaf before but this is my first time adding harmalas.


Haven't smoked DMT in a few months but it is calling me.

I'm a huge changa fan, I'll extoll its virtues until I die.  I've not yet made a blend involving an MAOI so some of you may not consider that true "changa" so to speak, but over at the nexus they use that term to refer to any DMT + herbs blend.  I've been using the "Electric Sheep" blend which is 50% DMT, 25% Calea Zacatechichi leaves and 25% Blue lotus petals by weight.  Having the DMT infused to herbs is INCREDIBLY useful in a variety of ways.  For one its easy to carry, share, trade... and most importantly smoke!  Gone are the days of fooling with steel wool, wondering how much was leftover from the last use and never knowing if the current dose was going to be too mild or knock me out cold.  Plus no more long speeches about proper smoking technique when we are joined by those uninitiated to the deems.  Just a pinch of the DMT infused leaf in a bong and after 1 or 2 quick rips you're in full blown DMT space (although I find it to be a slightly different qualitative experience, even without the MAOI).  You can also just put it in a handpipe if you're looking for a slower, more immersive experience.  I've also found it to be more potent for some reason (or perhaps i wasn't vaporizing it correctly when we were using just the pure freebase), it only takes 30mg of DMT (this would be measured as 60mg of changa) to get me knocking on the door of a "breakthrough" with this method.  It's definitely the only way I'll be flying in the future.


Some observations:

--The smoke is very acrid if you put it in a bong and try to rip it like you would cannabis.  Use long slow inhalations and just get it lit enough to stay burning.  This makes it less harsh, and the blend burns slower at a lower temperature, wasting less DMT.  You can also split the dose among 2 or 3 bowl attachments so you can just clear a hit and reload quickly.

--This does not seem to work very well with 5-MeO-DMT.  Made a batch with 20mg of the stuff on green tea leaves and 8mg produced very weak effects.  I'd love to know if anybody has a way around this, or succeeded where I failed because I'd love to have 5-MeO leaf.

--Isopropanol is the ideal solvent IMO.  Very cheap and easy to get, and evaporates quickly enough.

--Speaking of evaporation, leave yourself a full night and day, maybe more depending on the amount you're using.  I've evaporated it quicker using a hot desk lamp but I found that this created an "uneven" laying so to speak, certain doses were very light and some others were much stronger than usual.  This could've just been my imagination, but I think its just a good rule of thumb not to try to speed up evaporation using heat.  Sometimes you smell it and think the solvent is totally evaporated, but it won't be.  I usually transfer the herbs to a pill bottle for storage after drying, and occasionally after a fresh batch I'll open up the bottle and smell isopropanol.  If this is the case I just lay it out on wax paper again for a few hours to dry further.

Hmmm... have got some syrian rue seeds.  And some n,n,DMT.  Can I get the Changa effect by making a mixture of ground rue seed and the DMT and smoking it?


And an above remark is incorrect... MAO inhibition on its own DOES have an effect... grind up 3g syrian rue seed and consume on an empty stomach.  About 45 mins later there is a DEFINITE and moderately strong tingly fuzzy high that develops.  Fairly pleasant all on its own, IMO.


See here for hints about historical "cultural" uses of the pure Syrian Rue seed for its psychoactive (and other medicinal) effects:  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmal)


(And of course it enhances pot, mushrooms, and DMT containing plants.)

Smoking syrian rue seeds sounds like it might be pretty unpleasant.  The do taste quite awful.  But i don't know why it wouldn't be effective. 


Peganum Harmala is definitely active on its own, but i don't think that all those effects are strictly attributable to MAO inhibition.

I'm relatively sure that smoking syrian rue seeds has been tried with success.  The dose for oral harmaloids is something like 150-200mg but when smoked you only need a very small amount, so the amount in a bowl of seeds might/should do the trick.  However if you're looking for a *-huasca type experience many people would probably urge you to use caapi.  you could also do an extraction (rue is real easy to extract) and then freebase the pure(ish) alkaloids, but I haven't been able to find a reliable dose estimate or scale for this proportional to the DMT.  As a result I've got 600mg or so of freebase harmalas just sitting around because i'm not sure what to do with them.

**Smoked B. Caapi**


If I were to smoke B. Caapi extract alone (10x from a vine, put on Spearmint) what would the duration and effects be? 


What would be a recommended dose to feel these effects?


If it were smoked with a tryptamine how much would the effects be intensified by and would you still smoke the same amount?


Also, my research suggests that ingesting an MAOI with psychedelic phens is safe, would it be safe to smoke this with a 2C or mescaline like compound? Would the intensity increase by a similar amount?


Thanks for reading all these questions, I've been searching around and haven't really found any concrete answers.

Well, it would be more intense, but reasonably safe, however you should NOT use a 2C-T-x in conjunction with an MAOI.

beg to differ.


grind up 1 tsp syrian rue and swollow on empty stomach.  in 45 mins you will DEFINITELY feel altered on the rue alone.


smoke the ground rue (a bit "earthy" but not bad and it definitely has immediate mental and physical effects that are borderline psychedelic.  combine with weed for an interesting synergy.


this is not just book-theory.  I've done both of the above.  (if you accuse me of reporting "placebo effect" as fact i'm gonna track you down and bitchslap y'all, haha :D )

**Changa ?**


Hey ppl, i dont know where you guys are from but in perth, wa, we make what i think you guys are talking about.

I've heard changa before i think thats the Queensland word but i could be wrong... anyways we call it dreamtime or dreamtime

Blend.... what it is...... the secret ingredients are no secret its actually not as exciting, i was asking how they make it for years.

You extract dmt from wherever, then you disolve it in vodka or something better if you know of something better. you get some legal highs 

with mullein and passiflora preferebly (this makes it last a little longer) otherwise any legal highs work, ive done it with damiana and it was sweet.

i say legal high cos weed doesnt work it kills it. and then u add the legal highs to the potent vodka. lay it on something flat till it dries and u got

dreamtime or changa(i think).

Vodka is a terrible solvent to use, and also very expensive. Try acetone.

Changa is definitley battling in my mind to be my favourite drug! *snip* this guy *snip* and then he passed me what looked to be like a spliff but it was a blunt of changa! tasted it straight away, short lasting but very very rewarding in both body and mind ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Have got another gram in my draw waiting to be smoked!

I really do not have the time for a full on oral ayahuasca trip right now or any time in the near future. Is 2oz of both p. viridis and caapi enough for a batch of changa, and if so, what would be a good recipe?

Well, you need to extract the DMT first, then dissolve it and apply the solution to your carrier. There's plenty of info on DMT extractions on BL.

What do i have to consider when smoking Changa (real Changa, i.e. a mixture of pure DMT and harmala alkaloids) regarding it's MAOI-properties? I mean can i eat/drink normally, what substances should i not take the same day/day afterwards? Help would be very appreciated.

^^ Avoid strong stimulants, red wine, and strong cheese. Changa contains a much milder form of MAOI than those to which the usual restrictions apply.


Look up 'RIMA' for more information.

So from what information i gathered there are no real restrictions when smoking Changa (with MAOIs in it), but most people say it's better to stay away from certain food (and substances of course), like above said because people tend to get bad headaches when eating normally and smoking DMT/MAOI-infused leaves. But my question still is: how long do i have to abstain from those things before and after the experience?

Just thought i would chime in with this. On Friday night/Saturday morning i smoked roughly about 5 hits of changa throughout the night, whilst also sniffing mephedrone & i felt completely fine, with no adverse reactions; as did my friend who did exactly the same as me.

^ No problem, but thanks for your reply. Man, i'm really tempted to test this one out, but i'm concerned about the MAOi-properties of the contained harmala. Don't wanna run around with a bad headache (at best) for the next few days and doing a strict diet for some days just for 15mins of fun doesn't sound better tbh.

Anyone any tips on making enuthused leaf? what leaf to use and what ratio? 


I dont have a scale so i have eye balled maybe 2:3 (two parts DMT one part leaf, probably weaker) using powered Banisteriopsis Caapi mixed tobacco using Acetone.


do you think this will be cool?


I dont want to used too much with my first try as DMT is expensive and I dont have the time to extract myself now

Doesn't tobacco itself contain MAOIs which are responsible in part for the plants addictige nature due to synergy with nicotine?  If there is enough MAOI in tobacco to effect the effects felt by a cigarette smoker,  wouldn't a DMT tobacco mix be enough to create a changa effect?  If anyone has tried this i would be very interested to hear about it, it already sounds to good to be true as i am typing it, but you never know right?

I recently got some changa. 1gr - %50 DMT. Tried today. Here is the trip report which was very short, sorry for that  It was my first dmt experience, hardly understand any of it. 


Dose: Around 100mg (Don't have a scale so I had to eyeball it) (I got used to eyeballing by salvia)

Setting: My room, midday and I was alone


I used a waterfall bong which I had done in like 4 min and a normal lighter.


Light it and got my finger off the water hole, smoke began to pour down. When it finished I took all of it in one pull which was extremely easy as it isn't harsh at all. Then I lay down on the bed. It had been just around 6-7 seconds that I thought I couldn't hold it any longer. But I tried to hold it. Then I began to feel the pressure on my head. I felt like it was gonna explode. My vision began to change, then I exhaled. Then everything went Alex Grey. Now I understand those paintings. The rest of the trip is really hard to explain because half the time I focused on my breathing. Because I didn't know if I was or not. I can't say I panicked. But it prevented me from focusing on the trip itself. The visuals were so powerful that I couldn't tell if my eyes were open or not. I was also really detached from by body. I felt thousand stuff the whole time. Nature, space, love, the meaning of life. It was like millions of thought rushing through me. The whole trip I heard the same tune, like a music. The weird thing is everything was so fast that I felt the trip lasted like 3-4 min (it lasted around 15 min).


The thing I love is that it felt so natural. I don't know I kind a felt the whole existence, hard to explain really. I will definitely try it again soon, then I think I can experience and understand it more.


I'll be very happy if you comment on this, especially the breathing problem.

Nuh-uh! The times I smoked changa it just lasted longer than DMT, but no longer than 15 minutes tops. It definitely made the experience more stretched out and easier to get a grip on. I generally find DMT very entertaining but rarely do I find it useful, unfortunately. Maybe it's my mindset, but I've never had any proper psychedelic use for DMT. That did feel different on changa though.

Think I'm finally gonna get around to making a bit of changa. In the interest of expediency I'd like to use as little solvent as possible. Is there a noticeable difference in the concentration levels you can get with EtOH vs isopropyl alcohol?

Don't use Isopropyl - seems to oxidize everything way too fast. Harmalas turn bright red using isopropyl! What happens with that? 


Acetone seems to work well and doesn't cause too much "reddening", except on the outside. 


Also don't evap using a fan if you can avoid it - the slower you let everything evap, the better it will all turn out.

^^ might want to put it in the oven on a low setting for it to evaporate, since whiskey is 60% water.  in theory it should work though.  it'll taste like whiskey afterwards.

I can tell you that you will not have a problem from bad diet and smoking changa,  for example ive done ayahuasca 2hours after mcdonalds.


Ive smoked prob over 100g of changa the last years and the only thing that has given me any side effects is dehydration, and usually that only comes from binging on it since it really dries you out.


Other than that ive done changa on most psychs, dissios and mdma a few times,  one time on mdma though i did get a headache on the comedown. 


Also most changa blends only contain 10-30% harmalas compared to dmt, so if your average hit of changa contains 30mg dmt then it will only have 3-10mg of harmalas in it, compare that to a oral dose of 150-300mf harmalas.

how would you know when the acetone is all evaporated? Mine is infused with peppermint so that overpowers it but theres that lingering acetone smelll being(i think). Is there any other ways of checking if its done? 

Also I only have 200mg of 1:1 left so what would be recommended for a breakthrough(this is enhanced leaf so no maoi).

WHAT ARE THE REAL RISKS of mixing smoked MAOI with other party drugs? Such as mdma, amphetamines, alcohol, marijuana. 


I've been doing a bit of research online, forum posts etc, and reading some very different reports. The danger seems mostly theoretical at this point. Is it possible that smoked maoi stays in the body a much shorter time and therefore poses much less risk compared to orally ingested maoi?


Seems like a decent amount of people are mixing changa with other drugs without even being aware of the potential risks.


As the popularity of changa seems to be growing I think there needs to be a saftey faq put out there or something.


What do you guys think? Has anyone directly experienced or observed a bad reaction? Does anyone know of a study that might give more information about the effects of smoked maoi?

Or even heard about one... not really from combining. And I've talked to thousands of people about Changa. 


People taking SSRI's can still smoke Changa, but may get a headache afterwards. 


Other people have reported inexplicable reactions, not from combining with any drug, which could be anything really. 


The beta carbolines from the caapi vine seem really safe to me, there is an intelligence, a spirit in the vine that assists and heals. Harm isn't really part of reperioitre. I guess if you were using synthetic MAOI's in Changa, it might be a whole lot different. A lot of warning about MAOI's originally come from the rare reactions people have hadfrom synthetic MAOI's. When first released onto the market in the 1950's, these warnings were not present, as they were so rare as to not come up in the trials. 


I've only heard of people having reactions to syrian rue, after drinking red wine 24 hours before or after taking syrian rue. Apart from that, I haven't heard of anything else!

I am planning to try DMT, would you guys recommend starting with changa? Would anyone specifically advise against that?

Might sound stupid, but I've used 

Lavender and chamomile. I don't know which one of those two plants is a teacher.

But i have come to respect that when you are smoking dmt and prying open your third eye.

Whatever admixture you use, be it a simple one even something as simple as Chamomile and Lavender, it will produce a different series of effects.

I find the Chamomile allows breaking through into higher dimensions alot easier, there is something that intially removes all anxiety.

But it seems to make it very amorphous. Like you can just go on forever. I don't know about you guys but it always seems to be when i smoke just normal DMT.

There is a Rush Into infinity but after you've reached like a Halcyon point you don't really go any farther, you've broken down all of the dimensions. 


I remember when i did my most recent batch of 20:1 Lavender//Chamomile Changa mix eventually i hit a purple void which felt like the true character behind the Lavender. 

It, isn't an incredibly happy sort i've found full of mystery and intensity. Questioning as to why you have entered it's domain.


The Chamomile Changa on it's own is Bliss. 

But this hyper infusion of the two blends left me feeling a little raped afterwards.

Hello! 


I'm new to this Forum and I have some Questions ...


so first:


If I had DMT, then would it be better to make Changa out of it and store the Changa or would it be better to store the DMT itself as a Crystal ?


And whether the first or the second: How do you securely store it ? Just in a Baggy and then freeze it ?


And if yes or not: Then how long would it be consumable ? When would it start to loose its effects ? 


Thanx !

I' may be picking some Changa up in the near future-it seems like it's more similar to Ayahuasca than solo DMT and doesn't involve nausea/purging due to being smoked . Is this an accurate interpretation?


Are there those who prefer it to Aya or regular DMT as well-and if so what is it about Changa that  makes you prefer it?

changa at medium dose is like a short high dose shroom trip just way more clear headed.

Finally have gotten to try changa and one thing that comes to mind...it's such a smooth inhalation it doesn't feel harsh at all.  I guess it depends on the blend.  Mine had the claim of 40 percent DMT, and a blend of Syrian Rue/Chaliponga leaf.
