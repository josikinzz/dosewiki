*iupac = (8β)-N-Isopropyl-N,6-dimethyl-9,10-didehydroergoline-8-carboxamide*


The production of this compound was hinted at by a very reputable source. There is next to nothing on this compound that I can find on the web, besides a single erowid article. If anyone has any useful information on this one I would love to hear it!


I also think it is pretty neat this thread turned into a Small & Handy

I never heard of that one but the substitutions make sense to me in a way. seems to be similarily bulky compared to N,N-diethyl (LSD).

Oh MIPLA! I didn't expect this would see the light of day, thought it would be PRO-LAD next for sure. MIPLA does seem like one of the more promising lysergemides. It will be interesting to see how this substitution affects the effects.

They said they are dropping pro-lad in about 6 months, not sure if there is a set release on this one.

I kinda do as well, as much as it pains me to imagine some sort of ban is immenent. They also addressed LSZ, saying the synth was difficult and they were not going to persue it. Not that I cared for it, but it is worth noting. I am still however interesed in what this particular compound is all about. From what I read it is somewhat stimulating and not as "balls to the walls" as some of the other lysergimides. Looking for more info, the structure is very interestimg to say the least.

I know a guy who've tried MIPLA once (he got it from a non-RC lab somewere) He said it was like LSD, but different, less potent than LSD obviously. I'll ask him about details next time I see him. 


It would be very interesting to try.

Theres a kinda trip report on erowid [https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/me...de/methylisopropyl_lysergamide_article1.shtml](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/methylisopropyl_lysergamide/methylisopropyl_lysergamide_article1.shtml).


> After my third bioassay of methylisopropyl-lysergamide (aka lamid) as a known substance, I now believe it is the same mysterious drug that my friends and I encountered in a small run in the 1990s, which was provided to us as "another sort of acid" by my primary acid dealer. We all also had LSD during the same time, and it was clearly not the same molecule. My dealer called it "the beauty kind," but soon most of us were referring to it as "candy acid." It might be synonymous with the similarly curious "acid lite" that appeared in limited quantities during the late 1990s in England under the name "bliss." I bioassayed candy acid a couple dozen times during those years, and was left both wanting more and wondering what the fuck it had been.
> 
> 
> 
> Unlike LSD, lamid does not appear to become fully psychedelic even with increased dosages. Its effects were largely the same with 200 mics as with 100 mics, except for a relatively minor increase in euphoria and stimulation, with a significant increase in body load. Friends in the 1990s attempting to get stronger visual effects by taking far larger doses (well into the low milligrams) generally reported falling asleep. It does not appear capable of ever reaching colorful and geometric levels.
> 
> 
> 
> The known material, provided on blotter paper, tasted like some sort of acetate. But otherwise the "taste"--more a feeling than a flavor--was distinctly acid-like. First alerts appeared within 15 minutes, with onset around 40 minutes. There was lots of rushing euphoria, delicious radiant body sensations, altered perception, and a nicely magical glow to the world, but with maybe a tenth as much mental alteration and almost no introspection, as compared to LSD. Nevertheless, the introspection that was there was gentle and clear-minded, compared to the sometimes pushy self-analytical character of acid. Socializing was easy and comfortable, even when a surprise visitor dropped by.
> 
> 
> 
> The body load was similar to LSD. Around onset, there was a bit of edginess with some minor cramping, and abdominal discomfort was intermittent throughout the experience. Movement took more effort than normal; but, overall, walking was no problem and enjoyable. Hot tubbing was fine, although I overheated fairly rapidly.
> 
> 
> 
> While there were not many visuals, anything showing any movement looked odd and exaggerated. Especially outdoors, everything appeared to be hyper-real, as if there was too much contrast or as if the auto level command in Photoshop had been applied to an overly dark digital photo.
> 
> 
> 
> Sex required focus, with minor difficulty maintaining an erection. Tactile senses were elevated, and the erotic/sensuousness aspects were really sweet. It showed less than a three hour peak, and the effects had largely faded by the sixth hour, with only minor residuals for several more hours.
> 
> 
> 
> This is a really nice molecule if one can resist viewing it as an "acid substitute." It's a wonderful thing on its own: euphoric, stimulating, and mind altering in an open, expansive way that permits easy contact with other people and one's surroundings. If a person wanted to ingest acid, he or she probably would be disappointed with lamid, consider it boring, or maybe not even like it, since it largely lacks visuals and is missing most of the mental aspects of acid (preserving only around 10% of them), yet it retains many of acid's somatic discomforts, such as the inability to comfortably regulate one's temperature and significant elements of body load.
> 
> 
> 
> However, if someone wanted to visit a museum, participate in an interactive public situation, or go out and socialize, lamid could be an ideal molecule. I suspect that it will find a place of great value if judged on its own merits, rather than being thought of as a replacement for LSD.

Really interesting trip report. I'm very curious about this "acid lite" that the reporter claims was circulating in the UK in the late 90s. That's the language a lot of people use to describe AL-LAD (myself included), it would be pretty neat if that was going around back then. 


If the report is indeed about MIPLA, it's sounds like this should be a pretty interesting and unique drug.

The "very reputable source" the OP was refering to posted this on uk research :

So it doesnt look like MIPLA will come out any time soon especially because of the new blanket ban in the uk

That is why I rephrased what I said. The uk ban isn't effecting anything, though. They are moving, and dropping pro-lad within the next 6 months. While it may not be available for sometime the fact that they are hinting at this being produced with almost nothing out on it is obviously very worth noting.

It could become very popular as a party drug because of it's relatively short duration of 6 hours, and more entactogenic than psychedelic qualities. Shulgin & Nichols wanted to keep it a best kept secret.

I don't think this compound is being distributed at all, so this small & handy was probably premature.

Nonetheless, I think we all eagerly await.

Everytime I read Dresden trying to coin another drug slang term it sounds like Gretchen Weiners from Mean Girls whenever she's trying to "make *"fetch"* happen" ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Anyway, Albert Hofmann himself wrote that most of the N,N-dialkyl substituted lysergamides (including N-Methyl, N-Ethyl) are about an order of magnitude weaker than LSD-25, with only MIPLA being ~1/2 the potency of LSD.

According to Nichols, the only substitutions at the amide nitrogen that come even closer are 2,4-dimethyl-azetidide ("LSZ"), 2-butyl amide ("LSB") and 3-pentyl amide ("LSP").

Yes, MIPLA certainly seems like one of the few remaining, potentially promising and interesting avenues in the lysergamide exploration.

These are some of the most promising lysergamides that I know of, from most potent to least potent (in rats at least):


R-LSB > ECYPLA > LSD > LSP > MIPLA > R-2-LSP > IPLA > S-LSB > EIPLA > LSM


I think the tert-butyl and isobutyl are pretty potent too but I can't find much information about them.

Didn't the rats also find AL-LAD and LSZ to be "stronger" (as in "easier to detect in a drug discrimination test") than LSD, though?


MIPLA atleast has actually been evaluated in man, so that might have been a reason why they went with that one over LSP. Makes you wonder whether LSB would be worth it - even as a racemate I would expect it to be 1/2 the potency of LSD or higher in man, but there's still the risk that it (and especially the likely dystomer, S-LSB) could produce an unfavorable visuals-to-bodyload ratio, similar to LSZ and LSM-775.

I still have high hopes for some of these lysergamides that are reputed to have a high bodyload such as LSM-775 - that one in particular sounds like it could be the lysergamide equivalent of 5-MeO-DMT, another drug that has sometimes been overlooked because of it's lack of visuals, but which many find to be a bit of a psychedelic pinnacle. Haven't tried LSM-775 however, it's a bit too precious.

MIPLA is available from a Polish supplier, dosed at 200ug.

Has anyone had any experience worth mentioning?

**MIPLA TR: Tripping well grounded**


25 May 2018: 1st Trial of alleged 200 μg MIPLA tabs from Poland


This was a planned, much-anticipated first experience with MIPLA, a novel lysergamide. Novel to me certainly, with little hard documentation to go on. I had heard, on highest authority, MIPLA was a good one. Atypically, I did not test this material. I took it on faith, and good background, the material I received was genuine. I presumed it was authentic MIPLA, and I still do. 


Because I usually trip alone, I've experienced many psychedelics only at low to modest levels. I've had only one truly difficult experience years ago which was deeply unsettling at the time. Happily, it was calmly integrated over days-to-weeks, with only positive, lasting insights. 


Right then: All systems go, no heroics, hoping for the best, ready for the worst.


2:30 pm	0:00	One tab of blotter paper (uncoloured and, unusually, without markings of any kind) goes under the tongue--about an hour after coffee, two waffles and a muffin. Tastes of nothing, no bitterness, no numbness. Good sign. I head for the uni campus, a favourite tripping destination. It's idyllic, familiar, quiet in summer, a short walk away. It's a beautiful day, ideal for this.


2:50 pm	0:20	There's still no taste or numbness, maybe a vague hint of astringency that could easily be attributed to the blotter paper itself. I swallow the tab with a swig of water, while walking to the uni.


3:10 pm	0:40	I'm now at the uni campus, sitting on a bench. The weather is perfect, very warm with a refreshing breeze, few clouds. I abruptly feel not just an alert, but at +1. I feel like I just landed here, that the time spent walking here has gone to zero. 


This is odd because I can recall many points along the way perfectly well. I've taken this route countless times, but the city reveals something new of itself every time, in the right-here, right-now moments along the way. And so too today. 


Now that feels collapsed. Time restarts now.


I'm definitely in +1 territory already. I feel something in my gut. Nothing like nausea, more like warmth, just awareness really. I wonder about chakras for a minute. I vaguely imagine one of them is assigned there, maybe? Not really my thing, I'm now imagining generalized 5-HT activity in my gut instead. It's hardly anything. I forget about it and press on. I'm liking this.


3:40 pm	1:10	I'm laying flat on the grass, on the bank of a pathway where once was a creek, long since buried. It's very tranquil here, very still, with only a handful of people scattered about. This is a perfectly manageable +2, with no sharp edges whatsoever. Visually there's not a lot going on, things are a bit brighter, a bit crisper is all. Even the clouds are just toying with me. At times, with other compounds, clouds can transfix me, drop me to my knees. Not today.


I feel perfectly safe here. There's good foundation for that; I live in a very safe city and the uni is a privileged enclave within that city. But to feel *this safe*, at +2, is remarkable. I've been right here before, on half a tab of ETH-LAD, on a day like this. I felt safe enough that day; I feel safer today. There is zero edge to this material. I close my eyes for a while. I'm just being still, and grateful to live in this place. 


4:15 pm	1:45	I think this +2 is as full on as I'm going to get. This is just great, easy, manageable, social. Senses are slightly enhanced, not at all distracting as I continue wandering about the uni. It's a big campus, with lots of lawns to loll about on.


I duck into a building to refill my water bottle at a fountain. I've learned where the good fountains are. I'm again filled with gratitude this uni is here, stitched seamlessly into the city with no clear perimeter. You mostly just know when you're there. 


No one is walking around in gowns yet but that's coming soon. They're setting up for it now. I hear snatches of conversations among the few students around today. They sound a bit giddy.  Listening to them makes me smile. 


4:45 pm	2:15	Still at +2, now back at the bench where time restarted. A friendly young man walks by and smiles at me, twice. He's happy about something and I'm happy for him. That's enough to smile back. 


5:00 pm	2:30	Still at +2, looking now at a pair of ancient cannons from a long forgot colonial past, on yet another lawn. I read the plaque explaining all this. Cannons don't interest me much, but for a moment I imagine the men who loaded and fired these clunky looking weapons. Maybe I speak English, and not French, because of them.


I'm starting to feel sunburned, also a bit lonely. That's not uncommon for me while tripping, and I don't mind. Time to plot a course back home though. 


There are many alternative routes but there's no avoiding the very much faster pace, off-campus, at 5 pm, on a Friday. I opt for a meandering route through city parks and alleys, skirting the busier streets and intersections. 


This leg of the journey is always more challenging, but in some ways the most instructive. I've lived here for decades at various addresses. Always in the core, just a few city blocks apart. Every street corner is known to me, or once was. But the city is transforming, faster than I realize. 


The trip is evocative, full of nostalgia. Old buildings are being demolished, parking lots excavated. Twenty-storey towers, emptied and skinned down to the steel, reincarnated as 60-storey hulks. 


All along I'm retracing my history, intersecting with my past. Time only seems linear until you step out of it, now it seems much more fluid and simultaneous. I imagine myself half a life ago, walking towards me. What would I say to him, I wonder? Of course, I wouldn't have to say anything--he'd look right through me.


5:30 pm	3:00	I'm on a bench again, in a ratty park in the gay village. I lived around here for many years. I exchange nodding hellos with the three guys next to me. Two of them look like women, and I wonder idly for a second how deep that goes. But they're at ease, I'm at ease, and it's moot. One likes my shirt. "Thank you, it kind of goes with what I'm on." Knowing smiles all around, and I'm off again.


5:45 pm	3:15	I'm at what I'll call a fully-assimilated +2. Happy, content, with my heart opened up like a kid. If called upon, I could probably dial it back to baseline in a moment; it's that pliable. I spot a couple I'd seen many blocks earlier, sharing a slice of pizza. Different paths, same endpoint. I pass the unfilled pool where skateboarders congregate, many more today than usual. I feel the pang of inchoate sympathy for the people hanging around the new supervised-injection site. I doubt most people, including the locals, even realize it's there. 


6:00 pm	3:30	Home, and glad to be. I spend a few hours reflecting on the nature of this material, listening to music, and tentatively plugging back into the online world. 


8:00 pm	5:30	Things have smoothly descended to +1. 


Regarding this compound, let's presume it's indeed MIPLA. This was wonderful day, and MIPLA was a great ally today. How much of that goes to the chemistry I really can't say. I've come to believe expectations play a much bigger role than I used to think. I wasn't expecting a full-on, +3 or more experience else I'd never have set out on a field trip. 


Some might find this compound wanting, but I'd rather think of it as fail-safe. I liked AL-LAD for the same reasons, and this feels safer still. There was no anxiety, no troubling or intrusive thoughts, no body load, and little residual stimulation. I was at ease every moment. Even for an old pro, that's quite something. 


1P-LSD is more demanding, but offers more rewards, more awesome. I'm not always up to awesome. Sometimes I want to be grounded. MIPLA, today, was tripping well grounded.

They will discontinue MIPLA and make 1-P-MIPLA instead. Apparently MIPLA has the same molecular weight as LSD.

Well yeah, they're both C20H25N3O.


LSD has two ethyl chains on the amide, while MIPLA has one methyl group and one isopropyl chain.

I'd rather have prefered if they had made 1-A-MIPLA. I somehow feel 1-P metabolism is a bit slower than 1-A. Maybe it's just in my head, who knows.


 Apparently some other new lysergamides are in the pipeline, while others are being discontinued. Yay

Even if you use GC/MS which looks at the molecular weight, it also looks at ionized fractions of the molecule and there should be small differences, namely at that amide.


Pretty exciting there's some novel interesting lysergamide around!

a few years ago a friend of mine was caught with some gray area 5-IT, which got misidentified as aMT, which is illegal here.

I guess they break into the same fragments, since the sidechain is simply on another part of the indole

Your trip report was very well written, and gave a clear idea og what MIPLA is. I think the intesrest is dwindling because it's being discontinued and it isn't going to be freely available to everyone anyway.


I think MIPLA sounds lovely, but to me personally, it's not something I really need. Low dose LSD is already to me completely what you describe. Of cause, I'd still like to try it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This just showed up in my home country from a reputable source. Ships worldwide.


 Will report back by Tuesday.

Was any consensus ever reached regarding higher doses?  I used to start and redose the late Spaniard's (RIP) golden ALD-52 at 500 mikes a piece without tolerance so I am a hard-head.


I don't want to waste material but I may start at 400 all the same, but I recall reading elsewhere the higher doses don't add much - I know what to expect I just don't want to waste. My internet access is sadly limited, any help or reference is greatly appreciated! Otherwise a full write-up from myself with years of extensive and extreme experiences and my lady's first LA experience will be written up by mid next week.


I'd wanted this for a long time to show her before trying my last of the spaniards gold. If this is what this source is selling it as, I will let you kind folk know. She's not let me down before but there is always a chance. I can afford the risk/reward.

I don't know of any consensus on higher doses.


On the one hand, harm reduction principles would never say to jump in at 400ug with this brand new compound, but on the other hand if 500ug of ALD-52 is your normal dose, then you are indeed a major hard-head, so 400ug of MIPLA doesn't sound too reckless - IF this really is MIPLA, and IF there isn't some really wild steep dose curve to it. It sounds like your home country vendor is highly reputable if tis the one I'm thinking of, so I would expect it to be the real deal.


Either way, let us know how it goes, data on MIPLA is precious at this point!

It sounds like your home country vendor is highly reputable if tis the one I'm thinking of, so I would expect it to be the real deal.

aye, tis the one you imagine sir.


I've done worse than what can be put onto paper but i shall start with one because you are right but 2 will follow a week later if not another or 2 at a underwhelming 1:30

Sadly an injury at work means no days off so it may be until next tuesday before I can return. If I can find consenus on safety before then and I am searching, 2 for sure, to start is my intent. Likely to redose.


Like i said I can afford the risk/reward easy I just don't want to waste a gem by hitting a ceiling and trying to push on it. got a bit of a history with that


I don't know what happened to the spaniard but he was laid to rest in a casket of Solid BTC with inlays of ETH and LTC flourishes adorning... We all made sure of that. I hope he at least has use of them in the afterlife but of course I would hope for ressurection... We were together for 7 and a half years and I remember the moment I worried for his health, my life has changed since - not better or worse, just changed. Miss him. I'm and you are lucky to have known him. People don't believe me when I tell them even the smallest details of what he was like. Golden Age man. Glad we saw/are seeing it.

Maybe the problem was that they were (knowingly?) shipping substances to other EU countries where these substances are banned? This was an international organization, and the operation that took it down likewise involved both Spanish and Austrian police units (one of the ringleaders was a citizen of Austria, which pretty much has a blanket ban on novel psychoactives, so it would be hard for them to claim ignorance of the law).


And if you're getting paid in crypto and no "legit" crypto exchange/bank wants to do business with you, money laundering (which they were also charged with) is pretty much unavoidable. I'm not sure if they had all their tax forms in order either.


Or they might simply have gotten greedy like the Dutch people that got busted last year, and run an illegal darknet operation alongside their *sorta*-legal clearnet business.

There are a couple of reports on r*ddit, doesn't look particularly interesting (although the short duration could be a plus in certain situations), and as expected, it's not very potent. 

On 200 ug  one kid spent his trip playing Call of Duty... I guess more valuable reports will pop up soon.

I'm very interested in getting some to try, even if it doesn't turn out particularly interesting..  If it is really 40% potency of LSD then 200 ug may just not be enough, especially if it is qualitatively weaker in other ways.

I read somewhere that it has a very shallow dose curve, and that 200ug isn't a lot more strong than 100ug, so I'm wondering if this is the kind of drug to just accept that it's a small shot, and enjoy at the lower end of the range rather than trying to push it up into the Big Trip territory.


I'll try to experiment with it at 100ug and 200ug to report back.

Are the effects of MIPLA not interesting enough to write about or are people just not trying it? It's been out for a few months now, I would think plenty of people would have taken it. Maybe trying novel lysergamides isn't that exciting to people anymore.

Lazy fuckers... I've been wondering the same. I don't know why I've been procrastinating myself.. no excuses really. It's amazing we have the opportunity to be some of the first people in the whole world to test this stuff out!

I just got five hits but its going to be about a month before my tolerance resets from all the ALD 52 I did last week. I assume is it cross tolerates and want to give it a fair shake. Wonder if I should I expect the almost LSD experience of 1p/ALD or if its more like its own unique experience like AL/ETH-LAD. 

 I was kind of hoping there would be more info on this, I will report back

Shulgin's lab notes have some MIPLA trip reports. He called it "Lamide".


[https://www.erowid.org/library/book...shulgin_pharmacology_notebookc_searchable.pdf](https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/shulgin_labbooks/shulgin_pharmacology_notebookc_searchable.pdf)


Here's a quote from Ann: 


> This material, I think, is better than the Great Lucy, just by a smidgen, but a rather important smidgen. It clangs less. It is straighter, quieter and in some ways - no, I was about to say deeper, but that wouldn't make sense. Lucy is as cosmic a path as you could ask for; the Lamide is just a bit less cluttered, and somehow there is more quiet humor, for me, with this material.

I can't seem to attach the pdf, so here's a Dropbox link [https://www.dropbox.com/s/7gcxobvq3rovtfh/MIPLA.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7gcxobvq3rovtfh/MIPLA.pdf?dl=0)

Interesting that Shulgin considered it slightly better than LSD.  Then again, he considered 2C-B better than just about anything.  Thanks for the link, Bluelight is set to not be able to attach files to threads, unfortunately.

Great post cj187 - Interesting and at times cryptic notes. Especially the short form notes (Sasha's?).


What the heck is "Freddie" that AP. compares it to? Some long forgotten slang name for MDMA? I also wonder what is the "Death Valley Material" he mentions.


Definitely positive reviews on the whole from these old explorers.

Kinda make sense though, as some people have described MiPLA as a less headspacey, kinda MDMA-esque lysergamide. Whereas 2C-B is the PEA version of that. Shulgin apparently loved his empathogens. He abused the fuck out of MDMA as a social enhancer, calling it a "low calorie martini" or something like that in PIHKAL.

Not really, I think, but judging for what he said on his books and interviews he was dosing quite casually. Using it as a writing aid and at social gatherings and such. I also recall reading somewhere that he was dubious of the neurotoxicity of MDMA when the first evidence started appearing. He was saying something along the lines that the animal models used in studies were not realiable.


I dont think he was the kind of guy to be dropping heavy doses daily, but wouldnt be surprised if he was taking moderate doses at least biweekly at some point. I also recall reading an interview where Ann said she was using it pretty often for a year straight to help with her writing.


Anyway, sorry everyone for offtopic.

OK .. finally took this for a spin.. I hope I don't disappoint you in saying that I only took a half tab. Being that I tend to be very sensitive to psychedelics and that there aren't many reports on MIPLA, I cut a 200ug tab in half and gummed it. 


100ug - Was very, very mild. So light that I feel confident in recommending experienced trippers go ahead and jump in at 200ug. It was very pleasant, felt good in the body and mind even 10 hours after dosing. It had that a certain familiar lysergamide warmth to it that's hard to put into words. Strangely it hit me in a wave about 8 hours in, with one of those moments of .. such-ness? triggered by some beautiful music. Anyways it was extremely light on the whole, very nice. I'll have no hesitation to test a higher dose and am looking forward to 200ug the next time the opportunity arises.

Are you sure your tabs are 300ug? The only MIPLA tabs I've heard about are 200ug.

I took one 200 microgram dose on the weekend, I like it. I agree with everything in the Shuligan notes. It had like zero negativity, no sinister undercurrent whatsoever. No body load or any negative body effects. It felt great. Also short acting, peaked in a few hours and 7 hours after I took it I was going to bed. I am usually an 8 plus hour tripper with 3 hours of post trip glow and the another hour or two after that where I can't sleep. This stuff I was tired after and slept easy. And usually this class of drugs just kills me and I oversleep after, but with MiPLA I didn't wake up the next day exhausted. 


I didn't get any visuals, but this is a probably a low dose. I suspect it may be less than 50 percent of LSD's potency. I thought 200 micrograms of this it was similar to a trip of around 50 micrograms of LSD rather than a 100 microgram dose. I could have a built up tolerance, cant say 100 percent for sure. I think most people will agree its pretty mild at this level. Next time I plan to try 300 micrograms though I suspect my own sweet spot with this one may still be higher than that. As a new and untested drug I am going to play it safe and only increase dose by half a hit each time, you never know. 


If I had to choose a 200 mic dose of AL-LAD or this I would choose MiPLA, the low dose AL-LAD trips I found lacking and kind of boring. 200 mics of MiPLA was mild but still interesting and fun, like a low dose LSD trip.  That's probably the best comparison I could give. It would, in my opinion, be good for one of those times you want to have fun at a show or art gallery or whatever but don't want a full blown mystical experience. The post trip day after glow was nice, it might be a good drug to investigate as a mood enhancer. I will try it again but it's going to be a while, likely in 2019

Nice, glad to hear another report on this one, there are surprisingly few.  I need to make sure to get this while it's available, gotta wait a while for funds to get more available though.

Nice one. You're assessment that 200ug is about as potent as 50ug LSD seems right to me - when I took 100ug it felt something like 20-30ug of LSD, so 1/4 the potency seems a good rough guideline. Let's see how it scales though - it's possible that MIPLA stays steeper as you increase the dose, and doesn't saturate as early as LSD. Or, or the opposite could be true. Like you said, best to proceed upward at around 100ug at a time.


I thought my next trial would be 200ug, but maybe I'll try 300ug since we have a report here at 200.

(MIPLA+MDMA trip report from [Erowid 's MIPLA experience page](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_MIPLA.shtml))


Extra Ordinary


This past summer I was in one of the most profound and beautiful psychedelic state of my life. The peak plateau lasted for about 5 hours, with hours and even days of afterglow. It’s difficult to discern to what degree this experience is due to set and setting. Maybe in sharing some of its ingredients, repetition is possible. I hope so. 


It was the final evening of a festival week and all music had already ended, except at the chill-out area. The past week had taken its toll on me. I was feeling very tired from less sleep than usual, dancing and dealing with the heat. I had also been working daily, as a psychedelic harm reduction volunteer; which gives but can also take. 


When my shift was over, I went for a light meal (9-10 pm) and downed 2 coffees after. I am not so used to drinking coffee, but one cup was definitely not enough to get me going. I was unsure if this last festival evening still had something in store, and unsure if I would do any drugs, but food and coffee was a good start. Later in the evening I arrived at the chill-out temple and shared a few sips of my favorite rum (1 am) with a colleague. Earlier on he had confided he loved whiskey and was delighted to hear that I had brought a bottle of fine rum to the festival. (only 12 years old but in finesse easily overtakes others a decade older!) I wasn’t into drinking that night, so, I only had a few sips for taste. 

A friend was by that time enjoying some first waves of 2C-B. Normally I tend towards leveling my state with party friends. Instead of taking 2C-B as well, I decided however to dip a bit of pure MDMA in my mouth (1h30 am – 35mg I estimate, in retrospect). It was clear that the festival week was having its positive effects too: I felt in touch with myself and could easily stand in my own truth of the moment. 


When the MDMA came on, I swallowed 3/4 of a 200?g tab of MIPLA (2 am – so 150 ?g) after letting the tab sit sublingually for a few minutes. Candyflipping gurus on the internet tell me that I need to be over the peak of the MDMA before adding a psychedelic. Otherwise the effects just fight each other. But it just felt right to do the MIPLA then and there. I had tried 150?g of MIPLA for the first time some weeks earlier, in a safe setting at home. MIPLA was clearly a friendly and easy-going substance that time. Generally, I half my doses on festivals but the fluo flashiness of the trance vibe had already ended and I felt safe enough to do the same dose. 


Half an hour later (2h30 am), I started falling into an extra-ordinary state. I looked at people dancing to the slow beats, moving like plants on an ocean floor, and the beauty touched me profoundly; not so in a trippy way ‘moving like plants’ however – MIPLA had only soft visual effects – but more metaphorically, while at the same time feeling the beauty of a person, whoever my eyes would land on. One song was just the perfect match. I went up to the DJ and asked the track title: Paul Schulleri “Sirene (Zen Baboon remix).” It had taken a whole week of cooking in this pot called ‘festival’ to produce this chill-out vibe of people sitting, sleeping and dancing. It felt unique and I was glad to be there. Everybody was in some kind of cocoon, with his or her own festival and life history, and underlying that, in a shared mellow “cooked” state. 


Only at the end of the evening did I try to objectively define my state of mind. I hadn’t been inclined to do that earlier, which is unusual for me. But it was impossible to define my state! I would focus unto something, like the morning mist on the lake, and my whole being would just be filled with the beauty of it, overwhelmingly, pushing out any thoughts or thought processes that were going on in my head. I could not analyze. So it was not that I was overlooking a scene and thinking “Oh.. everything is so beautiful”, which can happen in other psychedelic states. It was more a reality in which I became a building block of the surroundings, which at the same time enveloped me in the experience of the whole. 


I was in a kind of clear observing, experiencing mode. However self-consciousness was mostly not part of that because everything I did just happened naturally and in tune with reality. When something unharmonious would occur in an interaction with someone, I would just move to harmony with the whole again, without any effort, and I could “solve” the situation naturally without unnecessary feelings of shame in me or giving them to others. At some point I needed to make clear to someone that I didn’t like having her around me. Being assertive was not difficult, and it went in a gentle and caring way. 


I felt playful and trippy and went on a discovery mission. Wandering around, I found a group of four people who had created a funny micro-habitat somewhere on the ground of the chill-out temple. They were lying under a blanket on top of an air mattress in the shape of a pineapple. My brain was still relatively sharp and with humor intact, connecting was easy. At some point I enjoyed just listening to them, softly talking into each other’s ears. The intimacy of the dialogue sounds was pure bliss. I wished I had a bunch of friends like that whom I could have an under-the-blanket-session with. (Or probably just a girlfriend.) My only friend there was not in a “cozy around” mood. So, since that was not an option, which was fine, I hung around to the side of the pineapple club for a while. 


Joining them under the blanket, becoming part of their festival casserole, did not feel appropriate. To be sure I was not on some ego trip, I checked with them if they minded me hanging around them. They happily said “not at all.” I like to keep an eye on possible ‘ego trips’ because MDMA and psychedelics can put me in touch with the divine, allow me to see through unfiltered eyes, but controlling and conditioned aspects of the ego can still break through that and warp the experience, without me being aware in a blissed state. (Paradoxically from these states, my unconscious ego games are brought more easily into the light than from an ordinary sober state.) 


I noticed that only one specific ‘ego game’ could take me out of the amazing mind-body state: the feeling of being special. When I would think I could be of any special meaning to someone because of my unique state, that idea would take me out of it. Or any interacting from that mindset would be unharmonious. If I ‘d just surrender and be and move, the impact of my state on someone would just right. If that happened. 


Because of the minimal visual effects of MIPLA it was like moving in ordinary reality. If I wanted to be in a more visual psychedelic reality, I probably could have intensified that. But I didn’t feel the need to focus on the psychedelic alterations. I did only so for a moment with my eyes closed.

I didn’t feel the need to focus on the psychedelic alterations. I did only so for a moment with my eyes closed.

The closed-eyed visuals were peacock feather style, which is just my absolute favorite. I felt blessed with that, because it doesn’t happen often in my psychedelic explorations. Everything that had happened until that moment, the whole festival, had been perfect. In this trip report I can only share a few things, but there were many coincidences and some difficult situations that were necessary to make this evening possible. And I felt deeply grateful. 


Towards the morning the chill-out temple had become quite chilly. With a warm chai in my hands I wandered off into the sunrise at the lake (7h30 am). Then to the camping (8h30 am). I lay down in my hammock and started to reflect on some difficult situations of the day before. I could easily move into them, reflect and find resolutions if necessary. At some point, without any sad feelings, tears just streamed down my face, triggered by a memory of the day before. A release from the deep. 


I had a meeting to attend at 11am and needed a piece of fruit and a coffee. I wanted to speak at that meeting and the lack of sleep was starting to make my brain fuzzy. I ended up not being able to say things completely in the way I wanted to say them, but it felt okay and ‘just the way it is’. (Hey, that’s Bruce Hornsby, right?! – Sorry guys, I grew up in the 80’ies.) 


What was left of me in these last hours, was a deep peaceful joy in being ordinary. Nothing cool or fancy walking on the festival grounds… just me. 


This whole trip didn’t leave me with specific “profound revelations,” as I call, a bit ironically, my psychedelic insights. It was the state of being. Days and weeks after, I would be unexpectedly ‘touched by it’ or I could reconnect to it by listening to that Zen Baboon song again. In the bigger picture I have the impression that I‘ve changed a tiny bit, for the better. I have moved a bit closer to my true nature. 


I am very grateful to everyone who made the experience possible.

I took 300ug of MIPLA a few days ago. I spent the first few hours of the trip hiking on some trails near where I live. MIPLA is not very stimulating, and instead has a lethargic nature that made hiking feel like a chore. I kept thinking about how much more enjoyable it would be if I had instead taken LSD or AL-LAD, or nothing at all. In some ways it did feel very much like LSD, but a huge part of the experience was missing and I felt uninspired. Afterwards I found that MIPLA is better suited for lounging at home.


MIPLA is very light compared to LSD or even AL-LAD. It's more comparable to LSZ, but has less body load and is less synthetic feeling. I would say 1/4 the potency of acid is fairly accurate, but they really can't be compared directly, and I don't think going above 300ug would improve the effects. I plan to try a 200ug dose at some point.  I'm not sure what to think of MIPLA yet. I wouldn't say I'm impressed with it but it seems like it might be fun in the right setting.

At almost 2 hours later for 2nd hit I'm going say it doesn't count. Redosing doesn't work well with lysergics, I have never been able to extend an LSD trip doing it, I have come to the conclusion its pretty much a waste and that tolerance has started even before the drug has fully kicked in.


Anyway i did 300 this weekend, loved it again. It seems to make me, aroused? Both times I took it, I don't like to use labels like this but its kind of an aphrodisiac. Still no visuals, and if my 1/4 of LSD strength estimate is correct that isn't unusual for me. Anyway I have like 50+ hits so i plan to experiment with increased dosages over time. Both trips have been positive, no body problems, easy sleep after. I haven't found any downside to it, it's less intense but I know a lot of people for whom LSD is way too intense.

Not sure if you have tried AL-LAD but it sounds even more friendly (although they aren't really related analogues)? Thanks for reporting on this substance ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've only tried al-lad but not mipla. AL-LAD is very enjoyable. MIPLA sounds quite boring.

I took 200ug today and it turned out to be a nice dose. I have to agree with the reports that higher doses don't increase the effects much. This pretty much feels the same as 300ug. It's nice stuff for a cozy day at home. Light and fluffy, erotic, with a strong body high. It's not bad if you aren't expecting it to be like an acid trip. It does give me a little nausea though.

What does this have to offer that a low dose of acid wouldnt? Is it just a better body high ?

It felt more pleasant than a similar magnitude of LSD. You know how some people complain of discomfort at low doses of psychedelics? Well MIPLA seems like it's meant for a softer dose, it feels good like that, not uncomfortable at all. I've only taken it once, at 100ug, which felt similar to 20-30ug of LSD.


It's sounding like 200ug is probably the sweet spot for MIPLA.

MIPLA is more relaxed than even a small dose of LSD. It has an unmistakable acid-like character but it really provides a different type of experience. I would say it's worth trying if you want something that's light and recreational and reminiscent of acid.

I'm happy they keep trying new ones, personally, just because I think it's fascinating to see what new variations off existing structures do.

Yeah but they should have kept the best of the old ones.


Cut lsz, 1p-lsd, 1b-lsd, 1p-eth-lad. Keep al-lad, eth-lad, ald-52, 1p-mipla (mipla is an isomer of lsd and illegal in many countries so they are switching to that), slowly add pro-lad, bu-lad, ip-lad, ....


The real magici is in R6 subs which they have abandoned due to yield and legal issues.

Yeah I agree with that, I wish they still found it worthwhile to make AL-LAD and ETH-LAD.  I also really wonder why they kept making 1p-LSD instead of ALD-52.  Is anyone making LSZ though?  I am only aware of them making it once, years ago.

No they made al-lad and lsz first years ago (I assume the same number of  blotters). First batch of al-lad was gone in a few months, but the lsz didn't really sell that well. It's not that it's bad it just that for the same price you could get many more doses of subjectively better && cheaper tryptamines, 2c-x, 25x-nbohs (remember back then 2c-e, 2c-p, 2c-c, 5-meo-mipt were still legal in most of the EU and 25x-nboh in the UK), so it was never a huge hit apart from buying some to try. And the synth was harder than al-lad. So they eventually made another al-lad batch (took almost a year because it's not that simple either). Never bothered with another batch of lsz because it just didn't make economic sense. 


Then came jan 2015 when 1p-lsd was released and instantly became a hit + unlike the previous ones it was much easier to make. They continued making al-lad, 1p-lsd and eventually added eth-lad and ald-52. Afaik the synths for ald-52 and 1p-lsd are more or less equally hard. This situation continued for a long time but the eth-lad synth was always the hardest and sometimes failed for no apparent reason. Somewhere around that time a certain busted Spanish vendor (mods I hope this is vague enough) started making ald-52 and 1p-lsd too. For that vendor 1p-lsd sold much better until I suggested they call them 1a and 1p lsd because ald-52 sounds like some weird rc to the average person and 1p-lsd like lsd something. After that the sales became basically the same.


Last year (?) that Spanish vendor got busted and the original source decided to stop making eth-lad, al-lad and ald-52. Eth-lad and al-lad due to low yields and legal issues since they had to use a lab licensed to handle illegal intermediate products and that lab didn't want to work with them before. Before being busted the Spanish vendor promised to make eth-lad once the current stock runs out, either as a prestige project in limited amounts or in normal amounts at a higher price. Not sure why they stopped with the ald-52 since their synth route only involved legal intermediaries + the yields were about the same as 1p-lsd. Maybe 1p sold better, maybe they threw a coin, who knows.


Mipla came around later since they apparently can make r2/r3 subs with ok yields and no legal issues. It was quickly discovered that mipla is an isomer of lsd and illegal in many countries + could be misidentified as lsd so they switched to 1p-mipla.


1b-lsd came from 1a and 1p lsd becoming illegal in several countries (although it could have been 1a-eth-lad instead).


The ~6 months before the UK rc ban they made and tested a bunch of other r1 subs, most meh but one very good (imagine a mix of eth-lad and ald-52 with the good sides of both and bad of neither... yeah I got to try that one... amazing I hope they release it one day), 1p-eth-lad (final fuck you to the UK gov since they banned all known lysergamides including a bunch that didn't even exist like pro-lad, but missed combinations of both a r1 and r6 sub) which was basically like eth-lad, 2cb-an (exactly like 2cb, just weaker but the synth needed 2cb so legally it never could be mass produced) and afaik mcpt or maybe 4-ho-mcpt (pretty meh).


The owner/dude in charge coauthored a bunch of scientific articles titled The return of the lysergamides (available on scihub) and afaik is now trying to patent a bunch of lysergamides to tread anxiety, depression, ptsd, .. so the time and money available for making novel ones is limited.


Hopefully once the patents go trough they'll return to making novel lysergamides or bringing back good old ones. That or that the Chinese labs figure out the synths and make them (wouldn't hold my breath, they don't even make 6-mapb despite being legal in China). That's pretty much all the history about this I know.

Yeah I know that, I just thought since you said "cut LSZ" that it meant someone was actually making it still.  In which case I would want to find it just because I've always been curious.  I actually ordered some of those original LSZ blotters, they never arrived though and by the time they said they'd reship, they were sold out.  I bought some of those initial AL-LAD blotters too, my first trip on it I took 450ug and had an amazing time.

If it is any consolation you didn't miss much by not trying lsz. It was a pretty vanilla psy with nothing special about it and it made many people nauseous above 300ug.


If you take some ald-52 or 1p-lsd you'll have much more fun. 


Eth-lad (assuming you aren't one of the people who gets a lot of nausea from it) is even better.

I've got a nice stash of AL-LAD and ETH-LAD, and ALD-52. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I don't get any bodyload from ETH-LAD, the come-up is more intense than the others but I find the lysergamides very, very smooth.

Same here, but many people get horrible body load from it.


For me 2c-e and 5-meo-trypts are the worst.

I get a heavy bodyload on the come-up from 5-MeO-MiPT but then after that it feels perfect.  2C-E definitely gives me bodyload the whole time, but it's a weird one, it feels really good and unpleasant at the same time.


For some reason when I hadn't tripped very much yet, I used to get really intense come-ups and lots of nausea and heavy bodyloads from most things (never from LSD though).  But for years now, I basically don't ever get any bodyload from anything and I can't even remember the last time I felt nauseous on a psychedelics.  I always wonder if anyone else has that experience.

Personally I plan on staying away from 5-meo-mipt (tbh all of the 5-meo-trypts I've tried were not my thing... 5-meo-dmt has an extremely weird trip, 5-meo-dalt just made me nauseous and gave me slight swirling in my peripheral vision... maybe I'd try 5-meo-met if it was a free sample) and 2c-e (2c-p is fine, no bodyload/nausea as is 2c-t-7) the bodyload just isn't worth the effects.  


Perhaps if I had some ondansetron......


I'll stick to the stuff that doesn't give me any nasty bodyload/nausea (4-ho/aco-trypts, lysergamides, 2c-c, 2c-p, 2c-t-7 (if I ever manage to get it), 25c-nboh, ......)

I really love 5-MeO-MiPT, it's worth the come-up for me, it produces a really beautiful and social state where I want to talk and I feel wonderful.  And it leaves me feeling great, no drain, and if you push the dose it gets really psychedelic too.  But yeah some people I've talked to just don't agree with the 5-MeO-Ts.


Back to MIPLA... I keep thinking about ordering like 10 blotters just so I can say I've tried it, and write a report.

A few reflections on MIPLA


Not very much to read about MIPLA, so I’ll share a few observations from my first trial. Preloaded with 500 mg phenibut 4 hours in advance. Took my 200 μg WoW tab from an indole friendly friend on good faith. No taste. I was being at home, had some lack of sleep. Could have had a very slight tolerance from a low dose of another lysergamide 6 days previously.


First signs of an altered state after 35-40 min. Some restlessness, maybe nervousness as I’ve never had MIPLA before. Looking at my phone it felt like the letters were about to start to move, but they really never did. Feet felt cold for a while. Music became very present and touch more sensitive. Somehow felt more natural than from LSD or a 2C-X. I generally felt really great, without any push, confusion or anxiety. Pupils were dilated, but just slightly. My mind mostly felt very clear and at times my state reminded me of the MDMA feeling that this is my natural, true, self. Didn’t experience any major time dilation, but was very much in the present. Sex was really great. To my surprise I fell asleep about 3 hours in. Slept for 40-50 min and awoke to a song with the title "Stay Asleep" :^) dreaming a very vivid dream. Almost felt back to baseline – but wasn’t.


But I was very hungry and eating was easy but taste wasn’t extra ordinary as it sometimes has been on some substances. Shower was very nice and music continued to touch my soul without that dulling membrane between me and the music that my ordinary state of mind seems to create. Mostly down after 5 h, lingering effects for maybe 3 h more. No nausea, slight headache towards the end.


As my life seldom has space for high dose trips, I like substances which allow me to go about my day without effects being too obvious. Like AL-LAD (75-125 μg), 2C-T-21 (7-10 mg) or 2C-B-fly (7-10 mg) - though 2C-B-fly causes obvious mydriasis. And now I can add MIPLA to that group. Maybe there are others who like tripping at low-medium doses of substances like the ones I mentioned and we can start a thread about it? Can’t find a good subject title right now though…


So even though I really liked MIPLA, I must confess it also left me wanting something more, though I can’t say exactly what. To me it felt even less ego threatening than AL-LAD. Quite recreational. Looking forward to get to know MIPLA better! Feels like an ally.

Not at all. I wrote a little add on to this and accidentally deleted it before posting twice, so it must be the universe telling me that I need to finish another experience with each. Also, I have a 100 mg 4-HO-DPT experience that's been waiting for assay, and the escalation of 4-HO-MiPT from the last time around for better and more complete comparisons. Should be done in a few months.


They are pretty novel and enjoyable in their own right I must say. Very worth it if you can get your hands on some.

LOL! Subsequent trials have been a bit disappointing, though tolerance may be a factor. I've also come to suspect that MIPLA induces more tolerance than I'd expect from it's weak effects. Anyone else noticed that? (I had expected 200 mcg MIPLA to give a tolerance similar to about 30 mcg LSD/ALD-52, but it seems to give me more tolerance than that. Tough just based on one or two experiences.)

I couldn't speak for tolerance, but I felt similarly drained the following day as compared to a full 100 mcg dose of 1P or ALD 52, which struck me as odd also considering the subjective lack of immersion, comparatively.


The day after was more of a drag than an afterglow.

I am sure how I was dosing it had a tolerance going but I almost wanted that to dampen it.


Lol it is too expensive where I got mine recently to let a tolerance build again and I am in no rush to get more.


Not saying it was bad at all.


Maybe if it was a fraction of the price and I would try an entire 200ug at once next time (I am very sensitive to such things these days).


Call me a wimp.

Had the opportunity to try this at the weekend.  Agree with pretty much everyone that it is very mild, although somewhat enjoyable, at 200ug.  Had a bit of uncomfortable bodyload throughout the peak and there was a sense of edginess at times but that might be down to one of my friends feeling a bit too self-aware.  Will definitely try alone next time.  The good sides had that it had some minor visuals with morphing and making out shapes, it had that inner-peace vibe and I found it rather introspective, yet at the same time I felt like I could go out and party with great music and chat.  Would be great for festivals during the day.  It kind of reminds me of Al-Lad in some ways, but Al-Lad being smoother and more euphoric.


After around 3-4 hours we ramped it up with the pure 5-mapb batch and now that really brought things alive, reminiscent of some of my favourite 'candy-flip' experiences but maybe a tad more lucid.  It also gave a lot of energy to the 5-mapb forcing me to dance to music.  I'd definitely have no worries doing this combo at a club night with a banging dj.  


So, overall it was worth trying but I wouldn't stock up any more and I'll be keeping the rest for future 'flips' and saving for big events.

I swear this is the most under investigated drug. I have 50 hits still, I haven't read any huge dose reports, curious about that. Most I have done is 400 mics, I think. I love it but its only a once a year drug for me.

Eipla is still available...at least in North America but I read on an RC forum on reddit that Mipla will replaced by 1p-Mipla .

Not sure of the validity of the reddit post

I suspect this chemical shines at 400-600mics but I've not had any trials with it so it's pure speculation. 

I just see many posts about how one tab is just ok...

FWIW, I took EiPLA at 100, 200 and 400 µg and the dose-reponse curve was pretty shallow ... I mean, 400 felt just a little bit stronger than 200 µg, so still pretty mild. I've  tried MiPLA only at 100 and 200 µg, and it behaved similarly, so I'm guessing maybe 400 µg would just be wasteful. I could be wrong, though, of course.


I guess this substances are just to be enjoyed for what they are; short-lived, mild psychedelic experiences. I've taken them for live music and they were rewarding in that setting. The short duration also lines up perfectly with that intention.

I recently sent some MiPLA to a lab to be tested, these were the results for an alleged 200ug tab (minus a small piece I removed for allergy testing): LSD 91µg; Iso-LSD 2.5µg


I sent an inquiry if the analysis results might have been misinterpreted with MiPLA being a relatively rare structural isomer and all, but let's see.


Anyhow, even if the analysis would have misinterpreted the compound, seems like the tabs are dosed at about 100ug, not 200ug as alleged.


I seem to have "bad" luck with my rc's, first my 4-ho-mpt being 4-ho-mipt and now my mipla being lsd. Well atleast the actual compounds aren't anything worse, so i ain't complaining!![😄](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f604.png)

Whoah, thanks for sharing! Now I'm quite curious. Based on reports, you would think that the difference between 100ug of LSD and 200ug of MiPLA would be pronounced—100ug of LSD is a solid dose for a lot of people. Reports for MiPLA all seem to describe a very mild experience

Which "lab" did you send it to?

Hopefully somewhere like Energy Control thst posts the results publicly so we can verify your ( in my opinion- an extremely serious accusation) claim...

No offence , but without verifiable objective evidence...you're just talking shit.

Yes the analyzing lab was EC, I will share the actual in depth analysis results when i get them, for now i have just their word. 

I really don't want to accuse anyone, just thought that people would like to know this. Preferably someone else would also send their MiPLA for testing so we have more data points.

Yeah, I'm curious as well. I tried these  bedore with about 4/5 of a tab (so about 80ug according to the analysis), and it seemed more mellow and shorter than LSD and certainly not as visual.


But it's a long time since i've done LSD anyways so my mind might be playing tricks.

I've taken up to 2 tabs of this and would confidently say it is not LSD, but clearly a lysergamide.

I would be really surprised. MiPLA was milder, shorter-acting, and besides having some lysergamide feel, it was completely distinguishable from LSD.

Actually, upon checking it looks like EC does NOT have a listed database with date,  location of sample sent, and what the sample was expected to be and what it was....I was sure I've seen something like that ...I guess I saw something else or I'm mistaken. 

I'm extremely skeptical that mipla is just 100ug of LSD. 

I feel if that WAS the case it would have been a much bigger hit than turned out to be.

I think one of the problems with MIPLA (as a product) is that it has the exact same molar weight and constituent atoms as LSD (same number of hydrogens, carbons etc). I wonder if EC got tripped up by that. I don't know EC's process for analysis and if this is even reasonable that they could make a mistake because of this, nor have I sat down and calculated the molar weight and counted the atoms, so I could be repeating nonsense. Maybe someone with more chemical flex can chime in.


I heard (on here probably) that one of the reasons they made 1p-MIPLA was to distinguish it more clearly from LSD to avoid this kind of confusion.


The one time I sampled MIPLA, it seemed distinct from LSD for sure; shorter, lighter, very easy. I don't discount the possibility that it was just tricks of the mind though.

^ That would make a lot of sense. If they are doing HPLC/MS , and don't have a standard for MiPLA, the two compounds would be almost impossible to distinguish. Maybe even with a standard. I'm not completely sure, but I think the only way to differentiate the two of them would be by NMR.

yeah that makes sense. maybe you could do a fragment analysis using one of the more "destructive" MS methods to get the structure right, but if they use soft ionization and some TOF method, they won't be able to discern it from LSD I believe.


NMR is probably too expensive to have set up, these facilities are very pricey, iirc from my BSc.

So just as an update...it looks like the place with the database of verified substances is ecstasydata.org  not Energy Control.

Edit: looks like Ecstasy Data is now called [https://drugsdata.org](https://drugsdata.org)

This is where we should be sending samples in for testing so the public can see the verified results.

It's also anonymous but they do list where it was sent from and what the drug was expected to be vs what the results say.

I have never had visuals from mipla, nor body load. I might try 500-600 mics next time but that probably won't be until next year. I have done a lot of LSD from mini half hit trips to massive doses, I have a hard believing it is just acid. It feels like its in the same class of drugs but that is it, it didn't feel like a low dose acid trip.

I didn't realize this one was gone. I kind of doubt it would go back into production, it's one of those ones that's a bit understated, so not necessarily very popular, and it has a higher dosage compared to other lysergamides, so more expensive to produce per dose.. I imagine it was produced at a financial loss originally, so might be unlikely that it will see the light of day again anytime soon I'd guess.


I really liked it the one time I tried it, so I hope I'm wrong!


I did notice EiPLA is around still at least, and people reported it being very similar, so you might want to grab some of that instead.

EIPLA is still available as 200 microgram blotters from a couple of vendors i believe. one i know of for sure. perhaps thats worth looking into if you like MIPLA. EIPLA is supposed to be slightly stronger too

I decided to not buy more EIPLA, it was ok, but it wasn't quite mipla. Though maybe that was all in my head. I wouldn't go as far as stating I could for sur tell them apart in a blind test, but I thought MIPLA was a bit happier.  Eipla may well shine at large doses, i may never know. I can't justify spending money on it instead of 1cp-LSD. If someone takes 800 mics and writes a glowing report I might consider further experiments but we are running of of time, it won't be around forever. I thought maybe they both were custom synths since I only ever saw them in one place.

I also found MiPLA to be "brighter" and slighly more euphoric than EiPLA. I think their similarities (besides being short acting lysergamides, which obviously already give them a lot in common), are a little bit overstated.

And here's the EC-report:

Have since asked for a more detailed report with spectra peaks etc., but no answer now for a couple of weeks.


This has now become of great interest for me to find out what the tabs actually are. If someone could recommend a (preferably cheap) place that does NMR-analysis/is equipped to analyze MiPLA, I would be grateful. 

What should be certain though, is that these tabs that were claimed as 200ug were actually 100ug, as the quantity couldn't have been misinterpreted with the methods EC used.

Interesting, thanks for posting the results.  That is shitty about the dosage, I wonder if they're consistently underdosed, or you just got unlucky?  When laying blotters there is always the potential for hot spots and corresponding "cold spots".  I'd hate to think the vendor purposely misrepresented dosage.

Let me know if you find somewhere that can reliably indentify MiPLA. I asked EC about EiPLA and they said they wouldn't be able to confidently identify it, which sucks because I've been sitting on some "EiPLA" tabs for a year and a half now. EiPLA in quotes because the guy's "2C-YN", 2C-B-FLY", and "2C-EF" were 2C-D, 2C-B & 2C-T-7, respectfully. Knowing that his "EiPLA" is probably some NBOx bullshit.

I've seen legitimate EiPLA blotters that were labeled like the other lysergamides, but the ones I received are on blotter art, which makes me less confident that it's EiPLA.

Pretty sure there is zero percent chance the Mipla or Eipla I have is LSD just based on effects. I was going to get all these acid analogues tested but the GCMS at the OTC testing center said they don't have references for these drugs they could only tell me lysergamaide or nbome they not but could not say 1p or LSD or AL-LAD. To be fair their specialty is opiods.  Anyway 1p-Mipla is out, I may get some.

I thought LSM was pukey and had unpleasant side effects? Eipla didn't have any of that. 


But OTH when the biggest vendor in that same country went under a few years back LSM was on the page until the last day, it went somewhere, I never saw LSM for sale even on the page the defunct seller said bought their supply. Someone somewhere bought it, and it was unpopular enough that reselling it as something else may have been tempting. I don't know now I have doubts, it's always been weird I only ever saw Eipla in one place.

Seems fairly unlikely, but the testing error would be weird too, since EiPLA is different enough from LSM to be able to easily tell one from another in spectroscopic analysis. LSM has an oxygen-containing morpholine, for example. 


Really weird whatever the case.

well I did a quick calculation and if I didn't fuck up, eipla seems to have the same molecular weight as lsm 775.


so if they did a gc-ms analysis with weak ionization, they might not have the means of telling the difference, and maybe they have the lsm as a standard to test against.


the same was also speculated when mipla showed as LSD on a gc ms analysis.


to clarify: with gc-ms, you ionize a molecule by kicking of a hydrogen so it becomes a charged particle. then it gets accelerated in a magnetic field. the acceleration is defined by the ratio of mass over charge, so heavy molecules accelerate less than lighter ones with the same charge. molecules are identified by the time it takes them to hit a detector. so if two particles in this setting have the same mass/charge, you can't tell them apart.


there are more complicated versions of this technique which allow for structure analysis, but I doubt that gets done in a routine drug sample screening.

This does seem to be unlikely, as LSM-775 has been reported by all accounts I've read as having an extremely intense bodyload and nausea component.  People say it is much more similar to LSA (morning glory seeds in particular) than it is to LSD.

I had a plain white 200ug MiPLA tab analyzed as well (it was wrongfully labelled as 1P-MiPLA) when I bought a few of them in 2019 and the result was: MiPLA (n.q.).


I doubt that these blotters are accurately dosed though. I had 3 experiences (100ug, 300ug, 400ug) with it so far and all of them were underwhelming. The 400ug experience was comparable to 100ug 1P-LSD imo, but less visual and shorter-lasting.

It's very possible they aren't accurately dosed, there have been some pretty blatant examples of large dose variation with some of these other lysergamides.  In fact there are a number of reports of the new AL-LAD supply having extremely strong blotters, likely from the edge of a sheet that dried unevenly.

Weird that the new AL-LAD batch has strong variations as well. I had a discussion on Reddit a while back where I asked if it would be possible, that AL-LAD lost its potency quicker than other lysergamides because my experiences with it became weaker with every single use. Some users pointed out though that the last AL-LAD batch (of 2017, I guess) was probably unevenly laid and that's the reason for the different responses. Some user apparently had a really strong experience on a third of a tab while others took two and didn't feel much. This would also explain why so many people are dissatisfied with AL-LAD nowadays and everyone seemingly loved it 4 years ago.

Your post made me nervous as i have a bunch al-lad from 2017 in storage so i tested 450 mics and and they seem fine I dont' think al-lad degrades faster.I don't think the tabs are uneven either maybe i'm minority in that opinion.

I had a 200ug tab of MiPLA. Took it on a beautiful day in the mountains. It was nice but very mild. Short acting, by around 6h I was back near baseline. This 200ug dose was not double the effect of 100ug, so it does seem to have a shallow dose curve. Always hard to compare when years have elapsed, but I'd put this 200ug dose at about 1.25-1.5x as strong as the 100ug dose.


It doesn't seem so wildly different from other lysergamides that I'd call it a must-do. If anyone has been FOMOing over this rarity, I wouldn't sweat it - it's nice to have in the collection for when you want a nice short easy ride, but I wouldn't rank it as essential.


I'm happy to have this in the quiver for dosing half-tabs at 100ug as it seems perfectly suited for that low-key dose. If I were looking for something spicier I'd reach for AL-LAD, ETH-LAD, or one of the LSD prodrugs. But nice to have a really short acting and easy going lysergamide.

I never saw many reports of LSM775 and think my report here was one of the most comprehensive out there; I took 1000ug (1mg) and yes there was some bodyload and nausea but I wouldn't call it intense let alone extremely so - had many drugs more so in fact I'd say ETH-LAD is worse at high dose for example. It wasn't excellent but well worth trying for novelty. I dunno about MGS - had HBWR once and felt pretty bad for a trip (or at least effects) that was just about perceptible and never bothered again.

I had 200mcg of mipla combined with some Kratom or dck I think at the end of last year. I really liked it, a lot like acid but with shorter duration. Would definitely try it again at this dose level.

This always sounded like nice stuff. Was always quite a bit to pricey for me and never around long, but I was definitely intrigued. I held off hoping that it would become more popular, get a larger production run, and then come down in price, but that didn't happen.

Yeah I didn't bother due to the price tag, I kinda want to grab a few hits just to be able to try it and write a report though.  Doesn't really sound worth the price though when you can just take a low dose of LSD for tremendously cheaper

Ate 500 mics of this the other day, I almost never choose Mipla for my monthly lysergamide dose, I still have decent amount stashed. Last week i was running out of time to squeeze in a trip and decided to eat 2.5 hits because it doesnt last as long or have as hard a hangover as other lysergamides. I still enjoy it, it has nice day after mood enhancements. That could have been a selling point for people who want anti depressant effects without a full trip. I'm glad I stashed some away, this time i smoked DMT at peak and it was nice combo, but some 5-meo-dmt i smoked at the tail end seemed to be somewhat muted. Almost nothing dulls 5-meo-dmt for me besides alcohol.  Usually 5-meo-dmt takes over completely when i smoke it during LSD trips, why it seemed to have less effect after Mipla is unknown. I imagine not too many people have much of this stashed away, but I will return and report on some higher dose experiments, probably not this year though. I imagine its probably safe in high doses, but being the first to try makes me a nervous. Overall it reminds me of MDMA but without the over emotional crying and shit. It feels "acidity" but I can't imagine anyone would have a bad trip /freak out on it, by far the mildest LSD analogue i have done.

Anyone here have tried 1cP-MiPLA? I'm gonna receive 5 blotters next week dosed at 200µg. From what I know it seems to be lighter than LSD in duration and intensity, people seems to say it's "very light", is this true? Cause that could be the perfect psychedelic for me.

I haven't tried 1cP-MiPLA but I did try MiPLA a couple of times. I'd expect the 1cP- variant to work pretty much the same, and yes, it's much lighter than LSD. You'll probably like it [@HofmannBlotter](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/145832/)

Thanks, can you tell me more about the bodyload and the mental headspace compared to LSD? Thank you [@perpetualdawn](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/307995/)

There's not a ton to say really [@HofmannBlotter](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/145832/), I think it's really a lot like LSD but shorter acting and milder, maybe it has the potential to be slightly smoother?


The two times I've taken MiPLA was in an outdoor hiking setting in the mountains and it was really nice for that. The first time I took only 100µg which was very easy and light, a lot like a threshold LSD dose, similar to say around 20µg of LSD, but it didn't last as long from what I remember. 


The second time I think i had 200µg and it was stronger, but again probably more like 30-40µg LSD and shorter duration. I remember feeling a bit scared when we summited - it was an easy scramble and not at all dangerous but it felt exposed.  


Because both these trips were in a similar setting and pretty light it's hard for me to compare to LSD which I've taken a lot more and in all kinds of different settings.

I always think MiPLA sounds like a latin american revolutionary party, fighting to bring justice and equality for la gente  ![:LOL:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png)

So I have tried 1cP-MiPLA (half a blotter 100µg), very good experience. Quite light but felt very safe on the body and the duration is short (around 5-6 hours max) which is good. Gonna take a full blotter in 14 days ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Gonna stock more I think, this was great! [@perpetualdawn](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/307995/)

I think this is my favorite lysergamide. If AL-LAD is the younger brother of LSD, then 1cP-MiPLA (or MiPLA) is the son of AL-LAD. 


I've tried it several times at 100µg (which is slightly about treshold), and several times at 200µg (standard dose), the effects are milder than LSD but more enjoyable in a sense as it's difficult to have a bad trip on this one, less than everything I've tried. 


Combined with 2F-DCK, it's funnier. Guess I'm gonna stock this chem. It's like LSD but for party! Mental effects of this one at standard dose is very neutral and not dark at all. 


One of my friend who never trip tried this one too and he had a wonderful time. The duration is also great, it only lasts 5-6 hours max in my experiences.


This chemical is godsent!
