[TiHKAL entry #45.](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal45.shtml)


This came as a fumarate salt and was ingested in a gelcap by two individuals at a dosage of 90mg each.  After the onset both individuals experienced a loss of interest, motivation, and emotion. At first this was mitigated by a blissful feeling in the body (not in the mind) that rapidly passed, leaving a very tired mind behind. From then on it was like being half-asleep yet wide awake. Doing anything seemed pointless. Thinking seemed pointless.  This zombie-like state mercifully dwindled after 5-6 hours, but the overall effect was felt till after a night's sleep (which was not easy to come).  The dosage of 90mg was closer to the 120mg experience in TIHKAL.


Has anyone had any experience with this compound?

No personal experience here, but I am interested in any reports of smoking or injecting. Shulgin speculates that the additional methyl added to 5-Meo-**di**MT  (which results in 5-MeO-**tri**MT) saves it from destruction by MAO. I wonder if this is only a partial save, which would account for its rather high dosage requirements. I also wonder if its toxic side effects are a result of the *volume* required by oral dosing and if injecting or smoking it wouldn't show these signs.


I would wager if it was active via smoking then it would be a very different feeling drug.


Is there any reason not to think this would be a good chemical to smoke?

the apathy you describe seems similar to how i feel on Morning Glory seeds, except i get some visuals and trippy thoughts with that. 5-meo-TMT doesnt sound very appealing to me.

I would concur on smoking it. Typically with smoking psychedelics that can be...it drops out the full body effects. Perhaps this will include the vegetive mind state.

But this sounds like a horrible drug.

What do you think would be a good smoking dosage?  Is conversion to freebase mandatory, or merely convenient?

based on the MP of DMT and 5-meo-DMT, I would say converting it to freebase would be essential to properly vaporizing it. You can do that with NaOH or even baking soda.


As far as dosage, I would start very small, perhaps 1-2mg or less. Titrate the dose up by double if no effect is felt. After an effect is felt (probably around 5-10mg), then start titratng the dose up a lot more slowly. Stop if toxic side effects increase.


I don't condone experimenting with these chemicals with new routes of administration. So proceed at your own risk.

all quiet on the 5-Meo-TMT front for some time.  Judging from the TiHKAL entry, it sounds a bit like 5-Meo-DiPT.  I just got through listening to Hearts of Space on NPR. lol, i've noticed a number of references to NPR's music programs in the qualitative sections of both the *iHKALs.  I wonder which member of the research team is the NPR fan.

What's interesting, 5-MeO-DMT is active insufflated(5-25 mg), as well as orally, but at a much higher dose(30-40+ mg). Shulgin lists significat dose(75-150 mg) for oral route of 5-MeO-TMT, and I am wondering if insufflating of 5-MeO-TMT will reduce dose, and how much?

I don't know but probably: ouch. Vaping should be the superior approach right? Unless you are rich or have a fat supply of 5-MeO-TMT for another reason I don't think that oral would really get everything out of it, looking at what is said about for instance 5-MeO-MET.


Snorting 5-MeO-DMT is indeed an okay thing but I still feel pretty negative about the burn, same or moreso with DPT. I seem to have never worked up the balls to vaporize 5-MeO-DMT and freebasing my brown DPT was a sort of a failure, what a messy stuff.

But snorting 5-MeO-DMT with ketamine was pretty much a success IME! And it eliminated a nice part of the burn.


Maybe I.M. really is not such a bad idea at all for pretty much all of the compounds mentioned in this thread. But I wouldn't know. Still looking forward to doing synthetic DMT and or liquid ketamine I.M. someday but I.M.-ing 5-MeO-DMT scares me a little for some reason.

I don't trust the 5-MeO's as much as other psychedelics... in general. Though 5-MeO-DiPT was pretty cool, especially with ketamine. It made me feel reptilian, like a giddy alien on a safari right in my home. Listen to Secede - Vega Libre ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bazQz14O0lo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bazQz14O0lo)) and you might understand why, check out the weird little 'whaah!' yells. Actually, the alien that I thought I was resembled 'crazy frog' very very much:

by the way, I hate crazy frog like the plague and I'm sorry about the off-topic part. But that was a very fun trip!

I never smoked something(except few cigarettes), so smoking is not an option for me. In addition, 5-MeO-DMT HCl should be smoked carefully to prevent pyrolysis, so I am not sure if 5-MeO-TMT fumarate is smokable.

5-MeO-DMT HCl burns, but it is pretty tolerable for me. My nostrils aren't really sensitive, so snorting most compounds are ok.

My 5-MeO-TMT supply isn't vast, so I think insufflating will be my main route. 


As for IMing, I never did this, but IMing 5-MeO-DMT is on my to-do list, as well as 5-MeO-MET and 5-MeO-TMT, but I need to learn proper filtering technic first. Should every solution be filtered?

All 5-MeO-T's I tried were really nice compounds, although different from "classical" psychedelics. They are unique in a strange way.

Did you try 4-MeO? They look pretty similar to their 5-MeO counterparts, but I am interested in them too. 


> It made me feel reptilian, like a giddy alien on a safari right in my home. Listen to Secede - Vega Libre ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bazQz14O0lo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bazQz14O0lo)) and you might understand why, check out the weird little 'whaah!' yells.

Oh yes, I know this feeling, experienced it only once, and have incomplete memory(maybe it is false memory, lol). The track is absolutely great for powerful tripping, it would made me totally synaesthetic. 


Also, you're lucky to have Ketamine! Wish I had it too... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I wonder what the other isomers are like...


5-MeO-2,N,N-TMT sounds pretty crappy really, but 5-MeO-α,N,N-TMT and 5-MeO-7,N,N-TMT both are reportedly active in animals, yet seem never to have been tried by humans. 


5-MeO-4,N,N-TMT will most likely be active also if you compare it to pyrano[3,2-e]indoles like AL-37350A. So many options not yet tested!

Yeah, I evaluated 5-MeO-2,N,N-TMT today, and I am pretty sure that other isomers may be very interesting. It so pity for me that RC vendors focus on cathinones, 2C-E and 4-AcO-DMT. 


I heared that 5-MeO-α,N,N-TMT was sold for a short while, so someone might try it. 


Okay, so here is the short review of the compound in title(5-MeO-2,N,N-TMT). My dose was 10-14 mg followed by another 15 mg after 40 minutes(so approximately 27 mg in total). Both doses were taken intranasally.

And, contrary to expectations in this thread, it turned out that this chemical have nice potential for being a psychedelic. Nevertheless, I have mixed feelings about it: the first part(~2 hours) was rather fun, and the second part(T+2:00-T+5:00) was very boring, luckily I slept for a half of it![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It is unique chemical, it felt nothing like "watered down"/"retarded" version of its parent compound - 5-MeO-DMT. The mindspace is indeed 5-MeO-DMT-alike, but reminiscent of non-methoxy tryptamines/PEAs mindspace. I don't really know how to describe it, but I would say 5-MeO-TMT has less selectivity for 5-HT1a over 5-HT2a than 5-MeO-DMT(Hopefully this doesn't sound like a complete bullshi). So, comparing to 5-MeO-DMT it felt closer to "normal" psychedelics, in terms of visuals and mental effects.

5-MeO-TMT is more sedative, than stimulating, and caused no bodyload and nausea, however some muscle tension was felt during the trip.


I would really like it, if not the crappy second part of the trip.


Also, I was taking notes during the experience, so I will publish the trip report for this compound soon.

Well, first of all I took two doses(T+0:00 - ~12 mg, T+0:40 - 15 mg), the most interesting effects were in this time frame: T+0:40 -- T+1:15, this part of trip was similar in certain aspects to my 2C-E trips (Don't get too excited, these two chems aren't very comparable). Then effects started to get boring, but it was ok until T+1:45. At this point there were almost no mental effects, physical(muscle) weakness - maybe it was just B-vitamins deficiency, which was manifested by this drug. I felt tired and uncomfortably sedated, and there was strange headache-ish feeling in my head. Also, I was a bit disappointed because I expected the drug to last longer. As you can see, nothing terrible, and absence of positive effects is what really made this part "crappy". 

As I mentioned, I went to bed, and I easily felt asleep. I slept for a hour, and then woke up feeling the same range of effects. Luckily, most of them were gone after another 30 minutes.


So... Overall, it was a nice psychedelic for the first 1.5 hours, leaving sort of hangover for the rest of trip(I was near the baseline at T+4:00, and felt totally sober at T+5:00). Oh, today I felt nice afterglow, which I enjoyed very much. 


I am definitely going to experiment with this drug more, I plan to take 30-45 mg in a single dose the next time.

It seems this compound might be making the rounds sometime very soon, at least 3 vendors have it in stock now.

Have there been any additionally bioassay trials in the few years since this thread was last bumped? 


The dose required is massively high with oral ROA, but if it's possible to vaporize it without I'll effects I might have to give it a shot in the coming months.

Do you think this is one of those compounds that needs to meet a certain dose before its fully enjoyable? I'm very interested in your other ROA methods.

Apparently it'll be more widely available soon.


However, no one here has ever tried it in the last 8 years since this thread was first posted? :O

This has actually been for sale by a european tryptamine vendor since the begining of this thread, when it hasn't been getting more attention it can only be because it sucks imo. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've tried this twice, at 20mg and 35mg rectally. It feels almost identical to 5-meo-dmt but more relaxing/boring and it has a tendency to cause headaches and vasoconstriction. Music enhancement is quite good though.

Overall I wouldn't recommend it.

Well it appears that this thread hasn't become very big or dandy at all. I'm vaguely interested in this, as it is offered by a vendor I know. I would be interested in vaping/smoking it, as others in this thread have suggested would be a good method. I was surprised not to find any actual reports of this when I scrolled down. And it has been years! Somebody must have done it. Does anybody out there have any experiences and/or insight on this?

Ok after looking a little, looks like rikki_tikki has indeed smoked this. I'll quote him here so other seekers like myself can see it. It's not exactly a rave review but seems to be a confirmation that this is, in fact smokable.

Okay, so I should have a 100 mg sample of this soon which I plan to experiment with vaping. One thing I've noticed though is that is the fumarate salt and I'm under the impression that that would not be the ideal form for vaporization, although it seems like that was the form of the batch going around before and most likely the material in the trip quoted above (you still out there rikki_tikki?). I'm wondering whether I should bother trying to convert some of it to freebase; I've read that it is extremely simple but have no experience with the conversion so I'm worried about potentially fucking up and wasting the small amount I do have. But it would be nice to convert just 50 mg (half my sample) to freebase so that I could experiment with vaping both the fumarate and the freebase (leaving plenty of time in between for tolerance). Of course, whatever happens I will post my results here.

This will supposedly be available soon. It's named (improperly?) as 4-Me-5-MeO-DMT.

I'm particularly excited about this one, just by the logic that substitutions in the 4 position usually seem to increase potency... Of course it's not always that simple though.

Also worth noting is the similarity to [4-F-5-MeO-DMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Fluoro-5-methoxy-DMT), a selective 5-HT1A agonist.

Of course being a serotonin agonist does not imply active psychedelic.  BOL148, 8-OH-DPAT, etc show that.
