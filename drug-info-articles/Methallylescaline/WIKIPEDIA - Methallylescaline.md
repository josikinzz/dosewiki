*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methallylescaline*

Methallylescaline (MAL), also known as 4-methylallyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and scaline families related to mescaline. It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It is closely structurally related to mescaline and to other scalines like escaline and allylescaline.
Methallylescaline was first described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). It was encountered as a novel designer drug by 2013.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists the dose range of methallylescaline as 40 to 65 mg and its duration as 12 to 16 hours. As such, its dose range is relatively narrow. Moreover, the drug has been reported to have an unusually steep dose–response curve, such that a small increase in dose can result in an unexpectedly large increase in effects. Methallylescaline has about 6 times the potency of mescaline, which has a much higher listed dose range of 200 to 400 mg. Its onset is within 1 hour and peak effects occur within 2 hours.
Shulgin has described methallylescaline as a "mixed bag" in terms of experience reports. Its effects have been reported to include closed-eye visuals, "visual theater", open-eye visuals including visual distortions, visual depth and movement effects, kaleidoscopic neon colors, watercolors, fantasy, mental imagery, feelings of unreality, easy childhood memory recall, self-connectedness, eroticism, initial discomfort, overload, feeling overwhelmed, shades of possible amnesia, loss of contact, extreme restlessness, trouble sleeping, and enhanced dreams. It was also reported to produce quite strong body effects, diuretic effects, and slightly reduced heart rate. Some found it unpleasant and said that they would not repeat the experience, whereas others were impressed by it, found it enjoyable, and called it "beautiful". Many expressed that the dose they tried was too strong for them and that a lower dose would be better. Methallylescaline has been described as having relatively more visual imagery than other scalines like cyclopropylmescaline and allylescaline.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Methallylescaline acts as a potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It also interacts with certain other targets, such as the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor.

## Chemistry

Methallylescaline, also known as 4-methylallyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and scaline. It is a synthetic derivative of mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) with a methallyloxy group instead of methoxy group at the 4 position.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of methallylescaline has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of methallylescaline include mescaline, escaline, allylescaline, and cyclopropylmescaline, among others.

## History

Methallylescaline was first described in the literature by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). It was first tried by Shulgin in 1981 and its hallucinogenic effects were discovered by him in 1982. The drug has an entry in PiHKAL, but not in Shulgin's 2011 book The Shulgin Index, Volume One: Psychedelic Phenethylamines and Related Compounds. It was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe by 2013. Methallylescaline's pharmacology was described by Matthias Liechti and Daniel Trachsel and colleagues in 2021.

## Society and culture

### Names

Alexander Shulgin described the name of methallylescaline (MAL) as "completely unsound". This was because there was no union of a methallyl group with escaline. Instead, methallylescaline is mescaline with a 2-propene group attached to the methyl of the methoxy group at the 4 position. However, Shulgin expressed that there is no way of naming the compound in that manner. The only corresponding proper name would be 4-methylallyldesmethylmescaline (MAD). However, Shulgin found the acronym MAD to be disagreeable and ultimately preferred MAL.

### Legal status

#### Sweden

Methallylescaline is illegal in Sweden as of 26 January 2016.

#### United States

Methallylescaline is not directly scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act. However, due to its structural similarities with mescaline, it could potentially be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act if sold for human consumption.
