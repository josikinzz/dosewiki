## Subjective Experience

4-FA became commercially available as a research chemical circa 2001. In terms of
effect it is often positioned, subjectively, as being somewhere between amphetamine
and MDMA. At the time of writing it is increasingly popular, particularly in the
Netherlands.

Despite the reference figures above, there are a substantial number of posts across
Internet forums citing significantly higher doses, many in the 100mg to 200mg
range, and some even higher. In this respect, Azarius.com states:

```
“According to different sources, a dosage between 80-140 mg is considered
common; a dose of 50-80 mg produces a mild trip”.
```

This probably reflects the broad consensus.

I elect to apply a dose limit on the session by measuring 150mg and placing the rest
out of immediate reach. Of this, I plan to take 50mg, and possibly redose with
another 50mg if the experience is positive enough to merit deeper exploration. The
other 50mg is reserved in case the threshold is not reached.

```
T+0:00 50mg is bombed orally in rizla paper. I also create two small 25mg
packets for the potential redosing, and leave the final 50mg in the scale pan.
[2:55pm]
```
```
T+0:30 Something may be happening. I am warm, content, clammy and a
little sweaty. I feel slightly uplifted and a little light headed.
```
```
T+0:45 As there has been no significant change during the last 15 minutes I
begin to contemplate the first of those redose packets. I ate a small bowl of
muesli about three hours ago, so stomach content shouldn't be having a
significant effect.
```
```
T+1:00 Although I am not immersed in stimulation or empathy, there does
appear to be an upswing in intensity. I therefore hold off the 25mg redose. I
walk around occasionally to assess the effects. I do feel quite comfortable and
fairly happy.
```
```
T+1:15 I decide to redose: 25mg is bombed. I have now dosed 75mg in total.
```
```
T+1:30 At 90 minutes the onset of the original 50mg should be largely
completed.
```
```
I am in a reasonable place, but not firing to the same degree as I was on
amphetamine or MDMA, for example. Having stated this, I sampled a far
higher dose of those two than I should have.
```
```
I will resist the final 25mg for the next 15 minutes to see where this goes.
```
```
T+1:45 The final 25mg is bombed. I am now at my planned maximum of
100mg. I will draw a line in the sand here, by taking approximately 10mg of
the remaining 50mg, and binning the rest.
```
```
T+2:15 The good news is that I don't feel any compulsive urge to redose. This
is contrary to my experience with amphetamine and methamphetamine. I feel
rather more like I did whilst under the influence of MDMA, in that there is
stimulation there, but it is not overwhelming or totally dominant.
```
```
I am now fully aware that I am solidly experiencing a drug trip. I am still
warm, with the occasional hot flush, and my mind drifts into a mild blissful
state. I am generally content. My pupils are dilated, but not fully so. There is
no gurning or jaw tension.
```

```
Is there any horn?
```
```
At this point, not particularly. I didn't experience this aspect with MDMA
either, but certainly did with amphetamine. I feel that I could chose to engage
on a take it or leave it basis, but at this particular dose I feel none of the wild
compulsive sex drive that is sometimes reported for this chemical.
```
```
T+3:00 This has now strengthened somewhat. There is slightly more horn and
more strength to the overall experience. I am guessing that the final redose is
kicking in.
```
```
T+3:45 Having become rather more intense the experience has now settled
again. I feel that it has reached a plateau, where I expect it to remain for a
while.
```
```
This is very pleasant, with a sense of positivity and contentedness (including
an empathetic edge) without taking me flying.
```
```
T+4:15 I remain on the plateau I referred to above. The question is, how long
will this last? There are some reports of very lengthy duration and difficulty
sleeping, which I hope are false.
```
```
I eat a small meal with some fruit juice. Note that I have been sipping water
throughout, to avoid any threat of dehydration.
```
```
T+6:00 The experience has wound down to a lower level. The effects are still
evident, but are of significantly lower intensity than earlier.
```
```
T+17:00 The effects continued to fade until I retired to bed at 10:37, which
was seven and a half hours after the first dose. I tossed and turned, unable to
drop off. As I was wide awake at 1:30 am, I popped 1mg of Etizolam.
Thereafter, I slept through until 7:30am.
```
```
On rising and heading for coffee, I felt a little groggy, but generally well.
```
It could be that to fly really high on this I would need to consume a significantly
higher dose, as is suggested by a variety of Internet trip reports. However, at this
dose it was nice enough, and I can see the logic of comparisons with MDMA. I
experienced quite a mild and gentle journey, with plenty of feel-good factor.

On the flip side, alarmingly, I have recently been reading reports suggesting that 4-
FA has occasionally caused cerebral hemorrhaging. In urging caution regarding this,
I would particularly stress the need for restraint with respect to dosage.

Finally, note that for a few days following this experiment I experienced a perceptible
comedown in terms of flatness. Appropriate planning and aftercare is therefore
strongly recommended (see MDMA for further information).
