## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 4-quinolinemethanols. These are organoheterocyclic compounds containing a quinoline moiety substituted at the 4-position with a methanol.

### Background

Malaria is a protozoan disease that places an enormous burden on human health in endemic areas around the world. The 2020 World Health Organization malaria report indicates a 60% decrease in the global malaria fatality rate between 2000 to 2019.
14
Despite this, malaria remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; 90% of deaths from malaria occur in Africa. Individuals at the highest risk for malaria are those in disease naïve populations, children under age 5, refugees in Central and Eastern Africa, nonimmune civilian and military travelers, pregnant women, and immigrants traveling to their place of origin.
15
Mefloquine, commonly known as Lariam, is an antimalarial drug used for the prevention and treatment of malaria caused by infection with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. The drug was initially discovered by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) during a malaria drug discovery program between 1963 until 1976. It was approved by the FDA in 1989, and was first marketed by Hoffman Laroche.
5
This drug has been the subject of widespread controversy due to concerns regarding neurotoxic effects; product information warns of potential serious neuropsychiatric effects.

### Indication

Mefloquine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate cases of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.  It is effective against chloroquine-resistant forms of Plasmodium falciparum.  Mefloquine is also indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, including chloroquine-resistant forms of Plasmodium falciparum.
13

### Pharmacodynamics

Sporozoites located in the salivary glands of mosquitoes infected with malaria parasites are introduced into the bloodstream of a human host during mosquito feeding. These sporozoites rapidly invade the liver, where they mature into liver-stage schizonts, rupturing and releasing 2,000 - 40,000 merozoites that invade red blood cells.
19
Mefloquine is an antimalarial drug acting as a blood schizonticide, preventing and treating malaria.

### Mechanism of Action

Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (Plasmodium falciparum)
Binder
80S ribosomal subunit (Plasmodium falciparum)
Binder

### Absorption

Mefloquine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; food significantly increases absorption and increases bioavailability by 40%. The bioavailability of tablets compared with the oral solution preparation of mefloquine is over 85%. Cmax is achieved in 6 to 24 hours in healthy volunteers after a single dose.
7
,
13
Average blood concentrations range between 50 to 110 ng/ml/mg/kg.
7
A weekly dose of 250 mg leads to steady-state plasma concentrations of 1000 to 2000 μg/L, after 7 to 10 weeks of administration.
13

### Metabolism

Mefloquine is heavily metabolized in the liver by the CYP3A4 enzyme.
12
,
13
Two metabolites have been identified; the main metabolite, 2,8-bis-trifluoromethyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid, which inactive against plasmodium falciparum. The second metabolite, an alcohol, is found in small quantities.

### Half-life

The terminal elimination half-life of mefloquine ranges from 0.9 - 13.8 days, according to one pharmacokinetic review.
7
In various studies of healthy adults, the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine varied between 2 and 4 weeks, with a mean half-life of approximately 21 days.
13

### Toxicity

The oral TDLO of mefloquine in humans is 11 mg/kg/2W (intermittent) and  880 mg/kg in the rat. Intraperitoneal LD50 in the rat is 130 mg/kg.
17
Symptoms of an overdose with mefloquine may manifest as a worsening of adverse effects. In the case of an overdose, symptomatic and supportive care should be provided. There is no known antidote for an overdose with mefloquine.
13
Monitor cardiac function by ECG, follow neuropsychiatric status for at least 24 hours, and provide treatment as required.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Abametapir
The serum concentration of Mefloquine can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abemaciclib
The serum concentration of Abemaciclib can be increased when it is combined with Mefloquine.
Abrocitinib
The serum concentration of Mefloquine can be increased when it is combined with Abrocitinib.
Acebutolol
The risk or severity of QTc prolongation can be decreased when Mefloquine is combined with Acebutolol.
Acenocoumarol
The serum concentration of Acenocoumarol can be increased when it is combined with Mefloquine.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with a full glass of water.
Take with food. The presence of food significantly enhances the rate and extent of absorption, leading to about a 40% increase in bioavailability.

### Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action of mefloquine is not completely understood. Some studies suggest that mefloquine specifically targets the 80S ribosome of the Plasmodium falciparum, inhibiting protein synthesis and causing subsequent schizonticidal effects.
4
There are other studies in the literature with limited in vitro data on mefloquine's mechanism of action.

### Volume of distribution

The apparent volume of distribution is in healthy adults is about 20 L/kg with wide tissue distribution.
13
Various estimates of the total apparent volume of distribution range from 13.3 to 40.9L/kg.
7
Mefloquine can accumulate in erythrocytes that have been infected with malaria parasites.
13

### Protein binding

The binding of mefloquine to plasma proteins is over 98%.
7
,
13

### Route of elimination

Mefloquine is believed to be excreted in the bile and feces. In healthy volunteers who have achieved steady-state concentrations of mefloquine, the unchanged drug was excreted at 9% of the ingested dose, and excretion of its carboxylic metabolite under was measured at 4% of the ingested dose. Concentrations of other metabolites could not be determined.
9
,
13

### Clearance

The systemic clearance of mefloquine ranges from 0.022 to 0.073 L/h/kg, with an increased clearance during pregnancy.
7
Prescribing information mentions a clearance rate of 30 mL/min.

### General Function

Translocates drugs and phospholipids across the membrane (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:8898203, PubMed:9038218, PubMed:35507548). Catalyzes the flop of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane. Participates mainly to the flop of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, beta-D-glucosylceramides and sphingomyelins (PubMed:8898203). Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:9038218)

### Specific Function

ABC-type xenobiotic transporter activity

### Gene Name

ABCB1

### Uniprot ID

P08183

### Uniprot Name

ATP-dependent translocase ABCB1

### Molecular Weight

141477.255 Da
