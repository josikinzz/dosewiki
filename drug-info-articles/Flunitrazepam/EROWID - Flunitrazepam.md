Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol)
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
Flunitrazepam is marketed as "Rohypnol" by Hoffman - La Roche in Latin America and Europe. It is sold as a treatment for insomnia as well as pre-anaesthetic medication. One of its primary actions is to cause anterograde amnesia, as well as general feelings of intoxication. It is used by some in the rave scene as a recreational psychoactive. While it is perhaps best known as a 'date rape drug' due to its use by a small number of people to facilitate date rape, this use is relatively rare.

Dose #
 
Flunitrazepam is available in .5, 1 and 2 mg tablets (although the 2 mg tablets were phased out between 1996-1999).
 
Price #
 
Rohypnol is available on the black market for as little as $4-5 per tablet and as high as $15 per tablet.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/flunitrazepam_law.shtml) #
 
Flunitrazepam is Schedule IV in the United States, but more importantly it is not approved by the FDA for human consumption so it is not available by prescription and is not legal to possess. Reportedly U.S. customs seizes even small quantities coming across the borders, even by those with valid prescriptions from other countries.
