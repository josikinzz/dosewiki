**3,5-Dimethoxy-4-propoxyamphetamine** (also known as **3C-P** or **3C-Proscaline** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) class. Although its name suggests it may be related to the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family, this is not the case since it is the 3-Carbon analog of [proscaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Proscaline) .

The original synthesis date of 3C-P is unknown. Its theoretical synthesis is briefly mentioned in [Alexander Shulgin's](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) , in which it is speculated to have psychedelic properties and a presumed dosage range of 20 to 40 milligrams. It is typically sold on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 3C-P, and it has only a brief history of human usage. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

3C-P or 3,5-Dimethoxy-4-propoxyamphetamine, is a molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Amphetamines are substituted phenethylamines containing a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and a methyl group bound to the alpha carbon R α . 3C-P contains methoxy functional groups OCH 3 attached to carbons R 3 and R 5 and a propoxy chain OCH 2 CH 2 CH 3 attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring.

3C-P is the amphetamine analog of [proscaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Proscaline) .

## Pharmacology

Although its name suggests it may be related to the 2C-x family, this is not the case. 3C-P is actually the 3-Carbon analog of [proscaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Proscaline) , thus the name.

Its pharmacology can provide strong interaction with 5-HT2A receptors, which could potentially help to prevent cluster headaches or give the compound the possibility to ease the psychological suffering associated with end-stage cancer.

3C-P's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

According to the structure-activity-relationship between mescaline analogues, 3C-P has been identified as being more potent than [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and [TMA-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TMA-2) . It has similar potency in animal studies to 3C-E, and the authors of one study on potency of mescaline analogues in rats predict that it may have similar effects and dosage to 3C-E.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 3C-P is usually considered to be moderately to extremely stimulating. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) are sedating and relaxed.

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry encountered on 3C-P can be described as similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) .
 
The geometry can be comprehensively described as synthetic in style, algorithmic in appearance, intricate in complexity, structured in organization, fast in speed, smooth in motion, small in appearance, multicolored in scheme, glossy in color, and sharp and angular in its corners.
 
- **[Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Level_8A_vs._level_8B)** - While the geometry produced by 3C-P has yet to be fully characterized, the geometry gives off certain attributes which are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) at higher doses.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
3C-P and other [substituted amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) produce a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) family. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[Alterations in perspective](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alterations_in_perspective)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 3C-P are described as primarily stimulating than psychedelic and more confusing than [3C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3C-E) , especially at higher dosages. The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes: 
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**

- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems only to be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3C-P use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 3C-P is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from people within the community who have tried 3C-P suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

3C-P is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 3C-P is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3C-P presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 3C-P all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 3C-P. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

- **United Kingdom** : It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.
- **United States** : 3C-P is technically not scheduled in the United States, but could be considered an analog of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and may, therefore, be considered a Schedule I drug under the Federal Analogue Act.
- **Japan** : 3C-P is a controlled substance in Japan effective February 28th, 2018.

3C-P, also known as 4-propoxy-3,5-dimethoxyamphetamine or as α-methylproscaline (3C-proscaline), is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and 3C families related to 3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA). It is the amphetamine (3C) analogue of proscaline. The drug has been reported to have a dose range of 20 to 40 mg orally, with a typical dose estimate of 30 mg, based on informal anecdotal reports. Although 3C-P produces hallucinogenic effects, very little is known about its effects. The chemical synthesis of 3C-P has been described. 3C-P acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. 3C-P was first described in the scientific literature by Otakar Leminger by 1972. Alexander Shulgin mentioned it in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and Daniel Trachsel synthesized it in 2002 but neither reported its effects or properties. The drug has been sold online as a designer drug and was first detected in September 2013 in Finland.
