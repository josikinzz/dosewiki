## Subjective Experience

a-PHP was first synthesised in the 1960s, and became popular as a legal high
following the ban on a-PVP early in 2014. It was itself scheduled in the US in 2019.

Wikipedia introduces it as follows: “α-Pyrrolidinohexiophenone is a longer chain
homologue of α-PVP, having an extra carbon on the alkyl side chain. Regarding the
potency of alpha-PHP in the brain, chemist Michael H. Baumann of the Designer
Drug Research Unit (established by Baumann of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse stated: "alpha-PHP might be even more potent than alpha-PVP"; this
statement is based on laboratory tests of chemical reactivity.”

Given the lurid scenes shown of a-PVP (‘flakka’) victims across the news media, I
approach its stronger sister with some hesitation. Internet reports certainly confirm
that extreme care will need to be exercised. NeuePsychoaktiveSubstanzen for
instance offers the following (translated) words of caution, amongst others:

```
“Consumers who only know weaker upper like speed will be overwhelmed by
the strong craving and the psychological side effects that a-PHP triggers and
should stay away from this substance!”
“Paranoia, anxiety states & psychotic phases ("drug psychosis") possible ...
the body load of alpha-PHP is perceived by the vast majority of users
(especially in higher doses) as very unpleasant .”
“Once an overdose has been taken, users find it extremely difficult to stop
adding more and more, even if psychotic, schizophrenic symptoms have
already occurred”
```
With those words still ringing in my ears I place an absolute limit on my
experimentation by separating 50mg from my supply and placing the rest totally out
of reach.

After careful consideration I elect to initially dose in the middle of the
common/normal range as specified by the harm reduction portals, rather than
targeting the stronger band which I often edge towards. I prepare 20mg in lines of
2mg, 6mg, 6mg and 6mg. The idea here is to use the 2mg initially as a toe in the
water, and then proceed with the larger lines, with the final line being optional. Use
of the remaining 30mg will be dependent upon how the afternoon develops.

I clear my desk, take a deep breath, and prepare to launch.

```
T+0:00 I hoover the 2mg line with my right nostril. [12:30pm]. I will give it 5
minutes before taking any of the rest.
```
```
T+0.10 I feel warmer, a mild heady stimulation is underway. I snort the first
6mg line.
```
```
T+0.45 A heady glazy feel is now in place, not overly strong, but a bit
whimsical in nature. I was really tired this morning and I can still feel that in
the background, but I am warm and fairly contented. Horn is also in play but
not overwhelming at this point.
```
```
T+1.00 There has been no significant change. I feel I can go heavier without
being pulled out of control, so I snort the second 6mg line, bringing the total
to 14mg.
```
```
T+1.40 I am in a pleasant zone. A weary edge to proceedings remains, but
there is definite horn and the general stim-like headiness. I snort the last 6mg
line with my left nostril.
```

```
T+3:00 I seem to be on a plateau, which is charged and positive, although I
feel I can go higher and of course I have a strong desire for the ride to
continue.
```
```
I prepare the last 30mg of my reduced stash and for better or worse over the
next hour I snort my way through it. My higher brain knows I shouldn’t be
doing this, but is aware that I do have a ceiling after this supply has gone.
```
```
T+4.00 I am very high but this has a slightly different character to
amphetamine and methamphetamine. This is very much in the same ballpark,
but the head space has a more rounded edge to it, in that there is a persistent
dreamy-like background.
```
```
The sexual payload is also compelling and constant, and meal time comes and
goes with no appetite or interest in food.
```
```
T+5.00 I remain highly stimmed and in a place from which I don’t want to
leave in a hurry.
```
```
Having sensibly limited my supply I decide to depart my usual single-drug
path and smoke some weed. The idea here is two fold. Firstly, to prolong and
perhaps intensify the ride, and secondly, to hopefully enable a gentler
comedown and a better night’s sleep.
```
```
T+7.00 The last couple hours have passed in a state of almost zombified bliss,
with the cannabis having rounded the edges of the experience and taken it
into a more internal dimension, less tuned to the physical world. I am tiring at
this point, but now able to eat a healthy meal.
```
```
T+9:30 Although I feel that I am on the way down I am still extremely high,
with most features still in situ. It is now 10pm, my usual bedtime, so I decide
to retire in the interests of tomorrow.
```
I lay in bed for perhaps 30 minutes before taking 0.5mg of etizolam to help me on my
way. This was a success, and I had a passable night’s sleep. I woke at my usual time
in the morning, feeling somewhat dazed, but generally functional.

I take my usual recovery steps (food, fruit juice, walking, a couple of supplements
and vitamins) to hopefully mitigate the anticipated downer of the next few days.

This was, as expected, very moreish, and without the fear factor engendered courtesy
of research, I may well have careered into a more damaging binge. There’s no point
in denying that it was a hugely enjoyable ride, and the temptations which lead some
people into serious trouble were clearly evident. My precautions certainly helped, not
least with respect to the aftermath.

If you intend to use this drug, despite its risks, it is vital that you do not skip any of
the safety measures.
