### INTENSITY

10 - Infinity

### MATERIAL

Ketamine is a general anesthetic manufactured
by Parke Davis and marketed as Ketalar. It is also distributed by several
smaller pharmaceutical companies. The Parke Davis Ketamine comes in a multi-use
sealed vial, generally containing 500 mg. Ketamine is also used as veterinarian
anesthetic, and occasionally it is sold in powder form on the underground
market.
### HISTORY

Ketamine is used clinically as a general
anesthetic. It is considered a "gentle" anesthetic and is often given to
children and elderly people. Its psychedelic characteristics were discovered
after a large number of recipients reported "reemergence" experiences while
coming out of the anesthesia. Further experiments showed that a dose much
smaller than the anesthetic dose produces a psychedelic experience of incredible
intensity.
### DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION

A 100 mg. dose of Ketamine taken intramuscularly
will produce an intense psychedelic experience. The exact dose required
will vary with body weight and mental state. Ketamine can also be administered
by snorting. One must pour the liquid out on a glass tray and set in an
oven at 200 degrees F until the liquid has evaporated. The remaining powder
can then be scraped off and snorted.
Many people are understandably afraid
of needles, but Ketamine is much safer than " street drugs. " Ketamine
comes in a sealed pharmaceutical vial and does not contain the impurities
often found in "street drugs." Ketamine is routinely administered at a
much higher dosage as a clinical anesthetic, and is considered a safe and
gentle anesthetic, therefore there is little risk of an overdose. Ketamine
is normally taken intramuscularly rather than intravenously. The psychedelic
self-experimenter John Lilly injected Ketamine in himself 24 times a day
for several consecutive months without significant difficulties (see John
Lilly's - The Scientist). By all means anyone injecting any substance
should use only a new, sealed hypodermic syringe and never share with even
a close friend. The risk of contracting a disease like AIDS is by far the
greatest risk in using a needle. I feel that the Ketamine experience was
worth overcoming my fear of needles, although many who have wanted to try
Ketamine but can't overcome this fear have snorted it for a less intense
experience.
### THE HIGH

Ketamine is the most intense, bizarre,
and enjoyable psychedelic I've tried, and this perception is common among
the people I know who've used it. The Ketamine high comes on about two
minutes after injecting. One should be lying down or reclining at this
time, because on a regular psychedelic dose they will be unconscious of
their body shortly after this.
Ketamine can be taken in various dosages.
A smaller dose will allow one to maintain some sense of identity, memory,
and ability to perceive and interact with their physical surroundings.
I find that a 10 to 20 mg. dose puts me in a non-psychedelic, disassociative
altered state. 50 mg. does little for me psychedelically, putting me in
some semi-conscious halfway zone. 75 to 125 mg. will produce the highly
desirable Ketamine trip. For the effects of very large doses see the writings
of John Lilly. I tend towards unconsciousness with too large a dose. The
experience I will describe here is for the average psychedelic dose of
approximately 100 mg. taken intramuscularly. I've heard reports of people
who snort small amounts of Ketamine while at dance clubs. However, the
experience produced by this is not even remotely similar to what I've described
below.
As the high is coming on there is a
break in the continuity of consciousness. Soon after this point I find
myself in a swirling psychedelic universe. There is no concept that I am
currently high on a drug that I'm going to come down from. Frequently there
is no recollection of ever having been myself, been born, had a personality
or body, or even known of planet earth. The experience is one of being
in total orgasm with the universe. I feel like I'm in hyperspace, simultaneously
connected to all things. Billions of images and perceptions are simultaneously
flowing through my circuits. I am not bound into three dimensions. In the
fourth dimension of time I am not locked into the current moment. I experience
backwards and forwards in time as well, with the current moment being the
center of intensity. On my first Ketamine experience there was a non-verbal
feeling that my entire life up to that point had been preparation, particularly
my other psychedelic experiences, and taking Ketamine was like pressing
the GO button. It felt as though there had been a major and permanent shift
in the "fabric of reality," or the mode in which I perceived the universe.
It felt as though the states of mind I had broken through to in previous
psychedelic peaks had become the base reality. And this new reality felt
better than I'd ever anticipated it could be. My past psychedelic experiences
taught me how to release and flow within this type of world. On a Ketamine
experience I do not need to "do" anything. Once administered, the experience
simply happens. Sometimes I feel like a single atom or point of consciousness
adrift in a swirling vortex of energies, like a single cell within a being
of galactic proportions. This feeling may shift and I then become the center
point through which all these energies pass. The experience is of titanic
proportions in the merging of energy, intent, and awareness, yet lucidly
articulated to the minutes" spiraling details. All the while I feel very
relaxed and at home in this universe. Even though any supports of reality,
identity, or stability are being dissolved at the speed of light, I do
not experience any fear, as if the one who would experience fear at losing
these things is not a part of me. As the waves of experience pass through
me I feel a bit like a kid on a rollercoaster. Although he's about to have
an exhilarating experience while going over a hill, deeper in his mind
he's confident that the rollercoaster will stay on its tracks.
Some 30 minutes to an hour into the
experience I come to an apex. At this point I have felt that my will determines
whether or not I exist, and whether or not the universe exists. And I could
toggle between existence and non-existence many times within a second.
I've even had the impression that I could cause the universe (which is
quite fluid in the moment) to crystallize in whatever format I desired
although I haven't had the impetus to actually try this.
After this comes the return to regular
consciousness, which begins with one perception out of each million seeming
like it's within my familiar perceptual structure. These "personal perceptions"
increase in frequency, one every 100,000, one every 10,000. Soon I remember
my previous identity. I've never felt this moment as disappointing, as
I frequently feel when coming down from ecstasy. When I realize I'm coming
back it feels more novel like "Wow, I'm coming back, I wonder what life
is going to be like after this experience." Although there is a feeling
that the ride's almost over this part of the experience is quite interesting,
with part of my mind still running circles around the cosmos, and another
part reintegrating with my identity. Often I experience the return portion
of the Ketamine Journey as an alien rebirth experience. Upon returning
to the body, visuals will continue for a while with eyes opened. These
can be quite spectacular and hallucinatory, and bear more resemblance to
DMT visuals than other psychedelic visuals.
45 minutes to an hour after injecting
the Ketamine I'm back though there remain some strange bodily sensations.
I tend to feel light (anti-gravity), slightly dizzy, have poor motor coordination,
and a bit nauseous if I move around. For a couple of hours after the experience
I find it best to just relax, lay in bed, listen to music, etc. until the
recovery period has passed.
One problem I find with Ketamine is
that the experience is difficult to bring back and reintegrate with routine
reality. Memory of the experience is even difficult. Within hours after
coming back, 99% of the experience is inaccessible to my current conscious
mind. The Ketamme experience is so bizarre and otherworldly that a normal
mind can't even conceive of experiencing in this manner. It feels as though
some part of the mind protectively closes off access to the dimensions
experienced on Ketamine. I've recently found a method that is proving effective
at solving this problem. This is to take Ketamine while already high on
2C-B. This seems to provide a "bridge" between the ego or identity, and
a state that is ego-less and without limitations.
I've observed a fairly mixed response
in others I know who have tried Ketamine. It seems that people either love
it, and think it's the greatest stuff in the universe, or feel uninspired
by it. From speaking with numerous people who've tried it, it's clear that
most have had experiences similar to what I've described, while others
describe much less fascinating results. After taking Ketamine some 100
times I've noticed that it's fairly easy to miss the mark, and wind up
with an experience that is nothing like what I've described above.
The main trick to hitting the mark
with a Ketamine trip is taking the correct dose. Too small an amount will
not obliterate one's self-awareness, and will fail to admit one into the
realm of pure awareness. Too much will bring one towards unconsciousness,
giving one the vaguest impressions of having traveled somewhere. Many have
had successful journeys by starting with 75 mg., and increasing the dose
by 15 mg. on each separate occasion until the desired experience is reached.
If one takes Ketamine while already high on a psychedelic, such as 2C-B
or LSD, the "dosage window" for achieving a spectacular Ketamine journey
is significantly wider.
Another important factor in the quality
of the Ketamine experience is one's "set" or personality. Dr. Igor Kungurtsev,
a Russian psychiatrist, was involved in administering an experiment treating
alcoholics with Ketamine. An article on his work was published in the Fall
1991 issue of The Albert Hofmann Foundation Bulletin. One of his findings
was "the correlation between the type of personality and the type of experience
under the influence of Ketamine. People who are very controlled and have
difficulties letting go, or who have problems with relationships, often
have negative experiences with Ketamine. For them the dissolving of the
individual self is horrible. For other patients who are more relaxed and
able to surrender, who have a deep capacity to love, the experience is
usually blissful, even ecstatic."
Kungurtsev also found that Ketamine
produced spiritual experiences, as well as long term changes in the spiritual
outlook, of most of those who tried it. "It is interesting that many people
who never thought about spirituality or the meaning of life reported having
experiences that one might read about only in spiritual texts or Eastern
teachings... For many patients it is a profound insight that they can exist
without their bodies as pure consciousness or pure spirit. Many of them
said that as a result of their experience, they understood the Christian
notion of the separation of the soul and the body, and that they now believe
some part of them will continue to exist after death. There were several
cases where people reported contact with God, but this is usually not an
anthropomorphic figure. They describe an ocean of brilliant white light,
which is filled with love, bliss, and energy."
### SAFETY FACTORS

Ketamine is extremely
different than other psychedelics when it comes to safe use. Since injection
is usually involved, the purity of one's material, and safe use of needles
is paramount. Equally important is that one not undertake any bodily activity
that could be dangerous while on Ketamine. A psychedelic dose of Ketamine
moves one towards a state of unconsciousness where a surgeon could operate
on them. The normal reaction abilities that prevent us from accidents and
death are suspended while on Ketamine. When I take Ketamine I'm always
Iying down, and do not get up until the tail end of the experience. Even
for a few hours afterwards I will not go outdoors where potentially lethal
traffic is passing by. However, for people who do not "program" themselves
to spend the Ketamine experience in a comatose state, it may be possible
to get up and walk around while quite high.
One of the safest methods of taking
Ketamine is to have a friend or "sitter" present when one takes it. Since
I frequently take Ketamine while alone, I take precautions such as extinguishing
all candles in my room. Were I to accidentally knock over a candle and
start a fire, I probably would not have the presence of mind required to
extinguish the fire or move myself to safety.
A major concern regarding safe use
of Ketamine is its very high potential for psychological addiction. A fairly
large percentage of those who try Ketamine will consume it non-stop until
their supply is exhausted. I've seen this in friends I've known for many
years who are regular psychedelic users and have never before had problems
controlling their drug consumption. And I've seen the lives of several
people who developed an addiction to Ketamine take downward turns.
After about two years of once-per-week
Ketamine use I even found that I had developed an addiction. Although it
was less severe than what I've described above, it took considerable effort
to break the cycle of repeatedly using it, even though I was aware of detrimental
effects that it was causing. Since that time I've used Ketamine only occasionally,
but find that I must continually exercise a high degree of will power to
prevent myself from falling into a pattern of regular use. Amongst those
I know who use Ketamine, I've seen very few who can use it in a balanced
manner if they have access to it.
One of the most remarkable things I
experienced in becoming aware of and breaking my Ketamine addiction was
the intervention of the tryptamine drugs, psilocybin and N,N-DMT.
The DMT provided insights into the negative effects Ketamine was having
on my life: a reduction in ambition; a reduction in healthy mortal fears,
such as the fear of death; as well as a reluctance to confront fears or
difficult tasks and situations directly. Frequent use of Ketamine can lure
one as an escape since a blissful and fantastic state of fearless, disembodied
consciousness is so easily available.
In my early expirimentation, when combining
Ketamine with psilocybin I normally had good experiences and virtually
bypassed the bodily discomfort of the recovery period. However, while I
was addicted to Ketamine I could no longer have a good mushroom trip if
I planned to take Ketamine during the experience. I remember one experience
where the visuals were complete static, and after taking the Ketamine I
returned in a lethargic, uncoordinated, low-energy state. This was a complete
contrast to my previous experiences with this combination. During these
times DMT proved to be a strong ally, teaching me to be a dragon, and offering
encouraging glimpses of what my experiences could be like if I defeated
the addiction.
Another factor to be aware of when
using Ketamine is that much of the life energy, known as Chi or Kundalini,
departs the body during the journey, normally returning along with one's
awareness. While I've often experienced a wakening of this Chi energy as
it reenters my body, with less care and indiscriminate use I've returned
to find my body drained of this force. It is not uncommon to feel slightly
drained of energy or lackadaisical after a K trip.
### COMBINATIONS

Ketamine can be combined with most
other psychedelics. However, after much experimentation I've decided against
using it with any natural psychedelics. While I did have some positive
experiences with such combinations early on, eventually I began seeing
many negative effects, and felt that it was inappropriate, or at least
that I was not ready, to combine substances of these types.
It seems as though the "entities" of
the natural psychedelic realms are adverse to having their realms polluted
by people combining them with K. I also feel these entities frown on excessive
or indiscriminate use of Ketamine by itself.
The reversal in my experience of combining
Ketamine with psilocybin was one factor that has led to my current position.
But the most intense message came when I tried combining Ketamine with
mescaline. When one takes a natural psychedelic like mescaline, they often
come into contact with with age-old entities of that realm. With mescaline
I find that I become a branch of a living entity, often called "Mescalito,"
who has existed at least since humans first ingested psychoactive cacti.
Mescalito can be viewed as being a conglomeration of the experiences of
all mescaline users. It feels as though when taking mescaline I become
an "eye" of Mescalito, and that he experiences through me. Mescalito has
experienced much during his 3000+ year life time. However, my introducing
him to a powerful synthetic anesthetic/psychedelic left him shocked, stunned,
and confused. It was a serious insult on my part to force this experience
on Mescalito, especially since omens were telling me I should not do it.
I've found Ketamine to combine best
with 2C-B This produces an enhanced K journey as well as reducing
the negative effects during the recovery period. Limited experimentation
with some rare synthetic phenethylamines, including 2CT7, 2CT2,
and DOB, have also produced good results. I find no enhancement
of the K journey when combining it with ecstasy, however, this does reduce
the discomfort of the recovery period. Combining K with LSD produces
an enhanced K journey, however the recovery period can be a serious drag.

Combinations chapter.
