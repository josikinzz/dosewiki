## Subjective Experience

White sage has a lengthy history of use as a ceremonial plant, with Native Americans
using it as incense to fend off evil spirits, to clear negative energy, and to create
sacred spaces. It has also been used medicinally across a number of civilisations.

I had used it a year or so earlier and vaguely recalled a light sedation but a harsh
uncomfortable smoke. I re-sampled it to document this more thoroughly for the
purposes of this book.

I broke the dry and brittle leaves into the bowl of a large bong. The smell had a mint-
like edge, but largely reminded me of the old sage & onion stuffing that used to arrive
on my plate at Christmas. It certainly had a pungent and strong odour, at least prior
to incineration.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I take the first hit, which is not as harsh as I recall. Indeed, given that
the smoke is thick and intense, it is quite mild. [8pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:01 My head has lightened already, and I do feel a relaxing effect, with a
clear anxiolytic benefit. This is minor, but certain.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I repeat with two or three reasonably large hits. Via the large bong this isn’t
too bad to toke at all. It feels almost cleansing.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Strangely, the smoking ritual itself also feels pleasing, which could have
something to do with the pre-reading I have just completed on ceremonial
use.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:05 I stop inhaling at this point, having taken maybe half a dozen hits over
the last five minutes. The light-headedness remains, and there is a vague
dreamy feel in play.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:10 I was quite anxious at the start of this experiment, having endured a
difficult day. At least for now, however, this has dissipated. The headiness is
mild but present, and I can see how some people claim that this plant holds
meditative qualities. Physically I feel quite tranquil.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:15 A relaxed mood remains, as does a little of the general ataraxy. I
continue to feel a background sedation and serenity, but expect this to slowly
drift down from here.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I have indeed moved towards base, although a balmy and mellow
ambience persists.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+14:00 For the rest of the evening I felt relatively normal, but with muted
anxiety and a calmer disposition. This is quite usual during the slow unwind
from this sort of experience. The night’s sleep was disturbed, but with some
periods of deep sleep, and a period of vivid (or at least recalled) dreaming.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This morning I feel fairly standard, although perhaps a little off-key.
\`\`\`
Whilst I found that this was not a ++ on the adapted Shulgin scale, as some members
of this class have been, it certainly invoked a clear psychoactive response. Overall, it
was quite pleasant for a one-off or rare occasion, but given that it contains thujone,
which has been reported as toxic to the brain, kidney, and liver, it is not one to make
a habit of.

Salvia apiana, the Californian white sage, bee sage, or sacred sage is an evergreen perennial shrub that is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, found mainly in the coastal sage scrub habitat of Southern California and Baja California, on the western edges of the Mojave and Sonoran deserts.

## Description

Salvia apiana is a shrub that reaches 1.3 to 1.5 metres (4.3 to 4.9 ft) tall and 1.3 metres (4.3 ft) wide. The whitish evergreen leaves are 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in) and persist throughout the year; they are opposite with crenulate margins. Leaves are thickly covered in hairs that trigger oil glands; when rubbed oils and resins are released, producing a strong aroma. The flowers are very attractive to bees, which is described by the specific epithet, apiana. Several 1 to 1.3 metres (3.3 to 4.3 ft) flower stalks, sometimes pinkish colored, grow above the foliage in the spring. Flowers are white to pale lavender.

## Distribution and habitat

Californian white sage is a common plant that requires well-drained dry soil, full sun, and little water. The plant occurs on dry slopes in coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and yellow-pine forests of Southern California to Baja California at less than 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) elevation.

## Ecology

Flowers attract varied pollinators including bumblebees, carpenter bees, Bombyliidae, and hummingbirds. However most of these species are ineffective pollinators, with only three species of carpenter bee and one species of bumblebee actually leading to routine pollination.

### Pests and disease

The terpenoids and essential oils found in white sage likely deter herbivory.

## Uses

Salvia apiana is widely used by Native American peoples on the Pacific coast of the United States. The seed is a traditional flavouring in pinole, a staple food made from maize. The Cahuilla people have traditionally harvested large quantities of the seed, then mixed it with wheat flour and sugar to make gruel and biscuits. The leaves and stems are a traditional food among the Chumash people and neighboring communities.
For healing use, several tribes have traditionally used the seed for removing foreign objects from the eye, similar to the way that Clary sage seeds have been used in Europe. A tea from the roots is traditional among the Cahuilla women for healing and strength after childbirth.
Different parts of the plant are also used in ritual purification by several Native American cultures. 
White sage is overharvested to sell commercially for smudging, incense sticks and cones.

## Conservation

Over-harvest of wild Californian white sage populations is a concern held by many Native American groups and conservationists. Over-harvesting is negatively affecting the wild population and distribution of white sage. It is believed that illegal harvest is occurring on public lands and non-permitted harvesting is also taking place on private land. In June 2018, four people were arrested for the illegal harvest of 400 pounds of white sage in North Etiwanda Preserve of Rancho Cucamonga, California. Due to the potential for overharvesting and the plant's sacredness to certain Indigenous tribes, many Native Americans have asked non-Natives to refrain from the usage of white sage.
It is frequently suggested that white sage is protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which is a common misconception. Collecting plants without permission from a landowner or land manager is illegal. Although Californian white sage is not listed on the Endangered Species List, conservationists are still concerned about the future survival and distribution of the species. The destruction of white sage has become a focus of the Tongva Taraxat Paxaavxa Conservancy.

## Cultivation

Salvia apiana prefers a sunny location, well draining soil, and good air circulation. It easily hybridizes with other Salvia species, particularly Salvia leucophylla and Salvia clevelandii.
