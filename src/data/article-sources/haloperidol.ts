## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group.

### Background

Haloperidol is a high potency first-generation (typical) antipsychotic and one of the most frequently used antipsychotic medications used worldwide.
7
While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain,
10
it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.
16
It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.
9
Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as
Chlorpromazine
,
Zuclopenthixol
,
Fluphenazine
, and
Methotrimeprazine
, haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).
6
,
7
,
8
These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.
Interestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic
CYP2D6
activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.
3
First-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as
Risperidone
,
Olanzapine
,
Clozapine
,
Quetiapine
,
Aripiprazole
, and
Ziprasidone
. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.
8
The efficacy of haloperidol was first established in controlled trials in the 1960s.

### Indication

Haloperidol is indicated for a number of conditions including for the treatment of schizophrenia, for the manifestations of psychotic disorders, for the control of tics and vocal utterances of Tourette’s Disorder in children and adults, for treatment of severe behavior problems in children of combative, explosive hyperexcitability (which cannot be accounted for by immediate provocation). Haloperidol is also indicated in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics.
16

### Pharmacodynamics

Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as
Chlorpromazine
,
Zuclopenthixol
,
Fluphenazine
, and
Methotrimeprazine
, haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).

Low‐potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.
The balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol. Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia.
A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.
16
Cases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).
16
A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

### Absorption

Haloperidol is a highly lipophilic compound and is extensively metabolized in humans, which may cause a large interindividual variability in its pharmacokinetics.
3
Studies have found a wide variance in pharmacokinetic values for orally administered haloperidol with 1.7-6.1 hours reported for time to peak plasma concentration (tmax), 14.5-36.7 hours reported for half-life (t1⁄2), and 43.73 μg/L•h [range 14.89-120.96 μg/L•h] reported for AUC.
3
Haloperidol is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when ingested orally,  however, the first-pass hepatic metabolism decreases its oral bioavailability to 40 - 75%.
After intramuscular administration, the time to peak plasma concentration (tmax) is 20 minutes in healthy individuals or 33.8 minutes in patients with schizophrenia, with a mean half-life of 20.7 hours.
3
Bioavailability following intramuscular administration is higher than that for oral administration.
Administration of haloperidol decanoate (the depot form of haloperidol for long-term treatment) in sesame oil results in slow release of the drug for long-term effects. The plasma concentrations of haloperidol gradually rise, reaching its peak concentration at about 6 days after the injection, with an apparent half-life of about 21 days. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved after the third or fourth dose.
16

### Metabolism

Haloperidol is extensively metabolised in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in urine.
3
In humans, haloperidol is biotransformed to various metabolites, including p-fluorobenzoylpropionic acid, 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine, reduced haloperidol, pyridinium metabolites, and haloperidol glucuronide. In psychiatric patients treated regularly with haloperidol, the concentration of haloperidol glucuronide in plasma is the highest among the metabolites, followed, in rank order, by unchanged haloperidol, reduced haloperidol and reduced haloperidol glucuronide.
The drug is thought to be metabolized primarily by oxidative N-dealkylation of the piperidine nitrogen to form fluorophenylcarbonic acids and piperidine metabolites (which appear to be inactive), and by reduction of the butyrophenone carbonyl to the carbinol, forming
hydroxyhaloperidol
.
The enzymes involved in the biotransformation of haloperidol include cytochrome P450 (CYP) including CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, carbonyl reductase and uridine di-phosphoglucose glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. The greatest proportion of the intrinsic hepatic clearance of haloperidol is performed by glucuronidation and followed by the reduction of haloperidol to reduced haloperidol and by CYP-mediated oxidation.
In studies of cytochrome-mediated disposition in vitro, CYP3A4 appears to be the major isoform of the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of haloperidol in humans. The intrinsic clearance of the back-oxidation of reduced haloperidol to the parent compound, oxidative N-dealkylation and pyridinium formation are of the same order of magnitude. This suggests that the same enzyme system is responsible for the above three metabolic reactions.
In vivo human studies on haloperidol metabolism have shown that the glucuronidation of haloperidol accounts for 50 to 60% of haloperidol biotransformation and that approximately 23% of the biotransformation was accounted for by the reduction pathway. The remaining 20 to 30% ofthe biotransformation of haloperidol would be via N-dealkylation and pyridinium formation.

### Mechanism of action

While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.
9
Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.
9
While the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.
4
It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and α1-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of α-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.
13
Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities.
Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.
4
A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.
Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as
Risperidone
. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs.  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,
4
and therefore should only been used when necessary.

### Volume of distribution

The apparent volume of distribution was found to range from 9.5-21.7 L/kg.
3
This high volume of distribution is in accordance with its lipophilicity, which also suggests free movement through various tissues including the blood-brain barrier.

### Protein binding

Studies have found that free fraction of haloperidol in human plasma is 7.5-11.6%. This was found to be comparable among healthy adults, young adults, elderly patients with schizophrenia, and even in patients with liver cirrhosis.
3

### Route of elimination

In radiolabeling studies, approximately 30% of the radioactivity is excreted in the urine following a single oral administration of 14C-labelled haloperidol, while 18% is excreted in the urine as haloperidol glucuronide, demonstrating that haloperidol glucuronide is a major metabolite in the urine as well as in plasma in humans.
3

### Clearance

Following intravenous administration, the plasma or serum clearance (CL) was found to be 0.39-0.708 L/h/kg (6.5 to 11.8 ml/min/kg). Following oral administration, clearance was found to be 141.65 L/h (range 41.34 to 335.80 L/h).
3
Haloperidol clearance after extravascular administration ranges from 0.9-1.5 l/h/kg, however this rate is reduced in poor metabolizers of C
YP2D6
enzyme. Reduced CYP2D6 enzyme activity may result in increased concentrations of haloperidol. The inter-subject variability (coefficient of variation, %) in haloperidol clearance was estimated to be 44% in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with schizophrenia
14
.
Genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 has been demonstrated to be an important source of inter-patient variability in the pharmacokinetics of haloperidol and may affect therapeutic response and incidence of adverse effects.

**Haloperidol** (trade name **Haldol** ) is an [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) drug used to treat a variety of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , bipolar disorder, [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , Tourette syndrome, as well as other disorders. It was first synthesized in 1958 by Paul Janssen from [meperidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Meperidine) . Haloperidol is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. It is also one of the most frequently prescribed typical antipsychotics and is sometimes carried by medical services as an emergency sedative.

## History and culture

According to Francisco López-Munoz, the "discovery of haloperidol at the end of the 1950s constitutes one of the greatest advances of 20th century psychiatry." This [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) drug has their origin in the research process of central [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analgesic) molecules derived from [pethidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pethidine) and [methadone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methadone) , carried out by the Belgian company Janssen Phamaceutica. After the synthesis of [phenoperidine](/w/index.php?title=Phenoperidine&action=edit&redlink=1) , numerous analogues of this compound were studied, and chemists at Janssen took the decision to substitute the propiophenone group for a butyrophenone group. One of these compounds went the R-1625, a stronger agent with specifically neuroleptic properties but lacking [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) -like activity.

Haloperidal was synthesized on the 11th February 1958 and received the generic name of haloperidol because of the two halogenated substitutes incorporated into the molecule. Clinical development of haloperidol was conducted, primarily, by psychiatric research team at the University of Liège that confirmed its efficacy in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders such as acute and chronic paranoid [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , mania, or chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Under the brand name Haldol((R)), haloperidol was licensed and marketed in Belgium in October 1959.

Haloperidol is claimed to have contributed substantially to the development of biological psychiatry and currently neuroscience, because it made possible the development of new experimental models for predicting the effects of antipsychotics, and allowed the postulate of the firsts biological hypotheses about the schizophrenia etiology. It is included in the World Health Organisation's List of Essential Medicines.

## Chemistry

Haloperidol is a molecule of the [butyrophenone](/w/index.php?title=Butyrophenone&action=edit&redlink=1) class.

## Pharmacology

As a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol has a diverse pharmacological profile. Primarily, haloperidol acts on [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) D 2 [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) as an [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) , as well as a D 3 inverse [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) . Haloperidol is also an antagonist of the [5-HT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) 2A receptor, although this effect is not as powerful as that of [quetiapine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Quetiapine) . Unlike many antipsychotcs, haloperidol has negligible affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors as well as the histamine receptors, which results in less sedation, weight gain and hypotension.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

Haloperidol can have serious side effects at higher dosages, such as risk of having severe extrapyramidal symptoms and muscle rigidity, which can last for hours.

Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia. Rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed to the typicals at 5.5%. Switching to these atypicals is an option to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

Haloperidol, sold under the brand name Haldol among others, is a typical antipsychotic medication. Haloperidol is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, tics in Tourette syndrome, mania in bipolar disorder, delirium, agitation, acute psychosis, and hallucinations from alcohol withdrawal. It may be used by mouth or injection into a muscle or a vein. Haloperidol typically works within 30 to 60 minutes. A long-acting formulation may be used as an injection every four weeks for people with schizophrenia or related illnesses, who either forget or refuse to take the medication by mouth.
Haloperidol may result in movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia, both of which may be permanent. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and QT interval prolongation may occur, the latter particularly with IV administration. In older people with psychosis due to dementia it results in an increased risk of death. When taken during pregnancy it may result in problems in the infant. It should not be used by people with Parkinson's disease.
Haloperidol was discovered in 1958 by the team of Paul Janssen, prepared as part of a structure-activity relationship investigation into analogs of pethidine (meperidine). It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is the most commonly used typical antipsychotic. In 2020, it was the 303rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

Haloperidol is used in the control of the symptoms of:

Acute psychosis, such as drug-induced psychosis caused by ketamine, and phencyclidine, and psychosis associated with high fever or metabolic disease. Some evidence has found haloperidol to worsen psychosis due to psilocybin.
Adjunctive treatment of alcohol and opioid withdrawal
Agitation and confusion associated with cerebral sclerosis
Alcohol-induced psychosis
Hallucinations in alcohol withdrawal
Hyperactive delirium (to control the agitation component of delirium)
Hyperactivity, aggression
Otherwise uncontrollable, severe behavioral disorders in children and adolescents
Schizophrenia
Therapeutic trial in personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder
Treatment of intractable hiccups
Treatment of neurological disorders, including tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome, and chorea
Treatment of severe nausea and emesis in postoperative and palliative care, especially for palliating adverse effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in oncology. Also used as a first line antiemetic for acute cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.
As chemical restraint in acute care psychiatry, mainly for violent and self-harming patients (controversial use but very commonly found in movies).
Haloperidol was considered indispensable for treating psychiatric emergency situations. However, the newer atypical drugs have gained a greater role in a number of situations, as outlined in a series of consensus reviews published between 2001 and 2005.
In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in schizophrenia, haloperidol demonstrated standard effectiveness. It was 13–16% more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine, approximately as effective as quetiapine and aripiprazole, and 10% less effective than paliperidone. A 2013 systematic review compared haloperidol to placebo in schizophrenia:

In contrast to certain other antipsychotics like risperidone, haloperidol is ineffective as a hallucinogen antidote or "trip killer" in blocking the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

### Pregnancy and lactation

Data from animal experiments indicate haloperidol is not teratogenic, but is embryotoxic in high doses.  In humans, no controlled studies exist.  Reports in pregnant women revealed possible damage to the fetus, although most of the women were exposed to multiple drugs during pregnancy. In addition, reports indicate neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, such as agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder. Following accepted general principles, haloperidol should be given during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential fetal risk.
Haloperidol is excreted in breast milk. A few studies have examined the impact of haloperidol exposure on breastfed infants and in most cases, there were no adverse effects on infant growth and development.

### Other considerations

During long-term treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, the daily dose should be reduced to the lowest level needed for maintenance of remission.  Sometimes, it may be indicated to terminate haloperidol treatment gradually. In addition, during long-term use, routine monitoring including measurement of BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and lipids, is recommended due to the risk of side effects.
Other forms of therapy (psychotherapy, occupational therapy/ergotherapy, or social rehabilitation) should be instituted properly.
PET imaging studies have suggested low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over 78% associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Doses of haloperidol greater than 5 mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy. Patients responded with doses under even 2 mg in first-episode psychosis. For maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, an international consensus conference recommended a reduction dosage by about 20% every 6 months until a minimal maintenance dose is established.

Depot forms are also available; these are injected deeply intramuscularly at regular intervals. The depot forms are not suitable for initial treatment, but are suitable for patients who have demonstrated inconsistency with oral dosages.
The decanoate ester of haloperidol (haloperidol decanoate, trade names Haldol decanoate, Halomonth, Neoperidole) has a much longer duration of action, so is often used in people known to be noncompliant with oral medication. A dose is given by intramuscular injection once every two to four weeks. The IUPAC name of haloperidol decanoate is [4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl]piperidin-4-yl] decanoate.
Topical formulations of haloperidol should not be used as treatment for nausea because research does not indicate this therapy is more effective than alternatives.

## Adverse effects

Sources for the following lists of adverse effects:
As haloperidol is a high-potency typical antipsychotic, it tends to produce significant extrapyramidal side effects. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs it was the most prone of the 15 for causing extrapyramidal side effects.
With more than 6 months of use 14 percent of users gain weight. Haloperidol may be neurotoxic.
Prolonged use of the drug can lead to mental dependence.
Common (>1% incidence)

Extrapyramidal side effects including:
Akathisia (motor restlessness)
Dystonia (continuous spasms and muscle contractions)
Muscle rigidity
Parkinsonism (characteristic symptoms such as rigidity)
Hypotension
Anticholinergic side effects such as: (These adverse effects are less common than with lower-potency typical antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine.)
Blurred vision
Constipation
Dry mouth
Somnolence (which is not a particularly prominent side effect, as is supported by the results of the aforementioned meta-analysis.)
Unknown frequency

Anemia
Headache
Increased respiratory rate
Orthostatic hypotension
Prolonged QT interval
Visual disturbances
Rare (<1% incidence)

### Contraindications

Pre-existing coma, acute stroke
Severe intoxication with alcohol or other central depressant drugs
Known allergy against haloperidol or other butyrophenones or other drug ingredients
Known heart disease, when combined will tend towards cardiac arrest

### Special cautions

A multiple-year study suggested this drug and other neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs commonly given to people with Alzheimer's with mild behavioral problems often make their condition worse and its withdrawal was even beneficial for some cognitive and functional measures.
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis: analysis of 17 trials showed the risk of death in this group of patients was 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Most of the causes of death were either cardiovascular or infectious in nature. It is not clear to what extent this observation is attributed to antipsychotic drugs rather than the characteristics of the patients. The drug bears a boxed warning about this risk.
Impaired liver function, as haloperidol is metabolized and eliminated mainly by the liver
In patients with hyperthyroidism, the action of haloperidol is intensified and side effects are more likely.
IV injections: risk of hypotension or orthostatic collapse
Patients at special risk for the development of QT prolongation (hypokalemia, concomitant use of other drugs causing QT prolongation)
Patients with a history of leukopenia: a complete blood count should be monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of the drug should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in white blood cells.
Pre-existing Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies

### Interactions

Amiodarone: Q-Tc interval prolongation (potentially dangerous change in heart rhythm).
Amphetamine and methylphenidate: counteracts increased action of norepinephrine and dopamine in patients with narcolepsy or ADD/ADHD
Epinephrine:  action antagonized, paradoxical decrease in blood pressure may result
Guanethidine:  antihypertensive action antagonized
Levodopa:  decreased action of levodopa
Lithium:  rare cases of the following symptoms have been noted: encephalopathy, early and late extrapyramidal side effects, other neurologic symptoms, and coma.
Methyldopa:  increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects and other unwanted central effects
Other central depressants (alcohol, tranquilizers, narcotics):  actions and side effects of these drugs (sedation, respiratory depression) are increased. In particular, the doses of concomitantly used opioids for chronic pain can be reduced by 50%.
Other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system: inducers such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and rifampicin decrease plasma levels and inhibitors such as quinidine, buspirone, and fluoxetine increase plasma levels
Tricyclic antidepressants:  metabolism and elimination of tricyclics significantly decreased, increased toxicity noted (anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects, lowering of seizure threshold)

### Potential neurotoxicity

Several lines of evidence suggest that haloperidol exhibits neurotoxicity. Some studies report an association between antipsychotic medications, especially first-generation agents, and a decline in gray matter volume. Haloperidol irreversibly blocks the sigma σ1 receptor.  It may exert deleterious effects on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by attenuating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transcription and expression, associated with an increase in the long non-coding RNA BDNF-AS in the DLPFC. Besides the preceding mechanisms, haloperidol metabolizes into HPP+, a monoaminergic neurotoxin related to MPTP. This might be involved in the extrapyramidal symptoms that develop with long-term haloperidol therapy.

### Discontinuation

The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.
There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

## Overdose

### Symptoms

Symptoms are usually due to side effects. Most often encountered are:

Anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, paralytic ileus, difficulties in urinating, decreased perspiration)
Coma in severe cases, accompanied by respiratory depression and massive hypotension, shock
Hypotension or hypertension
Rarely, serious ventricular arrhythmia (torsades de pointes), with or without prolonged QT-time
Sedation
Severe extrapyramidal side effects with muscle rigidity and tremors, akathisia, etc.

### Treatment

Treatment is mostly symptomatic and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions. In early detected cases of oral overdose, induction of emesis, gastric lavage, and the use of activated charcoal can be tried. In the case of a severe overdose, antidotes such as bromocriptine or ropinirole may be used to treat the extrapyramidal effects caused by haloperidol, acting as dopamine receptor agonists. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures.

### Prognosis

An overdose of haloperidol can be fatal, but in general the prognosis after overdose is good, provided the person has survived the initial phase.

## Pharmacology

Haloperidol is a typical butyrophenone-type antipsychotic that exhibits high-affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and slow receptor dissociation kinetics. It has effects similar to the phenothiazines. The drug binds preferentially to D2 and α1 receptors at low dose (ED50 = 0.13 and 0.42 mg/kg, respectively), and 5-HT2 receptors at a higher dose (ED50 = 2.6 mg/kg). Given that antagonism of D2 receptors is more beneficial on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors on the negative symptoms, this characteristic underlies haloperidol's greater effect on delusions, hallucinations and other manifestations of psychosis. Haloperidol's negligible affinity for histamine H1 receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors yields an antipsychotic with a lower incidence of sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension though having higher rates of treatment emergent extrapyramidal symptoms.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### By mouth

The bioavailability of oral haloperidol ranges from 60 to 70%. However, there is a wide variance in reported mean Tmax and T1/2 in different studies, ranging from 1.7 to 6.1 hours and 14.5 to 36.7 hours respectively.

#### Intramuscular injections

The drug is well and rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability when injected intramuscularly. The Tmax is 20 minutes in healthy individuals and 33.8 minutes in patients with schizophrenia. The mean T1/2 is 20.7 hours. The decanoate injectable formulation is for intramuscular administration only and is not intended to be used intravenously. The plasma concentrations of haloperidol decanoate reach a peak at about six days after the injection, falling thereafter, with an approximate half-life of three weeks.

#### Intravenous injections

The bioavailability is 100% in intravenous (IV) injection, and the very rapid onset of action is seen within seconds. The T1/2 is 14.1 to 26.2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution is between 9.5 and 21.7 L/kg.  The duration of action is four to six hours.

#### Therapeutic concentrations

Plasma levels of five to 15 micrograms per liter are typically seen for therapeutic response (Ulrich S, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998). The determination of plasma levels is rarely used to calculate dose adjustments but can be useful to check compliance.
The concentration of haloperidol in brain tissue is about 20-fold higher compared to blood levels. It is slowly eliminated from brain tissue,  which may explain the slow disappearance of side effects when the medication is stopped.

#### Distribution and metabolism

Haloperidol is heavily protein bound in human plasma, with a free fraction of only 7.5 to 11.6%. It is also extensively metabolized in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. The greatest proportion of the hepatic clearance is by glucuronidation, followed by reduction and CYP-mediated oxidation, primarily by CYP3A4. Haloperidol is metabolized into HPP+, a monoaminergic neurotoxin related to MPTP, by CYP3A enzymes.

## Chemistry

Haloperidol is a crystalline material with a melting temperature of 150 °C. This drug has very low solubility in water (1.4 mg/100 mL), but it is soluble in chloroform, benzene, methanol, and acetone. It is also soluble in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (3 mg/mL) with heating.

## History

Haloperidol was discovered by Paul Janssen. It was developed in 1958 at the Belgian company Janssen Pharmaceutica and submitted to the first of clinical trials in Belgium later that year.
Haloperidol was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 12 April 1967; it was later marketed in the U.S. and other countries under the brand name Haldol by McNeil Laboratories.

## Society and culture

### Cost

Haloperidol is relatively inexpensive, being up to 100 fold less expensive than newer antipsychotics.

### Names

Haloperidol is the INN, BAN, USAN, AAN approved name.
It is sold under the tradenames Aloperidin, Bioperidolo, Brotopon, Dozic, Duraperidol (Germany), Einalon S, Eukystol, Haldol (common tradename in the US and UK), Halol, Halosten, Keselan, Linton, Peluces, Serenace Norodol (Turkey) and Sigaperidol.

## Research

Haloperidol was under investigation for the treatment of depression. It was employed as a short-term low-dose dopamine receptor antagonist to upregulate dopamine receptors and produce receptor supersensitivity followed by drug withdrawal as a means of treating depression.

## Veterinary use

Haloperidol is also used on many different kinds of animals for nonselective tranquilization and diminishing behavioral arousal, in veterinary and other settings including captivity management.
