**Methylone** (also known as **M1**, **3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone**, **MDMC** and **bk-MDMA**) is an entactogen and stimulant of the phenethylamine, amphetamine and cathinone classes. It was first synthesized by chemists Peyton Jacob III and Alexander Shulgin in 1996 for potential use as an antidepressant.

This compound is often used as a substitute for MDMA due to its similar range of subjective effects. However, in spite of behavioral and pharmacological similarities between methylone and MDMA, the observed subjective effects of both drugs are not completely identical. Alexander Shulgin wrote of the former:

*“Methylone has almost the same potency of MDMA, but it does not produce the same effects. It has an almost antidepressant action, pleasant and positive, but not the unique magic of MDMA.”*

“Methylone” is also a trademarked brand name for an injectable form of methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid hormone used to treat arthritis and severe allergic reactions; hence, methylone may be confused with it.

In terms of its chemistry, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine is part of the phenethylamine, cathinone and amphetamine families. There is a methylenedioxy ring attached to carbons R3 and R4, as well as methyl chains at Rα and RN. Methylone is a close structural analog of MDMA, differing by the addition of a β-ketone group attached to the beta position of the amine chain.

In terms of its pharmacology, methylone acts as a mixed reuptake inhibitor/releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. These are the neurotransmitters in charge of pleasure, motivation and focus. This is done by inhibiting the reuptake and reabsorption of the neurotransmitters after they have performed their function of transmitting a neural impulse, essentially allowing them to accumulate and be reused, causing physically stimulating and euphoric effects.

In comparison to MDMA, it has approximately 3x lower affinity for the serotonin transporter, while its affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters is similar. Notably, methylone’s affinity for the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is about 13x lower than that of MDMA. The results of these differences in pharmacology relative to MDMA are that methylone is less potent in terms of dose, has more balanced catecholaminergic effects relative to serotonergic, and behaves more like a reuptake inhibitor like methylphenidate than a releaser like amphetamine; however, methylone still has relatively robust releasing capabilities.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of methylone can be broken down into seven components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The “body high” of methylone can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher dosages. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user’s physical energy levels, methylone is commonly considered to be extremely stimulating and energetic. This encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing in a way that makes methylone a popular choice for musical events such as festivals and raves. The particular style of stimulation which methylone presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes, and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control.
- **[Vibrating vision](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high dosages, a person’s eyeballs may even begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus– a condition known as nystagmus.
- **[Dehydration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with methylone; this effect is a product of an increased heart rate and an extreme motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated, especially when out dancing in a hot environment, there have been a number of users suffering from water intoxication through over-drinking so it is advised that users simply sip at water and never over-drink.
- **[Difficulty urinating](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Higher doses of methylone result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination. This is an effect that is completely temporary and harmless, due to methylone’s promotion of the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is responsible for regulating urination. This effect can be lessened by simply relaxing, but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow.
- **[Loss of temperature regulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Loss_of_temperature_regulation)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**

**Cognitive effects:**

The cognitive effects of methylone can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of methylone is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation, feelings of love or empathy and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical psychedelic, entactogenic and stimulant cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **[Euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within methylone and are likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release. In comparison to MDMA, it is closer in effects to that of the euphoria felt within amphetamine and mephedrone.
- **[Empathy, love and sociability enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love_and_sociability_enhancement)** - Although distinct and powerful in its effects, this particular feeling is less pronounced and therapeutic when compared to that of MDMA. It can be described as less forceful and more internal in its manifestation, resulting in feelings of love and empathy that are not necessarily felt as essential to express to others.
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are common within methylone and speed up the experience of time quite noticeably.
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - Experiences of unity, oneness and interconnectedness between levels 2 - 3 are common within methylone. This component most consistently manifests itself at high dosages within large crowds at raves and musical events in the form of “becoming one with the crowd.”
- **[Thought acceleration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Mindfulness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational methylone use does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because methylone is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried methylone suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

Tolerance develops rapidly with repeated usage, so periods of extended use require increasing doses of the drug in order to achieve the same effect. Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational use of any stimulant where compulsive redosing is common.

**Legal Issues:**

- **Netherlands**: In the Netherlands, methylone is covered under the medicine act. Because methylone is not registered officially, as such, it is forbidden to trade in methylone.
- **New Zealand**: In New Zealand, although methylone is not explicitly scheduled and falls outside the strict definitions of an “amphetamine analogue” in the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is considered to be “substantially similar” to methcathinone and is thus considered by law enforcement authorities to be a Class C illegal drug.
- **United Kingdom**: In the UK, methylone has been illegal since the 16/04/2010 revision of the misuse of drugs act.
- **Sweden**: Methylone has been listed as a schedule I narcotic in Sweden as of Oct 1 of 2010.
- **Canada**: Although not listed as a Schedule 1 substance, Health Canada reports that methylone falls under the scheduling as an analogue of amphetamine. However, Methylone bears the exact chemical difference between amphetamine and cathinone; cathinone is listed as not being an analogue of amphetamine leading to imply that methylone is unscheduled in Canada.
- **United States**: As of October 21, 2011 the DEA has issued an emergency ban on methylone. It is illegal to possess and distribute.

## Subjective Experience

Methylone was first synthesised in the mid 1990’s by Peyton Jacob III and Alexander
Shulgin. Under the name explosion and various others it was to emerge as a popular
recreational drug a decade later.

Whilst it was legally available, methylone was often mis-sold as MDMA, although it
is widely suggested to be less empathogenic and more stimulating. Certainly, it
produces a shorter experience.

It was classified in the UK in 2010 and scheduled in the US in 2011.

As Erowid cited reports of "worrying heart rate and blood pressure increases" as
well as chest pains at higher doses, I elected to go low. This decision was re-enforced
by the relative scarcity of dosage information, and in some cases, its ambiguity.

Note that I had allergy tested with approximately 5mg some weeks earlier.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 175mg of the clumpy white powder is carefully measured. 130mg is
bombed in cigarette paper with a glass of water. [16:50]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The remaining 45mg is held back for a potential redose, to be taken should
events proceed along a steady and enjoyable path.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:15 There are familiar signs that something is afoot, with my hands feeling
slightly cold and clammy.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:20 A headspace is starting to emerge. There is a general drifting feeling,
which is fairly neutral but not unpleasant.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I am now unmistakably under the influence. My head has a nice buzz
about it, and I feel slightly uplifted, albeit not enormously so. My hands are
still a little clammy but I feel increasingly content.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:40 I feel quite ramped up, and indeed high, although I am fully
functional and lucid if I need to be.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The vibe is quite pleasing and I feel a general warmth, and certainly, the mood
lift is very evident.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I do feel slight chest trembles but nothing alarming at this stage.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:50 The experience seems to have settled on to a plateau of general well
being with a dreamy stimulation in play. The word to describe it is probably
nice, given that it is not overly exhilarating or exciting.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 I can see why there are comparisons with MDMA, as it does have a
mild empathogenic feel, and it would probably come into its own in a social
situation, particularly amongst other users.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I consume the remaining 45mg, taking the total dose to the pre-determined
175mg.This is well into the common range according to the harm reduction
websites, edging towards strong.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Given the health warnings referred to earlier, this will be sufficient. I have no
intention of diverting from my original plan.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+1:20 There has been no significant change for the last half hour, and I
remain in a place of relative contentment. I still feel warm, and of a generally
positive disposition, with the semi-euphoric buzz remaining steady.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The minor chest discomfort, which I experienced earlier, has now faded.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:45 There is now slightly more intensity to the headspace, which is
presumably due to the extra 45mg kicking in.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
All other aspects remain at the same or similar levels.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
There is no compulsive horn, but no stim-dick either.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I check my pupils and they remain relatively normal. My blood pressure and
pulse are elevated at a worrying 183/94 and 69 respectively.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:15 I believe that the experience is now at a lower level of intensity than it
was earlier. I am still enjoying the serenity of the high, which is pleasant and
fairly gentle in nature.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 I am now drifting back to baseline. The headspace is dissipating
slowly but surely, and the body warmth is fading.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:15 I drink some fruit juice, have something to eat, and I am more or less
back to base.
\`\`\`
In line with expectations, this was a fairly gentle ride. Whilst the comparisons with
MDMA are hard to escape, it was much shorter acting, and as suggested in advance,
there was more stimulation and a clearer uplift.

It hinted at going further, but given the dose restraint, it remained within sensible
parameters. It was positive and pleasing throughout.

The following morning I had a slight headache, and for a couple of days I was aware
that I was still experiencing the aftermath. To some degree sleep was also
interrupted, with a not too pleasant headiness evident when I awoke. These
symptoms occurred despite the usual self-practiced aftercare, such as exercise,
vitamin pills, plenty of healthy food, and so forth.

Having stated all this, these ailments were not on the scale of a heavy MDMA come-
down, but they did linger.

Although this was a good experience, one or two worrying signs were clearly evident.
The body load and the potential risks should not be dismissed lightly.

Tread carefully if you intend to use this.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Methylone is a psychedelic phenethylamine, with effects similar to, but not identical, to those of [MDMA](https://erowid.org/../mdma/mdma_effects.shtml) . Doses for methylone are typically higher than those for MDMA. 
 
 
According to Winta, describing adding bump-doses onto the initial amount of methylone: "This is usually 50-100 mg's for my friends and myself. We do this 'trick' almost every time, the thing is that the booster hits right about the same level as the first trip but doesn't take quite as long. 
 
 Lets say we redose with 50 mg when the first effect starts to wear off, we get our trip boosted back to the same level for around another hour. I If we take 100 mg booster, it lasts about 2 hours instead. A whole full dose as a boost will take about the same time again as if I had started over." 
 
 Another report describes an idiosyncratic reaction: "As for bumping, after the first hour, oral bumps of 50 mg worked so-so and 100 mg definitely extending things by an hour, but after three 100 mg bumps, an hour apart each, the sedating effect took completely over, and resulted in a very pleasant state that was almost exactly like the feeling after smoking opium, enjoyed that for another 2-3 hours (lost track of time) until falling into a very deep and restful sleep." 
 
 A few methylone users have reported chest pains and heart palpitations during and after use, especially with repeated or high doses.

Methylone Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
Methylone (bk-MDMA, Explosion, Ease, m1) dosages are not well documented in the literature and the following dosages are based on a submission by Winta and reports gathered by Erowid. Methylone is generally available as pure crystals and rarely, if ever, pressed into tablets. As one contributor notes, "The most reasonable dosage recommendation for such a poorly documented substance would be 'none at all', but since this advice is unlikely to be taken seriously." The variability in response reported is reason for special concern and should be taken seriously by those considering ingesting methylone. 
 
 Dosages vary considerably between individuals, with some methylone users reporting that they "never" exceed 100 mg, while others report "barely reaching" threshold at 200 mg. 
 
 
- Oral Methylone Dosages Threshold60 - 120 mg Light100 - 150 mg Common100 - 250 mg Strong160 - 270 mg Heavy250 + mg | Oral Methylone Dosages | Threshold | 60 - 120 mg | Light | 100 - 150 mg | Common | 100 - 250 mg | Strong | 160 - 270 mg | Heavy | 250 + mg
**Oral Methylone Dosages**
- Threshold: 60 - 120 mg
- Light: 100 - 150 mg
- Common: 100 - 250 mg
- Strong: 160 - 270 mg
- Heavy: 250 + mg
**Onset : 15 - 60 minutes Duration : 2 - 3.5 hours Normal After Effects : 6 - 24 hours**
 
 
 
---
 
 Some respondents say that increasing dose with methylone beyond 100-180 mg causes increased physical effects and does not substantially improve the empathic cognitive effects. 
 
 Insufflated dosages appear to be slightly lower than oral dosages. 
 
 **Stimulation / Sedation** 
 Some have reported worrying heart rate and blood pressure increases at doses over 180-200 mg. While some people report stimulation, there are also reports of seemingly paradoxical sedation effects. 
 
 We have one report of a male who found it took over 250 mg of material to approach the bottom of a 'common' dose and found 300 mg to be "just right" and the same material affected others at more common doses. 
 
 
 **Boosting / Bumping** 
 Methylone is sometimes used with a larger "attack" dose (first dose) and then smaller "bumps" to maintain the effects for a longer period. These bumps are taken orally or insufflated and are often around 30 - 100 mg oral and 20-80 mg insufflated. 
 
 A third-to-half-dose re-dose usually extends the duration for another hour, a full-dose redose often extends the duration for another 1-2 hours. Some say that taking a booster dose more than 2 hours after the initial dose will not result in extending the desired effects.

**3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-methcathinone** (also known as **M1** , **MDMC** , **βk-MDMA** , and **Methylone** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) - [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) class.

Methylone was first synthesized by chemists Peyton Jacob III and [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in 1996 as a potential antidepressant.

Methylone is sometimes used as a substitute for [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) due to similarities in their effects. [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) commented that the substances has "almost the same potency of MDMA, but it does not produce the same effects." He also stated that it "has an almost antidepressant action, pleasant and positive, but not the unique magic of MDMA."

The toxicity of methylone has not been well-studied, although it likely does not exceed that of MDMA, and it has a limited history of human usage. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Methylone, or 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone, is a synthetic molecule of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) family. Cathinones are structurally similar to amphetamines, they contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . Cathinones such as methylone are alpha-methylated phenethylamines. Cathinones differ from amphetamines by the addition of a ketone functional group, a carbonyl group at R β .

Methylone contains an methyl substitution at R N , a substitution which is shared with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , and certain other stimulants. Methylone contains additional substitutions at R 3 and R 4 of the phenyl ring with oxygen groups. These oxygen groups are incorporated into a methylenedioxy ring through a methylene chain. Methylone shares this methylenedioxy ring with [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , [MDAI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDAI) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .

## Pharmacology

Methylone acts as a mixed [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) / [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . These [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) are thought to be responsible for regulating pleasure, motivation, focus, and sense of well-being. This is done by inhibiting the reuptake and reabsorption of the neurotransmitters after they have performed their function of transmitting a neural impulse, allowing them to accumulate and be reused, which results stimulating and euphoric effects.

In comparison to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , it has approximately 3x lower affinity for the serotonin transporter (Ki=242.1 nM for methylone to Ki=72 nM for [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) ) while its affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters is similar. Notably, methylone's affinity for the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is about 13x lower than that of MDMA.

The result of these differences in pharmacology relative to MDMA are that methylone is less potent in terms of dose, has more balanced [catecholaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Catecholaminergic) relative to serotonergic effects, and behaves more like a [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) such as [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) rather than a releaser like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) ; however, methylone still has relatively robust releasing capabilities.

## Etymology

"Methylone" is also a trademarked brand name for an injectable form of [methylprednisolone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone) , a corticosteroid hormone used to treat arthritis and severe allergic reactions; hence, methylone may be confused with it. Aside from context, they can be distinguished by the fact that the name will usually be capitalized when referring to the prescription drug.

A proposed alternate name is bk-MDMA, or beta-keto-MDMA. While this nomenclature has not caught on because the name "methylone" became widely used before the conflicting Methylone trademark was noticed, the analogous names for related chemicals bk-MDEA and bk-MBDB have become the established names for those substances.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, methylone is commonly considered to be extremely stimulating and energetic. This encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing in a way that makes methylone a popular choice for musical events such as festivals and raves. The particular style of stimulation which methylone presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes, and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of methylone can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with methylone; this effect is a product of an increased heart rate and an extreme motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated (especially when out dancing in a hot environment) there have been a number of users suffering from [water intoxication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Water_intoxication) through over-drinking, so it is advised that users sip at water and avoid over-drinking.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Higher doses of methylone result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination. This is an effect that is completely temporary and harmless. It is due to methylone’s promotion of the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is responsible for regulating urination. This effect can be lessened by simply relaxing, but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow.
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is reported to be less prominent in comparison to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of methylone can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of methylone is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation, feelings of love or empathy and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within methylone and are likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release. In comparison to MDMA, it is closer in effects to that of the euphoria felt within [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) .
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - Although distinct and powerful in its effects, this particular feeling is less pronounced and therapeutic when compared to that of MDMA. It can be described as less forceful and more internal in its manifestation, resulting in feelings of love and empathy that are not necessarily felt as essential to express to others.
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Time compression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are common with methylone and speed up the experience of time quite noticeably. This can promote [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) .
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Methylone](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Methylone.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational methylone use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because methylone has a very limited history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried methylone within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying it at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of methylone can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of methylone develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 1 - 3 weeks for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 3 - 6 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Methylone presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of methylone all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the stimulant class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Methylone should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , methylone , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Methylone may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , methylone and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

## Legal status

- **Austria** : Since June 26, 2019, methylone is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the SMG. (Suchtmittelgesetz Österreich)
- **Brazil** : Methylone is illegal to possess, produce and sell as it is listed on Portaria SVS/MS nº 344.
- **Canada** : Although not listed as a Schedule 1 substance, Health Canada reports that methylone falls under the scheduling as an analogue of amphetamine. However, methylone bears the exact chemical difference between amphetamine and cathinone; cathinone is listed as not being an analogue of amphetamine leading to imply that methylone is unscheduled in Canada.
- **Germany** : Methylone is controlled under Anlage II BtMG ( *Narcotics Act, Schedule II* ) as of July 26, 2012. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **The Netherlands** : Methylone is covered by the Medicine Act. Because methylone is not approved officially, it is forbidden to trade methylone.
- **New Zealand** : Although methylone is not explicitly scheduled and falls outside the strict definitions of an "amphetamine analogue" in the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is considered to be "substantially similar" to methcathinone and is thus considered by law enforcement authorities to be a Class C illegal drug. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Russia** : Methyloneis classed as a Schedule I prohibited substance.
- **Sweden** : Methylone has been listed as a Schedule I narcotic in Sweden as of October 1, 2010.
- **Switzerland** : Methylone is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis D.
- **United Kingdom** : Methylone is a Class B drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the cathinone catch-all clause.
- **United States** : As of October 21, 2011, the DEA has issued an emergency ban on methylone. It is illegal to possess and distribute.

## Effects
Compared to MDMA, methylone has a stronger stimulating and less empathogenic effect. The effect is more constant, the "hangover" less than with MDMA.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Short-term side effects are increased body temperature and heartbeat, dilated pupils and tightening of the jaw. The side effects and the (long-term) risks of methylone have hardly been researched yet.

## Safer Use
- Refrain from re-throwing: This does not intensify or prolong the flash with methylone.
- Be sure to drink enough water during the effect.
- Do not combine methylone with alcohol and other drugs, especially MAO inhibitors.
- Do not use methylone if you have heart or circulatory problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, epilepsy or mental health problems.

  "wikipedia": `# Methylone
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylone*

Methylone, also known as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone (MDMC), is an entactogen and stimulant drug of the amphetamine, cathinone, and benzodioxole families related to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; "ecstasy"). It is the β-keto or cathinone analogue of MDMA. Methylone is usually taken orally, but is also used by other routes.
The drug acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA). It has much less activity at the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) than MDMA and may have less serotonergic neurotoxicity. In contrast to certain other entactogens like MDMA, methylone does not appear to be a significant agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Methylone is similar in its effects to MDMA, producing entactogenic effects and euphoria, but has a reputation of being gentler than MDMA and only lasts about half as long. Side effects of methylone include tachycardia, hangover, and insomnia. It may have reduced negative after-effects compared to MDMA. Methylone's onset is about 0.5 hours and its duration is about 2 to 3 hours.
Methylone was first synthesized by Peyton Jacob III and Alexander Shulgin in the mid-1990s and was first described in the literature in 1996. It was patented by Jacob and Shulgin as a potential antidepressant and antiparkinsonian agent, but was never developed or marketed for such uses. Methylone was encountered as a designer and recreational drug by 2004 and has become a controlled substance in many countries. Similarly to MDMA, it is being developed for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

## Use and effects

Methylone substitutes for MDMA in drug discrimination tests in rodents. Methylone does not substitute for the stimulant amphetamine or for the hallucinogen DOM in animal drug discrimination tests. Further, also in common with MDMA, methylone acts on monoaminergic systems. In vitro, methylone has one third the potency of MDMA at inhibiting platelet serotonin accumulation and about the same in its inhibiting effects on the dopamine and noradrenaline transporters.
In spite of these behavioral and pharmacological similarities between methylone and MDMA, the observed subjective effects of both drugs are not completely identical. Alexander Shulgin wrote of the former:

"[Methylone] has almost the same potency of MDMA, but it does not produce the same effects. It has an almost antidepressant action, pleasant and positive, but not the unique magic of MDMA."
In acute pharmacological studies of methylone (50–300 mg) in humans, the drug produced physiological and psychological effects including increased blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, pupil dilation, stimulation, euphoria, feelings of well-being, enhanced empathy, increased sociability, and altered perception. The studies found that the effects of methylone were similar to or milder than those of MDMA. Methylone had a faster onset of action and its subjective effects wore off sooner than MDMA, which might lead to a redosing pattern of use. The misuse potential of methylone, as measured by for instance drug liking responses, appeared to be similar to that of MDMA. However it also has less off-target effects than MDMA which may be an advantage for medical applications.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Methylone acts as a mixed releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. In comparison to MDMA, it has approximately 3-fold lower affinity for the serotonin transporter, while its affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters is similar. Notably, methylone's affinity for the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is about 13-fold lower than that of MDMA. The results of these differences in pharmacology relative to MDMA are that methylone is less potent in terms of dose, has more balanced catecholaminergic effects relative to serotonergic effects, and behaves more like a mixed releaser and reuptake inhibitor than a predominant releaser, though methylone still has relatively robust releasing capabilities.
In addition to its monoamine-releasing actions, similarly to MDMA, methylone is a variable-potency partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT1D receptors. In contrast to MDMA however, methylone and its metabolites lack significant affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and do not activate the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor. On the other hand, a subsequent study found that methylone indeed showed no affinity for or agonistic activity at the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, but was a potent and near-full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor Gαq pathway, though not of the other assessed Gα pathways of the receptor. The absence of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism with methylone may explain its absence of psychedelic effects. The lack of serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonism with methylone may make it safer than MDMA, for instance in terms of long-term cardiac valvulopathy risk. Methylone is inactive at the mouse and rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).
Methylone has been found to produce psychoplastogenic effects in preclinical research and showed greater effects in this regard than MDMA.
Similarly to MDMA, methylone has been found to be a monoaminergic neurotoxin in animals. It has specifically been found to produce serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rodents. However, in one study, moderate doses of MDMA produced serotonergic neurotoxicity in rodents whereas methylone and mephedrone did not do so, suggesting that cathinones like methylone may be less neurotoxic than their corresponding amphetamine counterparts like MDMA.

### Pharmacokinetics

The two major metabolic pathways in mammals for methylone are N-demethylation to methylenedioxycathinone (MDC), and demethylation followed by O-methylation of the 3- or 4-hydroxy group to 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethcathinone (HMMC) or 3-hydroxy-4-methoxymethcathinone (3-OH-4-MeO-MC). Another metabolite is 3,4-dihydroxymethcathinone (HHMC). When 5 mg/kg of methylone was administered to rats, it was found that around 26% was excreted as HMMC within the first 48 hours (less than 3% excreted unchanged). The mean elimination half-lives of methylone in humans following oral administration of doses of 50 to 200 mg ranged from 5.8 to 6.9 hours. The onset of action and duration of action of methylone in humans are 0.5 hours and 2.5 to 3.0 hours, respectively.

## Chemistry

Methylone is the substituted cathinone analogue of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and the 3,4-methylenedioxy analog of methcathinone. The only structural difference of methylone with respect to MDMA is the substitution of 2 hydrogen atoms by 1 oxygen atom in the β position of the phenethylamine core, forming a ketone group.

## History

Methylone was first synthesized by Peyton Jacob III and Alexander Shulgin in the mid-1990s. This was after the publication of Shulgin's PiHKAL (1991), and so methylone is not included in this book. However, it was subsequently included in The Shulgin Index (2011). The drug was patented by Jacob and Shulgin as a potential antidepressant and antiparkinsonian agent, but was never developed or marketed. This was the first time that methylone was described in the literature. The drug was first described in the scientific literature by 1997. Methylone was encountered as a designer and recreational drug by 2004. It has become a controlled substance in many countries.

## Society and culture

### Names and etymology

"Methylone" is also a trademarked brand name for an injectable form of methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid hormone used to treat arthritis and severe allergic reactions; hence, methylone may be confused with it. Aside from context, they can be distinguished by the fact that the name will usually be capitalized when referring to the prescription drug.
A proposed alternate name is βk-MDMA, or beta-keto-MDMA. While this nomenclature has not caught on because the name "methylone" became widely used before the conflicting Methylone trademark was noticed, the analogous names for related chemicals βk-MDEA and βk-MBDB have become the established names for those substances.

### Commercial distribution

Analysis of "Explosion" has confirmed that the active ingredient is methylone. Many other formulations marketed as household chemicals, as well as the pure powder, have been sold.

### Legal status

#### Netherlands

In the Netherlands, methylone is not yet listed under the Opium Law, but is covered under the medicine act. Because methylone is not registered officially, it is forbidden to trade in methylone. The Minister of Health has asked the Coordination point Assessment and Monitoring new drugs group (CAM) to gather information about this substance, resulting possibly in an official risk assessment. Until now, no research has been conducted on the toxicity of methylone, so nothing is known about the harmfulness of this new drug.

#### New Zealand

In New Zealand, although methylone is not explicitly scheduled and falls outside the strict definitions of an "amphetamine analogue" in the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is considered to be "substantially similar" to methcathinone and is thus considered by law enforcement authorities to be a Class C illegal drug. Methylone was sold in New Zealand for around 6 months from November 2005 to April 2006 as an MDMA substitute, under the name "Ease". The product was withdrawn after legal disputes with the government.

#### United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, methylone is illegal since the 16/04/2010 revision of the misuse of drugs act. Before this it was not specifically mentioned in United Kingdom (U.K.) law as the β-ketone was not covered under the Misuse of Drugs Act. In March 2010, plans were announced to make methylone and other cathinones, Class B drugs, "within weeks". While delayed by dissatisfaction in the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the revision was rushed through by the government with little regard for the views of the council. The importation of the compound was banned immediately.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdag added methylone to schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as narcotics in Sweden as of Oct 1, 2010,  published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2010:23 listed as Metylon, 2-metylamino-1-(3,4-metylendioxifenyl)propan-1-on. Methylone was first classified by Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Nov 1, 2005,  in their regulation SFS 2005:733 listed as 3,4-metylendioximetkatinon (Metylon).

#### Canada

Although not listed as a Schedule 1 substance, Health Canada reports that methylone falls under the scheduling as an analogue of amphetamine. However, Methylone bears the exact chemical difference between amphetamine and cathinone – and cathinone is listed as not being an analogue of amphetamine, possibly implying that methylone is unscheduled in Canada. The CDSA was updated as a result of the Safe Streets Act changing amphetamines from Schedule 3 to Schedule 1; however, methylone was not added.

#### United States

In October 2011, the DEA issued an emergency ban on methylone. It was made illegal to possess and distribute. On April 4, 2013, the DEA placed methylone as a Schedule 1 substance under the CSA.

Arizona:
Effective February 16, 2012, methylenedioxymethcathinone (methylone) was classified as a dangerous drug, making it a felony to knowingly possess, use, possess for sale, manufacture, administer, transport for sale, import into the state, or offer to transport for sale or import into this state, sell, transfer or offer to sell or transfer. A.R.S. 13-3401(6)(c)(xliii), 2012 Ariz. Legis. Serv. Ch. 1 (H.B. 2356).
Florida:
In January 2011, it was reported that Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an emergency ban on MDPV, Methylone, Mephedrone, 3-methoxymethcathinone, 3-fluoromethcathinone, and 4-fluoromethcathinone as media attention on products labeled as "bath salts" grew. These chemicals are now Schedule I under Florida law.
Louisiana:
In January 2011, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal emergency scheduled 3,4-methylenedioxymethcathinone (methylone), 3,4-methyenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), 4-methoxymethcathinone (methedrone), 4-fluoromethcathinone (flephedrone), and 3-fluoromethcathinone (3-FMC).
Tennessee:
On May 5, 2011, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam signed a law making it a crime to knowingly produce, manufacture, distribute, sell, offer for sale or possess with intent produce, manufacture, distribute, sell, or offer for sale any product containing 3,4-methylenedioxymethcathinone (methylone), 3,4-methyenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), 4-methoxymethcathinone (methedrone), 4-fluoromethcathinone (flephedrone), and 3-fluoromethcathinone (3-FMC).
Texas:
In September 2011, Texas added 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone to the Penalty Group 2 listing of the Health and Safety Code.  Possession of a substance in penalty group 2 is a minimum of a state jail felony.
Michigan:
Schedule 1 controlled substance in 2012.
