3-Fluorophenmetrazine (3-FPM) is a substituted amphetamine that’s similar to phenmetrazine, a stimulant which was used for weight loss decades ago. 3-FPM has only been used since 2014.

It provides relatively moderate effects and is more of a productive stimulant than a recreational one. A limit on its positive effects has been noted, so the drug usually doesn’t provide notably better effects at strong+ doses.

Due to a lack of information about the substance, it’s hard to say how safe it is, especially with long-term use. Common doses don’t appear acutely dangerous for healthy people. No deaths have been reported.
