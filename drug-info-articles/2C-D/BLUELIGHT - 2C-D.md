(some peculiar thing i only get with 2c's, like i can taste the chemical as it's entering my brain and it makes me feel kinda icky and twitchy). ended up relating with what people have said about 2c-d, saying, humorously, that it feels like the retarded half brother of 2c-e.

But when I prepared it I just thought to myself "there is no way in hell that is all going up there" so I put maybe 1mg on a card and snorted it. This one is super painful but quite potent in comparison to taken orally. I took 4 bumps spaced about 8-10 minutes apart and I got a lot more than I expected. I will be trying this again at a later date.

So yesterday I had my first encounter with 2c-d. I administered 25 mg rectally and effects immediately took place. It's was quiet pleasant feeling but felt that there was a lot to be discovered at higher dosages.

Therefore I tried 80 mg rectally today and this was mind blowing. Definitely not a tofu experience and at this high dose it's not that easy going anymore.

For me, 2C-D was very similar to 2C-E in mental effects, but very different in physical effects...2C-E has a heavy push, 2C-D is easy on the body.  I never took it to high levels, 40-50mg was plenty for a gentle +++.  I still have to try a higher dose.

This was my first 2c-x experience so can't compare it to anything. Actually it was my second psychedelic experience ever as I've only did LSD once like 5 years ago. 

Can't wait to try 2C-E and 2C-P. At one point in time I really thought I overdosed because the effects were nothing compared to the 25 mg dose and I felt I was going bad. But I managed to control the bad visuals.

Got a big headache today though !!

Holy fuck, Pattyn. 80 mg plugged ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) that's a huge dose.


Be more carefull when you try 2C-P. it's not as forgiving, believe me.

Yep, 80mg plugged seems a very strong dose, i remember well my 100mg oral one and it wasn't tofu for sure, i guess 80mg plugged is even stronger.


For sure with 2C-P if you plug 80mg you will find god ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Anyway 2C-D should be illegal in USA from july if ii'm not wrong.

Keep in mind he had plugged 25mg the previous day, which is equivalent to about 50-75mg orally, so there was at least some significant tolerance going on when he plugged 80mg. Still a retardedly big doses though!

Yeah in hindsight it was pretty careless. Certainly because I don't have a lot of experience with psychedelics. 

I'm just a very impatient guy, I don't like to take small steps ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I'll be more careful with the 2c-e/p though because I've read that those substances can pretty much fuck with your head and body.

Hi,


I had a local anesthesia one day ago, but tomorrow I would like to take some 2C-D (low such as 10 - 30mg at max.).


Could we assume that it will be safe to take ? Can I also drink a beer or two while on this ? What's the side effect should I consider with this combo ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


My weight is also 45 kg. Will it be safe for my heart ?


Thank you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hey Hoffs! Nice to see you still around ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I expect you will be fine, local aneasthesia wears off pretty quick & is usually only active in a particular area, in the mouth at the dentist for instance. Maybe, purely for the sake of caution take 10mg first & then wait 45min before taking more & definitely don't overdo it until you are certain you're free of any possible contraindications.


Enjoy! Interesting stuff 2c-d, not your typical 2c & in fact quite dissimilar to most other Psychedelics, ime anyway... When I had some of this a few years ago I found the nootropic affect quite a surprise! I found I was able to read quite complicated passages in a book that might well have confused me on a normal day. It still feels like tripping but not in that classic tripping way, if you know what I mean. More clarity I reckon!

For the past two years I've limited my psychedelic consumption to a handful of aMT, LSA and mescaline trips, none of which were at greater than moderate dosages. 


Following a general improvement in life, outlook and morphine dependence, I felt the time had come to resume my adventures into the psychonautic unknown. Fast forward 2 weeks and a gram of 2c-d was found under my pillow along with a letter from the Easter Bunny. Yay!


Now I'm not entirely sure if, prior to this week, I've taken this chemical before. I used to regularly aquire 2c-b pills you see, only one batch of these pills was clearly not 2c-b. This mystery drug was of a much shorter duration (4-5 hours oral, regardless of dose), was not really physically stimulating (>20 mg 2c-b induces in me a fine body tremor and an acidesq desire to rave it up), was less mentally inebriating (and 2c-b isn't exactly a head fuck), had a different -wider- visual theme going on (nearer to 1-2 tabs LSD than 2c-b) but clearly was a closely related phen cousin. I decided it was probably 2c-d, based on the duration and gentle dose-response curve (small doses also had a 1/4 tab of acid like nootropic affect, which fits the bill).


In other words, now some definite 2c-d was available I was looking forward to test my previous hypothesis.


And test it i did! After the idiosyncratic checks, 30 mg was orally ingested, a very nice if slightly uneventful evening was had. 


Since then 50 mg oral, with a 10 mg trans-nostril booster at T+3 was tried, along with a 30 mg anal adventure.


Very, very nice compound. It's an amazingly easy, 'blank canvas' type psychedelic with (for me) no negative effects of any kind. It reminds me more of a low-medium dose acid trip than a 2c-b trip, though it lacks the lysergic duration and slightly sinister undertones. With LSD I tend towards and oceanic love for the entire universe, whilst maintaining a somewhat cynical (and a tad paranoid) internal observer. At higher end doses this cynical internal dialogue gets a bit nasty and starts to pick up none existent pretexts and make associations tending towards the paranoid and megalomaniac. 2c-d is much easier material, though not as rewarding. Alas, whilst music enhancement on 2c-d is very good, its not comparable to the world reflecting synergy between lysergic acid DEA 

and music.


Still great stuff!


Can't wait to try 2c-e, even if it does lock me in a thought loop and logically rape me ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Peace, and apologies for the weird sentance structures that my ket'd brain has spawned!

I actually read this entire thread thinking I was on another website and just realized as I attempted to reply that I'm not. That's probably the 2c-d though.. Thankfully this website has fast registration! I've thought about joining before since I read so much here. Anyways, onto the topic...


About two and a half hours ago I ingested 40mg orally (almost wrote 400 there.. wow would that have been off).


I know this is going to be one of my favorite psychedelics because it really pinpoints that psychedelic headspace without anything else. There's slight visual distortion and some body feeling, but for the most part it's just me sitting here realizing so much about myself and about the world. A true psychedelic.


I can see this being used therapeutically (wow i'm surprised I could spell that word right now!) much more than recreationally because of the lack of body feeling and visuals that so many people look for. Is this why Shulgin thought of it as not much? To me it seems like a great tool that has it's specific uses. It's like LSD is this one size fits all super-wrench while 2C-D is a 4mm wrench. The psychedelic headspace is definitely present and I come back to writing this post between my "me times" which prevents me from typing more than about a sentence at a time.


I said no visuals, but every once in a while when I look away from the screen I do have mild breathing of objects. No noticable color distortions or enhancements. As I was walking around earlier everything looked different, but that was probably because I had a different perspective on the various objects than I usually do. Everything seemed so intriguing. I would look up at the trees and see the different widths of the branches and they all looked so weird. Okay I'm not being of much help here.. maybe I should have waited until after to write this.. haha.


Oh, one thing I forgot!


Usually on psychedelics I'm scared to go and talk to people, but with this I was almost encouraging others to come talk to me just for the interaction I could have. I think this would be best done with other people and not alone just because it's actually very easy to talk and formulate sentences. It's much more social in nature. I feel quite clear headed which is probably why some have tried using 2C-D as a "smart" drug. I could definitely see it being used as a "get a different view on it" drug because it does bring you into the psychedelic headspace with being able to think outside it and not be so confused. Anyways I forgot my point.


I'll let you know how the rest goes! And I'll probably take a look around other parts of the forum and maybe find some danger to get into.

Glad you like it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 2C-D is a nice chem indeed *thumbs up*


I have a quick question here. Someone know if it would be ok to take Methoxetamine a day after taking 2C-D ?  I've heard about the serotonin syndrom things so i'm kind of hesitant doing it.


Thank you :D

2-d & Methoxetamine have been used in conjunction, I have known people use this combo. It has facinating audio effects. Keep doses lower (say half) than usual when combining things & go easy until YOU know you're safe.


I personally don't think there are any SS dangers here but I am no expert in that department.

Have a great time Hoffs ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I don't see any obvious problems using these two on differing days if the they can comfortably be combined at the same time without mishap.

2-D is one of my favorites maybe because it was the first phen that I have tried or because its hard to get a bad trip and it gets you in a great emotionally open mood.


This is not very psychedelic even though rooms look bigger to me with more than 30mg and I tend to see different spectral colors on white walls because they are obviously not 100% white in every lighting.


Its maybe more of a thing that would work in psycholythic therapy and not in psychedelic therapy even though there are reports where high doses are very psychedelic.

I could not have said it better myself.  And 40mg is my preferred dosage too.  I have never understood the 'TOFU' component many describe, nor do I get any 'smart drug' effects...even with as little as 5mg....but as a regular old fashioned psychedelic....2C-D is par excellence @ 40mg....far more useful than 2C-B or 2C-C when it comes to mind-expanding, insight, therapy-type psychedelic.  Certainly not as sexy as 2C-B or as straight amusing as 2C-C...but that is why it is nice to have choices.  Just like different wines.

There were a few times when I was slightly scared at some of the self-realizations that were occurring which brought the mood into a more somber (not always a bad thing) state. Those feelings were short-lived, however, and most of the trip was quite euphoric.

To me, this is much, much more than just psycholythic therapy. I came out of a single dose with many improvements to my mindset. I actually think this could be more effective than others in psychedelic therapy because it should be much less frightening without foreign visuals (for those who are unfamiliar with psychedelics) and a strange body feeling. If I could choose one drug to be used for the general public for therapeutic purposes, this would be my choice. I still have much more research to do with it and others that I have never tried, however.

Exactly! That is what I meant when I wrote about this substance being a true psychedelic. It's all about the 'mind expansion' without the "fun" visual effects or body effects that commonly come along with that. I do enjoy those as well, and they both have their place.

I wonder if this would be much more common if it had never initially been given the 'smart drug' or 'tofu' names in PiHKAL. I think this literature downplays 2C-D very much. It doesn't take heroic doses to get very effective results. I could see at heroic levels that it may be accompanied by the body feeling and visuals because they were ever so slightly present at 40mg. Maybe he only

This particular 2c-x took some time getting right, but after playing around with it, it became a new favorite.  The first time I was in a horrible mood and was a bit dope sick as well, so I'm sure that in itself made for an unpleasant experience.  I took 30mg and as soon as it started to come on I couldn't get comfortable for the life of me. About 2 hours into, I just kept on pacing around, feeling extremely down as I was depressed and alone at the time.  There were no visuals at this dose and  unlike most 2c-x, other than 2c-c, I felt oddly sedated and spent the majority of the rest of the trip in bed.  I know not to take psychs when one is in a bad mind state, but I figured a mild one wouldn't be too devastating and as always, I did gain some insight into a majority of issues I've been struggling with.


About a month later, i felt like I could handle a decent trip.  This time I ingested 50mg, I was also pretty high on heroin and really felt like having a proper, enjoyable trip and that I did.   I believe the opiates have a real nice synergy with 2c-d, it almost felt as if the two were potentiating each other. Another plus about 2c-d, is the shorter duration.  After 4-5 hours of pleasantly tripping, I was coming down, so I prepped 15-20mg IM.  This completely changed the character of the trip.  About 10 min after the injection it all just hit me.  I was tripping hard.  Previous to this route, I never expereinced visuals on 2c-d, but I was engulfed in visuals.  The processing of the visuals were quite unique and unlike any other psych I've had.  It's hard to explain, but everything around me was morphing, breathing, crawling, but in an odd fashion, at a rapid rate.  Despite the heavy alterations in my visual field, my mind was still relatively intact, though at times it felt I was simutaneously having several trains of thoughts going on in my head.  


All this subsided in about an hour, so I felt like calling it a night and IV some heroin, but I wondered what it be like to also throw a pinch of 2c-d in there.  In totality, I put probably 5-10mg along with the H.  As soon as I started plunging down, the world around me started to change at a pace I'm not to comfortable with.  Fortunately, I was given a good 15 seconds to prepare myself, so I do what I always do when I think I took too many psychs and am losing my mind, I retreated to my bed.  I felt a bit of terror start to creep over me, but I was able to move past it and ride the experience out, which lasted for about another hour.  It wasn't a negative experience, but rather neutral.  The IV route gets way too confusing way too fast and can induce quite a bit of anxiety, so I'd avoid  this route for those looking for a smooth ride.  


Anyways, I really have grown to enjoy  this compound. It feels clean on the body and clear in the mind.  Definitely a winner.

From briefly scanning through this thread I noticed many recommended 2c-d in combination with amphetamine.  I just parachuted couple points of methamphetamine, will I achieve the same results using these two substances in low doses or is the meth too much?

I took a 40-45mg dose of this beauty and had the best psychedelic experience of my life. Had a brief moment where all my senses and thoughts blended together giving me an everything is everything revelation, really hard to explain. 


The only negative effect I had was feeling like I was overheating and sweating during the comeup. Does this stimulant effect continue to increase with intensity into higher doses or does it plateau? Can't imagine taking a 150mg dose like the Germans if that's the case.

Idk if it was mentioned, but somehow I get the feeling it was not. 2C-D is more active when insufflated, actually that's the first advice I got from my vendor about it. So 15 mg is already quite a buzz with that method of administration, 25-30 mg a rather strong dose, and 50 mg supposed to produce a catatonic-like mind blowing experience. It still works for 3-4 hours this way so it's pure economy. It's treated as a fact so obvious where I live that I never did it any other way.


And the times I did it gave me the impression of a very smooth and highly euphoric, fun phen. It's strong on the stimulant side but not lacking a psychedelic headroom and visual activity. Dancing to psy music and talking to people felt awesome. A well balanced high overall, well suited for a party or chill out practice, and one I'd be happy to repeat.

Does it hurts if you insufflate this?


Tomorrow I will try this with some M for it's synergistic effects. People told me I could use less M and it smooths out the M-effect over a longer period of time.


Any advice on this will be appreciated.

Not too sure, but given other phens it doesn't seem like you want to snort this. Shortens the duration anyway, which kinda defeats your purpose doesn't it


(maybe I'm venturing close to "what should you take" here, but maybe low-dose aMT or an APB could be your schtick for a longer empathogen experience)

I once tried to insufflate some 2C-D, but it was like sniffing pepper so I sneezed and lost like 3/4 of the line. Can't really recommend it. 


The 2C-D I have is very fluffy, it's probably better to snort if it's more chrystaline.

Well yeah, it's a very unpleasant substance for ur nasal cavities unfortunately. It's painful like good speed times 3 I would say. But on the other hand u would snort like a few times less than when doing a line of speed so for me and my friends it was always manageable. Just remember to swallow everything that goes down your throat after snorting, the taste isn't actually that bad, it's just the burn that dulls the fun. For me totally worth insufflating though, 25 mg does u great for like 4 hours and 50 mg is plenty for a whole full on party (for 1 person).

stopping by this thread to say this is a wonderful surprising chemical.


had 2 doses of about 20 mg each, one taken 2 hours after the other, as i had thought i would not feel the first one. though it was in a public space with a great big party around, it proved quite manageble with only cevs for distortion in the visual sense, and oevs rather restrained. the body high and energy released was great, as was the apparent lucidity that allowed for conversation and social aspects... overall it lasted around 6 hours from the second dose, and was able to sleep fine in another hour or so...


i must say though that the set and setting suplied a lot of the diretion and happiness of the whole trip. in fact, i would go so far as to say this was and felt more like a roll than anything else, with added visuals and a trippy headspace. but then again, 90% of those around me were rolling and the music was rave oriented so that too was conductive of the trip. awesome time was had by all.


felt like quite a dose, but keep in mind i had tripped on a low dose of acid 5 days prior. my usual doses of 2cd do not exceed 30mg

Yes it is surprising indeed. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Combined with a little dose of 3C-P (about 40 mg of that plus 20 mg 2C-D snorted) it resulted in a profound headspace and various interesting perceptive changes I wouldn't even think could happen. I doubted the 'psychedelic tofu' quality of this compound, but now I gotta say Shulgin pinpointed it right, it's huge for expanding other compounds' action. As it always goes with 2C-D, also felt a nice body high and a very inspiring sense of euphoria. I would say this one feels best done at a party, and it doesn't really impair social skills unless done in extreme doses. The stimulating properties are also good for a boost when going into a 3 days long rave. Recommended.

I wouldn't take the tofu analogy too far, because like all other 2C's 2C-D is best when it's the only 2C in your system.  You get more of a feeling for it's unique short action and pleasurable, visual, and audial effects.

I wonder though, would it make for a good synergy with DOC? I'm planning to take a 4 mg hit of that at a multicultural party this weekend and probably take some 2C-D along just in case it seems like a good idea to do it. Anybody tried this combo?

4mg of DOC is a pretty strong dose, so keep that in mind. Also, the duration of effects are drastically different. You will have to carefully consider your timing.

Any good visuals with this substance? 

From what I read it doesn't seem to be a very visual compound.

Depends on how visual you make it.  Remember that "dose" is subjective.  I'm sure 125 mg would be just as visual or more visual than the equivalent amount of 2C-E.


In my experience, I could low dose this stuff all day and have visuals all day.

ive had a hard time combining DOC with anything actually, especially 2cs. somehow if you miss taking the 2c dose in the first hours of the doc experience one would need to take higher doses to achieve some effect... not saying one should start out with high doses in mind, but dont go in with high expectations either.


in regards to the visual aspect, id say its both user and dose dependant. for me at lower doses it isnt that visual, nor could i expect many redoses to sustain visual activity

Absolutely it seems Shulgin never took this to the fully active level; his dosage is way off as it is for AMT with which it shares the confusing quality (for a tester) of seeming to do something at a low dose; it more or less inplies this in Phikal "always teasing, until you get to heroic levels" - It just isn't a potent compound but then neither is his much loved MDMA; 2C-D is streaks above most of the magic half dozen apart from 2C-B and Mescaline (which needs stupendous levels)

Hi, first time poster here.


I've been scanning through the posts and wanted to chime in about the headaches.

I've experienced them at 20, 30, 35 and 45 mg (never went beyond that), taken orally each time.

They are, as someone described, a stinging, rather unpleasant sensation, usually at the lower back of the head, accompanied with a general sense of heightened pressure on the head in general.


My last experience with 2C-D was at 25 mg, and lo and behold - nothing of the sort!

This particular time, I was very, very well rested (8+ hour sleep the night before, plus a nap in the afternoon), I had taken 5-HTP earlier in the day, and had one beer about 2.5 hours before ingesting it. The next day, I only had a faint, negligible headache, perhaps more related to lack of sleep more than anything (I had to wake up early that morning - not for work though!).


As for the other qualitative aspects of 2C-D - I was not too comfortable with the full-on psychedelic experience I had at 45 mg. I had more much energy than I could deal with, couldn't concentrate on anything, following conversations wasn't easy or fascinating, no insights... Overall, it felt stupid more than anything.


At lower doses (from now on I think I'll stick to 20-30 mg), I find the slight energy boost to be quite pleasant and not too overwhelming.


Last night I wrote this with the intention of submitting to Erowid, but since it's a combined report, it might not get published. I'll just leave it here, if anyone cares to read. There's a bit of overlap with what I just wrote, sorry:


> My first experience with 2C-D was at 10 mg (orally), and the effects were nothing to write home about. I was mostly scatterbrained and giddy for a few hours, unable to focus on anything in particular. Making music was a vain effort.
> 
> 
> 
> A few weeks later, I tried with 20 mg, then later that month with 30 mg, attending concerts on both occasions (going on foot!), as I felt the material would be light enough for those types of settings. While the latter experience was slightly more intense, the effects were more or less the same: roughly 90 minute onset, colors seemed more vivid,  tactile sensations quite pleasant, a heightened sense of humor and maybe less inhibition, and a very small hint of paranoia. Depth perception also seemed slightly altered. Music seemed more pleasant to listen to, but I distinctly remember being able to stay critical about it. Some delay sounds clearly felt “plastic”, so there might some synesthesia there. Effects gone after 4 hours.
> 
> 
> 
> At 30 mg, I do remember feeling it slightly difficult to stand up straight and motionless. Nevertheless, in neither case did anyone who didn't know I had taken 2C-D notice anything unusual at all about me. One side effect I noted from both experiences was feeling from time to time a sharp headache in the back of my head, as well as the sensation of pressure on my skull. I would be interested to know how 2C-D affects blood pressure.
> 
> 
> 
> Later that summer, I decided it was time to take it to 45 mg. This time I decided to attend a small scale all-night party at a venue I am very familiar with, hosted by friends of mine. The effects of 2C-D didn't come on until 90 minutes, and were far more dramatic than anticipated. In addition to the familiar effects noted at 20-30 mg,  I started noticing “dislocated” tracers: something I saw in my field of vision would momentarily reappear somewhere else, but not in a continuous fashion, like a disappointing kaleidoscope. Then I remember feeling a strong jolt of energy going through my head. It was unlike anything I'd ever felt, and frankly a bit worrying, although not entirely unpleasant. This only occurred once, still during the onset phase. The aforementioned headache did not occur this time, but there was pressure on my head.
> 
> 
> 
> After about 2 and a half hours following ingestion, I decided to step outside for some fresh air. I remember carrying my bag on one shoulder and being completely destabilized by this uneven weight on my back. Once I had it on both shoulders, everything was fine. 
> 
> 
> 
> Once outside, I realized the true psychedelic effects of 2C-D had begun. The pavement was unmistakably undulating. Street lights seemed much more vivid than usual, giving a surreal pink tinge to everything. The materials from this familiar building all seemed alien and plastic. Viewed from outside, the red bricks made the building look like some giant cake. Windows looked like water surfaces.
> 
> 
> 
> Yet despite this extremely new set of sensations, I was able to hold conversations with seemingly unsuspecting acquaintances. Perhaps I was giggling more than usual, but I was able to contain myself surprisingly well. I did however feel waves of mental confusion coming and going. Concentrating on anything was hard, yet some alertness remained. It felt as if I was observing myself being under the influence of this chemical from behind a glass window. No insights whatsoever, though. Time got quite distorted at this point. One hour easily felt like two. Physically, it was slightly exhausting. 
> 
> 
> 
> The music felt more detailed, or rather, I started noticing how psychedelic simple production tricks like delay could be, and decided that the notion of “psychedelic music” was a complete oxymoron. Unlike I would under the influence of alcohol or MDMA, I was completely unwilling to dance beyond nodding along. In fact, I find that 2C-D made me quite tense, even petrified. Empathy is not one of its virtues either. In fact, I find myself wisecracking and being more sarcastic than usual under its influence, and at times, it would take me a while to remember I was the only one having taken 2C-D, and that others might simply be drunk, or even sober. At this dose, I found it is not a party drug, and I can see why it is so uncommon.

> 
> 
> As usual, the effects faded after 4 or 5 hours, and I felt fine the next day.
> 
> I have since experimented back at 25-35 mg, and find these doses much more pleasant in social settings. Headaches seem preventable by taking 2C-D after a good night's sleep. Drinking one beer a few hours before my last 25 mg experience, I felt none of the unpleasant side-effects I've noted above.

How does 130mg MDMA then 20mg 2c-d 2.5 hours later sound (looking for an extension of my roll more than a full blown trip).

Never tried it with MDMA but I imagine it is quite nice with it.


My last few trials with 2C-D were all in the 20mg-30mg range and it is still quite mind expanding and satisfying a compound at that level.    It does reach a whole different level above 50mg but it still offers a lot in the lower ranges.  Tofu indeed.


Edit: 

blistersinthedark  nice report.  I noted it on erowid a few months ago.  Good writing.

I've tried this material on three occasions thus far, at 15, 20 and 30mg. On all three trips, I had a significantly uneasy and unpleasant come-up, even when combining with mxe on the 15 and 20mg trips. At 30mg by itself, the drug was simply unenjoyable... The come-up was two hours of headaches and general disphoria, feelings of simply not wanting to exist. Then for an hour, I peak and it feels like a pleasant psychedelic... however, I don't feel like the two hours of pain and discomfort are justifiable in order to reach that one hour peak. Has anyone else experienced this with 2C-D? Any suggestions on how to avoid some of the discomfort? Thus far, mxe has proved fairly useless at forcing away the negativity, when normally mxe is a pure pleasure drug for me.


I see many of these posts suggesting that 2C-D is a valuable substance, but in my trials I have found it little more than a gimmick of a psychedelic, offering brief fun in exchange for far too much pain. I want to be able to use it to its fullest the way others have been, but I can't figure out how to go about doing that ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Plugging it may help with body issues, extend mileage / potency and being a parenteral sort of route it should also enhance / shorten come-up and come-down phases more than the plateau.


But yes 2C-D is of course just short-lived, and it seems to have a unique special edge to it that has been called stimulant and nootropic-like... not sure if this is also the same edge that is causing your headaches. 2C-D is not really uncomfortable for me but it does feel "squeaky", synthetic and generic. It is supposed to be pretty special if you push into strong territory, with some substances it seems people routinely underdose (like this one probably because people are not used to taking 100 mg or more of a 2C-X) or overdose (salvia 8) ). But I can't really say I am too interested in going there, it still seems like forcing it to me a lot more than you have to do with ones that just come out with it already. Which I guess is saying that IMO you always have to consider that dose-response curves are often different even if you try to adjust your dosage range according to proportional potency ratios.

^^240sxLover: I find the comeup slightly uneasy and uncomfortable as well, but not intolerable at all - maybe because I've been dosing it very very low, like 8-15mg range. It sounds like 2C-D doesn't agree with you, or else maybe you're just trying to push it further than where it wants to go with you?


For me personally, 2C-D isn't the one to "go far" with. If the 2C series were golf clubs, then to me, 2C-D would be the putter - it's the one for just a little bit of that phenethylamine goodness, the mildest of trips, museum dosing etc. So I agree with Solipsis, it does seem like forcing it a bit to go to the higher doses.


So maybe you're like me, and 2C-D fits better in the mild end of the spectrum?


edit: just some afterthoughts - I find 2C-D to be a very valuable substance, and one I'll want to have a lifetime stash of. But it's not useful in the way that standard PDs have been for me - it's not one for tripping out on per se, or for those deep, life-changing trips. I like it as a social drug, something to take with some friends and then have a beer together, a houseparty, or a couple hours before a meal. Or maybe for a stealth trip, a very low dose during a normal workday, to have a silly and fun workday.

^I'll give it a shot at lower doses, but like I mentioned, even at 15mg it was a fairly uncomfortable come-up. I'll have to give it a shot at 10mg next time, then head lower if it doesn't work. It seems to be a powerful substance in its own way, often overpowering mxe for me. Perhaps I was trying to aim too high. I'm hoping I can find the sweet spot, because the peak is always wonderful... it's just that miserable come-up.


I loved 2C-C when I tried it, and I took that up to 50mg with amazing results... perhaps 2C-D is like you said, just not right for my chemistry.

2C-D is a wonderful substance and for me the choice when clubbing over MDMA, 4-FA methylone etc. I ussaly take around 10 MG and drink a couple of beers and all anxiety dissapears and I feel extremely confident good euporia decent visuals and a general feeling of well being. I also hear people that benzo's reduce anxiety, well 2C-D does that for me 100-fold compaired to that.

I had a great time with 10mg of 2C-D on Halloween this year, at a small gathering. I'd say it's a great chem at low doses, at least for me. It was just right at 10mg, but past that it seems to give me issues. I've found 2C-C to be more giving and forgiving in recent experiences, but 2C-D has it's place in the right time and location.

I actually find 2C-D more forgiving. Both are very forgiving, but 2C-C can get dark with me sometimes even at low doses.


Did you use alcohol in conjunction with 2C-D and if so, how does it decrease anxiety for you? For me it helps me to get over my shyness a lot.

^I didn't combo it with alcohol ever in my... I think 5 times testing it out. It doesn't give me anxiety relief though by itself, and past 10-15mg the come up makes me wana die. I get just really uncomfortable headache-like feelings and a general sense of dysphoria for the first two hours usually. And like I said, opposite to you I find 2C-C to be the more gentle of the two 2C's I have tried, at least in relation to dose response. I have no idea what causes this variance.


The only reason I'd take 2C-D over 2C-C in any situation is because of how 'barely-there' it is for me at around 10mg. It makes good tofu as long as you don't up the dose to where you can 'taste the tofu' so to speak. I'd take a low dose of 2C-D at a party or a museum, but probably not 2C-C, because 2C-D is less in your face at the right dose.

2C-D... there wasn't a single substance... maybe DXM... I wouldn't mix it with... 


Every 2C-D mix... 10-25mg with whatever regular dose I took of anything else... always amazing. 25mg of 2C-D with 100mg (REAL) MDAI = MDMA. Wouldn't be able to tell the two apart except for the crazy visuals and the duration (2C-D adds another 2 hours to the peak) but less jaw clenching and no tachycardia.


2C-D + 2C-C? WISH I had the chance to try that one because I loved both of them.

I've only ever mixed it with MXE, which kinda makes both drugs feel weird... but I've been toying with the idea of doing 10mg 2C-D with methylone sometime. Have you ever tried that combo?

Methylone and 2C-D go great. 2C-D adds the psychedelic the methylone is missing and methylone adds the empathy that is a total void in 2C-D.


Its a great combo. Don't put the 2C-D over about 15mg though or it will take over and the psychedelic will be the main part of the experience.

It was a great combo. I was almost sure they combined well and they really did.

My prefered method of administration is IM. But with IM experience become pretty short, talking about time length.

 Increase the 2CC. Safely. 


The dose doesn't increase intensity but duration. 80mg lasted a buddy of mine (orally) about 11 hours but the intensity was the same as the 25mg we did.... Which was probably too much anyway.


Straight from Shulgin hinself


EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY: Other reports mention usage of up to 50 milligrams which seems to increase yet further the intensity and the duration. I have one report of an intravenous administration of 20 milligrams, and the response was described as overwhelming. The effects peaked at about 5 minutes and lasted for perhaps 15 minutes.

For every individual experience would be different. For me 2C-D really increase intensity with higher doses.

What sort of dosage is 2C-D again? I had some a few years ago but I can't remember at all.


I tend to find a dose of both 2C-B and 2C-I to be around about 25 mg~


Is 2C-D roughly the same?


I wish I'd made a note of my preferred dose.

2C-D is less potent than 2C-B and 2C-I, although for me and a lot of people even 15mg makes for a light, fun time. I'd say if you like 25mg of 2C-B you might want to start out at around 30-35mg 2C-D and go from there.

For me, the range of positive effects only goes from around 10-20mg. When I took 30mg once, the experience was stronger, but so were all the terrible side-effects 2C-D seems to bestow upon me. YMMV.

^Yeah good point that. I get the feeling that 2C-D doesn't go very "far" exactly the way you described. I've never dosed it above 18mg, so my advice to start at 30-35mg isn't very good. I don't think anyone would hurt them self with 35mg 2C-D, but you might have a better time starting at 15-20mg and working your way up.

Is anyone around here still using this stuff? I must say I'm pretty interested in it for the nootropic potential, even if some of its usefulness has been overstated. I really like d-amp or 2-FMA for studying but they don't open up mental pathways like cannabis, which is a bit too cloudy for me to be productive with anyways. So is this stuff really worthwhile to invest in for learning?

I got zero nootropic-esque effects from 2C-D. Hell, if you want stimulation for learning coupled with the creativity of some other drugs... I'd advocate coffee. You may laugh, but coffee has all the stimulation I could need, and it has all the creativity enhancing effects that amphetamines are lacking. It's the reason I graduated from college on time. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) Coffee!


2C-D is more like a plain ol' generic psychedelic; visuals, music appreciation, odd body sensations, but to me, certainly no creativity or mental space enhancement. It's honestly just a weird one... everyone seems to have a different opinion of it, so perhaps it would indeed have the effects you desire. Only way to find out is to try it yourself.

I'm wondering if you lot are talking about  2-amino-1-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanone (BK-2-CB pellets) ... it's just I'm getting a 100mg pellet as a freebie with my latest order, and I don't know what to expect. I'm generally a benzo user, although one or two of the cannabinoids around can be quite good (not like the real thing, though).

> I first visited with LAZAR at his hillside home overlooking the city in the summer of 1980. I had heard of this chemist for a couple of years and was intrigued by the work he was doing with synthetic neurotransmitters and the possibilities which they presented. It sounded to me that he had come up with a real "smartpill" that actually worked. I had managed to meet him at a party on one of his rare forays from his home. It was not so much that he was a recluse, it was just so great at home that going out was sort of a downer.

> I climbed the steps from the parking area where several cars were parked, nothing flashy just the run of the mill from Detroit and Tokyo. I rang the bell and waited. Presently from the rear of the house ambled a middle aged, well tanned and muscled LAZAR wearing nothing but a towel around his middle. After an exchange of greeting he led me through the house to a beautiful and secluded pool where a few lovely ladies and their consorts were enjoying themselves in the pool totally nude. I was introduced around feeling really out of place with all my clothes on. Sensing this my host directed me to large bedroom and said I could leave my clothes there. A large, round waterbed held several small stacks of clothes. Another stack of clothes was on the floor with the shoes. I undressed, made a pile of my clothes, and went out to join the others. As I stepped out onto the patio surrounding the pool, I was greatly relieved that no one paid any attention to me or stared, other than a glance to acknowledge my presence.

> With a slight movement of his head, LAZAR motioned me to a deck chair next to him. "Welcome to the Lazy Lizard School of Hedonism," he said while smiling, "This is an informal, unstructured, no load happening for a number of my friends and acquaintances who live a more frantic or hectic life than I do. This allows them to relax and unwind in a pleasant setting and recharge their batteries so to speak. Works rather well--most are workers at mundane jobs or graduate students at the U. doing mundane things."

> I asked LAZAR if this was his first or last name. He said that it was the only name and the change was made when he was staying on Maui for a while. He had attended a Sacred Fire Ceremony and during that time the opportunity presented itself to take on a new name of his own choosing. So he selected LAZAR since he had been called "the Lizard" around the pool for some time. It was part of a general plan to simplify his life from a bunch of extraneous stuff. He wanted to focus his energies in a more efficient manner. We exchanged bits of our respective backgrounds and I asked him how he had become interested in the "smart pills". This name for these compounds is not correct but it is much shorter than the title for this writing. (There will be more on what these chemicals do and some suppositions on how they act in the human body and neurological system.) He said he had been doing some library reference work and he ran across a reference to a patent application. The title of the abstract was: Compounds for improving the capacity for intellectual work of mammals.(2) This grabbed his attention right away and he realized that humans could benefit most from such a development.

Abandoning all other pursuits for the next few days he searched the literature for all of the similar compounds that could be found.

> The first "smart pill" compound made was 2CD or 4-Methyl-2,5 Dimethoxy-phenethylamine hydrochloride (3,4) and was tested at several dosage levels. The higher ranges from 10 to 20 milligrams (mg) produced a state of mild intoxication with increased sensory enhancement, but with no hallucinogenisis. Lower levels, from 5 to 10 mg produced calm states wherein one could read, study, or listen with excelled concentration and as we found out later with much better than normal retention. Sensitivity to this compound varied among the test subjects some finding that 5 mg (or even less) worked just fine for them and others stated that this dosage was not effective. So every one worked out their particular level. In those subjects who had a greater sensitivity to this compound, laughter, hilarity, and giggling interfered with studying or other learning pursuits. During this time of initial exploration it was noted that these materials worked best on individuals who were inclined to be serious about their study habits. When used by persons who tended to be less than studious when confronted with a book or lessons, they would think shortly of how much more fun it would be if they were playing catch, riding a motorcycle, drinking beer or just generally goofing off. In these cases the smart pills were of no advantage and probably were a hindrance to the overall process of learning.

> Another effect which was noted, after perhaps two months of usage, was that most subjects began making major changes in their lives. Since many were students at the local universities some changed their majors, transferred to a better school, left the area to places where they felt there was more opportunity, quit the job they had for a better one, got in a meaningful relationship, etc. A few said it should be called "courage", because it seemed to give them the needed push to move onward. Nearly all who were students reported better grades with less effort. Exams were no longer an anathema. Many reported that they were no longer bitchy when studying for finals.

> Having completed all of the required course work, he still needed to fulfill his language requirement. His adviser informed him that if he could pass the fourth semester of German with a "C" or better and pass the departmental written translating test, his language requirement would be fulfilled. He enrolled in the fourth semester of German without taking the first three as the department assumed he would. He talked to LAZAR about two weeks before the end of the semester and said he was afraid he would not pass the German course. He asked LAZAR if he had any suggestions, since he had seen him in the library pouring over some of the voluminous German chemical literature. LAZAR said he had some "smart pills" which might help. Carl said he would take them; he sounded rather desperate. He said he had planned to study or cram for the final for a full week of seven days and for eight to ten hours per day. So LAZAR said he would give him one smart pill for each day of study and one for the final if he thought it was necessary. LAZAR also told him that he had a set of index cards with the most used Chemical German technical terms on them. He would loan them to Carl to copy, not with a Xerox machine, but by hand while under the influence of a smart pill. A few days after the final exam Carl excitedly reported to LAZAR that he had passed the fourth semester German exam with a "C" and that during the test when he needed a word it was right there. He also said that he did not use a smart pill for the final exam indicating that the learning is not state dependent. That is, you do not need to be in the same slightly altered state when retrieving the information as when learning it. About a month later Carl and LAZAR crossed paths in the chemistry library and Carl told him that he had passed the Departmental German translating test and that he only had to finish his research and dissertation to graduate. Carl left for a few moments and on returning handed LAZAR his index cards and a very nicely done booklet with lettered index tabs and inside was a Xerox copy of a hand copied short dictionary of German chemical terms. Carl stated that he was translating German regularly and found it most useful for his work.

John felt that the use of smart pills was of great value in studying for the German and also for the cumulative exams which cover all of the chemistry which the professors feel the student should know. However, after that time, the Chemistry Department decided to plug the loophole and required students to take all four semesters of German.

> He had heard of a visiting lecture series on "Photo Chemistry" at one of the universities and thought that it might have some applicationin his synthetic chemical work. He went to the first lecture in the morning and found that the content was way over his head and that his comprehension was not very good. On the lunch break he felt that a smart pill would be worthwhile trying for the afternoon lecture. He took 10 mg, a little ahead of time, so that it would be working when the lecture started. The lecturer began with a recap of the morning lecture for those who may have missed it. LAZAR then understood what had been said in the morning and also understood the content of the afternoon lecture. Occasionally the lecturer would be standing at the black board, chalk in hand, and would be groping for the correct word. LAZAR knew what the word was before it was spoken and these were words which were not in his common vocabulary. He finished the two day series with a good understanding of the principles and techniques involved in this area of chemistry. Unfortunately it didn't seem to be useful for his work. What was interesting was the possibility that he was tuning into the lecturer's thoughts, as the latter was groping for the correct word, and somehow, LAZAR knew what the word was before it was uttered.

She reported a pleasant, controlled energy and studied because she felt like it and had very good results from the effort. A follow up discussion ten years later disclosed that she felt the use of 2CD had increased the acuity of her hearing and that now ten years later there was no diminishing in that effect. For most of Meg's studies she used 2CD-DiEt, a compound which had fewer distracting components to it for her particular physiology (more on her use of this compound later under its own listing).

The proposal focused on a new way to do what futurists call "STEEP Scanning": the identification of Social, Technological, Economic, Ecological, Political patterns, trends and issues of importance, and the translation of these factors into opportunities and threats useful for decision makers. The problem I wanted help with was this: How to show in graphical as well as verbal terms the dynamic systems involved. As the 2CD took effect (about 25 minutes, although a subtle energy shift occurred in my body almost immediately) I noticed that my internal clock speed was increasing, and that I was thinking and visualizing with increasing subtle "granularity" (i.e., "many more distinguishable trees in the forest"). After playing with ideas for some minutes, I took a toke of a high grade bud of cannabis, which for me often brings the ability to "see" systems in three dimensions.

I quickly sketched exactly what I needed and went off with my wife to make love, for the 2CD also quickened that aspect of beingness as well.

He took a one hour ski lesson and then a couple of days later went skiing with LAZAR and his lady. The first run was a disaster for Bill, who fell down getting off the lift and kept falling down every ten or twenty feet, or so it seemed. When they got to the bottom of the first run, LAZAR called everyone together for a smart pill and then waited a short while for it to take effect. When the very first or threshold effects were noted, everyone got on the lift and went up again. This time Bill did not fall down getting off the lift and he went ahead of everyone. It was difficult at times for the others to keep up with him. His form was not great, but he was really going for it. They all made one more run down this beginner's slope and then went up some slightly more difficult runs. By lunch time all were going up on intermediate slopes and doing very well. Everyone who had skied previously said that they had never skied better. After lunch, and a well deserved rest and half of a smart pill, the whole group went up again. By mid-afternoon Bill had started to lose it on some difficult intermediate slopes where LAZAR felt he had no business to be. So everyone moved down to some easier slopes and all was fine for the rest of the day. Bill went skiing twice more with his girl friend (the first time with smart pills) and the next time the four of them hit the slopes together. Well, the only time LAZAR and his lady saw the other two was when they went whizzing by at great speed. Bill had become as expert a skier as his companion in a very short time. In fact he was so enamored of skiing that he sort of became a ski bum and lived and worked evenings at ski resorts just so he could ski all day during the season. After a couple of years of this the novelty wore off and Bill came down to earth again.

After another half hour it was clear that something indeed was happening. I felt light and euphoric, but nothing particular was going on in my mind. I slept lightly for another hour -- very relaxed, a very refreshing and alert sleep.

Terence and I spent the next day and a half going over the proposed film, spinning tales and dancing the dance of new friends. The one full day was spent after ingesting a small (10 mg) amount of 2CD on my part. It is difficult to differentiate between cause and effect at this point, but I will tell you that in the space of that time, I felt as if my brain had been washed in the waters of some cool, clear, sweet, spring; that some kind of opaque filmy veil had been flushed away and that cortical tissues were being exposed to brilliant light. The nature of our conversations was so intense at times, that I would have to leave him and go for a short solitary walk because of being in overload.

Ideas were fully formed and clearly and powerfully expressed without effort or effect. I had extraordinary flights of mental connections. I felt as if there was a voice speaking in me that I had never heard before and that its origins were from some deep ocean of intuition and profound meaning. What continually astonished me in the process was that the things the voice was expressing were things I have never been able to say with absolute clarity. In other words, they were languaged feelings more than mental constructs. And these feelings had meanings far more profound than any thoughts I had theretofore expressed in my writings or in my personal conversations with other people.

How this new voice simplified everything and how, in the process of simplification, everything said gained the power of its own authenticity which, somehow, I didn't own, which was me, but not of me, which came from more than me. This report may seem rather effusive, especially since the substance seemed at the time of ingestion, so mild and barely present, but I intuitively feel there was something still working chemically and in alchemical combination in the meeting with Terence and that the "washing" I refer to was still going on. I would welcome any thoughts from the pool of your experience on this. Does this make any sense to you?

> The above represents a few of the many trials conducted with 2CD and one can see that it has a broad spectrum of usefulness. It was difficult to get the people involved with these tests to make written reports of what they experienced with the compound. One should also realize that all of this data is anecdotal in nature and not admissible as hard evidence. However, it does point to the great potential of this particular class of synthetic neurotransmitters. Several subjects, in addition to Meg, found that 2CD was a little too strong for them; they mostly felt that it "wired them up" excessively. The compound was tamed by replacing the two methoxy groups on the ring with two ethoxy groups and resulted in 2CD-DiEt (4-Methyl-2,5 diethoxyphenethyl- amine) which retained the smart pill activity and eliminated the tendency towards states of intoxication. Along this same line of reasoning, two other compounds were made where only one of the methoxy groups was replaced with an ethoxy group. Since there are two methoxy groups to replace, this resulted in two more compounds 2CD-2EtO (4-Methyl-2- ethoxy-5-methoxy-phenethyl-amine) and 2CD-5EtO (4- Methyl-2-methoxy-5-ethoxy-phenethyl-amine). The first compound, 2CD-2EtO, did not show any smart pill activity in initial trials and was not pursued further. The second compound, 2CD-SEtO, did show some very interesting properties in this area which will be covered under it's own heading later on.

> 
> There is some potential for abuse of 2CD as a recreational drug, but LAZAR does not feel the problem is serious. An example of recreational use will he given: A couple who were familiar with the smart pills asked LAZAR to furnish enough 2CD for a party of about twenty persons, The 2CD was dissolved in a sweet flavorful liquor, so that each ounce contained a moderate dosage. As each guest arrived, they were handed a small glass containing the fortified liquor. Everyone downed this offering and proceeded to the kitchen where they deposited the beer, wine or spirits which they had brought, as it was a BYOB party. After a short while, LAZAR noted that the party was going along very nicely, but no one was carrying a drink around with them. He noticed that end tables and other places held nearly full glasses and cans of beverage. Also everyone was interacting with others present and no introductions were necessary even though they were strangers. No one was left out of conversations, or discussion groups, or the music jamming that was going on in one of the bedrooms. LAZAR knew very few of the people there and said he never felt more comfortable at a party. People would go up to the hosts and give them big hugs and tell them what a great party it was.
>

> We all need a little recreation from time to time, and the use of a few milligrams of 2CD or similar compounds is certainly less damaging than several ounces of alcohol and much easier on the system also. There is no hangover or dragged out feeling the next morning. At the levels used there was no intoxication as such, just a loosening up and a mellowing out. The possibility of the material, 2CD, being toxic in the doses listed above are very slight as it has been used in Germany in psychotherapy. There it is known as LE-25, at doses of up to 200 mg. No adverse effects were noted at these dosage levels which are more than ten times the amount used in the above accounts. Most of the dosage levels mentioned in LAZAR's work are less than 0.3 part per million based on bodyweight of the individual.

> How do these so called smart pills effect their action? Since these compounds are analogous to neurotransmitters, it is possible that the process is similar to the difference observed when an automotive engine is run on gasoline with a higher octane rating and when it is run on gasoline with a lower octane rating. This is rather simplistic in its approach and there is more than that to the possible answer. In working with these compounds at the lower dosage levels which seem to be optimum for learning it was noted that the amount of internal dialog was greatly reduced. With the internal dialog reduced, the information could be filed in the memory bank of the biocomputer (brain) in a more orderly manner. Thus, without the static that the internal dialog represents, the stored information could be retrieved in a more efficient way since the sorting process would be simplified. This possible mechanism is all right for explaining intellectual activity, but it falls short when applied to the physical/mental coordination area such as music or sports. However, not being able to know how they work, does not detract from the fact that they do work.

There is great need for compounds that increase the capacity for mental work in humans. The complexity of living is increasing all the time and the need to learn more complex things in addition to a greater volume of knowledge the brain must handle, indicates an increasing need for materials and techniques which will somehow make learning easier and of better quality.

When you posted that pic of Mr. Lemaire in the lab I looked into him a bit, and actually did read though his 2C-D reports. Actually, that's what prompted me to post here. I got all excited about it at first but the reports almost seem to good to be true. I'd like to try it sometime, but for right now I decided it isn't worth it for me.

I like this analogy, good one.  It can be a bit forceful at higher dosages but alas, I still have not taken it above 50mg.  It is not as comfortable as 2C-B and 2C-C...so those are the only two I've gone *really* high with.

If the 2C series were golf clubs, then to me, 2C-D would be the putter - it's the one for just a little bit of that phenethylamine goodness, the mildest of trips, museum dosing etc. So I agree with Solipsis, it does seem like forcing it a bit to go to the higher doses.

It's a damn good 'smart drug' in my experience. Actually the most effective one I've used to enhance my study sessions. Like a psychedelic study aid. Fabulous stuff. I go through material 3 to 4 times faster than usual and make strong connections to reinforce what I'm learning about. I don't tolerate things like ritalin or adderal or even coffee too.

ShroomySatori,


What dosage do you use for studying?


I'm preparing a presentation right now, I took ~12mg 2C-D a couple of hours ago. I'm still trying to figure out if it's effective as a study aid, I think it is but it might be placebo. The stimulation is quite pleasurable as well.

I've been taking 10 milligrams, but now I'm uncertain. Because I took 10 milligrams again today, and I'm tripping. I'm having visuals, watching the ceiling swirl right now (just a little bit). I'm actually still studying though, and definitely learning, but the stimulation is absent today. It's probably because I haven't taken my oxycodone since the morning though so normally I'd be pretty dead inside right now, or have taken my second dose of the day. Instead, I feel delightfully wonderful and I'll go a little while longer before making my back pain go away. So like the lethargy of the early stages of opiate withdrawal is counteracted by the stimulating effects of the 2c-d. My normally crippling back pain is irrelevant right now. This is great stuff. I'm sure if I was on my usual dose of opiates, I'd be studying my ass off since I get energy off them. But honestly it's a miracle that I can focus on anything right now, considering I'm not on opiates. 


In any case, I'm going to keep taking doses like these because the effects are great. I've been having deep thoughts too and a generally altered state of awareness. I think it's time to take this one a little further, since these lower doses are so comfy. I might try 20mg next time.


Oh. I forgot that I'm very under slept. Which is why I took it to begin with. It was either that, or a nap... I was ready to pass out. That's why I'm not feeling too quick-witted this time. And with these restless legs going on, it's a miracle that I can get through a couple of pages.

^^^^^talking about sleep


Something I noticed while I was  preparing for a presentation last week was it may be useful as a  sleeping aid, I would take 10-15 milligrams during the day to help me  focus, which I *think* it did (still find it very hard to figure this  one out), a couple of times I would also take a smaller dose later on  during the evening, about 5mg.


 I woke up really well rested the mornings  after taking the 2C-D. The day of the presentation I didn't take anything (except for a single beer afterwards at  home to celebrate) and I woke up groggy and  feeling I needed more sleep.


So while it doesn't help me fall asleep per se, it does feel like it alters the sleeping cycle itself somehow, makes it deeper maybe.


So  as an experiment,  some nights I put a little bit under my tongue  right before going to bed (I dip the tip of my knife in the baggy and  lick that, it's ~3-5mg). Did that last night and I woke up fresh as a  daisy again.

Has anyone ever combined this with LSD or any other lysergamide? Although I still have some 2C-D left, I doubt I'll try it myself anytime soon, but the idea came to mind recently and I'm wondering if more adventurous souls have attempted this before. There's a couple of reports of 2C-B/LSD combos on Erowid which sound like positively powerful experiences, but having never really had a proper 2C-B trip I can't really relate or tell if it would translate at all with 2C-D.

I'm guessing the combo would be good.  LSD + 2C-B is indeed an amazing combo.  I've never taken a full dose of 2C-D, but I don't doubt they would combine well also.

I haven't tried it, but it should combine well. 2C-D lasts so much shorter than LSD, I'd recommend taking it a good way into the LSD trip, maybe 2 hours in, similar to a candyflip. I imagine this combo would be sort of like a mild, trippier, candyflip, and should be a lot kinder on your body that an MDMA combo.


Something like a tab of acid, and then 2 hours in 25mg or so of 2C-D seems about right for a first try at this.

When I combined LSD and 2C-B, I let the LSD establish itself first, and then took the 2C-B.  I think I took it at least 3 hours into the LSD.  I found the LSD by itself to be weak, but once I added the 2C-B it became wonderfully psychedelic and I had a pretty awesome inward journey listening to music with my eyes closed.

perpetualdawn: those doses/timing sound about right! 2C-D is very slow to kick in for me so two hours in should be good. I agree that it should be a lot gentler than a candyflip! At least 2C-D doesn't make you crash - it just quietly fades away.


I'll chime in again if I ever end up trying this!

^Its true, there is no comedown from 2C-D. I've yet to experience much of an afterglow though, either.


It just sits perfectly with dissociatives IMO. I've had a small line of 2CD and 3MEOPCP today just to add sparkle. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Fuck I love 2c-d. On its own its like a semi psychedelic upper I can take in public and be good to dive 3-5 hours later (20mg oral doses)


Push it to like 50mg plugged and its a different beast entirely.


Combines super well with 4 sub trips and dissos. Great for taking on the tail end of longer lasting psychedelics after the main effects have worn off, but you are still stimulated.


One of the only pschedelics I turned around and bought more of immediatly even though I had a good size bit left.

Is it true that it creates full-on audio distortions at high doses? As in comparable to DiPT? That's what someone in the EU forum told me.

That's a nice question and I don't know. But it seems possible considering high doses can apparently produce pretty full-on psychedelia. You wouldn't really say that from lower dosages IMO but hey, I can't think of a psychedelic that couldn't go hardcore if you just take enough (the safety concerns aside).


By the way I have gotten audio distortions from 2C-B, too.

I do not recall combining 2c-d with DPT, but I have combined 2c-b with DPT and that was quite nice. 


From personal experience, 40-50mg plugged 2c-d is venturing into high dose territory. Maybe 70+mg oral.

Have not taken 70mg oral, just guestimating from my lower 20-30mg oral doses and my 40-50mg plugged doses the equivalancy.


I've tripped so many times it's hard to remember which is which unless I look at my notes, but I don't really think 5-10mg is the difference between life or death, it's not like 2c-e where 12mg you are good and 15 you want to die. The fuller 2c-d doses did seem to come at the price of being a bit more stimulating, especially on the comedown. It does go from being "tofu"(excellent combo mixer) to "oh fuck this is it's own thing" at higher doses. Still fairly benign and non threatening though.

I stopped researching @ 60 mg because the side effects (heavy bodyload, cold freezy feeling, muscle tension, sweating) rose pretty quickly above 50 mg and it was not worth it.

The most I've taken was 40-45mg, which didn't seem a lot stronger than 30mg. My guess is that it continues to have a pretty shallow dose curve as you go above that. Thanks for your info Nitemares M3MORI3S and yepyepwoah.


2C-D is a great low intensity psychedelic/entactogen

**2C-D 20mg IM**


Not worth a full trip report, so just a few observations. 

I've IMed tryptamines in the past and am well versed in IM ketamine and some MXE.

This was the first time I've IMed a phenethylamine.

So, 20mg 2C-D injected into right buttock. As you would expect, comeup was very quick, and a touch confusing. From zero to plateau in perhaps 20 minutes. It took until about 45 minutes to really get to grips with the ride, prior to that my mind was racing too fast to really cope with what was going on.

At no time was this in any way scary or raise anxiety; it was just accepted. For the next hour or so it was enjoyable as the trip stabilised, pretty standard 2C-D trip, probably equivalent of around 40mg plugged (I've never taken it orally), but the speed of onset made it feel stronger.


The main downside was pain in the muscle of the injection site. This really detracted from the experience and I found myself constantly having to stretch my legs and adjust position in order to alleviate it. By about 2 hours 15 I was pretty much down. The pain in the muscle subsided a couple of hours later.


Really this was an experiment to see how much extra effect IM 2C-D would provide and how long it would last. I would not repeat the experiment as the muscle pain was too intense to allow much enjoyment.

Good info, thanks for sharing. Seems safe to say IM is worth skipping.

Mods - if you get the chance it would be great if this ended up in the 2C-D thread for posterity. (and posteriors)

Merged into the Big and Dandy.  Thanks for sharing Whitefox.  I can imagine the 2Cs might hurt a lot in the muscle since they're pretty much the most painful things I've ever come across to snort.

I took some 20mg 2C-D for a club night the other night. That drug is always really perfect for clubbing for me (along with a beer or two and tons of water) - it's so transparent, almost feels like I'm not on anything at all, yet I find so much attention for the amazing music, and energy to just keep dancing and dancing, and pro-social. Even after less than 4h of sleep the next day and week there's no hangover at all. I find it to be like MDMA in terms of partying, but without the extreme love part, just the good vibes part and party mode - and no wreckage after - I reckon you could take this pretty regularly without much negative side effects.


I took it after completing some *very* strenuous exercise that morning, about 3h of running in a trail race half marathon through deep snow on mountain trails. I wasn't sure I'd be able to go out after all that, yet I still had the energy to have a night of my life and dance with lots of energy to the amazing music that night. 


It did help that the music was utterly fantastic, right up my alley. It's amazing how good music can help you dig into the depths of your physical energy and just keep going (especially when potentiated with a pinch of psychedelic).

Tried 2C-D for the first time yesterday and it was awesome! The only other 2C-x I've tried is 2C-B which I've used extensively and really enjoyed. It had been about a year since my last psychedelic which was 4-Aco-DMT.


After 1mg allergy test took 5mg 2 hrs at T+0:00, then 17mg @ T+2:45, then 14mg @T+3:45 and finally 7mg more @T+4:05. All doses were oral


Perhaps it was placebo or afterglow from 19mg 3-MeO-PCE the night before but the 1mg seemed to have an alertness and a bit of a gustatory enhancement, chicken pho soup was mind-blowingly good. Decided to go for an assay of the purported "smart drug" effect. Reading out loud to my fiancee seemed much more fluid than normal but aside from that I didn't notice cognitive enhancement, but residual -PCE was certainly attenuating my baseline cognition. It was actually very relaxing and I napped for ~10 min at one point.


I wasn't initially planning to trip but she wanted to and once I saw she was having fun I got fomo and decided to take 17mg to start. 'Psychedelic tofu' definitely resonated with me for most of the experience, olfactory senses were much enhanced, music was good, and vision had more contrast but no breakage of the visual field until the last couple doses started taking effect and an undulatory effect was noticed in the peripheral and especially in the curtains. The strongest effects of the whole night only lasted 30min but they were very enjoyable, very pleasant buzz in the body. At one point, my fiancee left the room and I closed my eyes and focused on the music and felt myself being absorbed into it. When she came back I opened my eyes and at first she was spatially compressed in the up-down direction, almost like a gnome or such but returned to normal quickly.


I felt a lot of love and positivity throughout towards my fiancee which was great, we agreed that it was the best time we've had tripping concurrently - but this may have something to do with us being more comfortable and committed towards each other than ever before. The best part was when we went outside and walked down the street to catch the sunset that left us in awe, can't remember the last time I enjoyed a sunset so much and will definitely plan my next peak around it. Walking past people felt a bit odd but bearable, a dog in a passing cars bark was very jarring but no big deal. Came back in and watched Sunny, noticing a strange effect that when we placed a finger in the foreground of the TV it would become transparent after about 5 second and we could see through it.


Overall, the experience seemed very manageable although of course my dose was not so high. I am glad I built up the doses to get comfortable with the compound but next time I will go for one solid dose as I enjoyed the experience much more when the final dose kicked in and the cumulative effects reached their pinnacle. Perhaps 35-40mg. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Having taken this a few more times at varying doses I thought I'd add my anecdotes. Once I ate 7mg to test the nootropic effect, the results were inconclusive.


The next time I took 30mg and went for a hike alone which was great fun. It wasn't too visual at this dose which was probably a good thing. One thing that stood out was how transparent it felt on my body. At this level it was very clear-headed and I felt very confident climbing up outcroppings of rock despite the altitude, although my coordination was just a little impaired. There was just hints of psychedelia at the peak to go along with an extremely serene and refreshing headspace.


3 days later (yesterday) I took 45mg and went for a hike with my lady friend. Noticeably more visual, in terms of color saturation and how the proportions of my environment as a whole were altered. There still wasn't much geometry at this level. The headspace and my body did feel a good deal heavier, at least until the plateau I wasn't sure I would be confident hiking at this level by myself and there was a lot more analytical thought-patterning than with the 30mg dose. Once I hit the plateau it was wonderful and confidence overtook me, I was acting silly and felt so much love for my partner and was able to express it in wonderful ways. This experience was really great for my relationship but also made me want to improve myself in other ways, such as how I carry and express myself.


Overall, 2C-D seems like a great compound so far. It really is short, although not fully developed until 90-120 minutes, at 30mg I was almost totally down by the third hour. With 45mg the salient effects were extended 1-2 hours longer. 30-40mg with this stuff seems like it would be the perfect range for a hiking excursion. Hiking these past two trips has been the perfect activity for me, so grounding and really gets me into the moment, can't wait to try it with some other compounds. I'm going to try it with my 2C-C next, here in a week or two.

I loved this stuff. I would take 10-15mg doses and go to concerts and such. It was just slightly trippy, cognitive "enhancements" but not overwhelming and over quickly enough I could drive home safe(ish). Took a few doses and some mxe at Warped Tour a few years ago. Circle pitting in 100 degree weather tripping was nuts. Good thing I had a camelback of water. lol.


I combined this rectally with 4 ho met and mxe a few times before. It was the most sublime, non threatening, pleasant trips I've ever had. Just meditating for a while, then laying in bed listing to music just grinning. Passed out. Woke up feeling so good I dosed again, started smoking weed and spent pretty much two days just tripping. So peaceful.


If you take it over 50mg (esp plugged or IM) it really can become a bit serious. Overall it was tied with 2c-c as my favorite. 


Too bad I just flushed about 2 grams, and will probably never see it again. Oh well, theres always the cow field a few miles down the road ;-)


Also, ecstasylovers post reminds me I went hiking in Arkansas a few years back. I remember having 2c-d, o pce, 3 meo pcp, and maybe one other tryptamine. Maybe 4 aco met. Remember mixing them all over three days. 2c-d is a great hiking drug. Better than 2c-b or 2c-c IMO because it is so clear headed yet visually/cognitive enhancing. I just remember climbing up the side of a valley thing where there was a waterfall and watching all these people play around and feeling absolute fucking peace. I was also climbing some sketchy like 70 degree incline shit like a fucking nimble cat with no worries.  For hiking 2c-d is tops, maybe followed by doc, escaline, other 2c-x, lsd (lower dose, i get lost at higher dose), mmmm pyschedelic hiking.

I've probably gushed all over this thread about how much I love 2C-D already, but wanted to chime in re: the nootropic story.


I think the supposed "nootropic" effects of 2C-D is a red herring. It can be very useful as a microdosing type of drug, but I doubt it improves memory or focus in the kind of ways that people hope for with a true nootropic. Rather it's good in the way that a lot of psychedelics are at low doses - breaking from engrained patterns of thinking, creative boost, fresh perspective, enhancement of meaningful-ness.


Also agreed that it's a great hiking psychedelic!

I tried this at about 35mg last weekend.  I was surprised by how strong it was for me.  Physically I just had a faint warm glow (it was quite nice feeling, no bodyload whatsoever), but mentally I was very high.  However there was no stress/anxiety associated with it at all.  My mind was going on powerful tangents.  I was hanging out with friends on my birthday at my friend's house, and I'd get really lost in abstract thought but then someone would say something to me and I'd be able to answer just fine.  There were no visuals per se, but sort of like how with 2C-E, the sensory experience gets all tied in with the mental experience, I would find myself absorbed in something and then when I'd get brought back to the present, my sight would seem to come back over the course of seconds and I would have no visuals, yet moments before I was seeing something else, not an alteration of what my eyes were seeing but something in my mind's eye that overtook my sight perception in my mind.  Actually it reminded me of 2C-E quite a lot, except with 2C-E it's all far more intense, with periods of anxiety and pretty much constant social discomfort until after the peak, intense visuals, and an inescapable nature to it along with a strong body presence.  2C-D reminded me of 2C-E lite, with none of the negatives and a less intense positive and a lighter grade psychedelia.  But it resembled the state of mind of 2C-E far more than it did any of the halogenated 2C-Xs.  Which makes sense as it is one tiny step away from 2C-E.  2C-D is golden, I will probably get more while it's still possible to do so, especially since the dose is higher than other 2C-Xs and I only have a half gram.


I'm excited to try this at 50 or 60mg next.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I'm also excited to try 2C-P for further comparisons of non-halogenated 2C-Xs.

Nice report Shadowmeister! I keep meaning to take 2C-D up to higher doses, but I think 30mg is my max so far. I would love to hear what you think of it at 50 or 60mg. I agree that it's very similar to a 2C-E lite. I find that 2C-P is also of this ilk as well. It also feels lighter than 2C-E, but it could just be because I've always dosed 2C-P very moderately.

Yeah the general consensus seems to be that 2C-P is less heavy than 2C-E and more euphoric.  I'm very much looking forward to trying it, I think probably one of my next hiking days.  I have a music festival coming up but my band is headlining it and I'm helping run things so I'm going to stick to LSD or more likely, DOC or AMT, as these are well-known to me.


I hope to write a proper report on my next 2C-D experience.  I didn't take any notes or anything on my 35mg report (estimated dose anyway - I weighed out 50mg and then took what I guessed to be about 35mg of that), so I don't think there's enough detail to write a report.  I don't know though, maybe I could recall enough.


Another thing was that 2C-D was great for music enhancement, both playing and listening.

I just realized that my trip last weekend was actually 50mg after all... I took 35mg at first and then I forgot that I took the rest about an hour in.  I remembered because I was looking for the rest of the 50mg so I could put it back in my stash and when I couldn't find it, I remembered I had taken it.

Lol. Yeah I'm not surprised that was 50mg you described there, because it more intense than how I recall my 30mg trip, more so than I would expect from a 5mg jump, and also considering you seem to typically dose higher than me.


I've always been hesitant to push the dosage on 2C-P because it lasts so long. Not sure I'd be up for 18hrs of balls to the wall tripping!

I must disagree. I took 2C-D once after ten beers, and I felt alert in a way that I didn't think possible. It wasn't like taking normal uppers while drunk, where you suddenly feel sober-ish but then go out to fuck up in novel ways at demanding tasks. There must be something there, I don't know any substance that comes closer to completely cancelling out alcohol.

^ Maybe. I do find 2C-D combines marvelously with a beer or two and I don't find myself becoming too idiotic or anything.

Nice report Shadowmeister! It's one of my favourites, glad you're finding its charms. I agree that the psychedelic tofu label (and nootropic label) really threw people off on 2C-D. I think the community as a whole has really overlooked 2C-D. It's top notch, definitely in my personal list of essential psychedelics.

I don't think the "tofu" label is accurate either. From what I've read, I think a lot of people who have tried 2C-D feel the same way.

Since 2C-D is getting pretty rare i'm thinking of stocking up for the novelty before it's gone. The price per (serious, as in higher dosage) trip doesn't really seem worth it. But i've read about the combo 4-FA + 2C-D. Normal dose 4F with about 20-30mg of 2C-D. There should be no psychedelic effects but euphoria should be increased.


Since 4F is my favourite stim out there I was wondering if anyone has tried this?

How's this for a 2C-D elevator pitch:


"It's in the same family as Mescaline and MDMA, but milder and shorter acting than either, lasts about 3-5h. It's energizing and slightly trippy, and amplifies a good time."


Almost everyone has tried mushrooms, so relative to mushrooms:


"It lasts about as long as mushrooms, but less intense, more energizing, more social, and a bit dreamy."


I always have a hard time describing it to novices.

Combination with 4-sub tryptamines is also fantastic, I would go as far as to even recommend it, more than the sum of its parts.

Fantastic report!   Sounds like you had an amazing time.  I need to revisit 2C-D.  I have yet to try a full dosage, though I did do 25mg with a 15mg booster once, and 25mg once, too.   Enjoyed it quite a bit, especially the higher dose, but it seemed to not be quite high enough for full effects.

I've found it best suited for recreational use. It goes really good with a beer, and this is from someone who is a bit puritanical about not mixing booze with psychedelics. I really like about 20-25mg for a club night, 10-15mg for sitting down with hommies over a pint. It's pretty short acting, 3-4h it's done, so it's good for smaller nights, not an epic trip or deep voyage at all. Lightly psychedelic, mildly stimulating, turn-upper, good times maker. A gem!

Great report!  Sounds like you had a great experience from 33mg.  Personally I find 2C-D quite nice, too, at 50mg I had a pretty strong experience that reminded me in some ways of 2C-E, but much less aggressive and much lighter/less psychedelic.  I think it's probably time to revisit 2C-D sometime soon.

I very much liked 2c-d, always had a little too less of this material and what I always thought of was that the duration is a little too short. A great idea by fastandbulbous was to add it to some ion exchange material that would deliver it over a longer period of time than usual aka make it chemically into an extended release 2c-d. Just wanted to pass on his idea that he posted here to anyone that has 2c-d at hand.

Another option is just to take a small dose of 2C-E instead! Not quite the same, but in the same arena at low doses.

I didn't realize it was still available anywhere.  But 7eah all the 2C-Xs are pretty expensive, and have been for some time.  I miss the early days when they were super cheap and everywhere, they were the main RCs available

2c-e can just about still be found. The last pressed pills are being sold.

2c-d, don't have to look hard to find it. When you look at the price per pressed pill of 25mg forget it imo.

2c-c at 30mg even more expensive than 2c-d

Boh-2c-b quite cheap but you need a lot of it

I also don't care for BOHB, I find it very different from a 2C-X.


Ugh, I hate pressed pills, wish the days of grams of powder 2C-Xs weren't over.  maybe there will be a resurgence one day.  Fortunately I have a supply of various ones.

Yeah the 2cs were almost the only rcs widely available along with some tryptamines when I first looked for them in the early 2000s. Now you can find 2c-e and 2cb-fly and that’s almost it, the nbomes have also vanished after a short period of time when they were available.

Weird, I’ve ONLY seen powder available. But usually with a 1g minimum quantity at quite a steep price in comparison to what 2C-B powder usually goes for.

I haven't seen pressed pills or powder in a while.  I was just saying I hate pressed pills when it comes to RCs.   The dark web probably has some, but I am not sure if anyone is still making it, versus they had a stock of it from before the last place that made it disappeared.  I dunno, could be someone is, I'm just speculating.

Those 2C-C pellets sucked so bad, I ate 2.5 of them without good effects, still felt like a watered down version of 2C-B. 


The 2C-E pills are also unreliable, had three of them lab-tested and they contained 8.9mg, 9.2mg and 13.4mg 2C-E, respectiively, but were advertised as 15mg.


Luckily I bought some of their 2C-D powder when they still had it, but it’s coming to an end. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Those shitty, overpriced pills really make me mad.

Go for it man. Per dose and in the grand scheme of things that kind of money is nothing. Quite a few doses and it will last ages ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) it's quite a good drug and worthwhile.


Not entirely harm reduction oriented, but the potential psychological blow years from now where you have to conclude that 2C-D is just gone and you've never been able to try it could be tough ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yeah, all of the 2C-Xs have been quite a bit more expensive than 2C-B by the gram, for years and years, even when they were readily available on the clear net.  Well worth it though.  I very much wish I had stocked up on 2C-C when I had the chance.  I only have maybe 5 doses left of it and it's one of my favorites.

The thing I don't understand is they are allowed to sell the 2c-xx legally in Holland.

The 1cp-lsd is made there afaik.


Why the fluffing fluf don't they make the 2c-xx there? Does the problem lie with sourcing the precursors or what? 

I don't have a clue when it comes to that.


There's money to be made obviously.

There used to be -C, -D and -E there, powder, for reasonable prices even, 2-3 years ago. Then 2C-E slowly went away. Then they all stopped, don't know why.

They will though. People like us won't but a lot of people will just let it go. My opinion's got nothing to do with how good of a drug it is, it's just the case that it's easier to sell a legal drug than an illegal one.

One of the largest retailers of the main Dutch producers recently told me that they are planning to bring another batch of 2C-x chemicals on the market before the blanket ban comes into effect (they didn‘t specify which one though). So hopefully they actually follow through with that. I‘d also love me some 6-MAPB…

I'll be very happy if this ends up happening. A large vendor did seem to be considering producing 2C-E. I know that 2C-B-FLY pellets are still available, but those aren't nearly as appealing as the other 2C compounds given how prolific standard 2C-B is.

No shortage of people doing synthesis on that and getting stuff needed for the synthesis sometimes from hardware stores.


The shops have to report people to the police when they buy x product in quantity.


Speed in quantity is mega cheap too.

Oh man this is fantastic news!  I'm hoping they include 2C-E and 2C-C in this, particularly.  I'd also love to see 2C-I again, that one is so unique and fun.  And 2C-T-2.


I also wonder at there not being more 2C-T-7 around... for years, the immediate precursor was being sold openly on the clearnet.

2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and 2C-I are scheduled in NL, just like 2C-B. The others would certainly be possible though. I am also hoping for 2C-P, 2C-T-21 and perhaps a new 2C-X to pop up.

Wow, I hated 2c-p, too much bodyload and the trip was also too intense. When it comes to a solid 2c trip I’m satisfied with 2c-e…

I find 2C-E much more mentally intense/challenging, and confronting than 2C-P, which is more easygoing but similar in nature.  That said, I have yet to take what I believe is a full dose of 2C-P, only lighter doses, but compared to equivalent strength of 2C-E doses, the 2C-E is more challenging, yet also more rewarding.  I thought 2C-P had a quite pleasant body feeling, myself.

I feel the same about 2C-P as [@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/), and also like him I may just not have taken a full dose - it's pretty daunting to go hard on a 18+hr psychedelic, so I've usually kept it pretty light and fun.


edit: I want to add, looking at the 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-P series, I enjoy comparing. This is probably something I've posted before, but oh well:


- Obviously there is an increase in duration as you progress up the chain. 2C-D is short, 2C-E medium, 2C-P very long.
- I believe the potency per mg increases as well - 2C-E is definitely more potent/mg than 2C-D, and I would say that 2C-P is also more potent/mg than 2C-E.
- Then in terms of qualitative effects, I find 2C-E to be a bit of a pinnacle in terms of sharpness and psychedelia. To me, there is a bit of a local maxima on that axis when you look at 2C-E. When you go on either side (2C-D, 2C-P) you get something that is a bit softer and more mellow, maybe more fun and less edge.
That's my story anyways, subject to change, YMMV, and very definitely not to be seen as authoritative.

I would love to see any of the 2cx pop up. They're my favorite class of drugs I think. I recently saw 2C-D and was happy to see it. 2C-B is all I've seen available for some years now.

2C-I and 2C-T-2 are ones I really, really hope that I get the chance to try again. I never had another psychedelic like 2C-I. The visuals were insane and the trips were always fun. 2C-T-2 is one that I'd go to any lengths to get. I only tried it 3 times years ago, but it still remains my favorite. 2C-T-2 is a truly special compound. I must try it again before I die.

I agree about 2C-T-2.  It is absolutely special, and really helped me with some self-analysis of my personality that helped kick me out of a depressive slump that was very persistent.  Every trip I have had on it has been enjoyable and insightful, and leaves me with a feeling of peace and comfort that I treasure.  I have a few doses still, but haven't used it in a long time.


2C-I is indeed very unique, I have never experienced anything truly profound or deep on it, but the visuals are extremely unique with some effects I have not seen the like of from anything else, and it has a certain dissociative aspect to its body feeling that is super interesting.  And one time (I guess this was pretty profound, come to think of it), I saw, in my mind's eye, what I interpreted as spirits residing in my apartment I lived in at the time, while I was late-night tripping by myself.  The next day I mentioned it to my then-girlfriend, who has always been sensitive to spirits her whole life with many interesting and sometimes frightening experiences, and without any hints from me other than me saying I thought I saw ghosts the night before, she described the exact same spirits, down to the age I guessed them to be (one was a young boy and the other was a stern but protective middle aged man who seemed to be the boy's father), and said she had met them shortly after we moved in.  I was still tripping somewhat and my girlfriend, who had never tripped and didn't know I was tripping, was telling me she felt weird and saw the carpet moving in the same way I was currently seeing it.  Then I called to the boy to come out and hang out with us and that he didn't need to be scared (he seemed very shy), and right after that, the cats looked up suddenly and started running around a spot that seemed to shimmer and was moving towards us, as if they were rubbing on someone's legs as they were walking over.  And then there was an audible *thump* that we both felt and heard, as if someone sat down next to us.  So... that was pretty cool, and I don't really know how else to explain it other than 2C-I tuned me to the spirit realm.


Besides that, it's quite euphoric and fun.  I'd like to see it again, too.

I used to have my 2c-c as white powder before this (and although its been awhile so memory might play tricks), this feels equally strong. Might depend on what you expect though, you're generally not gonna feel "smashed" or stimulated using this, pretty sedated even.

I agree, mindset and setting definitely play a role here and I don't doubt that but I had quite a lot of their products lab-tested and the results were always a bit of a mixed bag. Their powders seemed to be fine for the most part, but their pre-dosed products always seemed weak to me (eg. 2C-C pellets, DOC blotters, 25E-NBOH blotters) and my friends had similar reactions. Now, I don't have any quantitative lab-results to back that up and these might as well all just be trip variations but I do see a pattern here and there's a good chance that you had an idiosyncratic reaction to their product as well. There are two recent Saferparty.ch lab-results for similar looking [2C-C](https://www.saferparty.ch/warnungen/kein-logo-2c-c-syntheseverunreinigungen-220920) and [2C-D](https://www.saferparty.ch/warnungen/kein-logo-2c-d-syntheseverunreinigungen-220920) pellets and they both contain at least one impurity in an appreciable quantity alongside the expected substance. How strong they are, still remains a mystery.

Funnily, I'd say DOM is the most 'deep and meaningful' of the alpha methyl series. DOET seemed more lightweight, although I've never had DOPR. 2C-EF is the most fun I've had (turned me into a dancing fool!). Bet DOEF is lots of fun.

DOPr is incredible, one of the best trips I've ever had.  Deep, zero bodyload, euphoric, and it had a really unique and profound shared mental space aspect where my tripping partner and I had a ton of wordless communication that was beyond what I typically experience on psychedelics.  I have never been able to get a satisfying trip from DOM, even at 7.5mg (I have notes on a 10mg trip too but I had a lot of tolerance at the time).  It doesn't seem to click with me,  I have had DOET at 3.5mg and it was weird, very heavy bodyload, and I was tripping, hard, but I couldn't really say how or why, because there were no visuals or interesting thoughts.  DOiP is also weird, kinda similar to DOET, actually... heavy bodyload, absence of "traditional" psychedelic characteristics.  DOF also has an absence of visuals, but is very light, pleasant, and very little bodyload... a nice one, not for heavy trips, or anything profound, sort of like how 4C-D is, its nature is to be light and easygoing.


DOC is always amazing for me, deep, psychedelic, social, easygoing.  How do you rate DOC (and DOB and DOI, if you've tried them)?

Dom I found to be too hard, even at around 1mg. Doc was really nice, one of the best. Doi was also good, a little less good than doc. And tma-2 was the strangest Amphetamine I ever took, it was awesome. Tma-6 on the other hand was way more plain, not anywhere as intense as tma-2.

DOET will be the next one I’ll try, really looking forward to my one and only 5mg dose. DOIP I really enjoyed the one time I’ve taken it, granted it was only 8mg. A physical but warm and euphoric compound, felt almost entactogenic at times. If DOET is any similar I’ll gladly take it. DOPR I will most likely sample next year, the duration is a bit daunting but the effects sound very worthwhile.

A handful of years ago, maybe 4 years?  Maybe 3?  I can't remember exactly when.


Nope haven't tried the T-4 yet.  I am likely going to pre-load with 20mg of MXE, that never fails to massively potentiate psychedelics for me, without doing much to color the experience.  Given I have one dose in alcohol, and it's an underdose orally, I think that's my game plan.  Either that or evaporate the alcohol and plug it.  But then I run the risk of possibly having an unwanted "guest" of the brown variety waste the dose.

DOET is kinda like DOiP (for me anyway) in that I found both to lack any signature qualities of psychedelics (visuals, trippy thoughts), but also found both to definitely be psychedelic in some way I find difficult to describe.  However, DOiP felt euphoric (though edgy and a bit anxiogenic also) and it felt good in my body, whereas DOET, at 3.5mg anyway, was not euphoric at all, and felt edgy, but not particularly good.  However, it's possibly it was an underdose... it's also possible I just don't react well to it.  I only had the one trial so far, and though I have a few more doses, I haven't been quick to try it again due to the long duration and difficult effects (not like I had anything even approaching a bad trip, it was just kind of unpleasant, for a long time).


I don't want to put you off it though, I'm super interested to see what you think of it.  I haven't seen more than a few reports and that includes the few tidbits in PIHKAL, but I swear I saw someone on here say it was great, once.


DOPR is well worth the duration, rarely have I had such an enjoyable trip, it had it all, in spades.

Any pellets will have filler... there's likely 300mg of filler in your pellets, and 30mg 2C-C. Filler is always needed to keep the pill shape and for stability.

Yes of course, I know.


But in this post ( [https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/th...lease-insert-second-disc.652829/post-15645799](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/the-big-dandy-2c-d-thread-please-insert-second-disc.652829/post-15645799) ) there is a link to tested 2C-C pellets and they are weighed at 180mg so im still doubtful. I can imagine that with well-known vendors there will be some consistency as to the appearance and weight of their pellets. Some variation would be normal too, but 150mg seems bit of a stretch.

Can someone remind me why Shulgin named it 2C-D instead of 2C-M (for methyl)?

In his lab book Shulgin succinctly wrote:


"The 2-carbon analog of DOM"


Which I guess implies the name comes from** 2C-D**(OM)

Yeah the whole 2C-D and DOM nomenclature were a curveball. There's no 2C-M afaik so kinda confused as the why he used D.

Honestly, a lot of his nomenclature is arbitrary/ all over the place. For example, why name DOT (Thio) ALEPH instead of keeping it in the DOx family? Then ALEPH -2, 3, 4 etc could have been numbered DOTs, to highlight the similarity to 2C-Tx.


I am re-reading PiKHAL with this in mind, and also piecing together the chronology of his creations.


Since TMA-2 was a winner, I asked myself was there a 2C version. Sure is - it's called TMPEA for trimethoxy phenethylamine. Mescaline could actually have that exact name (but with methoxys at 3,4,5).  Personally, I like the name 2C-TMA-2, but that's because I'm 2C "centric" having only tried them out of all the PEAs.


Forgive me for straying off topic. I might have to search for or start a new thread of Shulgin / PiHKAL review / naming conventions

See but the A in TMA stands for amphetamine which TMPEA is not. 2C-MeO sounds reasonable to me tho.


I don't even like TMPEA, because mescaline would fit that criteria as well, but I think about this stuff way too hard.

Or simply 2C-O(-1), considering there‘s a whole 2C-O-x series and it would be analogous to the 2C-T-x naming conventions.

It's interesting that TMPEA (I'm gonna call it 2C-O though because that makes more sense, considering he made the isopropoxy and named it 2C-O-4, and TMA-4 and 2C-T-4 are the isopropyls)is so impotent... experiments up to 300mg were done with little to no results.  Most (not all) of the 2C-Xs are quite a lot less potent than their DOX counterparts, but it seems like an extreme variance.  Then again, maybe not, as DOB is probably a good 20 times more potent than 2C-B, so perhaps 500mg is the correct dosage?  Which would make it extremely cost inefficient... but my mouth waters at the opportunity to try that experiment.


Interestingly, 2C-G is about the same potency as DOG (which he called GANESHA, I suppose DOG is a silly name  ![:doggo:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/data/assets/smilies/8E9150CC-87F3-4717-B2BA-F9AFBB87E872.gif) ).  Then again, the 2C-G series is very unusual in structure among the 2C-Xs.

TMA-4 is 2,3,5-Trimethoxy, no isoproxy there but I get what you're saying.


Also haha DO-G. I guess he had his reasons, some we'll never understand.


Anyway back to 2C-D. I absolutely love it but at pretty high dose. +50mg its rainbow land with a clear headspace and I'm out within 5 hours.

If I were to try a new-to-me 2c, I would want to try 2cd. The idea/structure of it seems to appeal to me or something.  I've had a sample of 2cp for many years but have never been brave enough.

2C-P is great, it's long but it's way easier to handle than say 2C-E if you dose reasonably. It's not about bravery, would definitely recommend trying it sometime

Took 20mg for a club night the other night and man it really is an anti-hangover drug. Dosed at about 11:30 pm, club didn't really get rolling until 12:30. Danced my ass off until 3am. Such a transparent drug, definitely not overtly psychedelic - especially at that dose - but just perfect for enhancing the vibes and well staying awake. Back home and in bed by 4am and then had to get up at 7am for some obligations.


I'm not going to say it was easy to drag myself out of bed after only 3hrs of sleep at my age, but with the help of 3 or 4 coffees (kind of normal intake for me) the day went much easier than if I hadn't taken anything at all the night before. I've noticed this kind of effect from other psychedelics, I don't think it's unique to 2C-D, just that 2C-D is also a really short acting one, so it fits in really easily with a club night and carrying on with obligations the next day.

Does someone know if Hanscarl Leuner ever actually wrote about his use of 2C-D (i.e. LE-25) in research? I'm incapable of finding anything of interest. Trying to uncover some psychedelic history for myself.

The book mentioned in the thread - i.e. Gateway to the Inner Space by Rätsch - does not give much further details about 2C-D (named LE-25 in the context of this research). It just references coarsely a lecture by Michael Schlichting about the trials with LE-25 who is also an author at Nachtschatten Verlag and is still alive in Switzerland ([https://nachtschatten.ch/autoren/schlichting/](https://nachtschatten.ch/autoren/schlichting/)). I had hoped for finding the original 150 mg trip report referenced in PiHKAL. Maybe continue some more digging later.

(with 18 mg) A bit more than I bargained for, most of the experience spent within public transport. I never realised those seats were as terrible, my back hurt a lot! Closed eye imagery of beakers and liquids swirling, a powder tumbling around in a rotovap. When walking through the autumn night, leaves falling gently down with closed eyes. Increased appreciation for music. Gentle, warm bodyload. No nausea, no tension. Psychosomatic troubles with fingers linked to traumatic 25E-NBOH experience noticed in the beginning of psychedelic effects and met with some uneasyness, but eventually left me. Terrible results in Duolingo, no nootropic effects (should they exist) at that dosage. Shulgin rating scale ++, probably equivalent to 10 - 13 mg 2C-B in intensity, but remarkably different. I think I like it. In and out rather quick, from intake to baseline again, not more than 3 h. Could become another trusted ally next to 2C-B. Will continue experimentation in 25 - 35 mg range.

I had 20 mg today.  This was my best 2C-D experience so far, including my younger days when I took up to 50 mg (once).


As far as negative body symptoms, I had a bit of tummy/gut tension / awareness, and for a bit at T+1.5 I had some significant jaw clench/chatter.  It also seemed to have a stimulating push but the feeling also seemed smooth and transparent, if that makes sense.


After sipping over 10 minutes, effects built up gradually, peaking around T+2.  Effects were starting to drop off at T+3 and dropped off significantly by T+4 and then lingered until T+6 with subtle persisting after-effects.  No headache!  Maybe tomorrow?  I do often get headaches after most psychedelic experiences.


I noticed a lot of visual activity, but it was rather inspecific and jumbled. There was some mild color enhancement but only noticeable with colors that were highly saturated to begin with.  I noticed a lot of "popping" of textures as well as textural after-images.  I also seemed to hallucinate textures that weren't there, and there were times in which I was a bit visually confused.  All this was with eyes open.  With eyes closed, there was pretty much nothing unfortunately.


I spent most of the experience listening to a compilation of classical music.  I was totally absorbed.  I didn't feel as much emotional connection as I do with most other psychedelics, but I felt a strong connection to the technical aspects, the nuances in rhythm and harmony, both as written and as performed.  The virtuosity I perceived in the performances was exhilarating.  Among the standouts were recordings of operatic soprano.  In these, I did feel intensely emotional but not so much in response to the music but because I heard and (acoustically) felt the singer convey that emotion to me with great intensity.


I went for a walk between T+3 to T+4, which was a wonderful diversion.  I felt very peaceful in a way much more like the trips I used to have when I was younger.  I'm hopeful I will encounter this feeling more often in my future trips.  At first, the sun was so bright that it completely blinded me to look in its direction, yet seeing glimpses of it made me feel heavenly.  I put on my sun glasses while walking into the sun and enjoyed the light and the feeling of air moving over my body.  While the visuals were mild, everything I saw looked somehow fascinating and inspiring.   At one point after my eyes had scanned across the solar disk (with sunglasses), I got an after-image of the disk with detailed "flame" forms.


Outside, I also noticed that my hearing seemed very muted but crystal clear and detailed.  I speculated that the muting effect was due to a significant adrenergic action, given what I've heard about people under extreme stress (like in war), but any adrenergic anxiety was completely tempered by psychedelic calm.  I also noticed that there was essentially no background noise in my hearing at all.


When I returned home, I put the music back on.  While listening to some rag time, I felt I could really get deep into the rhythmic nuances.  Later on I switched to some lively Cuban big band jazz which fit the mood perfectly, and it felt very good to move my body around while I made dinner.


All-in-all, I had a great time, and while I can't say this is my favorite, it is interesting and unique.  It may be the most mentally lucid psychedelic I've tried.  It makes me feel mentally *sharp*.  I am more curious about DOM now, though I'm not sure how much it resembles 2C-D or how much stronger the stimulation is.


I disagree with those who think it's similar to 2C-E.  I find 2C-E to be much dreamier and to be a very emotionally rich drug, whereas 2C-D seems very alert and cognitively oriented, to the point where emotionality mostly takes a back seat to the cognitive experience.  Today's 2C-D experience felt quite casual.  I don't anticipate having to do much if any post-trip integration.  In contrast, even my recent 5 mg 2C-E experience (which was probably less visual than this 2C-D experience) was *not* casual at all.

i had a rather low dose experience with 2c-d which was quite enriching and lighthearted, no hard tripping that i had with 10mgs of say 2c-e which i find a not that easy going psychedelic but quite useful and insightful all in all. 2c-d was more of a fun experience.

iom, great to see the 2C-D was good for you - your posts resonate well with me. Probably because I'm in the same boat of having to relearn psychedelics. Although for different reasons.


4 days after the 18 mg experience, I had a free day again. I couldn't bring myself to not trip - the 18 mg trial was just too appetising. And hungry I was, choosing to go with 35 mg. Unfortunately, the experience never really developed into something rich. Instead, I was annoyed by the lack of psychedelia, the neutral space - and tried sprinkling in some magic with 15 mg 2C-B at 1.5 hours. Instead of meeting magic, the blandness of the 2C-D was just extended. I seriously questioned why I was doing this. Why I keep doing drugs, and if it doesn't destabilise my mental state instead of realigning and stabilising it as I hope for it to do. While the 2C-D alone didn't cause any problems with my hand, adding the 2C-B also added some weird feeling in my right hand. Given how those problems present themselves, I'm entirely convinced of those issues being psychosomatic in nature now. But it was also quite cold, and that may have contributed too.


To calm myself down, I watched the documentary "A Clandestine Chemist's Tale", and it really helped.


At some point, I hope to recognise fully that most of the time, tripping for the sake of tripping is not worthwhile.

My hopes for 2C-D being a great compound remain, as I've realised not to judge a book by its cover or the first few pages. The chapter has just begun. Oh, and there is many more books I just opened and never read fully. Maybe it is time to finally spend time with them instead of opening book after book. Well, just a quick peek into the thios first, perhaps?

So I have a couple thoughts here.  First, I think you do need a purpose for your trips, especially with only four days between experiences.  I don't know if that purpose has to be anything too profound.  Maybe you just want to observe how it affects you and report on it.  Surely that's what kept Shulgin going.  Clearly your trip went in a "why am I doing this direction", which is good!  You should be able to answer that question one way or another.


Second, I also think the "not really breaking through" may be particularly in character for 2C-D, at least at "Shulgin" doses.  Shulgin's commentary describes 2C-D as "always teasing, until you get to heroic levels".  This also is hinted at by many of the included comments.  When I took 50 mg, I only felt (+++) after smoking some weed, and it only lasted for 15-30 minutes after which further smoking did not bring it back.  I do believe there is an "upper tier", a threshold beyond which psychedelic effects are much stronger, but I'm a bit reluctant to explore there partly because I'm not sure about it physically but also because I think I'd rather conserve the material.


I am going to hypothesize that 2C-D has significant alpha-1 adrenergic activity relative to most other 2C psychedelics.  First, reasoning by chemical analogy between DOET => DOM and 2C-E => 2C-D, the loss of psychedelic potency with 2C-D is substantial, but is alpha-1 potency affected to the same extent?  I don't see why it ought to be.  Maybe it is but probably not.  Second, the unique effects of 2C-D seem intuitively consistent with a stronger alpha-1 component.


That said, 2C-D may be a weak partial agonist for most people.  That's to say that there is a point at which any stimulating activity may saturate, beyond which the experience becomes much less one of "cognitive sharpening" and much more psychedelic.  However, this point may vary a lot between different people.  Some people may have less common variants of alpha-1 genes and may respond very differently to 2C-D.  I've noticed that a handful of people report an overwhelmingly physical experience with some even identifying alarming cardiovascular symptoms.  One report of adverse effects described the onset of 2C-D as including 30 minutes of "blinding anger"!

Perhaps the cognitive stimulation of the 2C-D overrode the 2C-B, but it's also possible you just needed to have this trip.  You needed to seriously contemplate why you are doing this, and maybe you're a bit closer to answering that question now.


In a way I have the complementary problem.  When I resumed psychedelics, I was pleasantly surprised to experience a dramatic remission of health problems, so now I feel inclined to try to sustain that benefit and learn how it works so I can maybe help others.  This means I have a reason to trip even if I don't enjoy the actual experiences.  Of course I'd rather have good trips, so I'm compelled to find ways to alleviate the boredom.

This is actually one of my main motivations for tripping, seeing what is possible, observing it, and if all things go well, write a report (or even more important, when things are not going well). The short space between dosing is because I'm impatient and want to titrate up and get to the meat of the matter - especially when I spend weeks obsessively finding all tiny pieces of information about 2C-D I can get my hands on and exploring the chemistry. I've also noticed that particularly the trips that go really well have me in an increased mood days or weeks after. They do make me content. On the other hand, there are two issues I have with tripping frequently: a) psychedelics are very valuable to me, and it seems wrong abusing them in any form. So many resources have flown into them, it feels wrong using them at the wrong occasion. Yet I still do sometimes. On the other hand, the worst occasions have sometimes turned out as the best in the past, and I was greeted with greatness just as I dearly needed it. And b), I've realised that some psychedelic phenethylamines may provoke entactogen-like effects if the right conditions are met, but are potentially less damaging. I've sworn of rather frequent entactogen usage, and it seems worrying to me that I try to use psychedelics as a replacement in a way.

Given how much 18 mg did for me, I was certain almost twice would have quite the pronounced effect, equal to about 20 - 25 mg 2C-B, perhaps not in quality, but intensity. But well, truth be told, even 25 mg 2C-B can be bland in the wrong conditions, which I certainly met - given that the inclusion of 15 mg 2C-B didn't "better" the state. Also, I'm not really one to search out "breakthrough" experiences, and I can be very happy with mild trips.

2C-D wasn't too stimulating for me, probably less than 2C-B. But neither is 2C-B really stimulating for me. In absence of in vitro binding studies, molecular docking may be interesting and already point towards the right direction with methods available to the inclined computer-assisted pharmacology nerd.

I wasn't really pondering about the 2C-D much, or my own trip. I'm quite sure I had what I had for a very good reason, and the 2C-D is not to blame. In fact I believe just 2C-B could have lead to a very similar trip on that day.


I'm still grateful for you taking the time to type out your reply. It further solidified some insights I already have (and even had before that 2C-D) trip, but which I just don't want to accept yet. I'm curious how the next trip will turn out, but still give it a moment of time. I usually try to go for 2 weeks between trips at least, and when I go under that limit, its when things to begin getting bland.

(with 50 mg) Gentle on the body. No nausea, just a bit of muscular tension, and surprisingly, no headache. Particularly the left hand feels a bit tingly, but objectively, both hands feel and move like they should. Better not to get occupied with it, though. Visually, not too much is going on. Colours seem brighter, softer, the room is breathing a bit and there is a bit of flowing. Good mood, music on the headphones like soundscapes. Quite manageable material, but as it seems more potential for a bit of "mindfuck" than 2C-B, with seemingly less potential towards the euphoric states. Duration about 4.5 h, rapid drop by 2.5 h, but quite a long time until completely baseline. No problem eating 3.5 h into the experience.


50 mg seems like a perfect level, in intensity about equal to 25 mg 2C-B for me. Just a bit shorter than 2C-B, similarly benign, but with just a tad more push towards introspection than 2C-B - I think this may just become another classic and ally of me. It will be hard to decide between it and 2C-B too, and I'm afraid 2C-B may have better chances most of the times due to being more fun.

You're welcome!  Your elaboration is also helpful.


I do still think 2C-D may exhibit a fairly strong but uniquely cognitively kind of stimulation, which could cause the lower dose experiences feel less intoxicating or immersive.  Note that I speculate that beyond a certain dose (maybe ~50 mg for most people) this cognitive stimulation effect saturates and the experience becomes much more psychedelic.


I should also mention that this cognitive stimulation is likely to be perceived as calming, similar to the way many ADHD sufferers experience stimulants.  I can't really compare to 2C-B because I only had it once and didn't enjoy it.  I have done a lot of 2C-I, and I'd say I find both drugs to be quite stimulating but in rather different ways.  With 2C-I, the stimulation is very oriented toward physical activity.  It motivates me to get up and move around.  With 2C-D, I feel it most in my mind, a feeling of hyper alertness along with a deep sense of mental calm and focus.  That said, the cognitive emphasis is so strong that emotions seem take a back seat on 2C-D, which is a negative for many applications including many kinds of therapy. 


As such, I tend to think 2C-D may be particularly suited to solving intellectual or analytical challenges, and I think it might be most satisfying to use when one can apply the self in a way that utilizes these cognitive capabilities.  When I try it again, I think I will stick to a lower dosage, maybe 30 mg.  Alternatively, I might stay at 10-20 mg but try adding some coca leaf, which  seemed to have an interesting synergy in the past.  Yet another possibility is to try plugging a smaller amount, and if that goes well to consider using plugging to hit a "higher tier" experience with less material than oral.  I'm not sure it will though.  I do not find it quite as nice to the body as others do.  OTOH, I don't mind 2C-E body load as much as many others, and I greatly appreciate the depth of the 2C-E experience.


Lastly, I'll just mention DOM again because I'm terribly curious if DOM exhibits some of this cognitive sharpening/focusing effect, at least low doses.  If so, I could see DOM being very useful for intellectual challenges.

In regards to this I actually have quite a bit of experience microdosing DOM around the 350ug area. It definitely seems to have a cognitive enhancement without ever getting overtly psychedelic. My last try with it in this regard was at a very emotional LGAT (large group awareness training) and I had to leave. I just couldn't respectfully sit and watch people pour their emotions out, I was way too analytical.


Side note* Even at microdose level, my pupils were still noticeably dilated. 


Anyway, if youre experienced with DOM, I would recommend trying out a really low dose.


Back to 2C-D, I much prefer higher dose and I like it orally.

So, I'm one experience wiser with 2C-D. The experience was had a couple weeks ago - five weeks after the previous excellent trial with 50 mg. The first 50 mg trial hit the perfect balance of riding the line between "almost too much to handle" and "still manageable". The decision was made to repeat at 50 mg 2C-D HCl orally.


Before dosing, I was pretty sure I'd be out of my 25E-NBOH trauma. And something had me intrigued by the 2C-D. Even though at first glance it seemed only little more introspective than 2C-B, the changes it facilitated were more present, despite only put into action very slowly. I used to joke at myself that one day I'd have the trip that turns me vegan. During that earlier 50 mg trip, I was reminded of the very interesting LD50 data for this compound¹ - supposedly, DOM has a comparable LD50 in mice. I was quite angry at the senselessness of measuring this value. The authors certainly did not consider using this compound in humans and by itself the value does not say much. This anger was soon redirected at myself for eating meat when it certainly is possible to spare the life of animals with appropriate supplementation. Thinking about eating meat even induced nausea - which I did not have otherwise during the experience. Regardless, while I was coming down, I certainly ate a meat-containing dish I had prepared earlier. The anger was easily traced back to the dissonance between moral values (i.e. not wasting our planet's resources with excessive meat consumption) and my own actions (i.e. frequently eating meat-based dishes). It took me a few weeks, but I've now come to the resolve that little change is better than no change and all my grocery shopping will be vegetarian. Excuses can be made for when I'm invited to people (in particular of the judgemental kind), or occasionally when I eat out (as I do experience certain cravings that I believe are natural and should be sated). Call me a conflict-averse coward, but I'm currently fine with that and will work from here - which will be finding alternatives to milk-based products. And then there was the other thing: earlier I described the bland trip with 35 mg 2C-D + 15 mg 2C-B @ 1.5 h which I believe to have been caused by too frequent tripping. Despite the 50 mg trip being very good, I waited a full 5 weeks devoid any other drugs for what would be this next trip. A decent chunk of time for me!


So all that pre-story aside, here we are. I was eager to take the 50 mg, and eager to see which places the 2C-D would take me to and which aspect of myself it would lead me to reevaluate and revise. But I hadn't done my homework at all. One thing which I'm constantly avoiding to address are my frequent slip-ups with the rules my girlfriend and I have made concerning drug consumption. My girlfriend is pretty much straight-edge. She acknowledges my drug use being part of myself, but I feel like there is a certain amount of skepticism attached to it. Unlike me, she is rather risk- and pain-avoidant. At the beginning of the relationship, the agreement was I'd quit the addicting drugs, take psychedelics at a reasonable pace (i.e. every two weeks at most) and have her informed/present with any compound new to myself. But one of my biggest flaws is impatience. Whenever I have a new compound at my hands, I feel like Christmas and there is the urgent desire to bioassay - combined with being ashamed at myself for this behaviour, I did not always follow the rule about informing her. This had lead to the 25E-NBOH incident² and my 2C-D trials were unbeknownst to her just as well. Now this time, I did inform my girlfriend I was going to be tripping, but on 2C-B (which she knows I'm plenty experienced with). So I grabbed the bottle of 2C-B, briefly considering that I'd rather not lie, promptly put it back into the cupboard and got hold of the 2C-D. It struck me as foolish to go into a trip with such a lie, but *alea iacta est* and off I went. I'd be fine - if only I'd known what I had set myself up for.


2C-D has a faster come-up than all other psychedelics I previously tried. Judging by the severity of this rocket ship ride, I quickly knew I was in for something. During the first 1.5 h, it was rather positive, but there were already hints of things becoming hard to manage. Closing my eyes and lying on the bed, things were getting definitely well into acid-esque ego-dissolving territory - which I wasn't feeling comfortable with and avoided by getting up again and conversing with online friends via chat. But then suddenly, it became too much. During the trip, I had decided to make an experiment and supplement with citrulline against any vasoconstriction (a common trigger for difficult experiences since the 25E-NBOH) and magnesium (against the neck tension). And before I knew it, all music became unbearable. I had a difficult time and had to convince myself that the feeling of fainting at any time was not real, that I was having a hard time and that this was surely punishment. Punishment for my hubris of going into a trip with a lie. A bunch of lies even. And this unstable contraption was beginning to fall apart like a house of cards in the wind and there was some explaining to do. I desperately needed some comfort and a hug to know that things would be alright. So I called my girlfriend over, who promptly came as fast as possible in the next 30 min. Not wanting to alarm her about any physiological troubles (which I rationally knew to be psychosomatic anyways) and not wanting to do much explaining of how this situation occured I told her I was in a psychologically unwell place and needed her help. She arrived to a shell-shocked version of myself, but there was little time for cuddles and comfort. Immediately after her arrival the fire alarm of the apartment building went off. After some panicked hesitation ("I'm too tripped out to go outside, surely this is just a minor alarm and nothing serious"), reconsideration ("better safe than sorry, regardless of my state") and scrambling ("where the fuck are the keys, I'm too tripped out to figure this out"), outside we went. Being on a rock solid +++ of the rather difficult kind, I insisted on going for a stroll away from the crowd of neighbours. The rapid change of setting helped a lot and I was no longer in fear, only hurt. Soon we came to see that people were on their way back in and made it back into my apartment. My life no longer depended on a hug and she could complete a creative project while I was hiding under a thick layer of blankets watching YouTube documentaries about unconventional aeroplane concepts as the trip faded out. I did not talk about the contents of the trip and why the situation arose that night.


I've been thinking loads about this experience. The problem is crystal-clear to me. But I'm still working up the courage to confide to my girlfriend. All those breaking of rules is a major breach of trust. And the dangerous situations I put myself in do not exactly put my little life-devouring research chemical hobby into a good light either. I don't know what her reaction will be. It would be easy to try and blame the problem on the enticement of those drugs - the sparkle of the psychedelic phenethylamines and the allure of the euphoric world of entactogens and stimulants. But it would be a lie. The reality is that I've failed as a person. And surely there are rationalisations and some mental gymnastics to shift the blame away from me. But I remain at the core issue. It is now up to me to face the fear of the unknown (i.e. her reaction) and embrace for the consequences. I direly hope she understands and that I can rebuild everything that had been broken in the process. It is ironic, as I almost anticipated something like this happening when we began our relationship. And in an attempt to avoid such course, I insisted on perfect truthfulness and transparency. Sadly I was incapable to live up to my standards.


Apart from the relation to the 25E-NBOH scare trip, I believe my bad trips manifest as physiological problems due to some health concerns I am having. I am unhappy with how I am treating my body, the lack of physical exercise and improper meals. I really need to address this separate issue too before it consumes me.


This has gotten rather personal and intimate. I've written this for two reasons: a) the selfish need to verbalise and communicate my thoughts and b) to declare a more refined judgement on 2C-D.


2C-D has proven to me to be anything but a light tofu. It is fully psychedelic with razor-sharp teeth and fangs, it will bite back if provoked. It has shown me aspects which make me believe that egodeath is certainly a possibility within the PiHKAL dose range of 20 - 60 mg. I hope this personal conflict of mine arrives at a good ending. I want my relationship to remain. Both to my girlfriend and to my sparkly little phenethylamines.

[@xdrc](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/570167/) it strikes me that you're tripping out on guilt a bit there and that it might be healthy to cut yourself some slack. Always best to strive to be the best person you can be, but we inevitably fall short. And that's ok. And anyways, your GF isn't your mom.


As a lifelong veg I think it's really good to be able to eat some meat for those social occasions. I wish I could do it, I've had a lot of awkward moments where I just couldn't do it, when it was rude to turn it down and I felt bad and probably made the host feel bad too.


2C-D has surprised me a couple times with its strength. A 20mg dose this summer had properly tripping with visuals and zipping sounds. Most times 20mg has been very mild.

I think it would be more healthy to change some things for the better and I can cut myself some slack once I've gone through that ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Anyways I have agreed to those rules, and as such, I have to stick to them, otherwise it is not a consensual relationship. This has nothing to do with my girlfriend not being my mom or otherwise. And it is not like she is controlling about these rules either, she trusts me. But it is not like having certain requirements (especially if they pertain to a long and healthy life) is unreasonable. It is upon me to agree to it or not, but being dishonest is an asshole move. With that being said, I'd rather not devolve this thread into talking about my relationship, this part was only included as necessary explanation for what had happened on my 2C-D trip and what the material can do.


Great stuff, great stuff. Seems to offer just the right amount of ass-whooping. Only wish it was a bit more emotionally warmer, but maybe then it would lose its sharpness. Or it hasn't granted me that yet. And the neck tension thing I have is annoying too - maybe it is a general issue with posture?

[@xdrc](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/570167/) I think the most I ever took was 30-35mg. I usually use 2C-D for the lighter and milder tripping usually around 20mg. It's been my go-to for a few years now, definitely one of my favourites. My tripping is so occasional lately, and I often find the duration and intensity of 2C-D is the easiest to fit in for a night out.

Pretty much all psychedelics have several common "side-effects": vasoconstriction, increased muscle tone, "body energies", GI activation, immune system activation, etc.  Neck tension is very common.  People call this stuff "body load", but I get the feeling there's a lot more to it than that.  Like, I think these may be the early stages of "work" that leads to healing and regeneration of these tissues and body systems, just as the trip is the early stages of the healing and regeneration of the psyche.


Muscle tension is not always completely involuntary either.  By becoming conscious of tensions, they can sometimes be relaxed.  As to the question of why such tensions exist "by default", well perhaps it is to maintain some particular posture.  It's not necessarily a good or bad posture.  It may simply be a posture with a purpose behind it, an adaptation shaped by earlier life experiences.  If you allow the process to happen, your body can show you things about yourself and about other things too that you maybe couldn't understand before without that awareness.  If you want to "correct" your posture, then the psychedelic space, particularly the period before the plateau, is an excellent place to initiate any new habits, but don't forget to make peace with the old habits which may be deeply rooted.


I agree that 2C-D is emotionally cold.  It feels like the cognitive aspect, which I agree is very "sharp", dominates so much that the emotions kinda take a back seat.  It is very interesting for what it is but is definitely not a favorite.  Have you tried 2C-E?  It's almost polar opposite in terms of emotional depth.  It is not "sharp" but feels quite active (in a good way) on the cognitive side too.  Some people describe it as "emotionally neutral" by which they mean that there is similar propensity for positive vs. negative states versus a "positive push" for most other phenethylamines.  I don't really like to think of it on those terms.  I feel like it is emotionally rich and authentic---intense even, but with a few notable exceptions, my trips have been mostly warm and positive feeling to me.  Around 6 hours in, I often get an intense entactogenic rush that feels incredibly warm, grounded, and blissful.  It's about the best feeling I can recall having, even among psychedelics, though plenty of other psychedelics have gotten me to similar places.


Another one I can suggest is 2C-T-2, which I know you had interest in.  It is relatively short, quite powerful, and has a lot of heart.  To me it feels somehow more sparkly and less analytical than 2C-E, if that makes sense.  Even though 2C-E has amazing visuals (probably among the best), I'm often so engrossed in the headspace that I don't care.  With 2C-T-2, the visual "fireworks" displays can be incredibly engaging and uplifting.  Keep in mind that these two have a reputation for "body load" including potentially nausea and vomiting.  I'm not particularly prone to nausea on phenethylamines, but I've had some real queasy moments while coming up on 2C-T-2.


Happy trips!

Same. Most of my experiences were about what I would have expected from the dose. Heck, I think I titrated up to 20mg+ rectally once and had a lovely time. But I won't forget the one[30mg oral experience](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/2c-d-30mg-orally-7th-time-an-idiosyncratic-intensity-or-total-enzyme-k.815853/)that was unexpectedly full value.

That's interesting that you find 2C-E to be more congenial! I liked them both, and agree that 2C-D feels cool, almost brisk. 2C-E was much more complex for me, but it's definitely emotionally neutral, warm only by comparison. It's more threatening to me, but also more rewarding.

I guess by "warm" and "cold", I mean emotionally open/expanded versus emotionally confined/narrowed.  I just feel like the range of emotions on 2C-D is much narrower.  I think cool and brisk are good words to describe the more emotional space, at least when things are upbeat.  I can definitely see it turning quite vicious in terms of anxiety of even panic in the event things get dark.  Overall though, I just find it to be much more of a mental/thinking trip.  I imagine it being very useful for undertaking work that demands intellectual creativity, but it seems less useful from a therapeutic standpoint, at least for "psycholytic" types that rely on sub-ego-loss doses.  Emotions can perhaps be analyzed and discussed from a detached viewpoint on 2C-D, but immersive emotional processing of the kind I got from 2C-E (without even asking for it, really) doesn't seem likely to be possible on 2C-D.  I should note that LE-25 (2C-D) studies done in Germany used doses that induced full ego loss, which I consider to be a fundamentally different kind of therapy than psycholytic, and I'm guessing 2C-D was chosen for this because of its short duration.  This makes me wonder if those researchers considered psilocybin, and if not, why not?

Edit: I somehow lost the paragraph I wrote about my recent experience with 2C-E.  I only had one particularly "negative" trip with 2C-E, and that was my rather recent 5 mg trip, which at the time is the strongest dose I'd had since I'd stopped using psychedelics for 11 years.  That 5 mg trip was very remarkable though.  At one hour, I experienced a *la purga* like response in which I briefly felt very nausea (did vomit) and sweat so much over the course of 2 or 3 minutes that it was dripping on the floor.  And with that response came a feeling of enormous emotional burden, which felt like a dark cloud surrounding my head and upper torso and seemed to be latched on to me.  I was just kind of stuck there, in that dark state for most of the trip.  Finally in the last couple hours, I started to talk through things with my wife, and I had a tremendous catharsis in which I cried harder and longer than I can remember---like an hour-and-a-half.  The emotional pain just kept on rising to the surface and coming out.  It was rather exhausting, but when I woke up the next morning, I felt like I had been released from that burden which I'd been carrying around and building on for so many years (really, those 11 years past), and I believe this profound change was permanent.  So for this one "negative" 12 hour trip seems to be feeling, I've probably felt at least a little better every day of my life since.  Like I said above, I don't see 2C-D bringing me to in to such an immersive and emotionally authentic space.

Of course I am aware that these are typical side effects of psychedelics. By many psychedelic enthusiasts, they are often seen as some sort of payment for the ride, if you will. Some of these side effects are even framed as positive, with vomiting being a symbolic cleansing of mental and physical toxins alike. And I myself have trips where such objectively unpleasant bodily effects were mentally very freeing, like shaking all sorrow away from my body. Yet I still don't believe in the somewhat masochist tendencies of not alleviating unpleasant side effects at all. I do wonder though what is the basis of your assumption for psychedelic trips causing a physical healing of the body.

I've tried 2C-E, and it really is a special compound. But it turns me into a tiny cogwheel of an enigmatic universe. It also has loads more bodyload to me and acts too long for me to be comfortable with my recent streaks of difficult experiences. I'd rather continue with the 2C-D and 2C-B in the upcoming trips, after I sorted some things out. But of course I do plan to revisit it.

At the present time, I don't entirely trust myself and the compounds. I'm really eager to try the last two of the magical half dozen, but currently I'm too anxious. 2C-T-2 and especially 2C-T-7 seem sketchy enough to cause a panic-spiral in myself due to misinterpreting some physiological signs. So, same as with 2C-E, unfortunately.

Where do you have the information that those dosages induced full ego loss? They certainly described ego-weakening, but full? Leuner also worked with 4-HO-DET and 4-PO-DET. I think the choice for 2C-D was much more one of practicality and legality. They did not really publish anything (other than just now, "Psycholytische Therapie nach Hanscarl Leuner", Passie, Schlichting, Bolle, Nachtschatten Verlag) and they tried their best to obfuscate the actual compound at the time, hoping for it to evade popularity and as such bans.

**(approx. 10 mg 2C-D HCl, oral) **The dose was taken after 400 mg of ibuprofen were entirely ineffective against treating an extreme attack of migraines, and I felt helpless and willing to try anything available. The most rational *anything* that was available was 2C-D. Psilocybe cubensis and lysergamides are known to help against cluster headaches and migraines in the scientific literature, but were not in the vicinity and I never tried them earlier. 2C-D was chosen out of the library of available phenethylamines as the least prone at *inducing *headaches. 1 h after ingestion, the migraines were manageable and not anymore at a level of pain that requires squirming in bed. Over the course of the duration of action for the 2C-D, the migraine slowly faded into unimportance and then disappeared completely. Unfortunately, the 10 mg were unexpectedly trippy for the dose.


As this is n=1, an attempt at a repeat trial was made with similar headaches that couldn't be resolved by ibuprofen. Unfortunately, the solution was puked right out in a sudden attack of nausea caused by introducing anything to the stomach (even tap water without drug some hour later was expelled from the system right away). No effects of the 2C-D were felt and the headaches progressed with the usual strength until they naturally disappeared.


I just thought I'd mention it, further experimentation is due.

I believe my regular (1-4 week) psychedelic use may contribute toward migraine prophylaxis in myself.  The improvement was not immediate.  It manifest over a period of several months during which I also experienced a dramatic improvement in overall health.  I had a long write-up on this, but I realized this is the 2C-D thread and would rather not clutter it up.  Let me know if you want me to post elsewhere.

I'm not sure if I had less migraines in the time when I was using phenethylamines often, it may have been the case. But I'm really plagued for the past couple of months. Not sure why exactly, but I'm not using many psychedelics currently. I'd hope there is no linkage, as I'd prefer other solutions than tripping frequently to avoid migraines.


I'd be glad to read your long write-up if it is not too much trouble for you. I'm sure it is okay to start another thread for that.

Could have been a fluke. Who knows. Although I'm not eager to have terribly painful migraine again, I know that the day will come and then further experimentation is due. For science!

Funnily enough, I don't get headaches often and when I do they're mild, but 2C-D is one of the few psychedelics that reliably give me a next day headache.

Had another go with the substance recently, at 30 mg 2C-D HCl p.o.. It does manifest itself as just as much of an ally as 2C-B. There are many similarities, as they are both mild (in the respective dose range, at higher doses, 2C-D packs a punch ime), but 2C-D leans more towards the introspective/neutral, while 2C-B is more heart-warming/soul-touching for me. Took it in the morning to a long hike, took 3.5 h from intake to complete baseline again. I suspect the duration is quite dose sensitive, as doses in the 50 mg range seemed to be more in the realm of 5 h for the duration. Didn't have any major realisations, rather than just reminders of flaws I already know I have and struggle with. Will keep on working on myself.


But it gave me a nice energy, reconnected me with nature (to the point of almost crying being overwhelmed by the beauty of the forest). And it once again showed me it is the little, friendlier brother of 2C-E: right at the peak, I had also climbed an elevated point of the rocky area (was a bit dangerous, 20 - 25 mg would've been more responsible for the area) and was greeted by a magnificent view in 2C-E oil painting style, with little peacock eyes in the trees of the valley. That was astoundingly visually active for the rather small dose!


Good stuff! And aside from a few weird body signals during the come-up, zero bodyload, zero nausea, zero aftermath, no headache, nada! Get your prescription now!

I'm fascinated by people finding any similarity between 2C-D and 2C-E. For me, 2C-D is a brisk wind, a bracing slug of iced tea on a hot day, the smell of fresh orange rind. 2C-E is an old scratchy wool sock drug off as bedding to a wolf's den..

I'm very much struggling with your poetic metaphors, but I agree that (for me anyway) 2C-D and 2C-E feel worlds different.  I don't think 2C-E really has a little brother.  Certainly nothing I've tried is very much like it at all.  It has a tremendous depth and intensity.  It is perhaps the least recreational of the common phenethylamines.  I haven't tried 2C-P yet, but I plan to soon so will be able to compare all three.

I found 2c-p to be more harder for the mind and the body than 2c-e. I can See doing 2c-e as a Tool for introspection for which it has its uses. 2c-p otoh is just too much, didnt like it at all. I would even go that far as to Call it a torture psychedelic. 2c-d is a much calmer and more relaxed version than the both afore mentioned, i liked it but only had around 25mgs which wasnt enough for full effects.

How about?

2C-D is cotton candy at the carnival.

2C-E is primal scream therapy


For me, they feel only passingly related to each other.

For me, the 3 alkylated 2C's have very much the same underlying character, but that character is extremely magnified and precise in 2C-E, is smoothed out and lengthened in 2C-P, and is made small, compact and soft in 2C-D.


You see a lot of that character in mescaline too IMO, but the character in mescaline is more full-bodied - it encapsulates the character of the alkylated 2C's and then some, and with low magnification of this broader character.

I do admit that part of my conclusion may be tainted by bias, wanting to put all the 4-alkyl 2Cs into one neat box. Yes, the occasionally always brutal effects of 2C-E (I liken it to heavy psychedelic storm) are in stark contrast to the comfortable sea breeze that is 2C-D. But regardless of their structural closeness, they feel to me like part of the same family - it's just that 2C-E never learned to behave and knock on the door before entering! And sometimes this is a good thing, *because you really needed to know what the hell it wants to scream at you... *But I think 2C-D tells me the same kind of messages, and mostly they seem to stick too. It's just going way friendlier about it and thus I'm more inclined to trust it as an ally. Also, currently I am far more inclined to opt for shorter and milder trips for a variety of reasons. Should really do more tripping and less distractions (stimulants) though. And while this is obviously dose-related, 2C-E and 2C-D were the only two phenethylamines yet to give me the impression that full ego-death is possible on them.


I hold the capabilities of 2C-D in high regards and will die on the hill it has much of the qualities of 2C-E with less of the disadvantages that come along with that one.


Haven't yet tried 2C-P, so no idea if I think it fits into the same family. Unlike perpetualdown, I don't see much similarities between mescaline (or scalines in general) and 2C-D/2C-E. There is something of grand, celestial, sparkly, magic energy with mescaline, and I just don't see it to the same extent in 2C-E/2C-D. They are less spiritual to me, more about myself and how I fit into the world, whereas mescaline grants me a place in the universe. Although, my latest 2C-E trip I felt completely at peace with the universe too... before it absolutely crushed me and had torn me apart!


This is all hard to pinpoint and needs years of more research, of course!

I'm with you that mescaline feels quite distinct from all the 2C-X I've tried, yet the phenethylamines I've had all seem more similar to one another than to LSD or any tryptamines I've had.  Others might disagree with me here of course.  I'm going to have to book time for a 30 mg 2C-D trip somewhere in my busy schedule because I've only had one other experience above 20 mg.


My first time with 2C-D when I was much younger was at 50 mg, and I was disappointed.  I had quite rough body load coming up for a trip that was only intense for about half-an-hour---not really long enough to settle in and do anything useful.  The visuals were intense but somehow very boring to the point of being annoying.  There was a lot of color cycling going on, and it looked a bit like a cheap "8-bit" effect.  After that half hour, I felt like I was coming down and tried to smoke more cannabis to bring it back, but instead the weed just made me feel even more clear headed.  We had hiked up a mountain trail on the come-up, and on the way down, I felt like I was incredibly enhanced.  I had perfect dexterity and was able to slide down patches of ice and snow gracefully and effortlessly.  I felt super precise, like I was in complete control, and it was an amazing feeling.  Occasionally I stopped to look at the scenery which was still color cycling, but otherwise I didn't really even feel like I was tripping or intoxicated.


I was disappointed because I expected more from 50 mg, and furthermore, if I'd had that kind of a come-up (body load wise) on 2C-E, I would have been tripping hard for several hours.  On the other hand, the incredible cognitive headspace in the 2C-D plateau keeps me coming back to it, and that quality is worlds different from what I get from 2C-E.  A few other psychedelics hint at it, for example LSD, 2C-T-2, and 2C-I.  Nothing comes close to 2C-D though.  Too bad even 20 mg gives me some rough early trip body load, but I'm still going to try 30 mg some day to see if I can discover more with better set and setting.  Otherwise it's certainly interesting for what it does it I have an appropriate application.


Alas, what motivated me to hit "Reply" was the discussion about 2C-E, but I should probably post those thoughts in the 2C-E thread.  I definitely vote for more psychedelics and less stimulants.  When you get to them, II look forward to hearing your thoughts on some other psychedelics like 2C-T-2.

For another mini-report, and to document my process of trying to understand how to use this substance. This goes to show how important set/setting are (duh!). A week beforehand I had wasted my time with mephedrone (and with ample time for metabolism) had my first trial with Aleph at 2.8 mg.


> **(with 47 mg)** After failing with the task (related to psychedelics/drugs) I had set for the day due to impatience, I got disappointed in myself. The previous days I had decided that it would be time for another more psychedelic journey, and I had either a ~50 mg of 2C-D or some 12 - 14 mg 2C-E in mind. As it was late in the evening, I had just eaten and because 2C-D is more amicable, the decision was easy. Originally, there was a plan to trip on this weekend, this was thwarted by some complications and then spontaneously decided for it again. Maybe not the best circumstances, as it seems like I need some preparation these days.
> 
> 
> 
> Anyways, the 2C-D was taken and this time it punished me with a bit of nausea, which was expected due to the meal being so close to ingestion. Otherwise the body was fine, except for some neck tension. But after the come up, I did not end up in any even somewhat comfortable mental state. I questioned many of my choices and actions, but without coming to any real solutions. Looking into the mirror, which under the influence often fills me with self-acceptance and love, despite my many short-comings, had the polar opposite result. I looked at a very tired and disappointed version of myself, with blue eye rings (not the case when sober!). I came to the realisation that I may still be deep in depression, despite claiming the opposite for most of the last year. Have I lied to myself? In any case, it became clear that there are some deeply routed flaws, and that I wouldn't get any wiser from further trips. I was disappointed in myself for wasting so much time with drugs, even with psychedelics. Why do I always need a new toy? Aren't the old toys enough? Haven't I found enough tools now to look into myself? When would I start actually applying what I learned? It feels disheartening, as I seem to lack the strength and time is running. I also realised the amount of self-isolation and dangers that come with my interest for all drugs.
> 
> 
> 
> I should probably try to strengthen old friendships and build new ones. And I need to spend the time that seems flying nowadays more efficiently and structured. The rest of the trip was spent mostly distracting myself, which may not have been the best choice. Maybe I should've tried pondering the enigma that I am to myself more. When the danger for rekindling a psychedelic wildfire seemed low enough, thoughts were drowned out by vaporising some cannabis. The next day was spent lethargic and depressed. Now I have a cold and am naturally lethargic. Damn.

> Click to expand...


I think I need some time off the drugs and really change some things. Not that this is a new realisation. But I keep failing. Wish life was more easy, lol. Hope I am able to implement some changes now, would prove the 2C-D really does enable to enact change within me. So far, seems like a more useful, less fun ally, overall. And no worries, it's quite unlikely I'll stay off the drugs completely... Just need to take some times to get my life back to priority number 1 and then the drugs can come some time...


Aside from these realisations, what I found interesting about this trip were two points:

A) The anti-drug nature. Quite interesting how psychedelics try to push me away from any drug consumption. Sure, there are some trips where it's all fun and I tell myself "I should do it more often", but many of my trips actively discourage me of any drug consumption, even against themselves. I find this property remarkable. Yet I come back! (And no, this is hardly a new realisation, but still...)


B) The trip felt quite weak. I've found with most 2Cs so far (and also scalines) that if I'm disappointed in myself, particularly for choosing to trip (in this case, I realised after the intake that maybe this was not the finest idea), then that I get what I call the 2C or scaline slap. It is mostly defined as an uncomfortable time (with the scalines in particular a high degree of nausea), confusion, wishing for the trip to be over. The trip is often also reduced in strength, i.e. no visuals or too much headspace. Most often there is no strong punishment, rather disappointment of wasting valuable material with an unsatisfying trip. Although in the end I hope for this trip to be really valuable in the long run. Time will tell.


By the way, this sort of lense on darker aspects of my character are also something I found in 2C-E and the reason why I find their nature somewhat similar. Still interested to try out 2C-P to complete the series. I can only hope it loses some of the sharpness of 2C-E, otherwise the length may turn unbearable for me!

Unfortunately, the solution was puked right out in a sudden attack of nausea caused by introducing anything to the stomach (even tap water without drug some hour later was expelled from the system right away). No effects of the 2C-D were felt and the headaches progressed with the usual strength until they naturally disappeared.

n = 3 now, with just a 33 % success quote. The third time, I didn't puke immediately, but at a later point. I don't think the puking was due to the 2C-D, but it may have amplified some of the nausea either way. I did have a headache resolve with 2C-T though recently... This guy (me) will do anything not to go to a doctor to get triptans! ![:rolleyes:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f644.png)


It seems like some of my migraines can resolve by using phenethylamines (and others may be caused by it), but I don't know which is which and I should really get that checked out. My willingness to try just about anything to subdue the pain should be reason enough.

This is a fairly dumb question, but you don't have a cluster headache diagnosis, right?

Me and my trip partner combined 5-MAPB with 2C-D, N2O & ketamine 2 days ago.

We used 10mg pellets. Over around 3-4h we took 50mg 2C-D (30mg orally 20mg boofed) + 80mg 5-MAPB (55mg orally, 25mg boofed).


It worked good, though there was a good amount of bruxism.


We took 55mg 5-MAPB orally, followed by 10mg 2C-D. I had some nausea on the comeup.

It was too weak, so we took another 20mg 2C-D orally & 25mg 5-MAPB rectally.


Around 2 hours later we added 20mg 2C-D rectally.


The optics were nice, I saw big mandalas / geometric patterns on the wall, including random letters that were incorporated in architecture.


CEVs were pretty weak.


A small ket line pushed me into a k-hole with more clarity.


N2O worked nicely.


It got pretty weird & sometimes slightly dark.

There were erotic moments, we were too distracted for sex.


I had some short out of body / "possession" style moments after inhaling a N2O balloon.


A lovely substance.

Next time I wanna try 2C-D on it's own.

I got 2x 60mg pellets left. Maybe a whole 60mg in nature?


PS: I also took 10mg tadalafil that day & didn't have any problems with my heart rate or circulation.


Felt slightly weird the next day. We tripped from 10PM to 10 AM (the last few hours were dominated by ket) & slept well till 6 PM.


Being in the kitchen of her shared appartement & talking to others was strange, my motor skills were effected.

We went outside, bought some asian food & layed in a hammock.

Felt way better to be outside. Had an interesting conversation about our mental health, my traumata & theorized about why psychedelics often induce spiritual experiences. Our thoughts were pretty original & deep.

No, and I don't think I have cluster, just relatively frequent migraines. I got a diagnosis for migraines when I was a teenager. Haven't been to a doctor again, but it would probably be worthwhile to get some triptane prescribed. I kind of missed this question, not that it matters much.

I don't know if these pellets are adequately dosed, and I think I'm a little more sensitive than the average tripper, but I found 50 mg 2C-D HCl orally plenty for me. Maybe equivalent to somewhere in the realm of 30 mg 2C-B for me, but much more introspective, much more neutral. Not as friendly, but certainly not unfriendly. While there was none of the terrifying mind loops acid gives me, I was a bit reminded of it in terms of depth. Although less spiritual, more pertaining to the work I have to do myself, and not what the cosmos and afterlife is like. I think 60 mg should be a decent dose. I wish I had the confidence to push 2C-D beyond 50 mg, but for me it seems to be kind of the edge between sanity and insanity, which makes the trip exciting, but also makes me a bit wary of solo-sessions. I like the waving of wooden texture on it, very gentle and nice. Not too advanced in terms of visuals, except for that one time it did the 2C-E oil-painting thing + peacock eyes in the trees while hiking on a "mere" 30 mg.

I may use rectal administration actually.

From the few reports I have found it's supposedly more potent than orally, thoughnot twice as potent like 2C-B is rectally vs orally, right?


Maybe dissolving both pellets & boofing 1/4th of the liquid (so 30mg) is the way to go. Or rather 40mg?


It did not burn, came on faster & there was no nausea when we boofed 20mg.

I had a 100mg of 2C-D on Saturday morning 9am, orally in an oblaat (thin, edible starch paper for swallowing bad-tasting things).


I am by no means a hardhead, and I had no tolerance, but it didn't feel overwhelming at all. It was pretty great!


I spent most of the trip either deep-diving on Wikipedia or pacing around the room thinking about the nature of humanity, the origin and fate of the universe, and other big thoughts. (You might think it's a waste to not do it out in nature, but this is totally my jam.)


For instance, I was musing about how much of human culture is devoted to signalling belonging to some in-group, which is likely an artifact of evolving in conditions of scarcity where survival depended on convincing members of your community that you are more worthy of care and resources than some "other". I remember thinking that if humans were ever to achieve a post-scarcity society, then people would be able to take the energy they had previously spent on conforming and use it to express their individuality, leading to much more rapidly-evolving and diverse forms of expression. (I have no idea if this is true, lol.)


Head space was very neutral and analytical and lucid.


Visuals were there, but I was way too focused on my thoughts to pay attention to them.


At 11:30, I took a little over 1500mg phenylethylamine (PEA), also in an oblaat, to see if there was any potentiation. I have previously felt moderate euphoria for about 20 minutes from a similar dose by itself. If anything, the PEA was almost entirely overshadowed by the 2C-D. I remember feeling some facial flushing, but the 2C-D euphoria didn't increase.


There was a touch of nausea for the first hour, and I was sipping ginger tea throughout. I was able to have lunch at 1pm, and flavor was greatly enhanced.


I was pretty much down by 2pm. 2C-D is so great because you can have a solid, meaningful trip in the morning without dedicating your entire day to it.

Been fortunate enough to have 2c-d in my life again. I have explored it up to 75mg orally.


At high dose, i am very much reminded of both mescaline and mdma, but different. Its extremely tactile, mentally clear, but not erotic AT ALL, if anything it is the opposite.


Like overall, that sort of primal need of mine seems satisfied.


Quite unlike 2cb or 2ci or even mescaline in that sense. I havent taken 2ce in years, but 75mg of 2cd starts to remind me of 2ce but still way less intense than even 20mg of 2ce.

[@Pfafffed](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/369391/) no where near the sheer intensity of 2ce, but at very high dose its very reminiscient of 2c-e in its entheogenic qualities except w/o insane body load or psychic stress lol

Kind of, yes.  I think 2C-D is quite stimulating (at least in the lower end of its range), and has quite a lot of entactogenesis as well.  Some data I've seen suggest that when compared with other 2C-X drugs, it may have relatively less affinity for 5-HT2A (psychedelic) compared to 5-HT2B (entactogenic) and Alpha-2 (stimulant).  At the same time, I find it has a strong cognitive and mental edge which pulls the experience away from the emotional realm, at least for me.

Except for a single 50 mg dose, all my experiments with 2C-D have been at 20 mg and under.  Unfortunately, even at 20 mg, I get a rather heavy body load during the come-up with chills, shakes, sweats, jaw clenching, teeth chattering, muscle aches, and a sour stomach.  By the time those effects begin to fade, the trippy headspace essentially fades away too, and I get a kind of smart-drug-like effect I guess.  It's actually very pleasant and fun after that crazy come-up, but it isn't really that trippy, or wasn't at 50 mg.  Perhaps I'll try working my way back up there and beyond, but to be honest, I kind of like what the low doses do for me in so far as it's quite unique and distinct.


Meanwhile, 2C-E continues to amaze me, and except for one occasion in which my body was in poor shape going into the experience, 2C-E has always treated my body quite well.  It does seem to be extremely psychedelic to the point that my thoughts can strongly affect how my body feels, but I also feel like I can direct the experience toward the positive as long as the setting is ok.  I've never had anything like a bad trip on it, and typically my trips on it are very euphoric.

The 2c afterglow...  is sometimes more what im after than the actual trip itself, and 2C-D has a really nice afterglow. 


I personally dont get much negative body load from the substance. Maybe a touch of nausea, but im usually drinking beers, which i notice i tend to want less and less as trip progresses


The tail end of my 75mg, was the best part, id stopped drinking beer hours before this (was essentially sober) still had strong enactogenic effects, libido came back, and overall felt great.


2C-E..... first of all, while the trip itself is indescribable, the afterglow is what i truly enjoy, starting around T+8:00 ending around +16:00. Its a very long experience for me, and always fucks up any regular sleep schedule im on. And it has always had very strong body load, more than any other substance including 2C-t2 or 5-meo-met. It usually starts off like im literally getting sick and by hour it starts to smoothe out physically, while the trip is intensifying.


I may never take 2C-E again, last time was 16mg, i swore i wouldnt look at the news. But on that uncomftorable come-up i wanted something to distract me. That was the day COVID global pandemic was officially announced. 


Not the best substance to hear that.

I spent a couple minutes just now questioning why I wrote about 2C-D's entactogenic qualities (or lack thereof for me) in the Social Tripping Thread. Turns out I meant to reply to this thread...


I'm always surprised when I hear about people claiming these sort of effects for 2C-D. For me some of the value of the substance is precisely not an inherent mood altering, but rather a quite neutral feeling which will develop according to the thoughts being pondered. Now while this is a quality which is shared to some extent by pretty much any psychedelic, many of them seem to tinge the mood into on direction or the other. At least subjectively, 2C-D gives me no such impression. In this aspect, 2C-E is quite similar, though it often gives me a feeling of an overpowering neutralness. 2C-E often feels like a divine machinery which keeps on running, with seemingly no discernible intention, and it certainly does not care whether you get stuck in the cogwheels and ground to dust... (all the while giving me a sizable bodyload which I suspect is tainting the nature of the experience significantly - I'm considering combining with ondansetron to get behind this). 2C-D is on a much more personal level and while I do think it is a full blown psychedelic easily capable of inducing ego dissolution at the right dosage and time, despite the lack of mood-enhancing properties it typically feels non-threatening throughout.


And it's a super short experience, which is pretty cool! So far I've only gone up to 50 mg though, which is plenty for me, riding the edge between too much and just right.

Not me, actually was scared of 2C s till i took 2C-E.

And that made review my thought s, on them and also Tryptamine s.


MDMA and similar acting Empahogen s are past.

Fell in the cooking pot they brew MDMA in.

Put a good track on. And i m in Ecstasy.


So this is 1 hour on MDMA these day s.

2C-D also 2C-C even 2C-B to a extent are not high on my list.

2C-E reminds me a bit of MDMA, like it has bit s.


And 2C-T2 is heaven. Not MDMA like as 2C-E, but taken on the comedown.

So... I have taken the 2C-D probably close to 20 times at this point. 2 of those times were 7 years ago, the rest have been in the past 3 months.


Here is my assessment. To start, I quite like it. To me, it's effects are extremely clear headed, slightly visual, and then depending on dosage it can be analytical or empathogenic. If I HAD TO COMPARE, i would say it is more mescaline like than it is 2C-B like.


My very first time w 2C-D (it was the HCL), I had rolled up to the Grand Canyon at night, slept in my car illegally. Upon waking, I snorted 25mg of the HCL salt. The burn was.... enough to kind of put me in a bad mood. I stepped out of the car and saw the canyon for the first time and I immediately felt like an insignificant and temporary piece of dust. So that first trip, was somewhat melancholy, though it kind of improved as the day went on. While it wasn't the most positive trip, as a psychonaught and explorer of 2Cs I was intrigued.


A few months later, I had organized a Shulgin appreciation party in honor of his bday (2018?). Everyone at that party was tripping on different substances. I chose to take 50mg 2C-D orally (it was the very last of the 2C-D HCL that I had). This experience was so much smoother. Not only did things get extremely colorful, communication flowed well, conversation was quite fun, and in that moment there was quite a bit of euphoria. Everyone had a great time. We had people come in for this small gathering from around the country. I was proud. Went home and slept like a baby. My intrigue grew.


--------------------------FAST FORWARD TO 2025. 


I had hoped that I would encounter 2C-D again, but after 7 years I hadn't. So I decided to take matters into my own hands, and lets just say I made it available for the rest of my life.


First trial this run was 37mg. All of these experiences are with 2C-D Hemisulfate, so it is slightly less potent than the HCL, but not by much.

I took it and ran to a concert at a local park. I was surprised at the level of visuals, and also the heart opening effect. I came home so happy.


2nd trial was eyeballed but I would say it was close to 75mg. At this dosage, it resembled mescaline more than any other 2C that ive tried (ive tried most). I had kind of hoped that it would be erotic enhancing, but it did the opposite. I felt so spiritually satisfied that the idea of sex or orgasm just wasn't in my mind (not the case with 2C-B or 2C-I) in that sense it felt more like 2C-E, but a lot gentler. I was actually reminded of MDMA during this experience. The visuals were there but never overwhelming.


Since then, I have only taken microdoses, and the effects while arent quite as pronounced, are still obvious. I've taken it as low as 3mg and still seem to feel it, tho my preffered dosage is probably around 10mg. It never approaches MDMA, 2C-E, or Mescaline effects at this dosage. Its something different. Its like a more entheogenic and less stimulating adderal. Every day that I did take a small dose of 2C-D was just amazing. I achieved my daily goals w ease. Even on days that i woke up feeling doubtful or hungover, I would take 5-15mg and my day would be so much better. I did this maybe a dozen times or so and mostly, " results were similar.


Last night I took 7.5mg and went to a Choctaw fire ceremony. We wrote on 2 pieces of paper. On one we wrote some something we want to leave or exit our lives, on the other we wrote something we want in our lives. I didn't tell anyone that I had taken the 2C-D. The leader of the ceremony though seemed to notice anyway. I had met him prior to the beginning of the ceremony and we both exchanged knowing glances. Throughout the ceremony in between songs he would call me out and say "HEY! what do you think of this ceremony. I threw my intentions into the fire and replied "Thank you for bringing us together". I left the ceremony ended, got home and slept like a baby. I think 2C-D's after effects linger. More than 2C-B or 2C-I

This is a great retrospective.  I too have noticed a subtle connection between 2C-D and mescaline, but I still think 2C-D comes with a kind of 2C-X-base effect, if that makes sense.


To change the subject, I'm somewhat curious about a 2C-D + psilocybe mushrooms combo.  Anyone tried that before?  My thinking is that the 2C-D might add energy and clarity to the mushrooms, or perhaps the mushrooms would provide some grounding and depth to the 2C-D.  I also think they have at least roughly similar timelines and durations with the mushrooms perhaps setting in a little faster and lasting a little longer.

All I said was... out of all of the 2C's ive taken... 2C-D at high dose is more like mescaline than another 2C...


On your side note... I have also explored 2C-D as a potentiator like sasha described. I've combined it with very low levels of 5-Meo-DMT and 5-Meo-MIPT

Um...


They potentiate eachother.. 


specifically with 5-meo-mipt. 

(7.5mg of 2C-D orally) I hit the residue of a pipe that I'd previously smoked and carefully weighed out 2.5mg of 5-meo-dmt and 7.5mg of 5 meo-mipt...


The 2C-D is ever present. is this the psychedelic tofu that sasha mentioned?

Very cool, interesting read and I like to see this compound appreciated. I'm currently all out of it. I intended to trip with it this week, but then realised that some microbial contamination has gotten to the aq. solution. I had previously just hoped it would keep clean, starting from distilled water without preservatives trying to minimise handling. Unfortunately I'm all out of good luck on that front. Fortunately it was only a few doses, like 100 mg at most. I've been making the switch to propandiol. I do have great hope I'll come across a significant quantity again though.


I am aware that everyone is different, but one of the qualities I like about 2C-D is the entire lack of entactogen-ish qualities. It is a very clear and insightful headspafe for me without any hedonistic distractions, which I really appreciate about it.


[@Didgital](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/496462/) I'm curious, how long does a full dose aft for you? Also, I think (still not) addressed in the social tripping threads, but how do you respond to low doses (~ < 10 mg)? Do they interfere with everyday life, rational thought, learning, or does it enhance this for you?


PS: From what I remember in the pharmacology notebooks I think Shulgin kept the dosages rather small, which may be the reason for his assessment.

I looked at Erowid and couldn't find any report of mushrooms combined with 2C-D.  I did find a handful of reports of mushrooms combined with other 2C-X and 2C-T-X.  Only a few were especially informative, but the better reports suggest neutral to favorable results.  One report for (IIRC) 2C-B + mushrooms expressed frustration because they didn't seem to really potentiate each other---"it was like having two +2 trips at the same time."  Reports involving 2C-I and mushrooms were more favorable, suggesting that they synergized in many ways including visually.  Reports involving 2C-E and mushrooms suggested this combo could produce trips that were particularly profound, but there were only a few of these.


It seems like the combo may be worth a shot, but I have my reservations.  Unfortunately 2C-D and mushrooms both tend to give me rather rough physical come-ups.  I'd hate to get stuck with the worst of both worlds there, but who knows.  Right now I'm leaning toward just taking some mushrooms tomorrow and saving a combo until I have a bit more "current" experience with both of these things at higher doses.  (The last times I had decently strong trips on either of these was over a decade ago.)

At high doses +75mg its very enactogenic imo, tho not especially tactile but i do get heart opening and physical tingles.. the heart opening is especially pronounced after the plateu. it never gets super visual, but is still psychedelic, never overwhelming. Colors, lights, maybe some geometric CEVs. Out of all of the compunds ive tried it (including TMA-2) sorta mirrors mescaline (like most 2C-x), the most. 


This becomes more apparent at higher doses. I will agree its way less tactile than most  common empathogens, and a


Mescaline to me def an enactogenic effect. It feels like a spacier, more visual and slower MDA.


2C•D has smooth stimulant/ light psychedelic/ and empathogen all rolled into one to me.


It does have minor tactile effects and one observation of mine, is that duration def increases w dosage. W the 4 alkyl 2C-x's i have tend to have a particular afterglow effect, that  after im done tripping, im still high. At high doses of 2C-D, i feel altered for a good 10 hrs . At lower doses, (less than 35mg) im usually 95% back around 5 hrs. Microdoses of 7.5mg i still feel for approx 5 hrs.


The empathogenic effects seem to present themselves at higher doses, while the stimulant side never gets... worrying in any way


While i say its an amazing psychedelic, i would refute the pihkal entry that says its just as psychedelic as 2c-b, tho i believe that entry was 150mg, Ive only taken hapf that dose, and i dont think i need to take more than that again


Ive mostly taken it 7.5-15mg. Its wonderful... i insufflated 10mg the other day, i prefer it orally...
