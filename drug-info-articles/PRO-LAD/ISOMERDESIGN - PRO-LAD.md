## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 135 μg, orally) âA strange development into a sort of paranoia place, without any reasonable dialog with my partner. A light-headed experience of a different kind, but we did not find common space. Not too comfortableâemotions are dull. At about mid-experience, considerable visuals came into play, with easy fantasy interlocking with music. BrÃ¼chnerâs âViola quintette in Aâ viola quintette in A produced extraordinary castle frames within castle walls. Emotions were reknit, food was good, and sleep fine at the 8th or 9th hour. It is not up to LSD (if that is your standard) because it is basically not like LSD.â

(with 175 μg, orally) âThis is an intellectually clear material, but it is a funny material. I am certainly at a +++ or at least I was a couple of hours ago. How does one describe PRO-LAD? Itâs not-quite-this and not-quite-that sort of stuff. Or, to borrow from Winnie-the-Pooh, âItâs not at the bottom, and itâs not at the top (but this is the stair where I always stop)ââoh, never mind. I mean, Iâm not sure how to categorize this material. Itâs pleasant, itâs fine for fooling around, itâs good for humor, even excellent. Itâs very good for clear thinking, although not cosmic-type particularly. Itâs a sort of nice, comfortable, middle-American, July-Fourth-Picnic, apple-pie with ice cream sort of psychedelic, the kind that you can wrap up in gold and white striped paper for your youngest aunt, the one who likes to think sheâs really a bit wild, you knowâthe kind of psychedelic thatâs a bit much for your Dad or Mom, but itâs just jazzy enough to keep some younger relatives happy with you for a few months. However, I must tell you, kid, if you try to bring this to the Big Town, wellâ¦ It is pretty much dropped off, now. Ah'm gonna lie mahself on down.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
N-Propynyl-nor-LSD (PARGY-LAD). Some activity at 160 μg. Active at 500 μg.

N-Butyl-nor-LSD (BU-LAD). Something at 500 μg.

N-Phenethyl-nor-LSD (PHENETH-LAD). Nothing at 500 μg.

As these substituents get heavier and heavier, the potency of the products drop by an order of magnitude or so, or even more. But here, in this N-substituted nor-LSD family, there is a fantastic research opportunity just waiting to be exploited, an exact parallel to the radio-iodine labeling of DOI as was described in PiHKAL. It is a good guess that this position is one of good metabolic stability. So what about putting on a small group that can be labeled with a reasonably long-lived positron isotope? A specific proposal: N-(2-fluoroethyl)-nor-LSD with an 18F radio-label. The compound should be makable rather quickly (nor-LSD and 18FCH2CH2I in DMF with potassium carbonate) and cleanly purified by centrifugal chromatography, all well within the almost two hour half-life considerations of radio-fluorine. Here is a group that would be (in theory) intrinsic to the central activity of the end product, N-(2-(18F)fluoroethyl)-nor-LSD. The end compound could be synthesized, purified, characterized and sterilized quickly, allowing its brain localization and central dynamics to be determined by PET scanning, with virtually no risk to the subject. Letâs call it FLUORETH-LAD.
