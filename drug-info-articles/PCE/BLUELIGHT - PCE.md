I wanted to start one of these "Small & Handy" threads for a long time and it seems now is the time because I might receive a yet unknown quantity of this rare dissociative. PCE, or eticyclidine, is one of the "base" arylcyclohexylamines (like PCP and PCM) and has never seen a mainstream market as of yet, and probably never will because it's scheduled in most countries. Information about this compound is scarce but there are two trip-reports from the same individual on Erowid ([TR 1](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=114164) and [TR 2](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=112776)). Hamilton Morris also did a podcast with this guy on Patreon, for anyone that wants to hear more about this compound. PCE is believed to be a bit more potent than PCP by weight and likely quite similar to 3-MeO-PCE or 3-Me-PCE in its subjective effects.


IUPAC name: N-Ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexanamine


[Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eticyclidine) for PCE


Here's a picture of its structure:

Have fun with it. I once had 500mg of tce once which is quite similar structurally and it was the best ach I ever had, rivaled only by ketamine.

Oh I wanted to try PCE for quite some time but unsure whether I'll have the luck. Also O-PCE quite took me the hope for PCE but given that seemingly most of the O-PCE around was either fake or impure, who knows.

Oh man, I have had PCE on my wish list for a long time.  I bet it's amazing.  I like all of the PCE compounds the  best out of all of the ACHs I've tried.


I hope you get to try it, and I'm glad you got to start a small and handy. ![:geek:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f913.png)

Alright, I got a quarter of a gram of PCE freebase in EtOH solution (12mg/mL) ready to be sampled. I’m probably going to start with 6mg (peroral) and report back once I do.

Have you tried PCP yet?  I'm sure many are curious about the comparisons between the two.

Unfortunately not. I gave my friend 300mg of 3-Cl-PCP to try a dehalogenation to PCP, but I don't know if it'll work. Would love to draw comparisons between the two.

Took 4mg of the freebase and it’s nice, feels similar to 3-MeO-PCE, but not as stimulating and much stronger per weight. That may change with higher doses though. I will abstain from taking more for now because I want to have it lab-tested first.

Alright fellas, Checkit got back to me with the results of two different PCE samples I submitted. The first sample was my PCE freebase / ethanol solution (mentioned above) and the second one was a small amount of some new, beige PCE fumarate powder.


Sample 1

submitted as: PCE freebase / ethanol

expected: //

unexpected: 1 unknown substance (not quantified)

remark: we could not detect any PCE in your sample but an unidentifiable substance with a similar structure to PCE.


Sample 2

submitted as: PCE fumarate

expected: PCE (not quantified)

unexpected: 1 unknown substance (not quantified)

remark: we detected an unknown substance in your sample alongside the PCE, which is likely a synthesis byproduct or an oxidation product.


First off, I am surprised that my PCE freebase solution didn't contain any PCE at all but an unknown substance. I have no idea what happened here, maybe the synth was botched or the PCE freebase reacted with the ethanol? Whatever it was, both batches were made by a friend of mine so an intentional mislabelling/rip-off can be ruled out. Unfortunately, these testing-facilities only tell you these results without giving out data like NMR graphs and so on. What I also find odd is that the "PCE freebase" sample was definitely very active, as I took 4mg of it by mouth before I received my result and had clear dissociative effects that were in line with what I expected from PCE. The smell is also very similar to the second sample which does contain PCE.

Anyway, I will most likely not ingest my first sample again until I know for sure what it is, but I will start a careful titration with the fumarate powder in the next couple of days and will release a report once I reach full activity.


Edit:

Checkit could not determine the unknown substances in either sample. They speculate that the unknown in the 2nd sample might be N-cyclohexylideneethylaine but this couldn’t be verified.

Had four trials with the PCE fumarate batch so far (2.7mg, 5.4mg, 7.5mg and 9.9mg (all taken by mouth)) and I gotta say that I really like it. Very warm, balanced, euphoric and fun. I am currently working on a large bioassay post which I will release when I've had ten trials at different dosage levels and ROA's

As I said it’s tce (which should be real similar to pce, maybe a bit weaker), it’s on par with ketamine. There are some ach related dissociatives that are even better I’ve heard.

Four days ago I had the opportunity to try PCE fumarate and I ended up plugging 10mg. I combined with phenibut, which I had been taking (~1.1-1.2g FAA) almost every day for the past month. My mood was really good before taking the PCE. I had a low-level hypomania and felt really positive about my life. My ability to verbally communicate had been getting better with each passing day of phenibut. It's ironic because while phenibut nukes my ability to concentrate or think abstractly, it maxes out my verbal processing ability and I'll deploy phrases and words in the moment that I would never access otherwise.


As soon as the PCE started hitting I lost contact with all my emotions. Everything became completely neutral. My brother called like every other day, but I didn't answer because I knew I would be stumbling over my words. Another friend called and told me I sounded depressed. I hated the state I was in.


Throughout the day it gradually became less unenjoyable, as the visual effects became more prominent and the headspace became less dissociating but more stimulating (and slightly more psychotic as well). It was actually not really stimulating at all for the first few hours, but at 12 hours in it was quite stimulating and I was thankful that I hadn't taken more.


To be fair, I don't think phenibut combines that well with dissociatives (off-the-top I've also combined it with K, MXE, and 3-Cl-PCP) because a subset of its effects intersects with a subset of the effects of dissociatives. The effects comprising this intersection are generally enjoyable, so that upon adding the dissociative you simply add the effects of dissociatives which lie outside of the intersection, and (at least at this point in my life) I find these added effects rather uncomfortable.


In the days that followed I can't say the PCE provided much of an afterglow. Instead I've felt I was recovering ever since. Dissociatives have always seemed to nuke my verbal processing, so ever since I've been trying to get back to the high point that phenibut was providing in that regard. They also compromise my semantic object recognition (i.e. the attachment of labels to an object in the visual scene) which is a function implemented in the the [ventral visual stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-streams_hypothesis#Ventral_stream). For example, when quickly turning my head an object will enter my field of vision and be classified as a cat even though I instantly know this is incorrect. Another thing that dissociatives tend to do is make me overanalyze interpersonal interactions, to the point of being far too concerned with the other person's perception of me. It isn't at all a positive effect and is just another reason why I feel like they are not constructive to me at this point.


As I've already sort of alluded to, it's difficult to tease apart the qualitative subtleties of dissociatives while on phenibut (due to the effects common to both of them). I know this wasn't so much of an analysis of the effects of PCE and I apologize for that, but I figured that given its rarity I would document my experience nonetheless.

After my last experience with PCE I wouldn't have expected to return to it anytime soon, but I've always been quite stubborn when it comes to dissociatives. I've had two more experiences with it since then. The first was a low dose (4mg RA) in combination with a lower dose of 3-Cl-PCP and that was a pretty enjoyable experience. Then yesterday I took the most PCE I've taken in a single session yet (15mg RA), spread out in a few doses over the course of a couple hours. I was going to take 5mg more but held off after it became extremely mentally stimulating. At that point I did a couple guided mindfulness meditations and that really helped bring me down to earth. The bodily awareness this activity gave me was quite remarkable.


I guess I should try to be a bit more precise than usual when it comes to describing the stimulating effects of dissociatives. There are components of both mental and physical stimulation which, when moving from one dissociative to the next, don't always co-vary in the same direction. For example, PCE is more mentally stimulating than 3-MeO-PCE but less physically stimulating. Relative to MXE, PCE is more stimulating both mentally and physically. Relative to MXE, I would say 3-MeO-PCE is more mentally stimulating but less physically stimulating.


Generally the less mentally stimulating, the easier a dissociative is to hole on. This is why I can't hole on 3-MeO-PCE but I can hole on MXE, despite MXE being more physically stimulating. Also, in general, there isn't an inverse relation between "how-strong-the-dissociation-feels" and the mental stimulation, which is counter to what you might expect. For example, 3-MeO-PCP is quite dissociating, but also quite mentally stimulating.


The main effects of PCE lasted at least 6 hours after my last dose, at which point I fell asleep. Overall, despite the above caveats, it does remind me of 3-MeO-PCE the most. It is also less visual than 3-MeO-PCE, which for me always added an oil painting veneer to the visual scene. Music is quite enjoyable on PCE and I was listening to a lot of The Velvet Underground. It's a great band to listen to on dissociatives. Their music is gritty yet soothing, uplifting despite the dark overtones, and these paradoxical themes are prevalent in dissociative experiences. Lou Reed was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, perhaps he was just doing too much PCP?


A majority of the times that I've taken dissociatives over the past couple years they made me quite depressed, despite the fact that they used to be my favorite substances. I didn't really get that yesterday so I'm not sure what changed. I did take piracetam for a week straight quite recently, so perhaps that reshuffled something in my brain.


Update: Fairly nice/strong residual effects even 36hr after last dose.

3meo-pce was a gem among a dirty class of drugs.

Mixing it with bumps of ketamine was like a High end version of mxe.

It's finally finished! I just uploaded my large PCE bioassay in the trip-report section, hopefully this behemoth of a post is somewhat interesting or useful to some.


##### PCE - Bioassay - Eight human trials with the unicorn dissociative eticyclidine.

The following post is an extensive overview of the dissociative anesthetic, N-Ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine (PCE / eticyclidine). This post is very thorough and features a collection of trip-reports and plenty of other information. Because of this, there might be some repetitive and redundant...

I've tried PCE like 3 more times now (so 6 experiences with it total) and my sweet spot seems to be about 10mg plugged. Lately I've been using it when I get in an emotional rut and it's really helped with that. Most of my initial experiences with it were when I was taking phenibut daily, and after the last experience or two I can say it's much more enjoyable and comfortable without phenibut.


The best experience I had with PCE was laying on the beach, hitting my wax pen, and just meditating. There was another time I combined it with HXE and it was unique, although I wouldn't repeat it. HXE is an odd one, more lucid than most other dissociatives, but quite hypnotic at the same time. It's got a decent body high too, although not on the level of something like MXE or MXiPr, and it has a sliver of nausea which is something I've never really experienced on other dissociatives.

Feel like I'm spamming the PCE board at this point but I have indulged in this substance a couple more times over the past two days (making for 8 experiences total). Each of these last two days I combined it with ketamine that I dried out of a vial.


Today it was blustery, grey, and rainy but I somehow got down to a secluded beach under a cliff overlooked by some amazing homes. Sat there thinking while alternating between listening to music and the waves. Felt really good and the visual effects were quite pleasant. Felt like I was able to really resolve an unhealthy relationship during this time, and I reached a place where I'm happy to be moving forward. Once it got dark I hit a pizza place up and had a nice lil conversation with some local fellow. Made it home safe afterwards and hit the wax pen which made the effects much more prominent. Thought about chilling out with a BZD but felt like I could make some good progress by facing the effects, and ended up being glad I did so.


It's crazy because the times that I was in the house over the past 2 days I felt so depressed and these substances didn't feel recreational at all. They felt like a chore I had to face. But when I got outside and saw how beautiful the world was they became recreational substances and I felt much happier than I otherwise would have.


Hopefully I won't have any more PCE reports going forward my New Year's resolution is to quit all substances other than psychs because I've been consuming far too many drugs over the past year and have become much stupider as a result. My motivation has become shit as well, but I think that's mostly the increased porn intake (my other resolution). Anyways, mostly I blame the former on the months of daily phenibut usage which I was using to deal with my stomach. But thankfully I'm at a somewhat better place with that and I've been able to eliminate the phenibut. But I had been using alcohol and weed way too much lately and they certainly don't do my brain any favors either.

You are not spamming, but the opposite, gving super interesting datapoints on one of the most obscure compounds out there. Its a pity that you are finishing your eassys with it.


OTOH; I totally relate to your conclusions. I myself quitted 98% of porn usage during the last 2 years. It feels fantastic. Also quitted most drugs except psychs and some spare dissos too. Feeling healthier than ever.


Other changes that felt great this years: hitting the gym and going mostly carnivore. Totally gamechangers...

Sat there thinking while alternating between listening to music and the waves. Felt really good and the visual effects were quite pleasant. Felt like I was able to really resolve an unhealthy relationship during this time, and I reached a place where I'm happy to be moving forward. Once it got dark I hit a pizza place up and had a nice lil conversation with some local fellow. Made it home safe afterwards and hit the wax pen which made the effects much more prominent. Thought about chilling out with a BZD but felt like I could make some good progress by facing the effects, and ended up being glad I did so.

My motivation has become shit as well, but I think that's mostly the increased porn intake (my other resolution). Anyways, mostly I blame the former on the months of daily phenibut usage which I was using to deal with my stomach. But thankfully I'm at a somewhat better place with that and I've been able to eliminate the phenibut. But I had been using alcohol and weed way too much lately and they certainly don't do my brain any favors either.

I used it a number of times back in 2017-18. Probably my favorite non-ketone ACH along with PCE, although I prefer PCE. They are similar visually, although 3-MeO-PCE I remember having more of an "oil painting" quality. PCE is visually gorgeous though, colors become much deeper and more dramatic.


3-MeO-PCE had a deeper headspace too, but it also made my muscles feel quite stiff so I disliked moving around on it. Although one of my best 3-MeO-PCE experiences was hiking up to an outcropping overlooking Boulder, Colorado and coloring with my friend, so you can still get around on it. PCE just feels much more transparent in the body than 3-MeO-PCE.


Oh yea, and 3-MeO-PCE always left me with insane amounts of motivation for a couple weeks afterward, which is something I never really got from any other dissociatives. It's one of the only ACH's with significant DAT affinity, so I imagine this DRI activity might be part of the reason.

I made a lot of progress in the gym this year and my upper body lifts are at all time highs, that's the main reason I'm not thrilled about taking dissociatives for days in a row. Thankfully my weight hasn't really dipped, but that may be because I haven't been redosing.


Btw I took PCE for the 3rd day in a row today. Was feeling really good and decided to push onwards for one more day. I feel fairly charismatic and capable of emotion on it so it wouldn't be a bad social drug, which is in contrast to ketamine, which makes me want to hide inside my house. I will point out that my initial experience with PCE had a very blunting emotional effect (although that was in combination with phenibut). Clearly the effects of dissociatives on emotions are quite complex and depend on a number of factors.

Not sourcing or anything, but im curious in what circles pce is even exists?


Because even pcp is this mythical thing here in Europe.

Ive never heard of anyone trying it except a friend who did it at some Russian psy festival.

From what ive heard its quite non existent except some cities in the US and Canada.


But pce is another level of niche, is it like chemistry students who make it for fun?

Or is there some kind of weird pce scene?

I will say that I've had very little cognitive impairment for having used dissociatives 3 days in a row (used about 500mg K and 25-30mg PCE in that time). I actually feel quite sharp currently. If I had used phenibut even a couple days prior, my mind would be much cloudier. At first I thought this was a quality of the PCE, but now I'm thinking it might be that I've taken 1.5g/day Lion's Mane for about the past week. Thought about having more PCE today but it was rainy and I ended up going to the gym instead. Felt really, really good regardless so I'm glad I held off. Had a bit of weed just vibing listening to rain sounds.


Edit:


I see now that after my first experience with PCE I noticed some deficits with semantic object recognition along with some psychotic thought-patterns, which is something I generally observe after taking dissociatives. Dissociatives generally trash my working memory as well, especially if I'm mixing with weed. However, I've noticed like zero issues in those departments over the past few days. The only thing I noticed was a very brief OCD-like thought pattern earlier today, which is something dissociatives have always brought to the surface for me.


So now I'm thinking definitely it is the Lion's Mane, which is cool, because it didn't really interfere with any of the positive effects.

Yeah dissios really shred your memory and cognition in weird ways.

Esp on ket if i do high doses where i hole out.

But the same dose spread out over longer time doesnt give me as bad effects after.


So i dont think its purily the chemicals having side effects.

Its probably also related to the subjective effects.

Like doing 500mg spread out over 6h vs 2h etc.

Its the same total amount for my body to break down.

But if i aim for a deep hole i will be alot more sluggish for a few days compared to if i just spread out the dose a bit.

Ended up using PCE 6 of the past 8 days. Bit of a pyramid set (3 days on, 1 off, 2 on, 1 off, 1 on). Sticking to 1 dose plugged (~8-10mg) per day, no desire to redose. One day I did use a higher dose (13mg) and it wasn't as enjoyable, as I started to enter the claymation/putty zone. At lower doses it's more stimulating, warm and colorful. higher doses it becomes darker, colder, more removed, and less cheerful.


Damn I like this stuff though. Although a few days ago I was on it at the beach along with I guess a good bit of THC and I lost my phone. Didn't have it backed up so I lost all my pictures and my BTC wallet. Looked everywhere for it but nothing. Normally this would have absolutely ruined my day and probably the rest of the week but as I was starting to get upset I was able to calm myself down and think positively. I feel like I was able to flip some master switch that assigns a negative bias to my internal assesment of basically any situation (whether that be the unknown outcome of some event, other people's intentions, etc). My mom used to be like this and while it might be a strategy to occupy some stable evolutionary niche, it's not at all enjoyable way to live. I've been so much happier, friendly, less judgmental, etc, ever since that happened.


I've been surprised how little cognitive impairment there has been on the off days and really even most of the on days. I actually feel like my brain has woken up, which after months on phenibut I felt pretty dumbed down. None of the psychiatric symptoms that dissociatives often give me, which is surprising to me especially considering that I've been using THC more than average. I think a big part of this is the Lion's Mane, which I can't say I know much about how it works, but it's something I want to look into now. Also have been taking 850mg NMN and 150-200mg caffeine each morning,


Pretty good duration on this stuff, as the effects don't really wane for the first 8 hours. Feels very comfortable in the system during that time, after which it develops a bit of a pressor effect, although I've been combatting this with 10-20mg propranolol. It definitely has an effect into the next day (actually the days I abstained were two of the best days I had the past week), but it's more stimulating, colorful, bright, and not really dissociating at all.


Doesn't seem to alter basal metabolic rate or fluid levels much, as I've been able to almost maintain my weight (down a couple pounds over the past week, but I haven't been eating as much either). A lot of dissociatives tend to throw off my body temperature and can also make me perspire, but I haven't really gotten those from the PCE either.


Best part is this stuff is super social. I feel like my interactions with strangers over the past week have been much more beneficial for me. I was able to say things I felt were original and they didn't feel like empty interactions. I'm pretty cool with my neighbor and we've hung out a couple times, but even talking to him I felt so much more connection and camaraderie. It's like I don't care what people think of me anymore (which is a big issue for me normally), but not in a superiority-type way either.


Overall the past week has been really good. I feel like I'm getting back to myself after I spent much of the past year trying to be someone that isn't true to me. I even made a really big change that's gonna keep me a lot busier going forward, and I'm really happy about that.


PCE you amazing lady ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)
