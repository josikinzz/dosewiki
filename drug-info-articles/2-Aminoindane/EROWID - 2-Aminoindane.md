DESCRIPTION #
 
[2-Aminoindan Images](https://erowid.org/2_aminoindan_images.shtml)
 
2-Aminoindan (also referred to as 2-Indanamine or 2-AI) is a short acting stimulant with effects that have been compared to 1-benzylpiperazine or methamphetamine. There is very little known about its recreation use. It has recently become available on the research chemical market (2003). It is available primarily as an off-white powder and reports have all been for oral use.

Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
2-Aminoindan.
 
The Experience:
 
No common terms known.
 
EFFECTS #
 
Effects descriptions vary, but there is agreement that 2-aminoindan is stimulating. While some published and unpublished reports have been quite positive, around half of those describing their experiences to Erowid have said they've found it more jittery and uncomfortable than amphetamine or methamphetamine. 
 
 At this time (December 2003), there are too few reports to have a solid profile of the character of the 2-aminoindan experience.
 
Onset #
 
From initial reports, onset seems to be relatively fast, from 10-30 minutes.
 
Duration #
 
Duration of effects is uncertain, but has been reported as "somewhat shorter than Methamphetamine".
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
One material safety data sheet reportedly states that 2-Aminoindan releases dangerous fumes when burned. This suggests not smoking it though little is known about this reaction.
 
Contraindications #
 
- As with most stimulants, those with heart problems or with a family history of heart disease may be at greater risk of heart problems due to increased heart rate and blood pressure.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Early reports suggest that there may be noticeable addiction potential. Individuals who tried 2-Aminoindan orally reported significant desire to re-dose after a few hours as well as the next day.
