## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as xanthines. These are purine derivatives with a ketone group conjugated at carbons 2 and 6 of the purine moiety.

### Background

Caffeine is a drug of the methylxanthine class used for a variety of purposes, including certain respiratory conditions of the premature newborn, pain relief, and to combat drowsiness. Caffeine is similar in chemical structure to
Theophylline
and
Theobromine
.

,
16
It can be sourced from coffee beans, but also occurs naturally in various teas and cacao beans, which are different than coffee beans.
12
Caffeine is also used in a variety of cosmetic products and can be administered topically, orally, by inhalation, or by injection.
12
The caffeine citrate injection, used for apnea of the premature newborn, was initially approved by the FDA in 1999.
19
According to an article from 2017, more than 15 million babies are born prematurely worldwide. This correlates to about 1 in 10 births. Premature birth can lead to apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a condition that interferes with lung development and may eventually cause asthma or early onset emphysema in those born prematurely.
5
Caffeine is beneficial in preventing and treating apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns, improving the quality of life of premature infants.
12

### Indication

Caffeine is indicated for the short term treatment of apnea of prematurity in infants and off label for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia caused by premature birth.
12
,
16
In addition, it is indicated in combination with sodium benzoate to treat respiratory depression resulting from an overdose with CNS depressant drugs.
23
Caffeine has a broad range of over the counter uses, and is found in energy supplements, athletic enhancement products, pain relief products, as well as cosmetic products.

### Absorption

Caffeine is rapidly absorbed after oral or parenteral administration, reaching peak plasma concentration within 30 minutes to 2 hours after administration.
10
After oral administration, onset of action takes place within 45 to 1 hour.
15
Food may delay caffeine absorption. The peak plasma level for caffeine ranges from 6-10mg/L.
16
The absolute bioavailability is unavailable in neonates
16
, but reaches about 100% in adults.
12

### Metabolism

Caffeine metabolism occurs mainly in the liver via the cytochrome CYP1A2 enzyme.
10
The products of caffeine metabolism include paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline. The first step of caffeine metabolism is demethylation, yielding paraxanthine (a major metabolite), followed by theobromine, and theophylline, which are both minor metabolites. They are then excreted in urine as urates after additional metabolism.
10
,
12
,
16
The enzymes xanthine oxidase and N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) also participate in the metabolism of caffeine.

### Half-life

In an average-sized adult or child above the age of 9, the half-life of caffeine is approximately 5 hours. Various characteristics and conditions can alter caffeine half-life.  It can be reduced by up to 50% in smokers. Pregnant women show an increased half-life of 15 hours or higher, especially in the third trimester. The half-life in newborns is prolonged to about 8 hours at full-term and 100 hours in premature infants, likely due to reduced ability to metabolize it. Liver disease or drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 can increase caffeine half-life.

### Toxicity

The oral LD50 of caffeine in rats is 192 mg/kg.
MSDS
An acute fatal overdose of caffeine in humans is about 10–14 grams (equivalent to 150–200 mg/kg of body weight).
14
Caffeine overdose
In the case of caffeine overdose, seizures may occur, as caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It should be used with extreme caution in those with epilepsy or other seizure disorders.
16
Symptoms of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal upset. Intoxication with caffeine is included in the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).  Agitation, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, tachycardia, tremors, tachycardia, psychomotor agitation, and, in some cases, death can occur, depending on the amount of caffeine consumed.  Overdose is more likely to occur in individuals who do not consume caffeine regularly but consume energy drinks.
8
Overdose management
For a mild caffeine overdose, offer symptomatic treatment. In the case of a severe overdose, intubation for airway protection from changes in mental status or vomiting may be needed. Activated charcoal and hemodialysis can prevent further complications of an overdose and prevent absorption and metabolism. Benzodiazepine drugs can be administered to prevent or treat seizures.  IV fluids and vasopressors may be necessary to combat hypotension associated with caffeine overdose. In addition, magnesium and beta blocking drugs can be used to treat arrhythmias that may occur, with defibrillation and resuscitation if the arrhythmias are lethal. Follow local ACLS protocols.

### Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action of caffeine is complex, as it impacts several body systems, which are listed below. The effects as they relate to various body systems are described as follows:
General and cellular actions
Caffeine exerts several actions on cells, but the clinical relevance is poorly understood. One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism.
8
,
18
Phosphodiesterase enzymes regulate cell function via actions on second messengers cAMP and cGMP.
9
This causes lipolysis through activation of hormone-sensitive lipases, releasing fatty acids and glycerol.
14
Respiratory
The exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others.
16
The blocking of the adenosine receptors enhances respiratory drive via an increase in brain medullary response to carbon dioxide, stimulating ventilation and respiratory drive, while increasing contractility of the diaphragm.
12
Central nervous system
Caffeine demonstrates antagonism of all 4 adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, A3) in the central nervous system.
12
,
16
Caffeine's effects on alertness and combatting drowsiness are specifically related to the antagonism of the A2a receptor.
12
Renal system
Caffeine has diuretic effects due to is stimulatory effects on renal blood flow, increase in glomerular filtration, and increase in sodium excretion.
12
Cardiovascular system
Adenosine receptor antagonism at the A1 receptor by caffeine stimulates inotropic effects in the heart. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body.  In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation. Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by 5 to 10 mmHg when it is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.
12
The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.

### Volume of distribution

Caffeine has the ability to rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier. It is water and fat soluble and distributes throughout the body.
12
,
14
,
16
Caffeine concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of preterm newborns are similar to the concentrations found in the plasma. The mean volume of distribution of caffeine in infants is 0.8-0.9 L/kg and 0.6 L/kg in the adult population.
16

### Protein binding

Plasma protein binding of caffeine has not been determined for neonates or infants. In vitro studies indicate a protein binding of about 10%-36%. Caffeine is reversibly bound to plasma proteins.
14
,
16

### Route of elimination

The major metabolites of caffeine can be found excreted in the urine.
12
About 0.5% to 2% of a caffeine dose is found excreted in urine, as it because it is heavily absorbed in the renal tubules.
14
,
10

### Clearance

The clearance of caffeine varies, but on average, is about 0.078 L/kg/h (1.3 mL/min/kg).

### General Function

Broad substrate specificity ATP-dependent transporter of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family that actively extrudes a wide variety of physiological compounds, dietary toxins and xenobiotics from cells (PubMed:11306452, PubMed:12958161, PubMed:19506252, PubMed:20705604, PubMed:28554189, PubMed:30405239, PubMed:31003562). Involved in porphyrin homeostasis, mediating the export of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) from both mitochondria to cytosol and cytosol to extracellular space, it also functions in the cellular export of heme (PubMed:20705604, PubMed:23189181). Also mediates the efflux of sphingosine-1-P from cells (PubMed:20110355). Acts as a urate exporter functioning in both renal and extrarenal urate excretion (PubMed:19506252, PubMed:20368174, PubMed:22132962, PubMed:31003562, PubMed:36749388). In kidney, it also functions as a physiological exporter of the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (By similarity). Also involved in the excretion of steroids like estrone 3-sulfate/E1S, 3beta-sulfooxy-androst-5-en-17-one/DHEAS, and other sulfate conjugates (PubMed:12682043, PubMed:28554189, PubMed:30405239). Mediates the secretion of the riboflavin and biotin vitamins into milk (By similarity). Extrudes pheophorbide a, a phototoxic porphyrin catabolite of chlorophyll, reducing its bioavailability (By similarity). Plays an important role in the exclusion of xenobiotics from the brain (Probable). It confers to cells a resistance to multiple drugs and other xenobiotics including mitoxantrone, pheophorbide, camptothecin, methotrexate, azidothymidine, and the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin, through the control of their efflux (PubMed:11306452, PubMed:12477054, PubMed:15670731, PubMed:18056989, PubMed:31254042). In placenta, it limits the penetration of drugs from the maternal plasma into the fetus (By similarity). May play a role in early stem cell self-renewal by blocking differentiation (By similarity). In inflammatory macrophages, exports itaconate from the cytosol to the extracellular compartment and limits the activation of TFEB-dependent lysosome biogenesis involved in antibacterial innate immune response
