## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 0.76 g LAH in 50 mL anhydrous THF was stirred under an inert atmosphere, and treated with the dropwise addition of a solution of 2.27 g N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)tryptamine in 30 anhydrous THF. The reaction mixture was held at reflux for 40 min, then cooled to 40 Â°C and the excess hydride destroyed with the addition of 50% aqueous THF. The solids were removed by filtration, washed with THF, the filtrate and washings combined, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue was impure N-methyltryptamine (NMT) as could be used without purification in the following alkylation. The isolation, purification and characterization of this intermediate amine is described in the NMT recipe, and of course the pure NMT can be used in the following reductive alkylation.

The crude N-methyltryptamine obtained above (which can be substituted with 1.20 g of pure NMT) was dissolved in 50 mL EtOH ethanol, treated with 1.0 mL acetone, then with 0.5 g 10% Pd/C, and the reaction mixture shaken under a hydrogen atmosphere at 50 psi for 15 h. The catalyst was removed by filtration through a bed of Celite, the filtrate was stripped of solvent under vacuum, and the solid residue recrystallized from Et2O/hexane to give 0.93 g N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine (MIPT) which had a mp 82â83 Â°C. Fom the benzyloxycarbonyltryptamine, yield was 56%. From NMT the yield was 62% of theory. Anal: C14H20N2. C,H,N. MS (in m/z): C5H12N+ 86 (100%); indolemethylene+ 130 (10%); parent ion 216 (2%). Efforts to isopropylate NMT with an excess of isopropyl iodide in IPA isopropanol gave a 51% yield of a distilled product that did not crystallize.

(from N-isopropyltryptamine, NIPT): A solution of 0.47 g of N-isopropyltryptamine hydrochloride in 50 mL H2O was made basic with 5% aqueous NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã40 mL CH2Cl2. The pooled extracts were stripped of solvent and the solid residue was dissolved in 25 mL IPA and treated with 0.35 g CH3I. After 3 h at reflux, an additional 10 mL IPA and 0.14 g CH3I were added and the reflux continued for 6 h. After removal of the solvent under vacuum, the residue was partitioned between dilute base and CH2Cl2. Removal of the solvent under vacuum yielded 0.29 g of an oil that was shown chromatographically to be a mixture of NIPT and MIPT in a 3:2 ratio. This was treated with 0.35 g CH3I in 25 mL IPA and allowed to stand at room temperature for several days. A small quantity of crystals separated (N,N-dimethyl-N-isopropyltryptammonium iodide) which were removed by filtration. The filtrate was stripped of solvent under vacuum, and the residue again partitioned, as above, between aqueous NaOH and CH2Cl2. After removing the organic solvent, the residue (0.23 g NIPT to MIPT ratio 2:3) was treated with 0.5 g acetic anhydride, heated on the steam bath for 1 h, diluted with 5% aqueous NaOH and stirred for 2 h. This was extracted with 3Ã40 mL CH2Cl2, the extracts were pooled, and then extracted with 3Ã40 mL 1  N H2SO4. The pooled acid extracts were made basic with NaOH, reextracted with CH2Cl2 which, on pooling and the removal of the solvent under vacuum, gave 0.12 g of a colorless oil. Distillation at 0.1 mm/Hg (140â150 Â°C) gave 0.06 g (a 15% yield) of N-Isopropyl-N-methyltryptamine as a colorless oil that spontaneously crystallized.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 10 mg, orally) âThere is no question but what this is active. I felt it just a half hour after taking it, and was somewhat disappointed to see it disappear over the next couple of hours. A very good feeling, quite randy.â

(with 10 mg, orally) âDefinitely active, mild excitement, dry mouth, some muscle tension in the back of the neck. At 75 minutes, definitely rolling, but still no visual effects. Finally subsiding. Not unpleasant, although a feeling of restlessness persists. Tailing insomnia for 6â8 hours.â

(with 20 mg, orally) âMy handwriting is shot. There are almost no visuals, so why am I at a plus two? I feel very alert. Tried to sleep and ended up talking for quite a while instead The overall experience can best be described as âmildâ.â

(with 25 mg, orally) âQuite an active dose. Same initial effects as with 10 milligrams, but considerably more excitement, central stimulation. At an hour, the effects seem to have plateaued. Enhancement of visual field, i.e., brightened colors, clearly defined objects. Definite auditory effects, and I can pick out each sound with clear definition. Very âheady,â but still remarkably free of visual distortion. Slight mydriasis. As it subsides, there is some muscle tension in the jaws, but much milder than with MDA or even psilocin.â

(with 20 mg, by insufflation) âImmediate onset (less than a minute) and to ++. A little dizziness. My first thought is, âThis is definitely psychedelic.â Everything looked brighter, and vision was tinted orange. Everything appeared as if under an orange overlay. No other visual changes to speak of. Skin, hearing, sensitive. All-in-all, however, sensory changes were minor. The effects on thought were more typically psychedelic. The spin-offs, tangents, and implications of different threads of thought became apparent, and I could watch them unfold with my mindâs eye. These effects gradually tapered off over the next three and a half hours or so. During this time, interaction with my companions was facile, and we had a good conversation. This compound seems to emphasize âpsychedelicâ effects over âhallucinogenicâ effects.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The isomer of MIPT with a considerably less bunched up propyl group, N-methyl-N-propyltryptamine or MPT. This was made via the amide from indoleglyoxyl chloride and methylpropylamine, and reduction with LAH. MS (in m/z): C5H12N+ 86 (100%); indolemethylene+ 130 (8%); parent ion 216 (1%). Several human trials, up to twenty milligrams orally, showed no effects of any kind, so the activity, if there is any, is definitely less than that of MIPT. So the lumpiness of the isopropyl may be playing some role. There is no other way that is obvious of challenging this without adding more carbon atoms, and that would introduce another variable. This same decoration scheme has been used successfully in several other of the tryptamines in this story.

A couple points of passing interest. As to stability: many of the free-base tryptamines are sensitive to air oxidation, some of them extremely so. This particular base, standing for a goodly number of years with no particular protection from air, has remained almost colorless, with no apparent signs of decomposition. And as to subjective effects: there is almost a total lack of visual phenomena. There were no wave-forms, color distortion or object shape changes, and no eyes-closed imagery, unlike most N,N-disubstituted tryptamines.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Common: 10 - 25 mg
- Strong: 25 - 75 mg
- Heavy: 75 - 200 mg

**Duration:**
- Total: 3 - 8 hours

**N-Methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine** (also known as **MiPT** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is structurally related to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , along with other analogs such as [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) , [MPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MPT) , and [MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MET) .

MiPT was first synthesized and investigated by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) and described in his book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"). In the commentary, Shulgin notes that "there is almost a total lack of visual phenomena... no wave-forms, color distortion or object shape changes, and no eyes-closed imagery, unlike most N,N-disubstituted tryptamines."

Subjective effects include hallucinatory states, [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . Its effects are generally described as mild, indistinct, and highly variable between users. In contrast to many related tryptamines, it is able to be taken [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) .

Today, MiPT remains relatively uncommon and is either used as a recreational or an [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogenic) substance. It has been distributed online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) . Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MiPT in humans, and it has little history of human usage.

## Chemistry

MiPT, or N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure that comprises a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. Unlike [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , which contains two methyl groups, MiPT contains groups of one methyl and one isopropyl carbon chains bound to the terminal amine RN of its tryptamine backbone. MiPT is the methyl analog of [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) .

## Pharmacology

Like with most [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) tryptamines, MiPT is thought to act principally as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The psychedelic effects are believed to come from MiPT's binding efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors.

However, the role of these interactions and how it results in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

The sensory effects of MiPT are said to be similar to those of DiPT but with less intensity at the same dose, and without the same bias towards producing auditory distortions.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational MiPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because MiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from those who have tried MiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

As with many psychedelics, the use of MiPT has the potential to bring about long-lasting perceptual and psychological alterations. MiPT, in particular, is known to chronically alter the perception of sound and talking, which may not be suitable for everyone.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

MiPT is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with regular consumption. Like with most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , it is most often thought to be self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of MiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). MiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of MiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Due to its relative obscurity, the possession and sale of MiPT is unscheduled in most countries.

- **Germany** : MiPT is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Sweden** : Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying MiPT as a hazardous substance, on May 15, 2019.
- **Switzerland** : MiPT is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United Kingdom** : MiPT is a Class A controlled substance in the United Kingdom as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : MiPT is considered a schedule 1 controlled substance as a positional isomer of Diethyltryptamine (DET). MiPT is specifically mentioned by name in the DEA Orange Book , which lists all the controlled substances and other regulated chemicals in the US.

Methylisopropyltryptamine (MiPT), also known as N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family related to other psychedelics like dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT). It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a serotonin receptor modulator, including as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Derivatives of MiPT include 4-HO-MiPT (miprocin) and 5-MeO-MiPT (moxy).
MiPT was first described by David Repke and colleagues in 1981. It was subsequently evaluated and described in Alexander Shulgin's 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). MiPT was encountered as a novel designer drug by 2005.

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists MiPT's dose as 10 to 25 mg orally and its duration as 3 to 4 hours. A dose of 20 mg by insufflation was also reported. Its onset orally was reported to be 30 minutes and peak effects occurred at 1 hour. Conversely, its onset via insufflation was said to be immediate or less than 1 minute. Oral doses of up to 20 mg were described as being relatively mild in their effects. MiPT is notable in being the most potent of the simple N,N-dialkyltryptamines, at least via oral administration.
The effects of MiPT have been reported to include feeling "definitely psychedelic", being very "heady" (perhaps as in "psychedelic headspace"), effects on thoughts that were typically psychedelic, enhancement of visual field such as brighter colors and more clearly defined objects, vision tinted orange as if there was an orange overlay, an almost total absence of any other visual effects (including no wave-forms, color distortion, object shape changes, or closed-eye imagery), auditory effects such as enhanced sound discrimination, hearing and skin being more sensitive, and minor sensory changes in general. It was said to emphasize "psychedelic" effects over "hallucinogenic" effects. Other effects included feeling good, excitement, stimulation, feeling alert, restlessness, and trailing insomnia for 6 to 8 hours. Physical effects included pupil dilation, dizziness, dry mouth, and muscle tension.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MiPT acts as a serotonin receptor modulator. It shows affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2B receptors. The drug acts as a potent partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It shows weak affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), but does not act as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor or releasing agent even at very high concentrations.

## Chemistry

### Properties

MiPT base, unlike many other tryptamines in their freebase form, does not decompose rapidly in the presence of light or oxygen.

### Crystal structure

In August 2019, Chadeayne et al. solved the crystal structure of fumarate salt of MiPT.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of MiPT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of MiPT include 4-HO-MiPT, 4-AcO-MiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, methylethyltryptamine (MET), methylpropyltryptamine (MPT), ethylisopropyltryptamine (EiPT), propylisopropyltryptamine (PiPT), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT), among others.

## History

MiPT was first synthesized and described by David Repke and colleagues in 1981. Subsequently, MiPT was further described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe by 2005.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Sweden

Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying MiPT as a hazardous substance, on May 15, 2019.

#### United States

In the United States, MiPT is unscheduled but purchase, sale, or possession for human consumption could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.
