## Subjective Experience

This is classified by Erowid as a deliriant. It most certainly is, but does anyone
actually like being delirious? Is there any pleasure to be found in such a state? From
my experience the answer is a categorical no.

I gnawed on a nutmeg and a half, or whatever amount it was, several decades ago. I
won't even dignify its effects with the word trip. I was nauseous, dizzy, and unable to
grasp solidity, whilst simultaneously suffering terrible head pain in totally
unmitigated confusion. It was horrible in almost every conceivable way.

The next day it didn’t end: dry mouth, hangover, hell on earth. I thought I would die.
I was ill for days.

As I recall, it took so long to come-on that I thought I had eaten a dud. I waited
several hours, maybe more, and eventually I went to bed still waiting.

I awoke in the night to go to the toilet, and had to literally crawl there on my hands
and knees because I couldn’t stand. The floor was all over the place: my hands went
into it like they were going into thick glue and I had to pull them out with each lurch
forwards. My head was spinning sickeningly, my ears were ringing, and I was
struggling through a living dysphoric hell.

Quite apart from the nightmare of the ordeal, if you have too much this can kill you.
It can damage vital organs, leave you with serious medical issues, and not care a
hoot.

"According to the case studies from the Illinois Poison Center, even 10 grams
(approximately 2 teaspoons) of nutmeg is enough to cause symptoms of
toxicity." ~ healthline.com

I experienced no pleasure whatsoever. All I learned was to avoid it like the plague. I
still shudder after all these years just thinking about it.

There are some seriously good trips to experience, and this isn't one of them. I found
it to be a million miles removed.

An ordinary looking spice

I would suggest that experimenting with nutmeg presents an entirely pointless risk,
using your welfare and life as the stake, for a prize you don’t want. My unwavering
and sincere advice could not be clearer: don't do it.
