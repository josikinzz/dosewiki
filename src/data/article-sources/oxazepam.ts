## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1,4-benzodiazepines. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a 1,4-azepine.

### Background

Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting, 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and anxiety disorders. Oxazepam, like related 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine
lorazepam
, is considered less susceptible to pharmacokinetic variability based on patient-specific factors (e.g. age, liver disease) - this feature is advantageous as compared to other benzodiazepines, and is likely owing in part to oxazepam's relatively simple metabolism.
11
It is an active metabolite of both
diazepam
and
temazepam
12
and undergoes very little biotransformation following absorption, making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic interactions.
14

### Indication

Oxazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders and for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety.
14
It may also be used in the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
14

### Pharmacodynamics

Benzodiazepines, including oxazepam, exert their sedative and anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effects of endogenous GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS.
10
Compared to other benzodiazepines, it has relatively low potency and a moderate duration of action.
10
Oxazepam should be administered with caution to patients for whom a drop in blood pressure may lead to cardiac complications as, in rare cases, it may cause hypotension.
14

### Mechanism of Action

GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator
GABA(A) Receptor Benzodiazepine Binding Site
Ligand

### Absorption

Following oral administration, peak plasma levels (C
max
) averaged 450 mg/mL and occurred approximately 3 hours (T
max
) after dosing.
14

### Metabolism

Oxazepam has a single major inactive metabolite, a glucuronide conjugate.
14
The glucuronidation of the S-isomer is catalyzed by UGT2B15. The glucuronidation of the R-isomer is catalyzed by UGT2B7 and UGT1A9.

### Half-life

The mean elimination half-life of oxazepam is 8.2 hours.
14

### Toxicity

The oral LD
50
in rats and mice is >8000 mg/kg and 1540 mg/kg, respectively.
16
Symptoms of oxazepam overdose are likely to be consistent with its adverse effect profile and range from mild to severe, sometimes fatal, CNS depression.
14
Treatment should include gastric decontamination, via lavage or induced vomiting, followed by symptomatic and supportive measures. The benzodiazepine antagonist
flumazenil
may be used in hospitalized patients as an adjunct to non-pharmacological management, but may increase the risk of seizure in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose.
14

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Oxazepam is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Oxazepam may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Oxazepam which could result in a higher serum level.
Acemetacin
Acemetacin may decrease the excretion rate of Oxazepam which could result in a higher serum level.
Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen may decrease the excretion rate of Oxazepam which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Co-administration with alcohol may potentiate the CNS effects of oxazepam.

### Mechanism of action

Like other benzodiazepines, oxazepam exerts its anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain.
8
GABA(A) receptors are a component of GABA-gated ionotropic chloride channels that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials - following activation by GABA, the channel undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. The inhibitory potentials produced by GABA neurotransmission play an integral role in the suppression and control of epileptiform nerve firing such as that seen in epilepsy, which makes the GABA system a desirable target in the treatment of epilepsy.
Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) function. They bind to the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits on the receptor, commonly referred to as the benzodiazepine binding site, and modulate the receptor such that its inhibitory response to GABA binding is dramatically increased.

### Route of elimination

Oxazepam is primarily eliminated in the urine as its glucuronide metabolite, with the feces containing approximately 21% of the unchanged drug.
15
The majority of an orally ingested dose of oxazepam is excreted within 48 hours.

### Curator comments

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA(A) function by binding at the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits. Of the 6 α-subunits, only 4 (α-1, -2, -3, and -5) participate in the formation of this binding site. The above target is a collection of all α- and γ-subunits that are known to participate in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site.

### General Function

Binds water, Ca(2+), Na(+), K(+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin and drugs (Probable). Its main function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood (Probable). Major zinc transporter in plasma, typically binds about 80% of all plasma zinc (PubMed:19021548). Major calcium and magnesium transporter in plasma, binds approximately 45% of circulating calcium and magnesium in plasma (By similarity). Potentially has more than two calcium-binding sites and might additionally bind calcium in a non-specific manner (By similarity). The shared binding site between zinc and calcium at residue Asp-273 suggests a crosstalk between zinc and calcium transport in the blood (By similarity). The rank order of affinity is zinc > calcium > magnesium (By similarity). Binds to the bacterial siderophore enterobactin and inhibits enterobactin-mediated iron uptake of E.coli from ferric transferrin, and may thereby limit the utilization of iron and growth of enteric bacteria such as E.coli (PubMed:6234017). Does not prevent iron uptake by the bacterial siderophore aerobactin (PubMed:6234017)

## Effects
Oxazepam has a calming, relaxing, antispasmodic, anti-anxiety and sleep-inducing effect.
Taking benzodiazepines increases the effectiveness of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor. This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system. The flow of information in the brain between the brain cells (neurons) is thereby reduced / disturbed and feelings and perceptions are dampened.
The breakdown of the individual active ingredients of benzodiazepines in the body is age-dependent and therefore varies from person to person.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
There is little information available on risks, toxicity, side effects and long-term consequences. Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:
When mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!
Taking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.
Side effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.

### Long-term Risks
Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).
In addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur. In case of possible dependence, withdrawal should be discussed with a doctor beforehand and the withdrawal should be medically accompanied. It is extremely important that the dose is reduced gradually.

## Safer Use
- If medicines are obtained on the black market or on the internet and not from a pharmacy/medical facility, the contents are unclear. Have the medicine tested for the exact ingredients in a drug check!
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use benzodiazepines. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses can be much higher and fatal for new users.
- Blisters of counterfeits may look identical to the original packaging.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, opioids and/or other benzodiazepines is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!

  "wikipedia": `# Oxazepam
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxazepam*

Oxazepam is a short-to-intermediate-acting benzodiazepine. Oxazepam is used for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and to control symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
It is a metabolite of diazepam, prazepam, and temazepam, and has moderate amnesic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties compared to other benzodiazepines.
It was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964.

## Medical uses

Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine with a slow onset of action, so it is usually prescribed to individuals who have trouble staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. It is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders with associated tension, irritability, and agitation. It is also prescribed for drug and alcohol withdrawal, and for anxiety associated with depression. Oxazepam is sometimes prescribed off-label to treat social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and other conditions.

## Side effects

The side effects of oxazepam are similar to those of other benzodiazepines, and may include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, memory impairment, paradoxical excitement, and anterograde amnesia, but does not affect transient global amnesia.  Withdrawal effects due to rapid decreases in dosage or abrupt discontinuation of oxazepam may include abdominal and muscle cramps, seizures, depression, insomnia, sweating, tremors, or nausea and vomiting.
In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

### Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal

Oxazepam, as with other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause tolerance, physical dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from oxazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can occur, though, at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.

## Contraindications

Oxazepam is contraindicated in myasthenia gravis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and limited pulmonary reserve, as well as severe hepatic disease.

## Special precautions

Benzodiazepines require special precautions if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Benzodiazepines including oxazepam are lipophilic drugs and rapidly penetrate membranes, so rapidly crosses over into the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in floppy infant syndrome.

### Pregnancy

Oxazepam, when taken during the third trimester, causes a definite risk to the neonate, including a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including hypotonia, reluctance to suck, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth.

## Interactions

As oxazepam is an active metabolite of diazepam, an overlap in possible interactions is likely with other drugs or food, with exception of the pharmacokinetic CYP450 interactions (e.g. with cimetidine). Precautions and following the prescription are required when taking oxazepam (or other benzodiazepines) in combinations with antidepressants or opioids. Concurrent use of these medications can interact in a way that is difficult to predict. Drinking alcohol when taking oxazepam is not recommended. Concomitant use of oxazepam and alcohol can lead to increased sedation, memory impairment, ataxia, decreased muscle tone, and, in severe cases or in predisposed patients, respiratory depression and coma.

## Overdose

Oxazepam is generally less toxic in overdose than other benzodiazepines. Important factors which affect the severity of a benzodiazepine overdose include the dose ingested, the age of the patient, and health status prior to overdose. Benzodiazepine overdoses can be much more dangerous if a coingestion of other CNS depressants such as opiates or alcohol has occurred. Symptoms of an oxazepam overdose include:

Respiratory depression
Excessive somnolence
Altered consciousness
Central nervous system depression
Occasionally cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity
Rarely, deep coma

## Pharmacology

Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine of the 3-hydroxy family; it acts on benzodiazepine receptors, resulting in increased effect of GABA to the GABAA receptor which results in inhibitory effects on the central nervous system. The half-life of oxazepam is between 6 and 9 hours. It has been shown to suppress cortisol levels. Oxazepam is the most slowly absorbed and has the slowest onset of action of all the common benzodiazepines according to one British study.
Oxazepam is an active metabolite formed during the breakdown of diazepam, nordazepam, and certain similar drugs. It may be safer than many other benzodiazepines in patients with impaired liver function because it does not require hepatic oxidation, but rather, it is simply metabolized by glucuronidation, so oxazepam is less likely to accumulate and cause adverse reactions in the elderly or people with liver disease. Oxazepam is similar to lorazepam in this respect.
Preferential storage of oxazepam occurs in some organs, including the heart of the neonate. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the neonate, and withdrawal of oxazepam during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as oxazepam is excreted in breast milk.
Two milligrams of oxazepam equates to 1 mg of diazepam according to the benzodiazepine equivalency converter, therefore 20 mg of oxazepam according to BZD equivalency equates to 10 mg of diazepam and 15 mg oxazepam to 7.5 mg diazepam (rounded up to 8 mg of diazepam). Some BZD equivalency converters use 3 to 1 (oxazepam to diazepam), 1 to 3 (diazepam to oxazepam) as the ratio (3:1 and 1:3), so 15 mg of oxazepam would equate to 5 mg of diazepam.

## Chemistry

Oxazepam exists as a racemic mixture. Early attempts to isolate enantiomers were unsuccessful; the corresponding acetate has been isolated as a single enantiomer. Given the different rates of epimerization that occur at different pH levels, it was determined that there would be no therapeutic benefit to the administration of a single enantiomer over the racemic mixture.

## Frequency of use

Oxazepam, along with diazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam, were the four benzodiazepines listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and represented 82% of the benzodiazepine prescriptions in Australia in 1990–1991.
It is in several countries the benzodiazepine of choice for novice users, due to a low chance of accumulation and a relatively slow absorption speed.

## Society and culture

### Misuse

Oxazepam has the potential for misuse, defined as taking the drug to achieve a high, or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice. Benzodiazepines, including diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam, accounted for the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in Sweden from 1982 to 1986. During this time, a total of 52% of drug forgeries were for benzodiazepines, suggesting they were a major prescription drug class of abuse.
However, due to its slow rate of absorption and its slow onset of action, oxazepam has a relatively low potential for abuse compared to some other benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, flunitrazepam, or triazolam. This is similar to the varied potential for abuse between different drugs of the barbiturate class.

### Legal status

Oxazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

## Environmental concerns

In 2013, a laboratory study which exposed European perch to oxazepam concentrations equivalent to those present in European rivers (1.8 μg/L) found that they exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate. In 2016, a follow-up study which exposed salmon smolt to oxazepam for seven days before letting them migrate observed increased intensity of migratory behaviour compared to controls. A 2019 study associated this faster, bolder behaviour in exposed smolt to increased mortality due to a higher likelihood of being predated on.
On the other hand, a 2018 study from the same authors, which kept 480 European perch and 12 northern pikes in 12 ponds over 70 days, half of them control and half spiked with oxazepam, found no significant difference in either perch growth or mortality. However, it suggested that the latter could be explained by the exposed perch and pike being equally hampered by oxazepam, rather than the lack of an overall effect. Lastly, a 2021 study built on these results by comparing two whole lakes filled with perch and pikes - one control while the other was exposed to oxazepam 11 days into experiment, at concentrations between 11 and 24 μg/L, which is 200 times greater than the reported concentrations in the European rivers. Even so, there were no measurable effects on pike behaviour after the addition of oxazepam, while the effects on perch behaviour were found to be negligible. The authors concluded that the effects previously attributed to oxazepam were instead likely caused by a combination of fish being stressed by human handling and small aquaria, followed by being exposed to a novel environment.
