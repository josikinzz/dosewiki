## Subjective Experience

This legally available non-prescription stay-awake product was moderately popular
circa 2015, and was purchased via a research chemical vendor.

Ingested, it produced an unremarkable functional experience, in that I felt sharp, a
little stimulated, and awake, but distinctly under the influence of a chemical.

Generally, I didn’t feel that this gave me as smooth a ride as the more commercially
established armodafinil (see earlier) and it felt a little more like a stimulant than a
wakefulness or alertness agent. This impression was re-enforced by occasional
Internet reports of side-effects like jitters and vasoconstriction.

Whilst it was effective in terms of combating drowsiness and sleep, it wasn't
particularly pleasant and was not one I would return to.
