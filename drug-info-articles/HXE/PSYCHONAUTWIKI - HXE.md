**3-HO-2'-Oxo-PCE** (commonly known as **HXE** ) is a novel [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) substance of the [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) class that produces [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) -like [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is structurally related to [Methoxetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methoxetamine) , [Ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) and [PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCE) .

Limited data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of HXE in humans, and it has a limited history of human use. It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance.

## History and culture

HXE first appeared for sale on the online research chemical market in late 2020. However, it has been announced about three years prior where it has been 'hyped' for a long time but was on hold due to synthesis difficulties. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Chemistry

HXE or 2-(Ethylamino)-2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexan-1-one is classed as an [Arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine)

It is substituted on the cyclohexane ring with an oxygen at the 2' position and a hydroxy group at the 3 position on the phenyl ring. In contrast, [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) is substituted there with a methoxy group.

## Pharmacology

Very little is known about the pharmacology about this substance, however as an arylcyclohexamine it is reasonable to assume that it is an NMDA receptor antagonist. NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually an almost identical equivalent of the famous “k-hole.”

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

HXE's effects resemble rather the effects of [MXPr](/w/index.php?title=MXPr&action=edit&redlink=1) , [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) , [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) than more chaotic derivatives like [O-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-PCE) or [MXiPr](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXiPr) . Compared to [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) , it has less of a warmth to it and is weaker in its euphoria and clearheadedness, which can roughly be considered equal to [MXPr](/w/index.php?title=MXPr&action=edit&redlink=1) 's potency.
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** or **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - HXE has a mild stimulating effect which promotes activities like socializing or moving. Higher doses will evidently lead to greater amounts of sedation as moving around can become difficult. However, there are some stimulating effects that persist at higher dosages as well.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The body feeling of HXE can be described as slightly warm, but also empty or rough at times.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - This effect is usually uncommon.
- **[Gait alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gait_alteration)**
- **[Perfection of bodily lightness](/w/index.php?title=Perfection_of_bodily_lightness&action=edit&redlink=1)** - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become entirely weightless. This effect is strangely stimulating and encourages physical activities at low to moderate doses by making the body feel light and effortless to move.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside balance and coordination is prevalent within HXE and becomes especially strong at higher doses, although this compound seems to be less susceptiblw to this. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset (unless experienced) in the case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)**
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - This partially to entirely suppresses one's sense of touch, creating feelings of numbness within the extremities. It is responsible for the anesthetic properties of this substance.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Physical autonomy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - High dose HXE experience can sometimes result in nausea and vomiting at the peak of the trip. For most people, this is surprisingly not as unpleasant as they would initially expect due to the accompanying detachment from the physical senses.
- **[Optical sliding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Optical_sliding)**
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)** - Orgasm enhancement can also be present, even at higher doses. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Suppression
 
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)**
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This component is prevalent at moderate to heavy doses and makes reading impossible unless one closes an eye.
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)** - This effect generally occurs at higher doses and makes one unable to recognize and interpret perceivable visual data.
- **[Frame rate suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frame_rate_suppression)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Environmental cubism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_cubism)**
- **[Environmental orbism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_orbism)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry found within HXE can be described as very dark and bland when compared to that of [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) and often consists of many tiny interlocking and woven lines. It does not extend beyond level 4 and can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as simplistic in complexity, algorithmic in style, synthetic in feel, unstructured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, multicolored in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
At high doses, HXE can produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects include:
 
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , this effect can occur at heavy doses, but is considerably less common than the same effect found within [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, fixed in style, equal in new experiences and memory replays in content, autonomous in controllability and solid in style.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , this effect can occur at heavy doses, but is extremely infrequent in comparison to the same effect found within [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. The most common theme for this effect to follow is one of experiencing and talking to friends when they are not actually present. ### Cognitive effects
 
- HXE is generally considered to be euphoric and comfortable. It can also turn mildly confusing, although it's manageable and not nearly as wild as [O-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-PCE) or [MXiPr](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXiPr) . It is mostly clear-headed in comparison to that of [DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) and [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . The specific cognitive effects can be broken down into several separate subcomponents which are listed and described below: 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)** - This is not experienced in all environments, as [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) may also be experienced especially at lower dosage ranges.
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**
- **[Mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania)** - This can potentially occur with users who are compulsively and regularly consuming large amounts of this compound. This effect occurs less often on HXE than it does on more stimulating dissociatives such as [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) or [2'-Oxo-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2%27-Oxo-PCE) .
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)**
- **[Personal meaning enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_meaning_enhancement)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)**
- **[Suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)** ### Disconnective effects
 
- - **[Tactile disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This eventually results in HXE's equivalent of the "k-hole" or more specifically, *[holes, spaces and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)* alongside of *[structures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures)* .
- **[Consciousness disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Consciousness_disconnection)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently 0 experience reports which describe the effects of this substance in our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational HXE use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because HXE has very little history of human usage.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The lethal dosage of HXE is not known. Based on it's effect it could probably be assumed, that it might carry roughly the same risk of death like similar compounds like [DMXE](/w/index.php?title=DMXE&action=edit&redlink=1) or [MXPr](/w/index.php?title=MXPr&action=edit&redlink=1) .

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other nmda receptor antagonists, the chronic use of HXE can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of producing psychological dependence among certain users. when addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

tolerance to many of the effects of HXE develops with prolonged and repeated use. this results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. after that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

HXE presents cross-tolerance with all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , meaning that after the consumption of HXE all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

## Legal status

- **Switzerland:** HXE can be considered a specially defined derivative of PCE or O-PCE and is therefore illegal.
- **United Kingdom** : HXE is illegal in the United Kingdom. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **United States** : HXE is not illegal, however, if it is sold with the intention for human consumption (such as in capsules) it becomes illegal to possess under the Federal Analogue Act. This is avoided by placing the label "not for human consumption" on the container of the chemical. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
