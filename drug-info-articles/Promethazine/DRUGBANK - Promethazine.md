## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenothiazines. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a phenothiazine moiety, which is a linear tricyclic system that consists of a two benzene rings joined by a para-thiazine ring.

### Background

Promethazine, originally known as 3,277 R.P., is an N-dimethylaminopropyl derivative of
phenothiazine
that was developed in France in 1946.
1
Promethazine antagonizes a variety of receptors, allowing it to be used for a number of indications including allergic reactions, pain, sedation, nausea, and vomiting.

,
12
Promethazine cough syrup with phenylephrine and codeine is indicated to relieve cough and upper respiratory symptoms, and nasal congestion associated with allergy or the common cold.
13

### Pharmacodynamics

Promethazine is is a histamine H1 antagonist that can be used for it's ability to induce sedation, reduce pain, and treat allergic reactions.
12
Promethazine's effects generally last 4-6h but can last up to 12h.
12
Patients should be counselled regarding CNS and respiratory depression, reduce seizure threshold, and bone marrow depression.
12

### Mechanism of Action

Histamine H1 receptor
Antagonist
D(2) dopamine receptor
Antagonist
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1
Antagonist
+ 11 more targets

### Absorption

A 25mg dose of intramuscular promethazine reaches a C
max
of 22ng/mL.
4
Intravenous promethazine reaches a C
max
of 10.0ng/mL, with a T
max
of 4-10h, and an AUC of 14,466ng*h/mL.
4
Oral promethazine is only 25% bioavailable due to first pass metabolism.
4
Oral promethazine reaches a C
max
of 2.4-18.0ng/mL, with a T
max
of 1.5-3h, and an AUC of 11,511ng*h/mL.
4

### Metabolism

Promethazine is predominantly metabolized to promethazine sulfoxide, and minorly to desmethylpromethazine and a hydroxy metabolite.
3
,
4
Hydroxylation of promethazine is predominantly mediated by CYP2D6.

### Toxicity

The intraperitoneal LD
50
in rats is 170mg/kg and in mice is 160mg/kg.
14
The subcutaneous LD
50
in rats is 400mg/kg and in mice is 240mg/kg.
14
The oral LD
50
in mice is 255mg/kg.
14
Patients experiencing an overdose of promethazine may present with mild central nervous system and cardiovascular depression, hypotension, respiratory depression, unconciousness, hyperreflexia, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, extensor-plantar reflexes, convulsions, dry mouth, flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and fixed, dilated pupils.
12
Treat overdoses with symptomatic and supportive treatment, which may include activated charcoal, sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, controlled ventilation, diazepam, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agents, diphenhydramine, barbiturates, or oxygen.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Promethazine is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Abacavir may decrease the excretion rate of Promethazine which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Promethazine can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Promethazine can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Promethazine can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Alcohol may increase the sedation caused by promethazine.

### General Function

ATP-dependent transporter of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family that actively extrudes physiological compounds and xenobiotics from cells. Transports a range of endogenous molecules that have a key role in cellular communication and signaling, including cyclic nucleotides such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP), bile acids, steroid conjugates, urate, and prostaglandins (PubMed:11856762, PubMed:12523936, PubMed:12835412, PubMed:12883481, PubMed:15364914, PubMed:15454390, PubMed:16282361, PubMed:17959747, PubMed:18300232, PubMed:26721430). Mediates the ATP-dependent efflux of glutathione conjugates such as leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) too. The presence of GSH is necessary for the ATP-dependent transport of LTB4, whereas GSH is not required for the transport of LTC4 (PubMed:17959747). Mediates the cotransport of bile acids with reduced glutathione (GSH) (PubMed:12523936, PubMed:12883481, PubMed:16282361). Transports a wide range of drugs and their metabolites, including anticancer, antiviral and antibiotics molecules (PubMed:11856762, PubMed:12105214, PubMed:15454390, PubMed:17344354, PubMed:18300232). Confers resistance to anticancer agents such as methotrexate (PubMed:11106685)
