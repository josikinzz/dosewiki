## Subjective Experience

In its native Africa, sceletium tortuosum has traditionally been chewed as a “vision-
inducing entheogen and inebriant” (ref: Erowid), notably by the Hotentot tribe. It
can, however, also be smoked or consumed as tea.

I sampled it a handful on a handful of occasions, circa 2014/15, with perhaps a
couple of months between each session. The forum reports below were written
contemporaneously.

```
INSUFFLATION TEST 1
The package arrived in the post this morning. It contained 10g of brown
powdered plant matter, almost sawdust in constitution, with a distinctive but
not particularly pleasant odour.
```
```
I set about testing by insufflating a single line. Wallop! It was awful, and
brought tears to my eyes. Fortunately, this wasn’t in vain.
```
```
Despite harbouring doubts as to whether there would be anything to it there
was a fairly immediate effect. Within seconds I felt a changing of headspace,
and I was becoming strangely inebriated.
```

```
It was intoxicating in the sense of feeling slightly disorientated and a little
drunk, but without the loss of clarity. The onset was rapid, and as it took hold
I wondered how far it would go. However, the inebriation settled and it
stabilised at the same level for approximately 20 minutes.
```
```
It then tapered into the promised sedation. The depth of this was difficult to
measure as I was already quite chilled, but I was left feeling positively relaxed
for some hours.
```
```
INSUFFLATION TEST 2
This sample was sold as ‘Sceletium Tortuosum 40x extract’, and was procured
from the same source as the regular kanna I had tested earlier. I broadly
followed the instructions printed on the packet: “Serving size 10mg micros
scoop, to be insufflated 1-3 times in divided doses”. As stated, there was a cute
little scoop enclosed, which I piled high, thus reaching about 15mg.
```
```
A nice surprise was that there was no discomfort or serious sting, contrary to
the excessive pain I had suffered when I snorted the raw leaves.
```
```
I experienced a very clean inebriating effect, perhaps lasting about 10 minutes.
This then morphed into a distant sedation, but with a strange visual clarity.
Overall it was quite pleasant.
```
```
This wasn’t very long lasting, so I repeated the exercise, inducing a similar or
perhaps stronger response. There was no nausea, and no body load.
```
```
As this does seem to be a nice way to fill a couple of hours, it is difficult to
understand why this plant isn't more widely known and used.
```
```
Note that I was completely detoxed whilst undertaking these experiments.
```
```
ORAL TEST
I added half a teaspoon of plain kanna to a cup of coffee this morning,
swigging it down quickly to avoid any unpleasant taste.
```
```
It certainly had a psychoactive effect, with the next few hours passing with a
nice positive vibe. I spent much of the time enjoying the sort of ambient music
I wouldn't normally listen to, whilst working on trivial tasks.
```
Overall this was a pleasant surprise. It was effective via each RoA I tested and in both
its natural and extract form. Indeed, I would echo my earlier comment in wondering
why this is not more popular.

One further aspect: there are a variety of credible reports stating that this has
interesting synergistic properties with other psychoactives, including cannabis. This
may well be another area worthy of study.
