AMT
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
AMT is a psychedelic amphetamine-tryptamine first developed in the 1960's for anti-depressant research , although it was never very successful as a prescription antidepressant. Its effects usually last 8-14 hours when swallowed and 3-6 hours when insufflated. Its effects are often characterized as a cross between a psychedelic and an MDMA, with empathogenesis and strong physical stimulation common. One common side effect with both insufflated and oral ingestion of AMT is powerful nausea and associated vomiting.

History #
 
AMT was first developed in the 1960s as an antidepressant and MAOI with its cousin alpha-Ethyl-Tryptamine which was sold for a short while by Upjohn before being placed in Schedule I in 1971. AMT was available in the Soviet Union in the 1960s as an antidepressant under the commercial name Indopan in 5 and 10 mg tablets. It remained a very obscure chemical until the late 1990s when began being sold commercially around the world as a research chemical and found its way into recreational use circles. It became illegal in the United States in April 2003.

Effects
 
by Erowid
 
AMT can take a long time to come on when taken orally. A common error with AMT is redosing too early because effects are not felt, resulting in effects that are stronger than planned or desired.

United Kingdom (U.K., UK, England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Britain) #
 
AMT was added to Scheule 1 as of January 15th, 2015, by changing the definition of tryptamine substitions. See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3277/introduction/made](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3277/introduction/made) . Previously AMT was not controlled in Britain and does not fall under the substituted tryptamine rule because its 'substitution' is not on the nitrogen. See the [2001 Misuse of Drugs Act : Schedule 1, regulation 3](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/uk/uk_law_misuse_2001_1.shtml) (as of Mar 2004). AMT is still (2015) not listed in the UK laws, but is now controlled as a substituted tryptamine under Schedule 1 (not the same as USA Schedule I). (last updated Jan 3, 2015)
