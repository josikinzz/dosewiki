**1-Cyclopropionyl-N-methyl-N-isopropyllysergamide** (also known commonly as **1cP-MiPLA** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class. 1cP-MiPLA is closely related to [MiPLA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MiPLA) , for which it is suspected to be a prodrug for, but there is currently no data or enough anecdotal reports to reasonably hypothesize this.

1cP-MiPLA is a novel [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) which seems to have appeared first in 2020 or 2021, allegedly first synthesized by either Skyler Ulrich or a chemist/group under the name of Gerstmann [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] , alongside other novel lysergamides like [1cP-AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1cP-AL-LAD) on various [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) markets.

User reports describe the effects of 1cP-MiPLA as similar to those of MiPLA. Some anecdotal reports state that there could be a notable, if even slight, difference between the two although this does not indicate that that it isn't a true prodrug for MiPLA. Many effects seem to be identical or nearly identical.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 1cP-MiPLA. While it is often characterized by users as being generally more recreational and non-threatening compared to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , it is highly advised to approach this highly potent [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using it.

## Chemistry

1cP-MiPLA, or 1-Cyclopropionyl-N-methyl-N-isopropyllysergamide, is a semisynthetic [alkaloid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkaloid) of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) family. 1cP-MiPLA is a structural analog of lysergic acid, with an N-methyl-N-isopropylamide functional group bound to R N of the chemical structure.

1cP-MiPLA's chemical structure contains a bicyclic hexahydroindole fused to a bicyclic quinoline group (nor-lysergic acid). It is substituted at R 1 with a Cyclopropionyl substituent. At carbon 8 of the quinoline a N,N-diethyl carboxamide is bound.

1cP-MiPLA is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R 5 and R 8 . 1cP-MiPLA, also called (+)-D-1cP-MiPLA , has an absolute configuration of (5 *R* , 8 *R* ). The three other stereoisomers of 1cP-MiPLA presumably do not have psychoactive properties. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Pharmacology

1cP-MiPLA likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from 1cP-MiPLA's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain an object of scientific elucidation.

1cP-MiPLA is also suspected to be a prodrug for [MiPLA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MiPLA) , given it's 1-Cyclopropionyl substitution. This can be compared with [1cP-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1cP-LSD) , which is also likely a prodrug for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . However there is not enough data, anecdotes or guaratees that this will be the exact same property of 1cP-MiPLA.

1cP-MiPLA also shares many common traits with its parent compound LSD; in humans it appears to be roughly equal (or less) in potency as well as similar in mechanism although the progression and duration of effects are compressed (while remaining qualitatively less intense and more manageable - perhaps due to being catabolised more readily). It is also notably less potent.

## Subjective effects

While its subjective effects largely overlap with those of [MiPLA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MiPLA) and less so [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 1cP-MiPLA is commonly reported to be significantly shorter in its duration and less uncomfortable in both its [negative physical side effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Uncomfortable_physical_effects) and general [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) .

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Similar to LSD, 1cP-MiPLA is considered to be primarily stimulating in nature. This is in distinction to other, more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) which are more consistent in producing [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [relaxedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 1cP-MiPLA can be described as proportionally intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a pleasurable, fast-moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the experience, but for most it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. In comparison to LSD, 1cP-MiPLA is a little less sharp in the tingling sensations it produces as but is otherwise essentially indistinguishable.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Physical euphoria on 1cP-MiPLA is not as consistent as it is with substances like [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , and can just as easily manifest as physical discomfort without any apparent reason.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually occurs during and up to the peak of the experience or directly afterward. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable and peaceful in its sensations.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensations are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most 1cP-MiPLA trips.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - Generally mild in comparison to traditional [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect is significantly less pronounced than it is with [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and its related compounds, the four-position [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine#List_of_substituted_tryptamines) .
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - The possibility of seizures is extrapolated from the seizures that have been reported following the use of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . They are thought to mainly be a risk in those who are genetically predisposed to them, particularly while accompanied by physically taxing conditions such as dehydration, fatigue or undernourishment. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon-like in appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance. This is nearly identical in appearance to the visual drifting which occurs under the influence of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The [visual geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_geometry) evoked by 1cP-MiPLA can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful and cartoonish in scheme, organic in feel, flat in shading, soft in its edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, either angular or round in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it consistently results in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
In comparison to LSD specifically, 1cP-MiPLA's geometry tends to be more rounded in its corners, slightly softer in its edges, warmer in hue, and slightly less intricate in its form. Aside from this, it is otherwise identical in its appearance.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
1cP-MiPLA is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is a less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) but considerably more likely to when compared to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This can feel similar to the hallucinations which occur with [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) but tends to occur almost exclusively at [heavier](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) [doses](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) . Some of these effects include:
 
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**

- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol's central depressant effects can counteract some of the anxiety and bodily tension produced by 1cP-MiPLA. However, alcohol can cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively impact the tone of the trip. Users are advised to pace themselves and drink a portion of their usual amount.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines are highly effective at reducing the intensity of 1cP-MiPLA's effects through the general suppression of brain activity.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis strongly intensifies the sensory and cognitive effects of 1cP-MiPLA. Extreme caution is advised when using this combination as it can significantly increase the chances of a negative psychological reaction like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - 1cP-MiPLA enhances the cognitive, visual and general hallucinatory effects of dissociatives. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) and [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) become more vivid and intense on 1cP-MiPLA. These effects correspond with an increased risk of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - 1cP-MiPLA and MDMA are highly synergistic and mutually enhance each other's physical, cognitive, and visual effects. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable so it is advised to start with markedly lower doses than one would take for each individually. There is some evidence that suggests that co-administration of LSD with MDMA increases the neurotoxicity of the latter, and this may extend to 1cP-MiPLA.

### Experience reports

There are currently 0 anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 1cP-MiPLA use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 1cP-MiPLA is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

The body of anecdotal reports suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

As with other psychedelic substances, there are relatively few physical side effects that have been reported associated with acute 1cP-MiPLA exposure. Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is likely that as with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) itself, 1cP-MiPLA is able to be considered non-addictive, with an extremely low toxicity relative to dose. It is also likely that as with LSD, there are little to no negative physical, cognitive, psychiatric or other toxic consequences associated with acute 1cP-MiPLA exposure.

However, as with LSD and psychedelics in general, it is possible that 1cP-MiPLA can act as a potential trigger for those with underlying psychiatric conditions. Those with a personal or family history of mental illness are generally advised not to use this substance, particularly outside of a supervised medical setting.

It is strongly recommended that one uses [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that as with LSD itself, 1cP-MiPLA is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of 1cP-MiPLA is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 1cP-MiPLA presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the use of 1cP-MiPLA all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

The LD 50 of 1cP-MiPLA is unknown. Adverse psychological reactions are common especially at higher dosages. Some of these include [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and more rarely [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . Medical attention is usually only needed if suspected of severe psychotic episodes or “fake acid” (such as [25i-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25i-NBOMe) or [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) ). Administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help to relieve the negative cognitive effects of 1cP-MiPLA.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 1cP-MiPLA. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.

## Legal status

1cP-MiPLA is currently a gray area compound within many parts of the world. This means that it is not known to be specifically illegal within most countries, but people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analog laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Austria** : 1cP-MiPLA is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany** : 1cP-MiPLA is illegal in Germany as of July 2021. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Switzerland** : 1cP-MiPLA can be considered a controlled substance as a defined derivative of Lysergic Acid under Verzeichnis E point 263. It is legal when used for scientific or industrial use.
- **United States** : 1cP-MiPLA is unscheduled but can be considered to be an analogue of LSD, which would make it illegal to possess for human consumption under the Federal Analogue Act. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
