## Subjective Experience

4F-MPH appeared on the markets in 2015, and quickly became popular in its niche.
It fits very much into the functional category; meaning that it induces little or no
euphoria, empathy or mood lift, or indeed, any of those edges that make many stims
so enjoyable and recreational.

However, there is a significant uplift in terms of energy, alertness and even clarity,
and it persists for a very lengthy period. I ought to add here that it is extremely
strong at relatively low doses, so caution is the byword.

I used it on a number of occasions, invariably when I had a need to be on my game,
yet had been suffering from fatigue or tiredness (mental or physical). For this, it was
very much my go-to solution, at least for a year or so.

Whilst I found it to be smoother and less jittery than other stimulants in this
particular group, such as EPH, it was one which some people abused and eventually
became addicted to. Despite its usefulness in certain scenarios, it is not a chemical to
make a habit of.
