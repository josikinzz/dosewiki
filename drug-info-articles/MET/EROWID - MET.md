EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[25 mg vaporized followed by 15 mg vaporized] "[...] This is a sort of slightly speedy tryptamine, slightly LSD-like state with a warm MDMA-ish center. [...]" -- [Exp 90320](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=90320)
 
[15 mg vaporized] "[...] The come up was about 2-3 times as slow as the come up on DMT. It was strangely reminiscent of something, which I eventually realized was the come-down from DMT. This 'I'm not in the crazy fractalizing weirdness any more but I still feel pretty damn odd' feeling came first, but was almost immediately accompanied by a deeply satisfying feeling of body warmth and comfort. [...]" -- [Exp 89318](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89318)

MET is unscheduled in the United States.
