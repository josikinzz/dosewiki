## Subjective Experience

In terms of oral consumption, botanical powders are not my thing. More specifically,
I tend to find that they frequently refuse to dissolve properly, and that their
constitution is less than agreeable. Whilst I struggled a little with kola nut, at least it
didn’t taste revolting (à la kratom) as I swigged the fine woody-like powder down the
hatch with water.

This is widely used in Africa, and it is claimed to increase both endurance and
concentration, as well as act as a mild aphrodisiac.

It had a definite coffee-like kick to it. It was not overwhelming at the dose I used, but
the strength was there. I felt clear, awake and a little energised, with a slightly jittery
edge. This lasted for some hours.

Note that I consumed in the morning, which I suspect was a good idea with respect
to retaining a sensible sleep pattern.
