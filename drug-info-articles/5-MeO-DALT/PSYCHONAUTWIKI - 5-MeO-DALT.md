**N,N-Diallyl-5-methoxytryptamine** (also known as **5-MeO-DALT** or colloquially as **Foxtrot** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class that produces short-lived psychedelic effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is structurally related to tryptamines like [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) and [DALT](/w/index.php?title=DALT&action=edit&redlink=1) , although it is reported to produce distinct effects.

5-MeO-DALT was first synthesized by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who sent the first material regarding the synthesis and effects to a researcher in May 2004. This material was subsequently circulated online and the compound soon appeared on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. In August 2004, the synthesis and effects of 5-MeO-DALT were officially published by Erowid. Reports linked to the detection of 5-MeO-DALT began to surface in 2007.

Anecdotal reports characterize the effects of this substance as being primarily physical in nature, lacking the characteristic visual distortions or perceptual depth of most psychedelics. Its headspace has been described as "shallow," albeit suited for sexual contexts due to its potent stimulating and libidinous effects. It is also reported to produce more uncomfortable cardiovascular effects such as [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) relative to other psychedelics. This has raised questions about possible toxicity associated with long-term or heavy uses.

Very limited data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 5-MeO-DALT, and it has a very short history of human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

The full name of the chemical is *N* -allyl- *N* -[2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl] prop-2-en-1- amine. It is related to the compounds 5-MeO-DPT and DALT (N,N-Diallyltryptamine).

5-MeO-DALT is named for its chemical structure 5-MethOxy-DiALlylTryptamine. It contains two allyl groups bound to the amino group and a 5-methoxy group bound to the indole ring of tryptamine. It is a structural analog of [DALT](/w/index.php?title=DALT&action=edit&redlink=1) and [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) . 5-MeO-DALT is an off-white powder at room temperature.

## Pharmacology

5-MeO-DALT binds to 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 1D , 5-HT 1E , 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 2C , 5-HT 6 , α 2A , α 2B , α 2C , H 1 , κ-opioid, σ 1 and σ 2 receptors with K i values lower than 10μM and also acts as a DAT and SERT monoamine reuptake inhibitor.

5-MeO-DALT acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience remains the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

5-MeO-DALT has been used as an intermediate in the preparation of radiolabeled diethyltryptamine.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 5-MeO-DALT can be described as a motionless, constant, sharp and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the come up and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as simplistic, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout the experience can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [AMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AMT) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . It can be comprehensively described as unstructured in its organization, synthetic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, small in size, slow and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equally blurred and sharp in its edges and equally rounded and angular in its corners. It possesses a synthetic feel that is less impressive than most of the "classical" psychedelics at any level. It has yet to be confirmed whether this compound results in either [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) or [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) geometry at heavy doses. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The headspace of 5-MeO-DALT is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high doses.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 5-MeO-DALT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 5-MeO-DALT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 5-MeO-DALT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

5-MeO-DALT is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 5-MeO-DALT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MeO-DALT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MeO-DALT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **2C-T-X** - Both classes of compounds can be unpredictable alone.
- **2C-X** - The 5-MeO psychedelics can interact unpredictably to potentiate other psychedelics.
- **Cannabis** - May increase the risk of negative psychological effects such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **DOx** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions, particularly increasing the risk of unpleasant physical side effects.
- **MDMA** - Some of the 5-MeO tryptamines are a bit unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care.
- **Mescaline** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions.
- **NBOMe** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. This combination is best avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **Cocaine** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **DXM** - Little information exists about this combination.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **aMT** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **MAOIs** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **PCP** - Little information exists about this combination. May increase risk of psychosis and excessive stimulation.
