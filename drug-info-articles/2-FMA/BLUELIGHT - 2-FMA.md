Any idea how long effects last? Longer or shorter than 2-fa?

It should last longer of course. Something between 4-5h. Without redosing.

Feels a lot like 2-FA to me. Onset, duration, potency, etc., are all pretty similar. I have noticed, though, when I drink any alcohol on it my face flushes extremely easily. Not sure what that's about. I don't remember that happening with 2-FA.

I have loved 2-fma so far! I am very excited for my next pkg to come in. It feels very good, and as people have said, is like meth, but without quite all of the craziness, and less effect on the peripheral areas (i.e. grinding, twitching). My preferred methods currently are IV and vaping. Snorting is ok, but when you IV, it lasts for quite some time, and feels reallll good. %) So I prefer to IV over snorting. And then I smoke during the IV dose, heaven in an 8 hr package.

Hey folks, I'll add some personal experience.


experience : quite a few stimulants ... did not try coke, meth, but regular street amph + mdma and many rc stims.


I blasted ~1.2g of this stuff in the last 2 1/2 weeks. What follows is an overview of the last, somewhat escalated experience and a summary of the effects with a comparison to the related 2-FA.


last friday :


3 pm : first dose in order to perform boring computer work and reading : 60mg orally. Come up took about 1 hour. Then the main effects tapered of after another hour.

6:30 pm : insufflated eyeball about ~40mg, pushed the oral dose a bit.

8:30 pm : another 40mg snorted

11:00 pm : same


This procedure was continued until 9 am. No work was done, concentration was harder than in sober state. This is the most addictive substance I ever tried and far from functional for me. When insufflated, the initial rush starts about 5 minutes after intake. It feels mainly dopaminergic with maybe a very subtle serotonine release. It is present for like 30 minutes. After that what remains is weak residual stimulation. Not comparable to regular amphetamine IMHO.


After the 18 hours and ~300mg insufflated I felt very dizzy, although I was well hydrated and nutrated, could have been bad circulation. Pulse was not measured but was never worringly high. Plus I was pretty tired all saturday.


The last 30mg-dose was taken at 9 pm on saturday 33 hours after the first dose = 400mg overall intake . Sleep was possible at 1 am with the help of a few beer. Slept for 6 hours, felt tired through the day but not depressed or anything. Still had some circulatory problems.


Comparison to 2-FA :


Functional Stimulation : 2-FA -> 7/10 2-FMA -> 5/10


Absence of side effects : 2-FA -> 8/10 2-FMA -> 9/10


Addiction potential (DR, DRI IMHO) : 2-FA -> 7/10 2-FMA -> 9/10


If you are looking for an amphetamine replacement I guess you won't find it in that compound. Maybe it is an agreeable replacement for recreational stimulants like Mephedrone or Meth (I personally don't like Mephedrone). But then again this substance is so impotent, that you would need a lot to emulate the effects spectrum, what I cannot recommend. The initial dopamine release inherents a lot potential for addiction, for me much more than MDPV for example. Won't try this stuff again, as it is too weak for me.

2-FMA is good, but not great IMO.  I much prefer 4-FA, m1 or other "euphoric" stims.  2-FMA is kind of jittery and edgy, sorta like caffeine.  It's still better than a lot of the cathinones, just overpriced.

i like 2-fma so far. i have limited experience though, but i like most of its effects. i can see how one might compare it to caffeine, in that i can feel some heart palpitations and get a bit jittery on the come up, but then i find it quite enjoyable and without many of the side effects of other more potent stims (including here 4fa). i agree its not great as an entactogen/euphoriant, but then again, for what it is, a utilitarian stim, it is quite good. the low comedown profile is also a plus...

It's supposed to be like that.  4-FA is an MDMA-like serotonin dump. It's not a swiss army knife.

Doesn't 2-FMA have a ceiling effect at ~100-150mg? I thought it did.

Yeah all the side effects come when you DON'T orally dose it.   Eat 60mg and see the difference.  It'll last 6 hours or more.  No jitters + bonus anti anxiety effect.  


For some reason this one has to be orally dosed for full benefits.. maybe it partly slowly metabolises into 2-fa to make it jitter-free + anti-anxiety/relaxing while head stimulated.


People snort it or IV/IM it right away but for this one... taken like you pop an adderall xr or vyvanse or something its waay better.

Have some on the way and was wondering if anyone has tried plugging this yet? If so, how does it compare to oral and what was your dosage? Thanks! If no one replies, I'll likely be testing it out myself when my materials arrive.

I have tried this stuff twice:


First time - 50mg oral + 15mg snorted at +2 hours


I really enjoyed the come up, it was extremely smooth and clear headed with a very nice tingle.  I expected it to go more, but it just stopped and I was not as focused as d-amp.  I was hoping to find a replacement to some degree but I guess it could be if you needed SOMETHING.  this is definitely better than 4-fa for work/focus because I see it as d-amp + mdma in a pill.  overall I was not impressed with it.  I later did methylone plugged (100-125mg) later in the night and there did not seem to be any interaction between them.  I felt like the 2-fma was there for the first 4 hours but really tapered off.  I noticed that after this experience, my ears were ringing and have been moderately since then which has been over a week.  So I advise against this combination as I have done methylone+4-fa and methylone+mephedrone with no tinnitus problems 


Second Time: 60mg orally + 30mg insufflated at +3 hours


The nice come up was not as obvious at all and I just felt the need to smoke cigarettes which is a classic sign of amphetamine use for me.  I otherwise literally never smoke cigarettes and find them gross but I NEED THEM on amphetamines.  I intended to get really focused to work on some art related projects but I found that it did not add too much and it did not make a difference in the performance.  I noticed I had a mild headache too during the experience.  


Once i insufflated it 30mg though, there was much more prominent euphoria but not as much desire to focus.  I mean, it felt like i turned into a different drug.  My previous experience snorting 15mg was not enough and I guess this is a good place to start for insufflation.  


overall, I am not that impressed and will not be purchasing again.  if you are looking for a d-amp replacement, its alright but nothing to write home about.  I would rate it the following:


Focus: 6/10

Euphoria: 4/10 (6/10 when insufflated) 

Sexual: 3/10 (smoke weed on the comedown makes this an 8/10)

Duration: 8-12 hours (main effects 5 hours, with long gradual almost invisible comedown)


Overall: 6/10


EDIT: This stuff LASTS FOREVER.  I smoked weed at +11 hours from first dose and was HORNY AS ALL HELL.  I was not able to sleep until +16 hours initial dose and even the next day, I am awake and it honestly has an afterglow.  I was expecting a shitty comedown because my heart was racing really bad at +12 hours from dosing until early morning but I awoke extremely refreshed.  the sex part was great because I was also able to perform unlike god damn cathinones and some other amphetamines.  for sex, this is an absolute winner.  but I have to mention I was not horny really until i smoked a bowl of weed.  afterwards, I literally couldnt close my eyes without getting full blown blowjob closed eye visuals lol.


I want to also mention that insufflating brings out much more of the side effects of the drug and seems to get me slightly more focused but 2x more euphoria compared to orally.  


if you want to study, take oral


if you want to tweak, chose another route like insufflating it

I tried snorting some the first night I did this, about 10/15mg, and never again. I had allready orally dosed, and snorting some made me instantly uber paranoid and tweaked. Not a fan. I got an impression of how awesome vaping it must be and not gonna do that. 

I ended up doing like 80/100 mg that night and had no desire to do anything but try and find a woman to have sex with on the internet until 9am. If I had any booty calls at this point I would have called them begging. Would have fucked the ugliest, nastiest woman imaginable and absolutely loved it. Could come in handy for sure ;-)


I have been taking it orally though in doses of 15-25 mg normally.  thoughI am not a stimulant fan at all really. Got a script for adderall for add  years ago and couldn't stand it. Tried it again later after I started eating downers and it was much more manageable. Still too much up/down comedown blah. Made me feel like shit all day after.


This stuff is fucking awesome. I dont' really like to dose higher than ~25 mg orally because I start feeling kinda tweaked and speedy. Anything under that and I'm just energized and focused and ready to go. For studying the best part is the first 3 hours, I'm actually interested in boring shit. For working it's good five hours for main effects for me really. Maybe even half a cup of coffee at that point and it's like it's boosted back for ~2/3 hours. This shit seems to stay in your system a looooooooooong time. Even the next day I will feel slightly more stimulated. 


It just makes everything so much easier. I really hate the stimulant sketchy comedown, and I have been using this 4/5 times a week. I am trying to keep off days, but it's hard. It is so benign it's like you're not even coming down. It makes everything so much easier. I am taking online math class right now, and I'm not sure I would be getting any of the work done if it wasn't for this. Working 50 hours and week and then coming home to teach myself math (hate it) is not a fun time. This shit makes it so I am actually getting some work done. I have dosed 6/7pm and been able to get to sleep around 1am with the help of weed and 1/2mg etizolam.


It is kinda hard to get to sleep sometimes, we though if not dosed first thing in the morning. Even after 12pm. It's just got such a long ass, lingering stimulation. 


Plugging works well. I would say it's a little bit stronger, with a slightly more intense/quicker come on. Would prefer to eat it though, seems smoother. There actually might not be a difference, it might just be I should lower my plugged dose though. Not really sure there is a difference either way though. Can usually feel an almost immediate alert though. I feel it in my eyes, like they get slightly tweaked, like *ALERT*


Hope this shit isn't too toxic, and won't kill my heart :-( Otherwise it's so fucking good, and this is comming from someone who would shout from the rooftops how he hated stimulants a month ago.


Also, it is strange, but I agree with the people saying it's got anti anxiety affects. If I keep my dosage within the range I enjoy, it does seem to provide a certain calming affect. So completely different from any other stims I've ever done. I would always have to drink oreat xanax or somas on coke or adderall. So strange, yet so nice. If this shit was making me have to eat xanax or etizolam all day long, I definatly wouldnt' be taking it.

I swallowed 80mg 2-FMA in a gelcap, ~25 minutes ago.  Will report back, chiefly on the effectiveness of it as a study-aid & work tool.


I snorted ~175mg (total, over the course of 10 hours) 3-FA yesterday.  That stuff is a heavy hitter.  Less a an urge to redose as with meth (and I presume MDPV, not thanks), but too erotic and stimulating to get most work done imo.  When the main euphoric effects wear off it produces intense focus.  Perhaps I need to just try oral ROA instead of instranasal, and lower the dose as well.


Anyways, I'll edit this post once the 2-FMA really starts kicking in, and continue to edit this post throughout the day.  


-Not really feeling like writing up a TR. 


4-FA soon as well, but definitely not today.  I MIGHT end up doing a very small bump of 3-FA on top of the 2-FMA, a lot later.


-edit: So roughly an hour after ingestion it seems to have fully kicked in.  Hands are slightly clammy but not in that cold creepy ultra amped way.  This is the most calming stimulant I have ever done.  I took 80mg oral.  Could actually use ~20-30mg more..possibly even 40, but maybe I'm just getting greedy there.  A tiny dose of a benzo of choice or even phenibut would be nice, but I don't really need it.  I'll have to try this same dose out again when I haven't binged on 3-FA the night before and barely got any sleep.  That certainly is playing a role in this not being even more perfect.  I am very pleased with 2-FMA.  


It is more calming, FAR less manic and more useful than Adderall imo.

Report from a friend (80 Kg, male, age 50):


2-FMA sublingual (2x) and insuff. (1x) in 3 doses of about 10 mg each, over period of 2 hours

Incredibly clean for a couple of good hours, way better than caffeine as a barely-noticeable stim; weakly euphoric

Helpful wank enhancer

Developed strange mild headache and slight pressure in head/ears after couple hours, relieved by taking 200 mg phenibut (he liked this combo)


He says this one is a winner because it seems to have least "dangerous" feel of any RC tried and is unlikely to cause serious harm to anyone who uses it wisely. Of course there will be idiots who IV a g of it with 5 other drugs and they'll die, then it will be made illegal. "Thanks, morons, for fucking it up for everyone else." His words, not mine.

Ya a phenibut/2-FMA combo would be outstanding.  I was just thinking about that about an hour ago.  


Oral dosing is the way to go from what I've heard. I haven't tried any other ROAs yet, but oral 2-FMA is close to perfection.  If I wasn't up late last night from a 3-FA binge, and got a full night's sleep, I'd say this stuff is simply perfect.


I like that it lacks a rushy euphoria.  It's much more calming and you can focus on tasks easier and accomplish them.  Other stims have too much of a drive.  This one is just about right for me.

I've tested it a few times and can only say, don't insufflate it if you want to use it for study. It makes you greedy and horny as hell, like real methamphetamine. You will lose a lot of time this way. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


As a study aid 30-40mg oral are perfect for me.

after using this several times, I noticed some very bad/strange side effects.  My skin on my hands and feet have started to peel a lot, very unusual stomache issues followed by tinnitus that has not been relieved in about 2 weeks.  I used this substance 2 times both within the range of 60-150mg and thought it may have been something else but I have not used other drugs and have never had symptoms like this otherwise.  


I would strongly tread with caution with this one.  I have taken many stimulants before but for some reason, something about this one makes me nervous, all of the fma analogues actually I would be slightly worried about.


edit: i just want to say, i flushed my remaining stash.  I tend to NEVER flush stuff unless I am completely convinced its not worth another trial.

How you compare this stuff with Methiopropamine? stronger?

I've personally never had methiopropamine, but from what I've read, it feels like a somewhat dirty high, though it can be good. I feel like 2-FMA feels very clean and clearheaded when taken orally and has an okay comedown as long as you can occupy yourself with something until you can sleep. I haven't really tried it nasally as I tried a small bump and it burned very badly and I felt it wasn't worth it. I want to try it rectally soon.

I have gone through ~5g's of this in the past 3 months. 


Started on a whim, requested a sample from a new vendor offering it. I've been prescribed adderall before, didn't like it so much. Used it years later off the street, liked it a little more, but always needed alcohol and xanax for the comedown. 2-fma immediatly felt so much cleaner than any prescription stim I've had before. I figured since it might come in handy for getting homework done this semester. I work a ton, and usually don't have any motivation left to be bothered with homework. 


Worked okay at first, just using every few days to get a particularly boring block of homework out of the way. Then I "accidentally" stayed up too late, and got only a few hours of sleep one night. Used it before work, and everything was so much easier to do. This progressed into daily use for the past two months or so. 


Tolerance went from ~15mg would get me lit. Even though this is a clean stim, I'm sensitive as fuck, and it would sometimes make me jittery and 'noid as fuck even at this dose. Now tolerance sits at ~30-35mg for the same, yet still weaker, reaction. Started to abuse the fuck outta this, would take some late at night when I should go to sleep to "do homework" and end up fucking off on the computer (and masturbating like it was going out of style) for a while. The stimulation was there, I just got used to it after a while. Then it lost the driving "YOU HAVE TO FUCKING WORK" edge, and just became "normal".


Speaking of sex, overindulgence of this chemical has led to me almost having sex with some pretty questionable/ugly women off the internet. Thank god for my "jerk off once before leaving" rule. 


Towards the end of the semster, there were a few nights of no/1-2 hours of sleep. 2-fma came in very handy at this point, although dosages started getting out of control. I think I blew threw the last gram in about a week, or less. 


At first, I felt pretty shitty anxiety sometimes. Not even as bad as adderall, but still there. Etizolam helped greatly. Also, have had a few different batches. One was okay, one was really good (about the best you could expect normally), the last was out of this world. Opened the vial and was hit with an immediate chemical smell that was present in the other batches, but almost overpoweringly strong with this one. Noticed I would need about 5-7mg less than normal with this batch, and that the comedown/jitters weren't as bad (not that they are that bad normally). 


Overall, this is the classic stim addiction story. I'm bumping my dosages down every few days. Don't really feel like quitting outright and seeing how that goes. Don't really feel like quitting at all really. Would much rather stay with this than fuck with any stims I could get scripted. Will at least get my tolerance back down before summer classes start again.


Also, all dosages are either oral or rectal. Oral seems to last a little longer to me, and is more spread out.  RA has more euphoria, and comes on quicker, but seems to last a little bit less time.

I would warn against heavy alcohol consumption with this as it seems to produce dysphoria at higher doses and blunting of effects till the alcohol wears off.

I received 2 grams of this product 10 days ago along with some 4-FA. 


As for stims, in the past I've used Adderal, methcathinone, ritalin, methamphetamine, and caffeine.


Currently I've no scale that measures to .001, but I am expecting one.

I've used 2-fma orally, rectally, and intranasally.


For me I've found that using orally is best for studying or concentrating in a given day.

Intranasally tends to have a steeper more noticable drop off for me.  I only do this recreationally.

Rectal administration has not had favorable results for the trouble imo.


I can say that taking too much of this substance causes cold sweats of the feet and hands.

It also causes a headache that is similar to, in my experience, a headache caused from too much Wellbutrin.

This imo is from too much dopamine release.  There is virtually no serotonin action that I've found.


In summary I've had positive experiences with this substance and it has replaced caffeine.

I forgot to mention that this stimulant has provided a positive effect on my bowels.

When I use 2-fma I can expect a bowel movement within 6 hours, whereas I usually am somewhat constipated only having a bm every 4-5 days.

It is a great stimulant. I use Ritalin every day for ADD and while this isn't as effective for my ADD it is a nice "energy" stimulant when I need to churn out a massive essay. It also causes slight mania and moderate-high vasoconstriction though I am comparing this to non recreational use of stimulants so others may not be as bothered.. I use 25-35mg orally. Nasally produced a little discomfort but not as bad as 2-FA which felt like broken glass. However nasal administration was far to jittery. 


No real side effects noticed, occasional headaches and the usual massive stimulant shit shortly after it kicks in.

Truth is it isn't too special in the empathogenic department, just a useful low side effect stimulant. I almost never use stims but I enjoy 2-fma for its relatively short action without tweaky paranoia other stims may cause.

Sorry for bumping two thread about this but:


I have a few questions.. I am hearing duration is really long on this from some people, yet others describe it as lasting something like 5-6 hours. Also, how much of a difference in time is oral dosing to insufflation? 


also dosing seems different:


It looks like 50-80 milligrams is the recommend oral dose, but what about insufflation?


Not expecting too much out of this, just something to help focus and also maybe have some nights out with some beers/hitting up the bars.

Just tried this.

Only tried nasally, doses were 50mg or something.

My advice would be: don't try dosing high to get euphoria, you'll get loads of paranoia.


There's a slight euphoria which lasts about one hour and half when snorted.

However, it will keep you up and alert for about 4 hours.

Yeah that is the 1st time I have seen paranoia mentioned with 2-fma.


Can anyone compare plugging to other ROA please?


How much of a difference does taking an anti acid have with oral dosing? (I have no experience with amphetamines)

Also, I guess the question is, did you have a mg scale? Where you sure you were not taking in a larger dose then you thought?

Very clean stim that is for sure, do not feel much effects at all today. Might even take a smallish dose tonight for a concert I am attending too. Have a benzo for the comedown as well. Could see how this can be addicting.

I'm wondering about the tinnitis people are reporting. I've had the same thing happen to me. Took 50mg orally and the next day, there was a really loud ringing in one ear which went away after a day. Everything was muffled. Otherwise, 2-FMA is amazing - I haven't tried other RoA but orally is perfect: no noticeable comdown or hangover.

Just got 2g of this yesterday. I didn't have an amphetamine tolerance with my last amphetamine used being MDMA about 2-3 weeks prior. My stimulant experience is: Adderall, MDMA,  Psuedoephedrine, Pentedrone, 4-MEC, A-PVP, 4-MBC, Methylphenidate, Methamphetamine and 4-FA.


I weighed out my initial dose at ~55mg. Figured that would be a good starter dose seeing that this was my first time. I took it around noon and started to feel it around 12:30, started peaking around 1, one hour after taking it. It was a lot like I was expecting it to be based on everyones descriptions.


The stimulation was very clean. No bothersome physical side effects except for Increased Heart Rate (Wasn't too bad. I thought it was a lot worse than it was since I smoked weed as well), not very moreish. Very functional and focused but it doesn't have the drive of other amps that I've tried. Definite mood lift and at time euphoria. At times I got pleasant amphetamine body rushes as well.


I ended up doing small (10mg or so) bumps throughout to maintain. I was still going pretty good at 2 AM and decided to pull an all nighter seeing as sleep is nowhere in sight. Been taking little maintainer boosters and I still feel good physically and mentally. Ended up weighing ~40mg or so of 4-FA and insufflated it over the course of half an hour, starting at about 5am and ending at 5:30. Didnt feel it too much. It did kick the euphoria up a tiny bit and added a small bit more of stimulation. At this point I just feel somewhat tired, but like sleep is nowhere in sight. I really like 2-FMA for what it is. Not really one for recreational purposes (does beat being sober though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't use this to get 'high.' I hope most others don't either, because it's not for that. You've got a plethora of uppers at your disposal in which to properly get ripped to the tits off.


Don't spoil this one for me it's better than d-amph. Amphetamine (dex, benzedrine, meth) I found all too euphoric to get any writing done. Housework, maybe. But real work?

qft.  Really all I usually do on Damp to do productive is tweek out on physical assignments, I get distracted as FUCK doing homework usually.  Idk I just don't like to use amps as an attention aid when I don't have adhd and already retain information fairly well... some information atleast.  I disagree with your first statement, I love getting tits high on 2-fma, although I wish I didn't overdo it when I got it trying to figure out eyeball dosages cause now I know how to dose and how to get to that "sweet spot" where you're just perfectohigh for 6 hours.  I only crave more for like a minute an hour after smoking it, it's great, although you can fuck that up dosing wrong

I received this yesterday and am very enthusiastic about it. 


I did find that I don't have any urge to re-dose, as in an actual urge (like with MXE), but I did want to because I wasn't as stimulated as I wanted to yet, but once I reached an acceptable point I didn't want to. I also really liked how you didn't feel "wired" per se, like you had to focus and energy without the just general state of being on edge, it definitely seems to be mildly calming as well, especially when taken orally. 


I had a few questions, in specific if anyone has mixed 2-FMA with any other non-stimulant substance, and how that interacted. Primarily I am looking for combinations with either psychedelics or dissociatives. I tentatively plan on taking some LSD tonight, and am currently on 50mgs oral, so I will report back with that interaction in the near future if it occurs. 


Also, besides the fact that you need sleep, when you're on a substance like 2-FMA that doesn't seem to speed up your heart rate that significantly or present other harmful symptoms of use, is the only health consequence then the lack of sleep or can shit hit the fan after 24 hours regardless of the benign nature of what you're taking? 


Thanks for any and all replies.

**Pink Crystal 2-FMA?**


I know the rules about drug ID threads, and this is NOT one but please let me know if it's against any other rules I'm not aware of.  


Basically, I was just wondering if anyone's ever seen pink, rock-like 2-FMA?  What could cause it to look like that?  It looks more like crystal meth than 2-FMA tbh.  All the 2-FMA I've ever seen has been white powder so this is different in both color and texture.  


Thanks!

Upon further review, I've concluded that this thread is too close to substance identification, as I think most answers would be too speculative. I'm going to move your post into the 2-FMA megathread in case they've seen this type of thing before.

I would like to note that 2-FMA definitely doesn't seem to interact with other drugs in a positive way. But it also doesn't seem to do it in a negative way either. 


The only thing that I could say that isn't redundant in terms of it's interactions is that it seems to decrease the overall effectiveness of cannabis, plus the desire to take it.

I'm planning on getting my hands on this for school and work purposes, as it seems like the only RC stimulant that I should be doing. Now, in terms of mainstream stimulants, what is 2-fluoromethamphetamine comparable to most?

I'm going to find a vendor and order me some 2-fma. I have been using (L-)amphetamine as a replacement for my ADHD meds, but it's just too long lasting. Based on what I've been reading 2-fma seems to have an (almost) ideal profile to help me with mental focus while studying and making assignments. I will report back here after some test trials. 


Also, I'm curious as to what can be said about the neurotoxicity of this compound on it's own. If I recall correctly 2-fma does not release serotonin. And how about neurotoxicity when combining with a substance like MDAI?

I have been using 2-FMA (80mg, once in the morning, orally) as an Adderall replacement, for when my script runs out early.  I've found it to be the most effect adderall-replacement RC, in comparison to a-pvp and 4-FA.

Still here!  


While it's better than 4-FA for daily use, it CAN turn on you when taken for too many days/weeks in a row.  The calm stimulation is slowly replaced by a strange dysphoric effect, though it resolves after 2 days of abstinence.  It's not just a tolerance issue but a loss of good effects PLUS an increase in side effects (jitteriness, low mood, anger, dysphoria, etc).  Maybe it's just me?  I don't take more than ~40-50 mg per day and only use the oral ROA.

^really? hats off to ya for using it daily, i took 80 mg of 2fma, my normal (recreational) dose, and i am not even the slightest bit tired even after a percocet, 6 etizolam, and about to be 2 mg clonazepam. i am sensitive tho when it comes to not being able to sleep. 


lady codone....im looking everywhere and i cant get a straight answer. with klonopin..if i took 2mg yesterday and i want to get the "exact" same effects really, as in intensity (i really like the first 4 hours) would i need to take more than 2mg? some people on drug forum that because of the long halflife, you wont get the "peak" until the half life has completely left. i dont even feel tired, i just feel blank, and distracted. my meds (klonopin) help me focus and be productive. i guess im just wondering if i redose if it will work the same as it always does. im taking 2 weeks off benzos starting saturday, its gonna suck, but i know if i dont do it now, it will be even harder next month. thanks if you can shed any light

Anybody else experience highly amplified facial flushing/heat sensations when combining 2-FMA with alcohol? It's happened four times now that I remember so I'm fairly certain it's 2-FMA that's the culprit. It seems harmless but I'm curious as to what the cause might be.


Also, I've had a lot of success potentiating amphetamine (Adderall) with small IM doses of 2C-P (~1-2.5 mg). It really enhances amphetamine's verve and there's few psychedelic sensations from the 2C-P at that level (this is purely for recreation, not focus). I suspect the same is true for 2-FMA but wondered if anybody's tried it.

Woops, just now seeing this post Aphex.  I'm not all that familiar with benzo tolerance, but I imagine you'd have to double the dose to get the "exact" same effects as the last dose.  But that's obviously not a very safe path to go down.  I do know that benzo tolerance rises quickly and can only be lowered by abstinence.

np, thanks for the reply. im tapering somewhat. ive havent got back into daily use but when i do use benzos, every couple days, i am using slightly less than i used to, and just going from there. and not to hijack the 2FMA thread, but i think i like 2FMA more than 4FA really. it just makes me feel really good for like 5 hours straight focus from 90mgs. i never take more than 100 mg's oral because you dont get a whole lot more from it, just a more noticable comedown. ive never tried redosing 2FMA (since it lasts a really long time) but i dont think it would be a good idea. who knows tho

"I took an NMR of the 2-FMA from october and it came out with a significant peak at 9.6 indicating contamination from the precursor aldehyde." Quote from SOS, from a big EU vendor.

I consumed  at least 1 g of this batch, how worried should i be?

well that is worrying, I took a gram of it at around the same time from the same vendor. Has the user posted the NMR anywhere else?


Where do **-* keep their NMR scans? Just been on the site and I can't see any.

aldehyde naturally occurs in alot of common foods, i wouldnt be too worried. my batch came from the same region, same time frame (last september) and im about to polish off the gram i recieved with a final dose of 80 mg orally. just waiting on my vitamin C extended release tablet to wear off. dont want it weakening my amp buzz.

I believe, 2-FMA indeed binds to SERT. In order to underline my statement I've collected some info from papers regarding the effects of X-F(M)A's.

I've made a comparison chart with gathered scientific data coupled with personal experience.

Unfortunately, I cannot say anything to the in vitro potency of 2-FMA but I tried to derive data from experience in the end.

Would be great if someone could complement the summary with data for 2-FMA. 


potency expressed in mean of self-administered dose in mg per kilogram body weight (tested on apes), that is sufficient as cocaine replacement:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4-FA


0.32


3-FA


0.23


Meth-A


0.10


In vitro potencies of inhibition of monoamine uptake in nano-moles (the lower the stronger) :

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4-FA


DA : 33.3, NE : 18.3, 5-HT : 218


3-FA


DA : 24.2, NE : 16.1, 5-HT : 1937


Dextroamph


DA : 8.0, NE : 7.2, 5-HT : 1756


Meth :


DA : 4.67, NE : 6.47, 5-HT : 116 


LD_50s of fluoroamphs vs. amph in mice :

--------------------------------------------------------------------


2-FA


100mg/kg 


4-FA


46mg/kg


d-methamphetamine


55mg/kg


d-amphetamine


98mg/kg


Correlations between experience and scientifically obtained effects profile (speculation) :


4-FA : 


Is far less potent but has a worse LD50 than d-Amph and d-meth -> overall higher toxicity. For me it also feels very draining the next day (if more than 80mg is consumed).

4-FA has half of the potency of Meth regarding 5-HT reuptake inhibition. The DA/5-HT-ratio of 0,15, which is the highest in the above data, underlining it is better suited for social settings

than any of the other compounds. 4-FA is the most similar compound to Meth of the above, if you can say that, because DA inhibition it lacks significantly.


3-FA :


3-FA is less potent but has a similar effect on monoamine reuptake as d-Amph. If you just take the above data into account, the effects shall be the same as d-Amph with a slightly better DA/NE-ratio, meaning less jittery, but a slightly worse DA/5-HT-ratio, meaning supposedly more head fog but perhaps the activity on 5-HT is too weak anyway. Also 3-FA was considered the most effective cocaine replacement of every substituted amphetamine (including meth and d-amph). That means that it is highly addictive/moreish.


Meth :


Is somewhat outstanding, as the DA/NE-ratio is <1 (more dopamine, less norepinephrine) . That would explain the absence of side effects, that users describe and also the addiction potential. The pretty high DA/5-HT-ratio could also be a contributor for that. The high DA/5-HT-ratio is responsible for the depression when in withdrawal.


2-FMA :


Is not mentioned above. But I guesstimate from the effects that its profile is something like that :


2-FMA


DA : 20, NE : 16, 5-HT : 750


For my taste there is too much serotonine action going on, making the effects unpredictable. Also it has completely different effects if you change the ROA. Insufflated it is okay, but orally

it has too much SRI - qualities ! Please correct the data, if there are errors. If you can provide data on 2-FMA, it would be great.

Wow, thanks for the info Ziiirp!  I wouldn't have thought 2-FMA (or meth for that matter) would affect serotonin so much.  4-FA definitely "feels" like what I associate with a serotonin high while the others are more classic stimulants.  #learnsomethingeveryday


Will have to look into the aldehyde thing more, as it's a bit worrying.  Different batches DEFINITELY have a different feel, if only slightly.  One gave me swollen lymph nodes in my neck + headache while the other didn't.  And the appearance was completely different (white powder vs. light pink rocks).  Good to know.

At around 50mgs does this have less anxiety than caffeine? I cant recall it having any of note from my last try- apart from the regret i felt realized id taken too much and was too wired.


I know vaping is meant to have more of an overbite to it but I am talking about with oral dosing.


I ask cos after an extended period of 6 months abstinence ive started reintroducing psychoactives again by having a cpl of cups of coffee a day and its just ghastly stuff as i remembered. the second teaspoon seems to be the danger zone where what ive dubbed the 'creeping doom' starts to kick in where you are standing perfectly still and yet it feels like you wanna crawl out of your skin due to some unknown terror which seems to lay just around the corner. 


Anyhow 2-fma doesnt have anxiety like that does it? Just want to check cos the caffeine comedown feeling is fucking horrible and want to avoid it wherever i can! 


From what i remember i didnt have the 'frights' even when i took 120mgs of 2-fma i didnt have anxiety just was fucking wired at 10 am and had insomnia and dopamine depletion for a week+ after. If my memory serves me it was just a slow gradual return to baseline.

What would be a good light dose for me to get a feel for it again? 


Ive often fallen into one of two traps in past dosing with rcs. One is take to much at the outset and thus overdosing. The other is dosing low to be 'safe' and being dissatisfied at having dosed too low redose and overshoot the mark and end up overdosing again. Both situations lead me to becoming terrified of drugs, throwing my stash and vowing allegiance to The Good Lord that Ill be a good boy forever more, which lasts a few months and I would repeat the process. 


So Id like to prevent this childish routine from occurring again. 


I was thinking 50mgs. but Im thinking now 30 and then leave my house immediately and go do something outside to leave it at one hit and quit. 30 should be enough for a threshold of effects right? i have no tolerance now after 6 months of abstaining. 


If I can have a cpl of non frightening doses and get back to baseline again then Ill have gotten a feel for the high and gain some confidence in my dosing.

30mg should be fine, as you are already wary of dosing high keep it on the low side (as you have stated).


Oral dose btw.


Plugged 100mg of this a few weeks back alsong with 2ml gbl and it centrainly put a rocket up my ass when it came to getting things done (and just getting genenrally high) :D

I don't like this substance at all;  totally no recreational value for me and even as a replacement for my methylphenidate it didn't fit. Yeah there's some stimulation, but no euphoria or anything pleasant about it.

That description of caffeine is SPOT ON, Harambulus!  Caffeine definitely has too many side effects for me, and I love stimulants.  Too much adrenaline and peripheral nonsense.  


2-FMA can get a little jittery but only at high doses (which is around the 50-60 mg mark for me).  Taking it orally and avoiding all other stimulants makes this less likely.  I've never tried Adderall or dexedrine but I imagine this is the closest thing in terms of RC's.

^ No nausea, but it definitely causes a burning/gnawing pain if my stomach is empty.  I find myself eating waaay more just to keep it from happening.  Antacids/baking soda seem to help a little.

^albion- i get that too but it always goes away real fast. but i do get a naseuous moment sometimes. i took 80mg (my regular dose on an empty stomach, and it felt really acidic and putrid in my belly, but thanksfully the good vibes of the chem, subsided my mild queasines. and my good friend AA had the same experience but never threw up. hope that helps -aphex

I just wanted to share my experiences with this chem from an addiction/habituation perspective, having gone through 1g of the stuff in approximately 2 weeks and with another 2g on the way. I am predisposed with an addictive personality, so my experiences may be taken with a grain of salt, but I personally find 2-FMA to have significant psychological addiction potential. The functionality of this chem, along with its low side-effect profile and pleasurable effects seem to cultivate psychological dependence.


By this, I mean that being able to take 2-FMA throughout daily life (work, school, etc.) and enjoying the effects without interfering with my normal tasks makes it all too easy to fall into daily use. 2-FMA is actually highly effective for school reading and assignments and makes work more enjoyable day in and day out, most likely because I'm riding a steady stim buzz the whole time. 


Daily use is an easy habit to fall in to, and one that is hard to break as long as I have more in my stash, mostly because of the simple little question of "Why not?" And to be honest, I still have yet to find many reasons why to not use it as long as I have it, other than abstaining for abstinence's sake.


Others have reported not feeling compulsions to redose with 2-FMA. I disagree, but I think it depends on how you define compulsions to redose. If others mean that the drug's come down does not produce uncomfortable or undesirable feelings that prompt redosing, then I agree with them, because the come down is certainly not unpleasant in a way that creates the desire to redose. I personally do always feel the desire to redose, however, in order to chase the pleasure and productivity of the initial dose. Redosing becomes even easier with the low side-effects profile of 2-FMA as a safety net, preventing serious complications from continued dosing.


The reason I find 2-FMA habit forming but NOT addictive in any physical sense is that I used it pretty much every day I had some in supply, maybe skipping 2-3 days in a 2 week period, but I experienced absolutely no withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing use when my supply ran out. I pretty much just went back to life as normal, ordered some more, and while I do miss the zest it added to my day I don't find it hard at all to continue with my day-to-day life.


These are just my experiences and reflections to date, hopefully someone finds them useful or informative. I will have another (larger) supply of 2-FMA by the end of this week so I will update my experiences in a couple weeks.

^agreed.


2-fma is one fantastic chemical. When dosing try taking a few anti acids before doing to boost hte effects, or if you are feeling straight enough and a pipette up the anus won't make you start questioning your sexuality, plugging 2-fmagives a nice Rush and requires a lower dose to oral dosing ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Some very sound advice, much appreciated amigo. I plan on putting myself through the willpower gauntlet when my next order arrives, which will consist of letting my stash sit untouched for at least a week after it arrives and strictly adhering to some pre-planned dosing schedule after that, most likely 2 days on, 1 day off and never on weekends. Not terribly rigid, I know, but sustainable IMO.


I must say, however, that my experiences with psychological habituation with 2-FMA are nothing compared to what I experienced about a year ago with good ol' prescription d/l-amphetamine. I had virtually no control over how often and how much I dosed, and IME 2-FMA has a fraction of the addiction potential of prescription amphetamine. Any others care to weigh in on this comparison?

I'm not into stims at all unless I'm shooting speedballs, the only time I ever take an amphetamine is adderall when I have to study for finals. It sounds like 2-FMA is perfect for someone like me who is looking for something that is subtle and just would give me an increase in focus and energy. Time to try and find some!

I've only ever used 2-FMA orally, and there's not a terribly large amount of info, anecdotal or factual, available on it compared to other RC's. All the info I have encountered, however, seems to unilaterally report that any non-oral ROA results in quicker onset, stronger "rush" or "buzzing" effects, shorter duration and *increased* peripheral and undesirable side effects; basically a "sketchier" feeling, as you said you have already been told. It seems pretty clear that oral dosing is most suitable for productivity whereas insufflation, plugging or IV/IM is best left for recreational use.


I know they're different chems, but I've read virtually every scrap of info about 4-FA that can be found on BL & Erowid, and the same principle of oral=functionality, all other ROA's=recreational use.


If you're looking to stretch out your supply, there are other measures you can take to maximize your stash's efficiency. Particularly, never dosing on consecutive days, dosing on an empty stomach, maintaining a high intake of good quality protein (whey protein powder is a must-have when I'm using 2-FMA or 4-FA) and supplementing magnesium to prevent amphetamine tolerance (preferably magnesium citrate, definitely NOT magnesium oxide) and Acetyl-L-Tyrosine to boost dopamine & NE production. I've also read in several anecdotal reports that some caffeine when the main effects of 2-FMA are waning (around the T+2:00-3:00 mark for most) can extend the productivity-boosting effects.


Also, for productivity/functional purposes I find it much better to stretch a given amount of 2-FMA out over multiple doses than bombing the whole quantity in one go. For example, I find dosing 30mg initially followed by 10mg at T+1:30, T+3:00 and T+6:00 to be exponentially better for productivity than bombing 60mg at once or doing two doses of 30mg. 


Hope this helps! Let us know what steps you decide to take and how it goes!

Have fun snorting hot shards of glass. Seriously, that's the description I've read about snorting 4-FA many times over.


Trying plugging it. It's not *too* much stronger than oral dosing, but it completely avoids any nausea and you come up within 15 minutes. It still has a higher bioaviailability nonetheless. 


I have yet to try 2-FMA. I've also been a bit wary of trying another FMA compounds after trying the very toxic feeling 4-FMA. Shit felt so dirty.

I found 2-FA pretty good if it hadnt given me a slight head ache the next day sometimes.

Is 2FMA really that different or is it very similar to 2FA?


I dont care for 4-FA because I have phenethylamines for that Im looking for some clean stimulation and it can be more on the DA side rather than NE.


MPA is out for me because I find it strange cant say why, EPH I had that and took too much of it so I take a long break.


So should I get 2FMA, alpha pvp or amphetamine which is supposedly over 70%

I've actually been playing around a bit with insufflating 2-FMA over the past day, and I must say I am pleasantly surprised, especially considering I'm typically opposed to any ROA besides oral. For functionality, my "sweet spot" is 10mg oral + 10mg insufflated at the same time. I've found combining the two ROA's, rather than dosing orally at first and boosting via insufflation as many others seem to do, allows the two doses to balance each other out very nicely and the effects are better than taking all 20mg either orally or nasally. 


Combining oral/nasal administration produces the quick onset and stronger effects of insufflation while the oral dose negates the "sketchy" peripheral side-effects associated with dosing solely via insufflation and extends the duration of the effects, creating the same timeline as solely oral dosing.


Insufflation did seem to lose a certain amount of it's punch after several 10mg bumps, however, and my suspicion is that previous nasal doses had caked the inside of my nose and dried it out, thus limiting the effectiveness of subsequent doses. My theory found some supporting evidence when I indulged in a long broil in my sauna/shower, and as the heavy steam cleared and moistened my nasal cavity I could taste the strong drip from the 2-FMA caked in there, and shortly after felt a strong rush as if I had just bumped a decent amount. My next insufflated dose came on as strong as my first one, and I believe I have good ol' steam power to thank for that.

I dont understand how you guys could take it everyday as i had a weeks insomnia jsut from 1, 120mg dose. i chucked my benzo stash at the time cos i decided oi didnt want to tackle one substance with something even more addicitng. 


So you guys must really be deep into benzo dependance to be dosing daily. Since I refuse to use benzos the insomnia alone would ward me off of daily use.


Besides that tho, even tho its easier on the body it sitll def feels like your on a drug and i wouldnt wanna feel like that usually except for the occasional recreational. Im t total usually so i imagine im prob more of a stickler about feeling clean in body and mind than most.

From that nightmarish week of torture ill tell you it certainly isnt!


I think I blew out my dopamine cos i drank a ton of alcohol as well- like 1/4 bottle of rum or some shit within 45 mins getting overconfident- and bottle of wine or so and had some severe chills and dysphoria for a bit. That happened both times doing 2-fa too before that went off the radar. Each of those times overdoing it with the alcohol have produced acute dysphoria and fear i overdid it and subsequent ill effects on the comedown. 


I was reading how you can have insomnia from both too high dopamine, as we all know, but also too low dopamine, so i figure maybe that might be why. 


So its hard to say how much of a contributing factor that was because i overdid it every time with alcohol each time i either took 2-fa or 2-fma (only twice and once respectively). 


Note Im not a 'wild one' or anything with taking substances but i just was unaware of what a bad effect the alcohol would have since i never drink unless i take stims and it seemed really enticing at the time as you know how smooth alcohol goes down with speed. I know better for next time. The feeling like a shriveled prune from alcohol dehydration sends shivers down my spine just thinking about it.


Ive vowed not to touch alcohol if i take it again- gonna try weed instead. At least if i overdo it with weed i figure ill just come down quicker and go to sleep.

I don't use benzos at all, I just don't dose within 6 hours of going to bed. Also, I don't dose more than 20mg at a time, so there is never anywhere close to 120mg in my system at once. My daily schedule is extremely busy though (wake up 5:00am, work out 6:30-7:30, Job 1 8:00-3:30, Job 2 4:00-8:00) so I'm naturally so tired in the evenings that sleep is never hard to find regardless of any stim intake.


I also am having trouble believing in a week-long period of insomnia being triggered by a single dose of 2-FMA, even if it was a higher oral dose than most recommend. In your case, I'd definitely look to alcohol as the primary suspect for your difficult experience. If the alcohol intake you stated is accurate it sounds like you had the equivalent of 10 alcoholic drinks (1.5 oz. shots hard liquor/12 oz. beer/5 oz. wine) in under an hour. You probably had some slight alcohol poisoning going on, and IME when I drink to such excess I have problems sleeping well for a couple nights after my bender. 


What other psychoactive substances had you taken the day of your experience and in the few days prior?

I hadnt had anything else. Im t-total usually and hadnt mixed anything else. 


Prob the alcohol then cos another symptom I had was being really cold and couldnt get warm. Id turn on all the heaters in my room and stand right by them and was still freezing. Also I got a severe headache for 30-mins to an hour and my speed high was blunted and replaced by dysphoria till I drank lots of water. Then after a bit the coldness and headache went away a bit but still my high had been blunted. 


Like I say the 2 times I took 2-fa and once I took 2-fma I went crazy on the alcohol the same way each time downing wildly in short order so havent been able to say from my own experiences but seems likely now form what others are saying. Just read that hypothermia is a symptom of alcohol poisoning leading credence to this as the offender. 


This is good to know if it was the alcohol as the likely culprit cos I hate the stuff usually and would be easy to miss out. 


That fucking idiot juice! :D


Thanks for the heads up; good ol' harm reduction.

I found 2FMA an incredibly reinforcing and compulsive stimulant.  I've been on mixed amphetamine salts since I was a kid, and have only rarely used it differently than prescribed.  Amphetamine salt is a 'work, study, or clean' stimulant.  It makes me feel energized but I can hardly call it euphoria.  Methamphetamine can be very euphoric but the general manic nature and long lasting effects kept me from ever taking it to the extreme.  2FMA acts in my body completely different from classic amphetamine.  I do not find it a very good work or study drug at the 20-40mg level.  And when I took it up to 60mg, it became incredibly euphoric on a scale that only cocaine could beat.   For a few months I was eating truly insane amounts every couple hours and it is really the only drug that had some cognitive toll on me.  I also would have hallucinations on the insanely high dosages, hearing voices and a friend who was with me one night when I was binging on the stuff said I was seeing people that weren't there.  I honestly have little memory of this time, but I had enough awareness to know it was making me crazy, I guess I just didn't care.


Thankfully all of those cognitive issues went away when I stopped using it.  But for a while, the few friends who knew what I was doing really began to fear for me.


I imagine people react differently to this like most other research chemicals.  For what it is worth, it did take me a few tries with 2FMA to 'get it.'  It is like methylone in that respect...one's mental state (and maybe even what they had for breakfast) can affect the end result.

I'm generally pretty wary of RC's, but my good friend who is not sported me a gram or so of 2fma.  After some research I decided to go for it.  I've always enjoyed stimulants and have been using them recreationally for probably 20 years but my experience with them is mainly limited to pharms like ritalin and adderall, and way back in the day ephedrine trucker speed haha. 


I had about 2 grams to play with.  First session I started with an oral dose of about 5mg eyeballed on an empty stomach and coffee (not very sensitive to caffeine) just to see how my body reacted to that.  After no reaction I decided to bump up a notch to about another 10mg.  That dose got the ball rolling for me and I immediately recognized the come-up as similar to adderall - that busy feeling and the sudden urge to start cleaning and read the Post from cover to cover.   At about 2 hours and no negative side effects  I decided that my dosing scheme was going to be similar to adderall so I decided to add another ~7ish mg. My typical recreational dose of Adderall is 20 - 40 mg depending on my supply and how saucy I am feeling that day.  I'm not into tweaking and do like to be able to get to sleep within 24 hours of a decent dose.  

Long story short I was all together pleased with my 2fma sessions and would say it was close enough to adderall that I was already planning on getting more.  I have to agree with other posters that 2fma has a lovely smooth clean stimulant buzz that lasts awhile, however does lack some of the euphoria, at least at the dose I did.  

I did however experience a couple of negative side effects during subsequent session; the 2nd time I dosed 2 days later I experienced an uncomfortable achy feeling in my chest and and joints.  Obviously I can't make a direct connection and I had been smoking cigarettes (stims have always made me mad crave cigs even though I rarely smoke tobacco anymore); the same session I got chest pain after smoking a little weed at the end of the day but it went away within 10 mins.  However, 3rd and last session I had none of the achy feeling BUT I drank about 4 beers that night and had a nasty headache the next day.  This makes I'm inclined to agree with some other posters on this thread that 2fma probably does not mix well with many other chemicals.  Also tried insufflating maybe 3-5mg to test the reaction.  Burned quite a bit at first but it went away quick, maybe 10-15 seconds. 


One more note... a big selling points of stimulants for me is the horny factor and this didn't disappoint.  


Would I get more? yes

@MGS: 40mg is higher than I personally would ever use as a work aid/study dose, I try to stick to mg for any functional purpose. I have to agree with you on the compulsive nature of 2-FMA when used on consecutive days (or weeks!). Also, I've noticed that the same dose (10mg for example) doesn't deliver too diminished of returns on consecutive days *until* you bump your dosage up, even once.


For example, I had been using 10mg doses 2-3 times a day for about a week, and each dose felt more or less the same, with the obvious exception being my initial dose of the whole week which was more euphoric, as that first dose of anything always is. That weekend, however, I made the incredibly impulsive and foolish decision to bomb 40mg and insufflate another 50 at once to see what the rush would be like. The two outcomes of my stupidity were (1) hours of scatter-brained, panic-ridden anxiety from my massive dose that wasn't the least bit enjoyable and (2) all my doses for the next week were ruined. 


The day after my mega dose I tried to use a functional dose, 30mg, which was higher than my usual but I figured I had to account for tolerance. All I got was an elevated heart rate and a weird dysphoria. For the following week I was determined to taper off my usage, so I dosed 10mg twice a day on Mon-Weds and 10mg just in the morning Thursday. The dysphoria never returned, but neither did any noticeable effect from the dose. I'm not craving more 2-FMA now that my stash is empty, but i do have another en route. I've learned my lesson though, and never plan to dose over 10mg at once again so that these small doses retain their efficiency for me.

i find an oral dose of 80 mg to be perfect if your looking for euphoria. anything more than 80 mg is a waste. you wont get any higher, just a more pronounced comedown, stimulated and bored at the same time. i use benzos for this amount. i do it to be productive AND feel awesome. my advice, dont go over 80 mg, you will get euphoria. a buddy of mine did 100mg with me one day, and 80mg the next week. it was identical with less comedown(which is mild, im just sensitive to amp comedowns).

The clean euphoria of this is really nice, less side-effects then amps but the comedown is just as shitty and annoying imo. I just hate feeling that boring stimulation for hours after, then I get the motivation to socialize and instead I turn into a jittery annoying jackass around poeple. I even smoked weed and took benzo's but the boring stimulation was there for hours. Makes me remember why I stopped taking amphetamine but the peak/euphoria is better with 2-fma. Overall, I guess this is a nice drug to have around when you need to get shit done and makes me not need amps anymore but with regular usage I bet euphoria goes away and all that's left is the shitty side-effects...just like with amphetamine. Gonna try 4-fa next that one sounds more enjoyable when it comes to recreation and socializing. I literally got in a 10minute shouting match with this girl that pissed me the fuck out (she fucking started getting angry at me for the dumbest things and I just lost it, fuck her seriously I told her I was crashing from speed so she should've just fucked off...felt pretty nice to put a bitch in here place, the rest of the chicks there were cool as hell though so i'm not calling you all bitches ladies ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)) though so maybe that made the 2-fma less enjoyable to me...the actual high was really nice don't get me wrong. I'll be taking this again but lots of weed/opiates, and benzos are essential for the crash.

You make a good point, I was tapering down my use because after a couple days of the large doses I previously noted I was a little lethargic if I didn't use 2-FMA and I had too busy of a week to afford being drowsy all day, even for one day. Pretty much I just used the bare minimum to help me be alert and on the ball, I didn't really get any buzz or side effects at these low doses.

4fa is best when snorted. Unfortunately it burns, but people need to be a little less pussy about it seriously. The burn goes away in under a minute. 


I found 2FMA to feel almost too clean, never tried 4fma, but feels WAY cleaner than 4fa which feels clean to me in the first place.

2FMA is much more research paper oriented, on 4FA i was able to learn 16 cover songs on my bass in 1 night, redosing periodically.. which is pretty nuts imo..definitely gave me the energy and focus. 2FMA feels more mathematical and 4FA feels more like creative energy.

well im going to go with 4FA since i cannot for the life of me find any available 2FMA

i heard insufflation burns like a motheruckfer, but i can suck it up, i dont think it can be too much worse than ethylphenidate was to me.

i'll post a report of that when it arrives.

Or you could plug the 4-FA instead of insufflation. Much better ROA in all respects.

Lasts longer than meth (the useful parts). A good long time.. 

Little to no comedown with proper nutrition

Cracks back like glue in the pipe and takes 5-10 sec. (In contrast with 4-fma - which comes back completely clear (blew my roommates mind))

More appetite supression than meth (i assume due to PNS stimulation from levo-2fma.)

More paranoia than meth (at times)

I literally did not need or want sleep for 3 days. Then my body had finally had enough and the ettects just lost their reward-induced reinforcement and I slept and ate fine.


This stuff release maassive DA and Ne. I feel like d-meth's serotonergic effects kind of act as cushion/insulation to the socalled wild west of exponential ininhibited DA in the synapse.  iv route is preferred due to massive rush but itll guaruntee you look/act spun all day(and night).


Order of fav routes: IV, oral, vape off foil, sweet puff, sniffed. If i was a plugger id proll get my jollys at the same mg's iv.


Its not meth. You need alot more for a rush followed by really analytical type thinking (excellent study aid in lowest oral doses - large amts might affect memory.


Overall I prefer it to dmeth when ivd. Less crazyness. But for smoking d-meth wins. Its just as moreish if not moreso. Only consequences of extra high doses are high blood pressure and pulse. Also with medium-high doses there are some visual effects (hard to describe, different than intense colors/blurry speed vision.)

I really don't see any comparison to this stuff and meth at all, actually. This is probably the worst substituted amphetamine I've tried for productivity as well as the least euphoric. 


Buuut I'm in fiend mode. Thinking about combining 30mg orally with 600mg gabapentin and maybe some etizolam.

For the sake of keeping this thread alive, I'll post some more insights regarding 2-FMA that might be of worth to some. This thread is virtually the only solid body of anecdotal information about 2-FMA anywhere on the web (not a single report on Erowid, nothing accurate or useful on other forums and not much on BL besides this), so let's try to keep the ball rolling.


The initial reduction in effects from dosing on consecutive days occurs after about 2-3 days of repeated use, as is the case with most any drug ever. After this, however, this "new" level of effects can be recreated on consecutive days (or weeks even) from the same amount of 2-FMA for pretty much as long as you care to continue dosing. I've been using 20mg oral in the morning on an empty stomach before my hour-long daily commute to work, and the effects are consistent every day. 


Any redosing, however, consistently produces greatly diminished effects during periods of prolonged use. What I mean is that, as I stated above, I get the same effects from my daily 20mg morning dose every single day. A second (or third or fourth) dose of the same or greater amount as the initial dose, however, produces significantly diminished effects. It's as if the brain recharges enough overnight to allow the first dose of a day to work properly, but there's not enough recovery time within a single day for subsequent doses to be as effective.


Also, during periods of prolonged daily use I've found the effects I experienced on the first couple days of using 2-FMA with zero tolerance CANNOT be recreated no matter how high you push the dose. For example, if I haven't used 2-FMA in a month or more and take 20mg oral it produces focus, mood-lift and other dopaminergic effects similar to d-amphetamine but much, much smoother. The same dose taken the next day will have more or less the same effects, and on the third day these effects can be recreated with a slightly higher dose (30-40mg). After the 2nd or 3rd day however, oral doses as high as 60 or 80 mg will not reproduce the same elevated mood or productive focus and instead result in over-stimulation and insomnia.


If you plan on using 2-FMA for extended periods of time, you have to accept that it will not feel as good as it did the first day or two of dosing and not try to chase that initial high or you'll end up overstimulated and not be satisfied. That being said, 2-FMA has been fantastic for me over the last month or so, with my use being daily on weekdays and taking a break from it on weekends. Far more functional and sustainable than daily d-amphetamine use IMO, you just have to find the lowest dose that provides desired effects and is still functional and not try to push the limits. 


Also, all of this only applies to oral dosing. Nasal doses seem to be qualitatively different than oral doses and I suspect that, as some others on this thread have speculated, that something in the metabolization process causes oral and nasal doses to essentially be different drugs in terms of effects and side-effects. I don't find nasal dosing to be sustainable over multiple days due to excessive side-effects and "sketched-out" feelings and greater feelings of neurotransmitter depletion.

So my last batch of 2-FMA (from a reputable source) caused all kinds of worrying side effects.  Sore muscles, burning urination, stomach pain, back pain and other weird stuff.  The lower back pain got so bad I ended up in the ER thinking it was a kidney stone or smtg (no stones showed up on tests).  I drink about a gallon of water a day--sometimes more--so I don't think it's dehydration.  Just got sent home with Lortabs and "take it easy" orders.  No real answers.


2-FMA might not even be to blame, but the more I used it the worse the symptoms got.  Never had anything resembling this from 4-FA or any of the other stimulants I use.  I was using about 20-35 mg of 2-FMA plus about a half-gram of kratom per day at the time.  


Take this post as you will.  I haven't seen any similar reports so it's probably just my weird body reacting poorly.  Still worth mentioning though.


@ Hatrix - How does one "plug" something like 4-FA?  Does it burn as bad as snorting?  (God I hope not).  Ever try plugging 2-FMA?  I get horrid stomach acid from it and wonder if plugging might help.

This thread is virtually the only solid body of anecdotal information about 2-FMA anywhere on the web (not a single report on Erowid, nothing accurate or useful on other forums and not much on BL besides this), so let's try to keep the ball rolling.

Hear hear!  That's a very good point, and inspired me to contribute a bit with my experiences with 2-FMA:


In my search for a legal alternative to Adderall/Vyvanse, I came across 2-FMA and have tried it many times.  I would typically dose 20-30mg (in a gel cap) right after eating a light breakfast.  Within an hour, I noticed being more alert, sweaty palms, increased heart rate - the typical physical affects of a PNS stimulant.  I never really got that "push" or "urge" to get work done like I do with Adderall/Vyvanse, which is what I was hoping it would do.  For me, low doses of 4-FA make a better (albeit not wonderful) substitute for when my monthly meds run out early.


The few times I tried 50mg, thinking it would give me that rewarding push, I just got uncomfortably stimulated and wished I had taken a bit less.


I do like that one dose lasts 12 hours, and there is virtually no comedown.  It's a very, very gentle stimulant in my opinion.  I don't have experience with redosing or using it to stay awake for days.  I hope my limited use of 2-FMA is helpful to somebody out there!

Yes and yes to this. I don't understand how some people manage the "recreational" doses they report of 100mg or more, I've always found 40mg to be as high as I can push things before inducing some anxiety and some worrying cardiovascular issues (shallow breathing, rapid heartbeat, chest pains, etc.).


 Stick to 30mg or less, avoid shoving it up your nose, and don't take any within 8-10 hours of when you need to sleep and you should find this a very useful substance. Problems arise when you start losing sleep, binge dosing, or snorting this substance. Oh, and make sure you get proper nutrition, even if you don't feel hungry. As others have noted, whey protein shakes are an excellent way to do this, as they are easy to get down and are packed with amino acids that refuel your brain and body.

2-fma is by far the most pleasant rc stim for vaporization to date. the smoke goes down like air, no harsh burn, no bad taste, no complications at all with a proper vaporizer at temperatures around 190-200° even the HCl goes into easy to inhale smoke. while vaporization might shorten stim duration one can expect a nice rush even at small doses like 10mg. rush ends pretty fast tho and turns into a functional stimulation. no jaw clenching, no shakes, no sweats, no heartrace with small doses. never did more than 20mg in one session and  never had a problem with sleep 3-4 hours after last vape dose (always around 6-10mg), however it greatly reduces appetite (even the day after).

So my health issues were definitely unrelated to 2-FMA (diagnosed with lady problems that I won't mention here).  I've been using 2-FMA about 5 days a week since then and find it very effective for focus/motivation.  ~10-20 mg per day max.  Good stuff!

Glad to hear it wasn't the 2-fma giving you issues. I have no complaints with 2-fma. Long lasting stimulation with little in the side effect department. Only negative experience was from using it too often , leading to dysphoria / low mood as Lady Codone pointed out earlier in the thread. What do you Bluelighters think about the recent blue batch of 2-fma that has been making its way around in terms of quality?

^ I thought the blue batch was excellent.  The blue color faded permanently once I left the bag open for a while.  It reeked of mothballs so I let it set out for a while in case any weird impurities were left behind (not sure if that even helps, but no adverse effects were noted).

Appreciate the info. Also for anyone who may be wondering , someone had theorized that the reason for the blue tint in the current batch floating around is from oxidized ammonia. This isn't lab proven by any means though.

So I`ve had 2-FMA on and off the last 2 or so weeks. I like plugging small doses which I find to be some what euphoric as the day progresses. I`ve eaten gel caps with 2-FMA inside but I don`t enjoy the effects as much compared to plugging. 


So far I`ve been enjoying this chem.

Regarding different batches & potency, I can't comment on this "blue" batch but my most recent orders have been a darker shade of beige than earlier batches and the recent orders have been more potent as far as I can tell.

The batch I got a couple weeks ago looked pure white and crystalline. After further examination under better light, it has a pink tint to it. Seems plenty potent, as I wouldn't want to take more than 60mg.

Apologies if this has been covered (I searched but no luck) -- Many people have compared 2-FMA to d-amphetamine or adderall, and I have a couple questions:


1) I'm wondering if anyone could speak to approximate equivalent dosages.  I realize they aren't quite the same drug so there is no dose at which they are perfectly equivalent, but basically, if I wanted to achieve as close as I could get to 30mg of adderall / 70mg of vyvanse, how much 2-fma and by what ROA?  


2) Has anyone combined 2-fma with adderall/dexedrine/vyvanse/desoxyn?  If so, did you take them at the same time, one before the other, etc.?   


My goal is not to party or socialize, but to be able to focus on an *extensive* writing project (and preferably do so in such a way that I can avoid getting distracted by tangents that lead me to spend several hours on footnotes that, in retrospect, concern rather trivial matters.  So basically smooth, very long acting, rather constant strong (not not overly-hyperfocus strong and certainly not tweaking strong) focus.  I think I can do that if I can add approximately 30mg of d-amp (oral) worth of 2-fma.


Also, I'm new -- so apologies if this is worded in a way that is inappropriate... still trying to internalize the norms here.

While I can't help you with dosages in relation to other amphetamines, I can say that 2-FMA performs great on its own. I don't feel as if I need to add anything to the experience. I've had some small amounts of caffeine but definitely not anything substantial. A 30mg dose of 2-FMA orally gave me the focus to work for four hours on a math project of mine , completing it with stimulation still being apparent. I wouldn't combine it with any other stimulant, due to fear of increasing my heart rate to an uncomfortable point, personally.


On another note, interesting to hear about the pink 2-FMA. This stuff seems to be something straight out of Breaking Bad. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also, I found HighestWhenLow's post on page four to be pretty ridiculously close to my experiences. It is extremely easy to get to the point of regular use. The smooth comedown as well as almost complete lack of side effects honestly makes it rather difficult to reinforce that its probably not the most healthy. The worst I have gotten is slight kidney pain and palpitations but those are honestly pretty rare  Recently finished a gram of it and plan on taking a nice long break now. I find it almost comparable to MXE in that you never  *need* it , but things would feel a lot more swell on it.

1) I am prescribed vyvanse.  I typically take anywhere from 70-120 mg a day to get where I like to be.  When my script runs out early, I substitute with either 2-FMA or 4-FA (I've been switching between the two because I'm still trying to find out which one I prefer as a replacement for when my script runs out).  For me, personally, 35-38 mg 2-FMA (pink and fluffy batch) gets be going pretty good and lasts allllllll day long.  Be careful, though.  Any more than 40 mg and it gets more uncomfortable than functional: noticeably increased heart rate, uneasy body load, so stimmed to really get things done properly.


2) To try and stretch my vyvanse script, sometimes I'll take 35-38 mg 2-FMA in the morning.  Then an hour later, I'll take 40 mg Vyvanse.  This combination is WONDERFUL for days when I'm exhausted for whatever reason, or need to wake up extremely early.  The 2-FMA provides a feeling of complete alertness, and the d-amp from Vyvanse really makes me want to accomplish.

Awesome, thanks for the information.  Are the doses you indicated oral?  I sampled some 2-fma that I think was of particularly poor quality -- 75mg oral did not produce even threshold effects (though the same dose insufflated was mildly effective -- but I don't prefer that ROA for my utilitarian purposes).  I'm going to sample some from a new source shortly and I'll keep in mind that an active dose may very well be much lower than that.  Also I'll keep a lookout for pink 2-fma.

im excited to try this one.  unfortunately the only time i make decent money is when im on summer break, defeating the purpose of its use.


how well does this work as a study aid compared to adderall or methylphenidate?

Dude... yes. Kidney aches and heart palpitation are my tell-tale signs that I'm pushing it even by my standards. You summed it up perfectly: you never need it, but things seem easier when you have it. My use has been pretty frequent (3-5x/week) for several months now, and some new side-effects have been popping up the past 3-4 weeks that weren't present initially, specifically blunted emotions, some OCD tendencies, and this occasional discontent where some days I'm constantly craving the next activity/part of my day only to be dissatisfied when it arrives and to start craving the next thing; an inability to be still and content is what I'd call it. Will definitely be taking a LONG break from this one, i've reached the point of over-use where taking the stuff feels like more of a chore than anything.


Below if my older post  that Nimhod references in his post.

If others mean that the drug's come down does not produce uncomfortable or undesirable feelings that prompt redosing, then I agree with them, because the come down is certainly not unpleasant in a way that creates the desire to redose. I personally do always feel the desire to redose, however, in order to chase the pleasure and productivity of the initial dose. Redosing becomes even easier with the low side-effects profile of 2-FMA as a safety net, preventing serious complications from continued dosing.

I pretty much just went back to life as normal, ordered some more, and while I do miss the zest it added to my day I don't find it hard at all to continue with my day-to-day life.

Weird question, but does anyone know if 2-FMA is a 5ht2b agonist?  I wouldn't suspect it based on its effect profile, but you never know.  4-FA seems more likely to fit that bill, sadly ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Seems there's a lot of fluctuation regarding dosing.


I'm looking to use this as a caffeine replacement - focus enhancer Saturday/Sunday mornings when I go play poker. So looking to use as a picker upper & improve focus , not looking to get high or euphoria as it seems 4-fa (which I've tried & liked) will be my go to substance for that , as far as the -fa/fma sereis is concerned (have 3-fa/2-fma on the way , will likely try 4-fma as well)


Would 15-2O MG be a good starting dose? 


I tend to play 5-8 hours , and will take a dose right after I eat (at the card room) but am thinking if I plan to go over 4-5 hours maybe a small redose would be neccasarry.


I'd like to get away with using like 3Omg max a day, 2 days a week. Batch is the pink stuff raved about on here.

15-20mg should be a great starting point. IME 2-FMA is a very long lived stimulant. You shouldn't need to redose to keep motivated for 5 hours. Be careful, as you may want to anyway. Its not that the need to is there, but its so transparent, its easily justified to yourself. Like adderall.

Ok thanks for the reply.


Ill just refrain from having more then the initial dose on me when I go , so redose will be out of the question.


Will update thread with my opinion after my initial test (next Saturday). Will start with 15 and see where that takes me.

Still using small amounts of 2-FMA daily with no major problems to speak of.  The jaw tension is pretty severe and often turns to headache, which is pretty annoying.  Sleep quality has been shit but that's nothing new for me.  Excellent functional stim if you don't abuse it.


Also, I was wondering how the fluoroamphetamines compare to prescription stuff like dexedrine or Adderall.  I've never tried them so I have no reference point.  How are they alike/different?

I find 2-fma very similar to Adderall, at low doses they are close to indistinguishable IMO. I've used a lot of both as well as meth & dex. However I'm not much of a dex fan; it lacks euphoria & feels dirty to me. I always feel this nagging sense of incompletion, I assume due to the lack of euphoria. I also crash from dex but not from other amphetamines. 15-20mg of 2-fma feels equivalent to 30-40mg Adderall, not a recreational dose but a pleasantly motivational, functional dose.


At higher, more recreational doses 2-fma feels a bit more euphoric than Adderall but not nearly as euphoric as meth, with a fewer side effects than meth but not as many as Adderall. 


If I'm really tired I snort, oral use tends to put me to sleep sometimes at functional doses. This occurs with both Adderall & 2-fma but not meth or dex.

^ Thanks!  So 2-FMA is more potent than Adderall on a mg basis, huh?  Interesting!  


I've tried meth once and didn't find it all that similar to any other stim I've used (except maybe Benzedrex).  Have always wondered what the different prescription amphetamines feel like.  


That's weird you find dex more "dirty" than Adderall.  Always heard it was the other way around.  Different strokes I guess!

Yep, I find 2-fma in between Adderall & meth in terms of potency by weight. For me at least.


I've encountered many people who prefer dex, in fact I think more people prefer it over Adderall than vice versa. And they do say they find Adderall dirty feeling, often. Strange how that works! Dex honestly feels like ephedrine to me, or maybe in between ephedrine & Adderall. I have a friend who prefers dex to Adderall but prefers 2-fma to both. He also prefers meth above all amphetamines.

Yep, I'm one of them. Racemic amph just lost it's shine for me. I feel too tweaked out, and my moods tend to swing a lot with racemic amph nowadays. Dex just makes me energetic, a bit euporic, without the downsides I experience from racemic amph. Just a clean fun high. I have actually bothered little with the fluoroamphs since I refound my love for d-amph.

Does anybody else feel like 2-fma stays in the body awhile? With adderall I can tell the next day I did a stim, but with 2-fma the effect is a lot more pronounced. I've had some friends agree and disagree with that statement.


BTW We like 20mg doses, never nasal or even sublingual. Combined with sunifiram/pramiracetam was a very nice combo where my thoughts were next to surreal, and of course..... wait for it... no crash! Unless you redose of course

Never tried Adderall but I agree that 2-FMA seems to "hang around" for a while.  I find myself clenching my teeth after 8 hours of sleep.  Maybe it's got something to do with the "meth" component?  It doesn't feel like a nasty byproduct or anything, just lasts forever.

IME with 2-fma and prescription d-amp (dexedrine), l-amp (vyvanse) and mixed amp salts (adderall), 2-fma takes the blue ribbon as best functional stimulant because of it's smooth come-up, plateau and come-down and a less compulsive nature compared to the prescription amphetamines.


Prescription amphetamines, however, come with a considerable side-effect profile in my opinion, and just because 2-fma is the best among these doesn't make it totally benign. So far I prefer it to prescription amps, modafinil and 4-fa for productivity and studying purposes, but it still can take a toll on users if they aren't cautious. 


Physical side-effects unique to 2-fma are kidney pains and a strange tightness in my lower legs. Psychological side-effects are primarily paranoia, obsessive-compulsive tendencies where none existed prior to 2-fma, and an inability to feel content after extended periods (5 days or more) of continued use regardless of dosage.

I figured I would make this post as I am not sure how many people have done as much 2-fma as me, anyway after plugging aprox 300-800mg at a time several times every 24 hours with small breaks here and there for a few months of my life (on top of heavy use before) I noticed some serious effects that methamphetamine on its own never produced (however I never quite used meth for as long I tended to go harder nd longer without food or sleep, I noticed meth never had much of a cross tolerance with 2-fma, however there is some for sure). On to the main side effects:


-Unable to smoke pot, hot knives resulted in blacking out and physical injury

-Extremely bad heart pains (also intensified by the fact my muscles were being eaten away from lack of nutrients) and cardiovascular flow, extreme pain that weed potentified 1000x even from one toke.


I would also like to note some effects that 4-fma managed to produce from only using 2 or so grams over 2 days with a break between these 2 days. Also at the time I had never used very many stims in my life and I had no tolerance, I would like to note all of the above effects are included on top of these:


-EXTREME light headedness and dizzyness I blacked out and fell injurying my back on a bath tub and blacked out a couple other times but i was careful after that. Even sitting down made me light headed.

-EXTREME Depression, nothing like anything I ever seen off a drug before except the one time I mixed a bunch of random rcs. 


Some of the extremeness of these side effects may have been in hindsight contributed to the fact I didn't know how to use amphetamines at the time. I redosed very frequently despite ineffectiveness and took no attempt to preload, postload or prevent tolerance build up. But meth was definitely forgiving on harm reduction forgetfulness iMO.


Anyway I know these effects are for the most part in parallel to what amphetamines do to your body I would just like to note most likely 2-fma and DEFINATELY 4-fma are far worse for your body then meth, and that research should be done into these compounds into what the fuck they might be doing to our cardiovascular system and even brain that meth isnt. 


Forgive my sentence structure im a recovering methaholic lol, I have also been up all night.. sober.. thankfully xD

Whoa.  Thanks for your input.  


My typical dose hovers around 20-30 mg, so I can't fathom what 800 mg must be like.  2-FMA has some vasoconstrictive effects but doesn't fuck w/ my body temp as much as 4-FA.  Real meth had far fewer noticeable side effects than *any *of the fluoroamphetamines for me, but we all know meth is neurotoxic as hell so "feelings" aren't always a great indicator of toxicity.  (I've also heard that meth is much "smoother" than Adderall or other amphetamines in terms of side effects too).  


My main hope is that 2-FMA is roughly as harmful as prescription stimulants like dexedrine or Adderall.  We desperately need some human studies on this class of drugs since people (me included) are using them daily.  


2-FMA is one of the few drugs I can combine with cannabis w/out freaking out lol.  800 mg might be a different story though ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Its nice having someone as extensively experienced with 2-fma as you are chime in on this thread, but I gotta wonder if you have any support or evidence for your blanket statement that 2/4-fma is more harmful than street meth, besides your personall experiences of course.


Consider this: for someone with absolutely zero amphetamine or drug tolerance, the oral dosages would be roughly equivalent, with 10mg of 2-fma being a good starter dose (as was the case with myself and several others I know) and meth being active orally at 5-15mg according to Erowid.


Now look at your anecdotes. If we're comparing 2/4-fma to meth, then would someone plugging 300-800mg of meth several times a day for "a few months" be in better shape than you currently are? I've never used street meth, but my common sense says anyone using meth that way wouldn't last a month.

Does anyone here have any kind of remedy / way to minimalize the up and down mood changes? Even the first few times I've tried 2-FMA , I'd eventually get this strange negative feeling that is extremely uncomfortable and brings down my mood temporarily. I just want to stop whatever I'm doing and do nothing until it goes away which hinders productivity.

Sleep and spacing out 2-fma experiences are probably the simplest solutions. As far as I can tell, the negative effects of 2-fma can be largely eliminated by spacing out uses even by as little as 5-7 days, and it definitely doesn't seem to require as long of a waiting period as stronger monoamine releasers or even as long as 4-fa, which I have found really should be spaced out by at least 2 weeks between uses.

It's interesting you like the 2-fma & weed combo, my experiences have left me feeling the exact opposite haha. 4-fa for me is phenomenal with a bit of high-grade herb, and to a lesser extent I find 4-fma goes nicely with weed.


2-fma and marijuana, however, makes me prone to some intense paranoia and also negates the productivity-boosting effects of 2-fma while simultaneously preventing me from falling into a nice, content and relaxed pot high.

Appreciate the replies. Sleep and water are definitely what I'm least concerned about , as I make sure to get ample amounts of both. Vitamin wise though , what should I be looking to get? I already use vitamin B6/B12 and am probably going to get some magnesium as well. Will be spacing out usage as well for good measure. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I originally had claimed that 2-fma was kind of shitty, but upon getting a job working overnights and having a couple stints with it over the past few months, i have realized that it's potential is absolutely incredible. If this shit is safer than adderall by any chance, it's a fucking goddamned miracle.


When used throughout a 9 hour period, dosing 2-3 times in the former half, this compound is fantastic for getting things done. By the time i go home, i eat and sleep fine. I've found that the more I take, either at once or throughout the night, the longer it lasts. The effects don't really get stronger, though. It's more like... I get what I get with it, and that is energy, focus, and wakefulness for 6-10 hours.

Well said, I've read other reports that also describe a ceiling-effect on 2-fma's desired effects, meaning that taking more creates greater effects only up to a certain point, at which point increased dosing only increases peripheral side-effects and duration.


@Nimhod: My experience with potentiating amphetamines with antacids was that the neutral and negative effects of the drug (racing heart, vasoconstriction, anxiety etc.) are potentiated much more than the pleasurable effects, and I've read many anecdotal reports that have also suggested this. Obviously this is all subjective, but I would suggest avoiding highly acidic foods and eating a more alkaline diet instead of using antacids.

I am a huge fan of this chemical.

At 30mg notice a strong yet very fluid euphoria that lasts 80 minutes after dosing which then tapers off into a residual stimulation that can last up to 10 hours.

It is a very adaptable chemical as I can take this at parties with dosages like 30mg every hour or two.

I have also mixed MDMA with 2-FMA and it was incredible but I acknowledge also dangerous.

The other use for it is studying which I use at doses of 15mg taken every 80 minutes.

Concentration is increased a lot (especially at maths) and studying or writing is a pleasure.

Today for example I did 5 hours continuous study with the stuff.

As far as comedowns , they are basically nonexistent with this as it very gently tapers off.

I am planning on dosing this relatively high for the next 3 days due to exams and will report further when they are done.

Ok here is an update.

I ceased dosing early in the second day as negative effects became massively evident.

Every time I stood up I would get a very intense head rush along with very concerning tinnitus.

Hallucinations in my peripheral vision where also becoming more frequent.

I still love 2-fma though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have used adderall, dex, meth, ritalin, 4fa and tons of stimulants like modafinil and seleguline. 

**Are you looking for a meth replacement? Don't get 2FMA! **

Its a very smooth and comfortable high that lasted the whole day when I smoked it. Very pleasant feeling, like modafinil but better, not fun at all though. It feels like a blanket of energy, not tweaky adderall energy or even dexedrine energy, its closer to modafinil than anything else. Not fun at all, I want to emphasize this. Adderall is fun, 4FA is fun, but this is nothing more than an all day coffee to me, without the tweaky feeling.


Highwhenlow's report is very accurate, but I have no problems with redosing. It lasts too long, its not for me.


Its a functional stimulant with no real enjoyable effect at least when I smoked it. I'll update it if I change my mind.

^ Interesting you don't find it "fun", Issac!  I guess I don't really either, but there is some euphoria at times...the euphoria of not feeling like an exhausted zombie, which is my natural state of being.  


My main complaint right now w/ this chem is how tense it makes me.  My doses are insanely small and spaced out over the day, but I still get some dysphoric tweakiness from it.  Jaw clenching, tight leg muscles, restlessness, etc.  I feel bored but nothing sounds fun.  Hard to describe.  


Wish I could try Adderall or dex for comparison.  You're right about it being nothing like meth though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Got a couple questions...


Does anyone know if (pure) 2-FMA will react to (common) field test kits for illicit substances?


Does anyone know if 2-FMA falls under the Federal Analog Act or not?


*From 21 U.S.C. § 802:*

*(i) the chemical structure of which is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II;

(ii) which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II; or

(iii) with respect to a particular person, which such person represents or intends to have a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.

*


Seems to fit (i) completely given only difference to meth is a couple fluorines... but for sections (ii) and (iii)... IDK sorta kind maybe a bit like meth and d-amp... but to a great enough extent to be an issue!? IDK!?


**I'm possibly interested in using it for non-recreational purposes as a mental performance enhancer.**

I'd like to throw out a question about 2-FMA in comparison to 2-FA; am I the only one the experiences 2-FMA as _way_ more vasoconstrictive (cold hands/feet, sometimes almost painfully so) than it's cousin? I think I've come to favor 2-FA over 2-FMA in regards to the transparency of effects as well - 2-FMA might be functional, but when it comes to cognitive labour I think my thought processes become noticeably muddled. 


And in connection to this, I'd like to know how you deal with vasoconstriction (I'm currently using 5x piper nigrum extract in capsules, L-arginine, and taking regular breaks with some exercises - sometimes theobromine capsules as well - but still find the vasoconstriction irritating)

Might give guanfacine or clonidine a try.


And just two cents on the legal status, the only case I found where someone was arrested with 2-FMA ended with charges being dropped.

Being an amphetamine, 2-FMA will likely test positive in a field test (which are generally non-specific).  They could take your ass to jail but the charges might not stick once it's sent to a legit lab.


Anyway, not much new to report on my end.  Still taking low doses of 2-FMA 5 days a week and finding it effective for boosting productivity/energy.  My mood is a little unpredictable on it, but can't be sure that's the cause.  Hoping to try some 2-FA soon to see how it compares.

When ever I first start taking either 2-FA or 2-FMA I notice some vasoconstriction. I normally take a combo of 1 aspirin,2 or 3 B complex vitamins,a multi-vitamin and when I can get it(i.e. steal it from work)I wash it all down with a medical grade powdered L-arginine supplement called Arginaid. Kind of seems like a lot of shit to take all at once now that I type it out. LOL   But it does really help out with the cold hands/feet,at least for me. 


I do notice that after using 2-FA/FMA a few days in a row the vasoconstriction goes away for the most part.

Figure I'll give it a try. I've got a tiny quantity on order, and of course use Vitamin C/PQQ/Methylene Blue/Aspirin/Lucidril/Memantine.


I'll also try picking up a field test kit and see if it tests positive, and test common solubilities.


Will report back soon.

So this is interesting, and a bit unexpected. I got a chance to try reacting 2-FMA with Marquis reagent (bag #2). Bag #1 is d-meth for reference. These are each 5mg in 200 micoliters of Marquis, let to react for several minutes. The d-meth did the classic orange->brown inside a minute. 2-FMA starts clear, and slowly goes to light yellow after a minute or so.

**

Clearly, this stuff tests negative for amphetamines on Marquis Reagent. Interesting info for those out walking around with a baggie of it. %)**


Still may be mistaken for MDPV or Methylone though, I have not seen them react in person but they are described as being light yellow.

I can see how it may have left them disappointed. It could have been genuine 2-FMA but if they used 1 gram in a night, they definitely would have felt something. It just doesn't have much euphoria compared to other amphetamines.

Just wanted to share that I can confirm the kidney pain as others have mentioned. I have only taken small doses 20-30 mg with at least a week between them. The pain is sort of a quick piercing pain which only lasts a few seconds but it has me very very worried about this stuff. Does anyone know what the cause of this could be and how dangerous a threat it poses? Otherwise this substance is wonderful, just as euphoric at times as 4-FA but not pushy at all.

Yea well I get strong hypertension when I drink a cup of coffee too. I quit all caffeine several months ago because I couldn't take the dizziness and jitters at the dosage necessary to keep me energized working at my very physically and mentally draining job. I have only had a curiosity in other stimulants since then, nothing more than that. I think it's important to find the kind of dosage that is acceptable and safe on the human body regardless of the effects and then assess the risks going beyond that with respect to potentially desirable effects.


And remember, caffeine is lethal in easily obtained doses. Amphetamine is handed out to millions every year. I don't want to sound like I am trying to defend this new substance but I think it's important to keep an open mind. It could be useful to people. We simply need to know more about this substance before deciding it's no good.


Edit: 21p you seem to be knowledgeable about these substituted amphetamines. Do you have any opinion on 4-FA?

Hahaha, well thanks man, but I'm far from being an expert. 4-fa is serotonergic compared to 2-fma, so that's a huge red flag for daily use. As far as cardiac issues, I have no first hand experience and haven't read enough reports to get an idea of which receptors the chemical might also hit  (aside from what's obvious).


The real danger of hypertension whilst taking these types of chems vs. 4 hour energy or a red bull is the possibility of vasospasm induced arrhythmia progressing to acute myocardial infarction. Most users probably aren't over 30-35 yoa, so the chances of these types of problems are significantly lower.

If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, I strongly suggest you rethink daily use. If you have a history of heart problems or high blood pressure in your family I would recommend skipping the substituted amphetamines altogether.

Anecdotal evidence isn't the best, but I took 50mg today (first time in quite a while). I took a set of baseline vitals before - BP 96/72 HR of 48 (I'm working out again, if you haven't guessed from my Hannibal Lectorian vitals ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Reporting back in, the plot thickens. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Urine taken at t+8h after ingestion of 50mg of 2-FMA produced a clearly negative test on the amphetamine immunoassay, but an ambiguous result on mAMP (an extremely faint line, you can barely see it). Repeating the same test on 2-FMA dissolved in water yielded a clear positive for mAMP, and still negative for AMP.


These results interestingly conflict with the supposedly high cross-reactivity to amphetamine immunoassay reported in one of the few studies of 2-FMA: [http://bitnest.ca/external.php?id=%7DbxUgY%5CC%40%1BR%2B8%3CW%5C%0E%05%15%1CVIv%7C%7E%14TwxGD](http://bitnest.ca/external.php?id=%257DbxUgY%255CC%2540%251BR%252B8%253CW%255C%250E%2505%2515%251CVIv%257C%257E%2514TwxGD)


This is the same batch of 2-FMA that I tested with Marquis, so I can rule out contamination with actual meth.


So what to make of this? Well nothing is certain. However here is what I'm thinking...

-Previous (very silly) claims that the fluorine is magically stripped off of 2-FMA to yield methamphetamine are clearly debunked, as meth would have started metabolizing into amphetamine, leading to an AMP positive. I mean who the hell believed that? ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

-Clearly neither amphetamine or methamphetine are major metabolites of 2-FMA, as the latter decomposes into the former via further metabolism, and the former is not being detected.

-2-FA may be a metabolite. I have no idea how 2-FA reacts to the immunoassay.

-The possibility that 2-FMA is excreted by the kidneys intact is still there, and perhaps the most plausible. This would explain basically the same reaction between post-2-FMA urine and 2-FMA dissolved in water to the AMP/mAMP dual panel, excluding differences in concentration. Confirmation of this without GC/MS would require determining specific 2-FMA concentrations that cause a positive/negative screen for mAMP on the brand of test I'm using via binary search, followed by repeated collection of urine into a large container and subsequent systematic dilution until a negative test is obtained to figure out the concentration of 2-FMA, and thus see if the detected concentration matches up to the initial dose over some long period. This should theoretically be a way of confirming that either 2-FMA or something that reacts to the test in an identical way is being excreted in the exact same concentration that is being ingested. Of course if elimination methods other than renal exist, this seriously complicates things.


Anyway, food for thought. I'm still trying to get GC/MS done on my piss to solve this once and for all. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Tweek, here are a few thoughts I had while reading your post:


1. Very creative approach, but a GC/MS on your urine won't be accurate for excretion unless you are John Nash's understudy. You will be able to test for the presence of 2-f and metabolites, but don't expect anything more. Way too many variables to control for and the kidney is not an accurate barometer of what the body does *consistently over short periods*. Any 2fma metabolites present may have gone through several rounds of decay/enzymatic manipulation at unknown rates.


2. You will learn the most useful information about the drug by nabbing blood glucose, aldosterone, and hormone panels timed specifically to 2fma's observed duration of action. Although the chemical is novel, it isn't new. We know what catecholamines and sympathomimetics do (for the most part) and know what to look for when we piece together symptoms as part of a 'constellation dx.' I will be very surprised if the chem degrades much at all.


What I think we'll see after some research on 2fma:

1. greater activity on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the peripheral vasculature when compared to adderall/dex (explains vasoconstriction)

2. decreased duration of binding/affinity to inactive sites caused by steric hindrance, similar to MDPV. (explains marquis)

3. Increased risk of pulmonary htn (medium to long run)

4. Increased risk of CHF/D (long run)

5. Several absolute CIs related to 1-4,


One last point: I dunno if it's a good idea to post anything that could be misinterpreted as medical advice on bluelight unless you're 100% sure you're correct or the risks of being silent are too high. No disrespect, but about half of the last post was inaccurate (even the bradycardia comment, I'm afraid... which sucks bc you bolded it hahaha. been there, done that. Will probably do it again a few more times today...

Huh? I'm fairly sure bradycardia is defined as a heart rate of below 60. Does it have any clinical significance if it is athletic bradycardia? no, but bradycardia none the less. My bodyfat is a bit high ( 15% ), but I'm in the best shape I've been since high school. I just did my first sub-minute 400m (while off any drugs) in years, granted my heart rate was in the neighborhood of 200 at the end ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


Edit: Tried 2-FMA with clonidine today. Baseline vitals were BP104/76 52HR. Administered 100mcg clonidine at t=0. Vitals taken again at t+1h, BP88/70 46HR and 50mg 2-FMA administered. Vitals at t+2h BP 100/74 56HR.


So it appears for me at least, 100mcg of clonidine roughly negates the hypertensive effects 50mg of 2-FMA. Again, not that I seem to be someone with a tremendous amount to worry about in the hypertension department to start with...

Athletic left ventricular hypertrophy is still the subject of debate in the medical community, especially in pathology. If you have vascular issues as the cardiac muscle fibers begin to expand, ischemia and heart attack can follow in theory. The diagnosis is being re-studied bc doctors and medical examiners historically assumed the dead track star's valvular dysfunction was the primary cause of death, not compensatory hypertrophy *leading* to valvular prolapse. There are so many parallel processes occurring it usually confounds the diagnosis, kind of a chicken or egg thing most ER docs naturally don't give a shit about because like 2% of Americans exercise that frequently or strenuously.


This *could be* bradycardia, but normal limits are situational in real life. An old woman or small, physically fit male could easily be considered within normal limits with those numbers, but a 6'3" man would be headed for disaster. If he's African American, the scenario changes again. Often times, these patients are asymptomatic. 


You also have clonidine on hand, which means you either sought it out or it was prescribed to you. This is the first thing I'd note if I was taking your history as it potentially skews your statistics. Clonidine isn't well tolerated in a significant minority of people because it can cause reflex tachycardia and palpitations. You also have to ween yourself off of the drug if you take it regularly. If a kid started self-medicating with clonidine to offset potentially non-existent hypertension, there could be a megashitfuckton of problems when he/she ran out and didn't know better. *In general, you break a cardinal rule when you suggest a treatment before knowing the cause of the ailment.* **Many cardiac drugs are receptor-specific and could be life threatening when taken without appropriate testing**. I didn't want to go nitty-gritty because these types of conversations are not the most interesting reads, and besides... everybody here just wants to get hiiggghhh. sooo higghhh.


Anecdote:

Oddly, I learned this stuff before med school. An eighteen year old football player died under my palms one night in the trauma bay. I cut his shoulder pads off and traded CPR rounds while the trauma team tried to chemically resuscitate him. Autopsy just showed ischemia and 'athletic heart' hypertrophy, no congenital or valvular abnormalities. His family let the issue go, but you should have seen the resident pre-round discussion the next morning. I've never seen a room full of surgeons so confused and argumentative, as they tend to be more self-assured and obsessed with pecking order than other specialties. He probably should have gone directly to the ER, but the two departments were standoffish when I was wiping butts there... which is a reality check on health care best reserved for when I don't have so much stuff to study. 


You seem like a smart guy and you're pretty insightful for not having been through three years of hell. I only know this stuff because it was shoved down my throat with a ram-rod.

Thank you doctor-like people for the information!  It's virtually all that exists about this compound.  


2-FMA doesn't speed up my pulse as much as 4-FA.  I've taken my bp on both drugs and it was within the normal range every time (albeit approaching the borderline for Stage I hypertension once on a ton of 4-FA).  These aren't occasional use drugs for me, it's pretty much a daily thing (yes I know it's no bueno).  


In my years of RC stimulant use, here's what I've found helpful:


*If you're gonna take any stimulant regularly, you need to drink more water than usual and adjust your lifestyle to help prevent cardiovascular problems.  Remember that many things can affect bp and heartrate, such as excess sodium and even stress.  Make adjustments to help offset the amphetamine-induced changes.  If you're experiencing vasoconstriction (cold extremities, discoloration in the knees, headache, etc), take a warm shower or chew some ginger root.  


*Stimulants can cause dehydration by increasing urine output.  Mild dehydration can cause many vague symptoms, such as fatigue, dry mouth, dizziness, dry skin and headache, so drink plenty of water or electrolyte drinks.  Soda, coffee and other caffeinated drinks are like consuming NEGATIVE fluids since they increase urine output.  Avoid them.  


*Eat right, exercise (but NOT while on stimulants) and get plenty of sleep.  Exercising on stimulants is very dangerous because both exercise and stims raise bp and heartrate.  Brush your teeth every single day and floss nightly.  Dry mouth = more cavities.  


Common sense stuff mostly, but I felt like typing :D

Well, I suppose I'm using the term bradycardia a bit more loosely than you are, simply HR<60. The main reason I qualified it as athletic bradycardia. I'm actually 6'2" 205lbs now, and white (insert joke about amphetamine users here) and I have absolutely no symptoms of poor perfusion aside from the very occasional mild episode of orthostatic hypotension if I stand up quickly after a nap we all get. Actually my baseline HR being out of shape is in the 70s. I was in a nasty skiing accident last winter and got deconditioned, and have just finally been returning to *serious* athletic activity.

Sought it out. I actually had a workup from a cardiologist back when I was marathoning seriously a couple years ago. Fortunately I tolerate it quite well, and I use it pretty rarely. I primarily use it to counteract the hypertensive effects of repeated very high oral doses of nicotine, [as clonidine reduces catecholamine secretion induced by nicotine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2887269). Why I take repeated very high oral doses of nicotine is a much longer story... [Although this combination also has the interesting effect of strongly increasing HGH levels](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1463553/pdf/brjclinpharm00154-0149.pdf) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I just decided to see what effect it would have on 2-FMA, as it wouldn't carry any risk of adrenergic storm, unlike say, beta blockers. (Granted this isn't much of a real risk until the doses get insane)

I've heard several anecdotes of athletes dropping dead of undiagnosed HCM. Deconditioning obviously does work to differentiate the two. Also he sounds like he would have been a prime case for being resuscitated by ECMO if he got high quality CPR, too bad it is just now **starting** to see use for out of hospital arrests... ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Waste of time unless you want to spend 90% of your life devoted to your work. I went back at 29 and think it's much easier if you're younger and your body can handle the hours. You will have to ignore the majority of people outside your immediate family (most *can't* understand until they've done it, which is a weird dilemma) and be forced to interact with people just like yourself... except younger. Hahaha, it's great at times and other times I question the decision.

I don't think I would do it over again, which is what the majority of physicians say. You have lateral mobility but almost every specialty is highly regulated.


Idiopathic HCM in athletes = undocumented growth hormone and steroid abuse/dysfunction. Our local gym is full of unfortunate fellas destined for a similar fate. The world is strange; everyone pays for their hangups whether they know it or are totally oblivious.

Overall seems to lend a lot of credence to 2-FMA and other fluoroamphetamines being fairly stable from a metabolic point of view. Also interesting about difluorophenylethylamine tending to be attracted to fat cells, resulting in reduced stimulant potency per dose. I wonder if 2-FMA has some of the same issue?

Tweex, I don't have your background in science.  Do you think you could break down what you said for laymen?  What does being fairly stable from a metabolic POV mean?  


This is a substance that I'm very curious about, so I'm trying to get as much info as possible.

"Fluorine in psychedelic phenethylamines" was the name of the paper. I'll try to make it user friendly for ya, **Benny ZA** and explain it without getting too cray with the words.


**Purpose of experiment:**

     -They injected rats with a chemical to slow their body's processing of a psychedelic drug chemically attached to flourine to figure out:


1. *What does this drug do when it's just hanging out in the body?* You'll notice the research is from 1973, which means the writers were probably the first to do these types of experiments. 


2. *How does this fluorinated drug affect the body when there is an excess? **This may be where the answer is, Tweex.** 

-They found that the drug was taken up by fat cells in the rats at a faster rate,but it didn't stick around for very long at all. it was more of a footnote in the research to show the differences between the drug and others.


-**Most pertinent point of article from a medical perspective: fluorinated compounds acidify the blood, although most recreational doses probably don't have as serious of an affect. *This absolutely does not mean fluorine was detaching from the main molecule as the rats started to get high.***<--That would be bad, bad.


What is 'acidic blood'? -It's a roundabout way of saying that if you overdose on some fluorinated compounds, you may run a higher risk of fever, rapid breathing and pulse, and weight loss than their 'cousin' drugs (meth, amp, etc). All of these likely apply to binge use as well as a mega-dose, althought the weight loss is definitely gonna occur with binge use.


"4-FA in drug testing" Didn't check the full article, but I'm guessing that fluorine would stick out on a mass spec. The main question is: is it now part of a regular panel? Don't know, don't care to speculate for obvious reasons... again, give it a little time and they'll be screening for all of em. Guarantee a Quest dx would pick up MDPV after the face-chewing incident down in Miami last year.*

Haven't checked in on this thread in some months, so glad discussion on this largely unknown but useful chem has picked up! Big thanks to the people keeping the knowledge flowing, especially regarding biological & scientific aspects that have probably never been researched before! Imagine that, doing actual research on a research chem ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


In particular, thanks to tweex for answering the often-asked but rarely answered question of whether or not fluorinated amps show up on drug tests, and thanks to those who posted results of marquis reagent tests!


Much love ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Can now someone surely say if the BA of 2-FMA is higher when plugged compared to oral/nasal? Did it a few times but I still cannot tell if it´s worth it plugging 2-FMA and the reports on the net are contradictory.

Oh, the tl;dr on that: even though they aren't specifically tested for, the FA/FMAs *will* cross-react to most immunoassays (eg. the typical 10 panel piss in a cup and stick a stick in it type). For GC/MS they *won't* show as amp/mamp, and have to specifically to be sought out to show up. They are apparently hard to distinguish between with GC/MS testing, it is more a question of testing for "fluoroamphetamines" and "fluoromethamphetamines".


And of course as I posted before, they won't react much to a Marquis reagent for "field narcotics identification."

Figured I might as well voice my input on this substance as I'm on it right now. I dosed 80mg at 7:44am, and then redosed 50mg at 11:30amish. There is an initial euphoric phase, which maybe lasts 1-1.5 hours, then fades into a really really relaxed stimulation. At that point it feels close to adderal, but a little more euphoric overall.

If a normal dose of MDMA was taken, with maybe (and this is just estimation from my experience with each chem, as well as the two combined) 1/4 to 1/3 a dose of 2-fma, it leads to a pretty darn fun time. Just remember, 2-fma last MUCH longer than mdma, even if taken nasally. Dont redose them together, is my suggestion. 


     Ive done the two combined before, and in the right amounts, without any redosing of 2-fma, it was a blast. I probably did 30-40mg of 2-fma, with approx 110mg of MDMA. Had a great night and the fun lasted for over 5 hours. Its not that they synergize, its just that the 2-fma helps keep you going for a solid amount of time. And since pure MDMA is pretty damn psychedelic, and not too stimulating in my opinion, they work nice together. Like I said though, theyre duration of action is much different, and 2-fma lasts much much longer than MDMA. Use the 2-fma to keep you energized for a long period of time, and the MDMA to give you the "fun.".... 2-fma isnt that euphoric unless snorted, and even then the euphoria only lasts 20 minutes for me, and you are left with 4-6 hours of solid stimulation, any redosing in an attempt to get that euphoria back just end up with a MASSIVE overstimulation that is not pleasent. If you redose 2-fma without benzos, prepare to not sleep for a long time.

if I may answer for myself, I also find high doses of mdma pretty psychedelic, not to the point I would call the drug actual psychedelic class but something is definitely going on. Obvious are very vivid colors, and I tend to see the walls melting/warping and weak form of pseudohallucinations, like seeing patterns in objects where there are none. And peoples faces I know well start to look different.

High dose of mdma (let say 200+mg) is psychedelic in the same way as low/threshold dose of LSD (say less than 50-10micro) I'd say

@Laika. Yeah sorry I should have said "pretty damn", implying it was extremely psychedelic. Its not... I dont get massive OEVs, but I do get a decent amount of level 2 CEVs. It has the same effects on lights, colors and sound that a small to medium sized dose of LSD does to me, just without all the crazy visuals. Its possible the MDMA I have been getting it mixed with MDA, which is much more psychedelic than its methylated brother. I also get plenty of songs or compositions playing in my head, huge thoughts and ideas. I think the enactogenic qualities tend to drown out of the psychedelic ones in most people. 


I would MDMA mildly psychedelic, and MDA psychedelic. Whereas mushrooms and LSD would be on the "greatly psychdelic" end of the spectrum.

Hi,

just to reiterate some of the points from this thread - good functional stimulant, minor side effects (little bit of sweating and vasoconstriction), some antianxiety effects especially with oral dosing, not that recreational because the euphoria isn't huge, can be snorted and isn't very painful (doses about half oral, pain is much less than eph, 2c-x, 4-fa, bk-2c-b, ...), comedown is gradual, not very compulsive (for me anyway), for work study I would recommend doses between 30-60mg oral (first dose being bigger, later smaller).... There is some tolerance build up, so taking breaks every so often is a good idea.

2-FMA sounds interesting by what's said above me here.

I'd like to study/focus with minimal peripheral restlessness, agitation that can happen with less than pure amphetamine.

4FA worked really well, but it's been a long while and  was relatively lacking in d-amp experience. 

Paste was and has been really sketchy and peripheral, not so much centered. Pink powder is much better, clean and lacking unwanted side effects.

Been scared away from methamphetamine from seeing before and after pics, mug shots generally. This and the extra strength neurotoxic effects.

To be honest I'm not really sure what the difference between 2-FA and 2-FMA, it's probably mentioned in these pages someplace.

I'm not that sure either, I think 2-FMA lasts a bit longer and is dosed a bit lower. Also has more euphoria if dosed really high.

I bought the 2-FMA because it work out cheaper and was completely satisfied.

Yeah, thanks for getting back.

I'm just being lazy not searching for an answer in bluelight or by other means.

Maybe getting this wrong but methinks 4-FA has a 4-FMA version also, I'll google just to be sure.....

Yip 4-fluoro-methamphetamine.

Now I wonder just how 4-FA differs from 2-FA ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

4-fa and 4-fma release much more serotonin (some call them mdma light)

2-FMA is the cleanest stimulant I've tried to date. I have tons of experience with 4-FA, and still use it often. 2-FMA seems purely dopaminergic, where as 4-FA also acts on serotonin. 


4-FA is more of a "fun" drug to be used for having a good time at a party or whatever, while 2-FMA is purely focus and stimulation. 


2-FMA is almost completely absent of unwanted peripheral side effects, making it perfect for a study or work aid. It lasts a very long time (though the initial part dies down in an 1-2 hours for me), and redosing seems to work great with it. Though it will add to the comedown as expected, but not too much. 2-FMA is perfect for me as a study or work aid. Far better than adderall or anything else I've tried. 


Now, when combined with 5-APDB it's an entirely different story. The combo is filled with lots of euphoria and general rolling type feelings. Either chemical on their own however, and this won't be achieved.

It does make sense, the 2-fma provides the norephinephrine and dopamine and the 5-apdb the serotonin

Precisely. Wonderful combo. As far as dosages, tonight I had 30mg of 2-FMA plugged, then 65mng of 5-ADPB plugged about an hour later. I redosed each again a hour or so after the 5-APDB, about half the initial for both.

Sweet, thanks for the heads-up on this hatrix and black53.

The best study aid out there has been a question at the forefront of my mind for donkeys.

The Methamphetamine tail end scares me with regard to toxic nasties. Perhaps it has a different toxicity profile than the likes of pure out right Methamphetamine.

hatrix, you didn't mention 2-FA, does anyone know if it holds a candle to 2-FMA in the focus department?

I don't think toxicity is much of a concern with 2-FMA, but I may be wrong. From what I've read it seems to be pretty clean.


I have never tried 2-FA, so I can't share personal experience. From what I've read though, it's nearly the same as 2-FMA though I think duration may be slightly less. The biggest issue I read about seems to be a ceiling like effect with 2-FA, making redoses uneffective, whereas they work great with 2-FMA.


2-FA also burns like 4-FA apparently, where as 2-FMA isn't caustic at all for me.

The ceiling effect is a really good way of describing what I'm feeling atm. It's like having nowhere to go but a level plateau then back to normality. Usually caffine or nicotine serve as a boost, actually bought an e-cig yesterday for this purpose.

For sure, have to do further re-searches to find the toxic effects of 2-FA and 2-FMA.

I'd be amazed if it has minimal toxicity. Most if not all good things are bad, even exercise has it's drawbacks. But if the pluses outweigh the neg's count me in. The good thing about RC's is that they're generally a whole lot cleaner than street shit.

Still a near-daily user of 2-FMA and 2-FA.  I find that they both combine beautifully with tianeptine and weed (low doses of all three).  Cardio exercise is amazing on this combo, though I'm careful to stay hydrated and cool.  


Compared to 4-FA, the 2-FA's have nearly no weight loss effects on me.  My theory is that they lack the thermogenic effects of 4-FA, as well as the serotonergic appetite suppressant effects.  I actually eat MORE on 2-FMA because it irritates my stomach and causes that "I'm-hungry-feed-me" gnawing sensation.  


There's definitely a point where all the fluoroamps--and 2-FMA in particular--become dysphoric and anxiety-producing.  I try to alternate them with norepinephrine-releasing stims like phentermine to offset the tolerance.  Works beautifully ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Just wondering if anyone can compare the durations of 2-fa and 2-fma? 


I have seen a few conflicting figures from 2hrs to 6hrs for 2-fa. 


I used 2-fma about 5 days a week until 4ish months back and it is the smoothest stimulant I have used to date but 2/4-fa are both on the way which is why I ask about the duration. 2-fma was perfect for the standard 8 hour work day but is no longer available so I am hoping 2-fa works out as well. I found ethylphenidate to be too short and having to take 3 re doses throughout the day is kind of a pain. 


Peace

2-FA is much more speed like than 2-FMA in my experience. 2-FMA is more gentle and anxiolytic...but can still cause a good rush when you inject a 100mg...even get the cough! I can't really tell you much about the duration as I only ever abused the two of them, and did them til they were gone....

Hey all, I'm about to have a sample of 4-FMA in. I've never been too big into stimulants, more psychedelics, thc and some opiates every now and again. Stims, namely cocaine and vyvanse/adderall have always been a very occasional thing for me, though I have an above average natural tolerance. What would be a good starter dose for cognitive enhancement? I'm not going to be using often at all, probably once every few weeks/months.

In a week, I'll have this stuff and I'll tell you what my thoughts are towards it. I will use it for studying/concentration, not for any recreational purposes. My starting dose will be 50mg and I will just use it when I really need to do a lot of studying at once and have 0 concentration.

Hi,

I'm also on the lookout for a good study aid. I hear that 2-FA is really where it's at in this regard. I have been through all the pdoc's and consultants to do this legitimately. 

Strattera (Atomoxetine)  an anti-depressant that's an SNRI was their forgone conclusion, it's worse than Methylphenidate (Ritalin) for just feeling wired, weird and strung out.

I don't really know the toxicity of 2-FA, opinions seem to differ. I've never seen a paper on pubmed that's been trialled on humans.

Just to offset the euphoric effects (Serotonergic), or the zombie effects of DARI's; anything inbetween would be nice.

Buyer beware.

Any IV users want to recount their experiences?


Was there a rush? How was the duration? Any comparisons with other common, available amphetamines.

Question: Does anybody know the density of this stuff? I can't seem to find it anywhere.

Kind of creeps me out that a substance is so new that people haven't even determined the density under normal conditions...

Did a quick search and it appears to be around 1.07g/cm^3. Don't quote me on this, though. 


Just curious, what's the importance of the density under normal conditions in this case?

I know, double post, but I thought it should be bumped for this:

I have ordered 2-FMA and have used it a couple of times as a studying aid instead of my prescribed methylphenidate, when I **really** needed a long lasting concentration. At first it felt like this drug had 0 recreational value, but it gave a huge boost in my focus. Now, today, I took a lot of it, to check out if I noticed any difference when dosing high. I eyeballed a little over 100mg. It felt about the same as it usually felt, nothing special. A few hours later, I was done studying and drank a beer. All appeared normal, until I was at my third beer. Now the focus made place for a really pleasant feeling. I did not get tipsy, I need a lot more alcohol for that, given my etizolam & alcohol tolerance, but it felt a bit like GHB. Well, felt, this is now ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So basically, today, I found out that together with alcohol this stuff indeed **does** have recreational value. Now I took some etizolam. Fuck yeah, Kisses from me!

It's a completely different feeling from 4-FA, 4-FA forces happiness on you. This combination makes you float, as if your world is waving, you entity is breating. When adding etizolam, as I am on nog (100mg 2-FMA, 8mg etizolam and 5 beers) it became even more pleasesnt, It added a slight euphoria, but mostly the relaxing part is great. I did nearly fall of the stairs, but that's not weird with this in your system.

Exactly. They are really apples and oranges. 4-fa is also an empathogen, 2-FMA is a pure stimulant. I've had a LONG love hate relationship with 2-FMA, and just recently got to try 2-FA. 


However, I have to disagree with you on the mixing it with beers + benzos. I find that mixing chems like 4-fa, 4MMC, MDMA etc with benzos and beer makes for an amazing experience, but pure stims like 2-FMA, or Meth + benzos just counter act eachother. But to each their own! Just make sure to be safe man, blacking out on benzos while also on a powerful stim can be trouble. 


I do agree however about the recreational value, 2-FMA can definitely lead to a fun time, and also makes me extremely horny. Just watch out it is EXTREMELY long lasting, especially because of the drip, unless you have benzos or lots of alcohol (or something similar) prepare to be awake a long time. 


When taken orally, in the right dose 2-FMA can make your day 1000X more productive. However, once you treat it like a "drug" or fun time or go snorting it, things go downhill ( at least for me haha ) , you can get overstimulated quick (in which case take a benzo or something similar). If I had to very quickly type something that represents 2-FMA, I would say: Amphetamine without the extreme on-edge-ness, and teeth grinding. 


2-FA was much more subtle and pleasant. But I only got to mess around with a small amount of it. 


Anyways, without getting off track, 2-FMA is a very fun, functional and worth while stimulant, however has ZERO of the "I'm on top of the world" type of euphoria that Cocaine or even some good meth produces and doesn't give me too much focus or creativity . All the euphoria is more body-load type with this one. Never had a single negative side effect (besides lack of sleep) and I have gone pretty hard on this stuff.

That said..... always be safe, I don't want anyone ending up seizing off this stuff. I usually try to keep it under ~100mg over the course of a night but have obviously gone way above that before. Just make sure to be safe guys, always. Start small. If you are snorting this stuff, your lines should be 1/3 the size of a cocaine line, or even smaller! This stuff is much more potent. 


I have probably done a total of 30+ grams of this stuff in my life time and am always happy to answer questions about it. 


Note: don't bother trying to smoke this stuff, it will ruin your teeth and NOT get you high.

**injected**


IV'd this substance 40mg in two shots, second was made after 10mins.

Gives you a rush, i think second shot had eyenotiacble more 2-fma. and very relaxed feel and imo euphoria feels at head and warm bodybuzz and stimulanteffects are so smooth as people has said. Dammmm, this fiills so easy. I have some amphetamien tolerance(MDPV,A-pvp,mpa,eph,street amphe and so on).

Ι am very curious about this compound.. Is it the best concentration, pleasurable focus rc available?

I wish I have the chance to sample some.


By the way methylphenidate and ethylphenidate from what I have read seems too "dry". Not sligthly pleasant. 

Does it compare to the old prescription anti-obesity drug **mazindol**?

Got various stims, ****of which 2-FMA... what is a "good" dose for a rather big fella (oral)?**** and **what is the oral duration of this one? Is it a decent BA with this ROA?** What about sublingual (my favourite ROA for EPH...) This is mainly for concentration, slight mood lift, and motivation at work, so don't want to be gurning or headache or nothing... **How will it interact with ritalin or EPH (probebly no point combining right? no real advantage/synergy/better focus and more risk of side effects from too much dopamine?? **)


Thank you to anyone who can provide preferably sourced answers, or who is very experienced....

Two CNS stimulants don't mix easily..    


Especially a cathecholamine releaser (*amphetamine) with a re-absorption inhibitor (*phenidate) is a mess.

Hello fellow Bluelighters,


I´m asking here again: is 2-FMA worth plugging it for recreational purposes? I´ve read many contradictory reports about it. And if not, is nasal still better than oral?

Also, I couldn´t find any real dosage informations. Everyone says something else. Could someone make a suggestion/chart about dosage?

Fuck the haters, just because you enjoyed a drug doesn't make you a shill. I very much enjoyed 3FP. Unfortunetaly it's too smooth and doesn't really have a rush. I was using 2FMA on and off almost daily for about a year. It's smooth and in low doses spread out during the day is awesome for mood, energy, and even has a tinge of anti anxiety in there. You can still eat while on it, but make sure if you plan on sleeping it will be at least 4 hours (in my case at least) after your last dose unless that is, you pop some benzos or something.


Problem is I was using it as my everyday drug and my party drug as well. Eventually I stopped hanging out with friends and co-workers as much and just wanted to sit around, write music, occasionally fuck and snort lines. It's not extremely euphoric or more-ish compared to other drugs out there, but when you get into a daily regiment of mental state change you lose focus on reality, it got old quick. The only drugs I do now are super intense ones, I no  longer intend on being slightly high to get me through the day. Rather I  wait to get home and go ape shit ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

After testing this for while I have to say its a good stabilizer. Functional like 2FA but less euphoric but also longer lasting and it can potentially get you through the whole day. 


Focus is not extreme but good and it's mostly the wakefulness component that works. Very tedious tasks seem ok but thats about it. It still kind of works where other stimulants fail. Ritalin is good for focus but by now I could sleep on it after drinking a beer.


Modafinil is ok but way too often hit and miss because of its strange side effects. 2fma has always similar effects.

I was cycling between modafinil, 2-FMA, dex spansules, 4-FA and 3-meO-PCP with days and weeks off in-between.


My normal dose of modafinil is 50 to 100mg. Last week I tried 150mg and felt it was too much for me. My typical dose of 2-FMA is 20 to 40mg which suits my purposes well.


I don't dose 2-FMA often nowadays, maybe once every week to 10 days.

Well, I thought I might share some of my 2-FMA experience since there is not much information on this one. So, I finally quit using kratom back in December of last year and had quite a bit of this stuff sitting around at the time. It helped give me the push I needed to get through withdrawal which then became a daily habit. I basically went through around 8 grams since then. The worst of the effects was definitely on my circulatory system. I was getting crazy tachycardia, shortness of breath, strange gastrointestinal behavior, overheating, dizziness. It was nothing horribly unmanageable, just frustrating given 2-FMA's ability to provide that extra motivational factor and contentedness.


Anyway I ran out 2 days ago and so far I haven't experienced any sort of terrible crash. I am getting what you might call a sort of lapse in concentration like you get when you are really really tired and your brain just sort of gives up. It's almost a strange feeling of newly found awareness as if my body is sort of saying, thank god he's not putting this stuff in me any more. Maybe I'll provide an update if withdrawal kicks in, but so far I'm kind of surprised.

Thanks for telling about your long-term experiment. Good to hear, that you stopped, since there are rumors (with anectdotal evidence about a doctor's analysis) about the metabolites of 2-FMA being cardiotoxic. Of course it is a matter of frequency and dose but taking it regularly I consider significantly more dangerous than for example a Kratom habit (which also depends on the dose of course).


Regarding the crash of 2-FMA : My impression is, that the metabolites linger quite some time in the organism and during that period you won't experience the typical stimulant comedown symptoms. Perhaps you can give feedback on that a few days later.

Yea thanks for the response Ziirp. The stuff definitely has a long half life and who knows what kind of damage it has done that I may not be aware of yet. For now, I'm feeling ok, just sleepy and a bit out of it. I mentally crave it out of habit, but physically my body is feeling better than it has in a while.

**2-FMA gets a Yellow Light for Safety**


Last year I was taking 2-FMA twice a week or more along with a few days of modafinil and 4-FA and ritalin. It was not a sustainable cycle. It became boring and did not provide a consistent level of stimulation needed for creative endeavors.


There was some days I was dragging in mental energy, which i attributed to the cumulative effect of all my meds and substances, including a statin and Lopressor.


It takes time for all the metabolites and dregs of drugs to get worked out of the system, i've learned my limits and tolerances and spread out the dosing of 2-FMA and similar substances, due to an overabundance of caution in my old age.


In the mid 70s i was regularly taking windowpane, geltab LSD, using a unique and rarely discussed ROA, directly into my eye. It's been a most interesting life,  2-FMA may actually be more dangerous than the old days, perhaps?


There is a crash but I am not convinced it is too cardiotoxic as there are several users such as Lady Codone who seemed to be ok on long term low daily 2-FMA doses.

I finally had the chance to try 2-fa, as well as 2-fma.  2-fa wasn't bad especially if its for certain purposes such as studying and what not, other than that very minimal euphoria.  Just after my first trial with 2-fma, I'd say this my preferred one.  


Others mentioned not as much euphoria induced by taking it orally, with which i tend to agree.  Plugged on the other hand was a different experience.  I'm going to try IV tomorrow since the consensus is that it's one hell of an roa.

I've also been experimenting with several of the fluorinated amphetamines lately (every now and then, not daily use by any means), namely 2-fa, 2-fma, 4-fa and 3-fa, and various combinations of these. 


In my experience 2-fa is definitely the most forgiving of these in terms of after effects, closely followed by 2-fma. 2-fa at around 20mg orally is great as a performance enhancer for me, or to help you get through the day after a night of too little sleep.


2-fma has more recreational value though and I definitely prefer this one for parties at around 60mg orally (~65kg male, mid 20s). I'm a pretty introverted person usually, and wouldn't normally enjoy parties with loud (not too good...) music and lots of people that much (especially when there are mostly people I don't know..). With 2-fma I enjoy it quite a lot though and will find myself talking with various people throughout the night without any of the awkward silent moments that would probably occur otherwise haha. Plus, because of the near absence of after effects I don't have to worry about performing badly at work either - at least at this dosage on a friday or saturday night (redosing once at 60mg at around T+6h doesn't seem to make this any worse either).


At higher dosages and/or repeatedly redosing (e.g. 2 day binges / 250mg+ sessions) there (unsurprisingly) is a definite amphetamine-like hangover though - for several days I'll be unmotivated, tired, find myself wanting to go to bed at 4 or 5 in the afternoon, and I'll sleep a lot more (can easily sleep 10h or more a night). Considering the amount of abuse these after effects are still quite mild though in my opinion.


With regard to combinations, if I want to give it little more of an mdma like feeling I love adding a low dose of 4-fa (also 60mg orally) to the mix! There seems to be a great synergy there. At this low of a dose (4-fa), the serotonin-depletion hangover effects are also very mild, but there might be some slight depression 1 or 2 days after use. I'm very sensitive to the "serotonin hangovers" though, which is also why I usually avoid any serotonin depleting drugs, unless it is a very special occasion and I have plenty of time to recover from it. I do like the mdma effect a lot more than the pure amphetamine effect, but the hangovers are usually not worth it for me.


I find 2-fma also combines very well with alcohol, as long as you stay responsible. Don't drink more than you would normally do without any stims. Here there also is a great synergy though. With mdma I completely avoid alcohol because in my opinion it ruins the high - I just get drunk instead of having that amazing mdma feeling. I'll never understand people combining alcohol and mdma. Some alcohol with your 2-fma, though: amazing! I think someone else mentioned it as well, it will almost immediately flush your face. Even only one mouthful of beer will send a wave of warmth over my face. It's great ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But keep it safe.


Any other combinations didn't seem to stand out much. I have on occasion used very low doses of 3-fa (~10mg insufflated) in combination with 2-fma, 2-fa, and 4-fa which gives me a very short (~1h long), very dopaminergic mild/moderate high. This can be nice if it is something you are looking for but it's nothing too special. I've used it a couple of times right before taking 4-fa to bridge the time it takes for the 4-fa to start working, which can take up to an hour for me on an empty stomach.


I always have some etizolam on hand by the way to help me get to sleep after a night out ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Especially with these long acting stims like 2fma and 4fa it's a huge help, and a good night of sleep helps a lot in preventing after effects. Any stim user probably knows this but I cannot recommend it enough.


I am a little curious regarding my usual 2-fma dosage of 60mg by the way, as this seems to be in the 'heavy' range? To me it doesn't feel like a particularly high dose at all, not by any means weak either, just a moderate to strong dose. Are those who report using it at around 30mg looking to use it primarily as a study aid?


Recently the place I get my RCs also has 4-fma now. I haven't read up on its effects much yet, but I have a feeling it might fall somewhere in between 2-fma and 4-fa effects-wise. Seeing as to how that combination is pretty amazing imo, I'm pretty excited to try this new little chem!

Wow so nothing has been added in 2 years.


So basically I wanted to give a brief overview:


15mg oral- You definitely can feel it.. amazing for wakefulness- lasted a good 3 hours. No physical affects noted. woke me up like 100-150mg caffeine

30mg oral- super so fucking clean.

40mg oral- noticeably scattered and jaw clenching.

50mg oral- always got me to scattered and would begin kinda sucking on cheeks. Obvious heart is working much harder. Similar to adderall heart beat. It always remains 'clean' but anything over 40 is just too much. For work and getting things done i found it best to take 30-40 and a 30 or 40mg redose 3-4 hours later, although if you redose it'll last every bit of 12 hours. I have never not redosed. *figures*

60mg oral- Nothing to write home about. Theres a ceiling to this chemical and Ive certain you reach it around 40mg


NOW... to good the stuff ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I absolutely love porn and stimulants. These days a-PVP and a-PHP are simply too psychotic and delusional for me. Whether snorting, vaping or plugging as soon as i ingest it im catapulted into a state of extreme paranoia. I cant even beat off because i have to keep checking the windows and that the door is locked! Its literally retarded


75mg plugged provided much less body load than 50mg oral. I never really received a 'knocking heart' on plugged 2-fma. 3 minutes after plugging im immediately on the computer... With NO paranoia! However, if someone were to try and have a conversation with me it would be clearly noticeable i was on something. Obviously scattered. I dont have to redose for a couple hours in which ill do another 75mg and few hours after that 4mg of etizolam lays me down sooo nicely. 


I am simply AMAZED how LONG this chemical is.... but im even more impressed that if i havent redosed in like 3 hours... 4mg of etiz and literally 45 min later im asleep. 2mg works just as well.

Honestly I was always still going when I would take 2-4mg to go to sleep. For me, with copious stimulant and caffeine tolerance, was not even slightly comparable to Adderall or ice. For me, the comedown was as minute as one coming down off a very strong cup of coffee, without the fatigue. Its so hard to describe because it SO benign. 4 hours after my first redose, 2mg etiz and i could sleep in 30 to 45 min... Always woke up refreshed. I never stayed up more than 24 hours... and this is SO FOREIGN to me. i always end up binging

Unfortunately, I have no reliable benzo source, so I would always just end up riding it out. I guess those etiz's of yours do the trick for you. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Not much discussion about 2-fma these days. Has anyone been able to acquire any lately? I’ve been seeing it around, but am skeptical about its quality.

Ordered a couple grams this past weekend. Tracking says it'll be here tomorrow, but I'm sure it'll be Friday at the earliest. PO around here is understaffed and having to deal with excess packages being dumped on them due to a big box distribution center here being temporarily shut down. I'll try to remember to report back on quality. Claim is it's 97%, but I'd be surprised if that's the case.

Mine also claimed to be 97%. I tried plugging 30mg this morning and definitely felt it although there wasn't much in the euphoria deparatment. I didn't sleep at all last night so perhaps that's why it left me a bit agitated and tense. Over the next 4-5 hours I plugged 20mg 2x with a few mg's of Pyrazolam and now I'm beginning to feel a lot better. I think it takes a few times of usage before you find that sweet spot. Haven't been able to find this stuff for years so am glad it's still out there.


Probably ended up consuming 100mg throughout yesterday via rectal administration.  With the help of some benzos and clonidine I managed to get some sleep and woke up this morning feeling decent, but a little fried. There were some minor peripheral side effects still present (slightly elevated heart rate, vasoconstriction, negligible muscle tension).


I told myself I wasn't going to use anything today, but I just couldn't resist. I loaded up an oral syringe with 60mg of 2-fma, 1mg of suboxone, and .5mg of Pyrazolam and proceeded to plug away. I was expecting to experience diminished results and subsequent regret, but I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, I'm feeling exponentially better than I did with my initial trial.

Some people say this stuff makes you horny but I just insufflated 50mg which is considered a high dose and I don't feel horny at all. Wish I hadn't thrown away my Speed (amphetamine sulfate). You think I should take another 50mg or is it a waste of material?

I wouldn't expect to feel particularly horny on 2-FMA. 

You could take another 50mg but I wouldn't expect a big difference in pro-sexual effects. 

100mg in total will have you speeding pretty hard, I think.

Yeah I just realized that I prefer good ol' street speed for long, dirty porn sessions. 2-FMA is awesome for chores and studying though. Currently reading Morals & Dogma by Albert Pike and that stuff is deep af! He was truly in tune with the great architect of the universe!

Agreed.  And the desire to redose is there, but it's pointless as you can't get any higher if you redose.  it has a strong ceiling effect.

Read this whole damn thread. From my research 2-Fma seems like it’s the miracle substance for deep study/focus if used appropriately.. Ie. oral ROA and within recommended dosage. There is only two vague references though to reagent testing. 


Results I received:


Marquis: bright yellow 

Mecke: brownish-yellow 

Mandelin: greenish-yellow 


Any thoughts or opinions are very much appreciated. Thanks

It's really good for finals/exams/papers when used sparingly. It's the sole reason I ever graduated, although I did turn out to have ADHD so the difference probably was larger for me. 

A couple of friends would use it during exam periods and would describe it as 'cheating' because they would get twice as much work done in a day. The miracle effect does wear off so extended breaks are necessary to retain the "miracle drug for emergencies" status. 


I have no idea when it comes to reagent results. All I know is that there must be two different synth methods that result in 2-FMA with different effects. One is very strong and long (and can be quite addicting), the other drops off early and lacks strength in general (although it's probably still 2-FMA). I can spot (and taste) the difference between the two from the powder, the "bad one" is much more sticky.

Just as update on researching reagent testing for 2-Fma. drugsdata.org has the most conclusive evidence that I could find:


Marquis: light yellow-grey 

Mecke: no reaction

Mandelin: no reaction (orange)

Been a long time without entering the site.. 

well, just came to say that I dislike **so much **2-fma, specially the last batch I got, such a shit you cannot even believe how frustrating it feels.. I tried several times, the first time, orally was semi-useful, but it has something that it makes it addictive which I swear other batches hadn't... I ended up binging 3/4 times I used, 2 grams, still going. 

It's so incredibly frustrating because you get zombified, like it had any other stuff (not having money at the moment to test anything seriously) probably a benzo? don't know.


I get that 2-fma has that distinctive anxyolitic effect but this is more brain-dead or brain-dread feeling, I really hate it. Wanted to use it for studying, it worked once, the first day I used (in like years, without any stim tolerance). Then I got some kind of concerning side effects that really resemble fluorine intoxication (been reading for hours and it made total sense) and they are symptoms I didn't have the first batch I got in 2017. 


 Other subtance I had with this purchase was 4f-mph which was also so weak compared to the first batch I got, but at least it was devoid of concerning side effects apart from typical mph anxiety and restlessness. 

The brain-dead feeling on 2-fma also brought something I didn't like at all, more than a week of insomnia, not like the first day but so disturbing.. to the point of considering going to a hospital to get some benzo script (thing that I would hate to do since I'm very into herbs that generally work like ashwagandha or scutellaria). I feel like this substance/batch fries you brain in some way, very creepy shit. In fact it has half-convinced me not to get any RC ever, except for some tryptamines and perhaps other psychs.

2fa is infinitely better than 2fma. 2fa is even better than adderall — so smooth. i flushed it after a couple weeks because of cardiotoxicity reports. into healthy hearts.

I actually prefer 2-fa I'm not completely sure why the heck I purchased 2-fma, probably because I considered that the long lasting effects would make it less reinforcing and addictive, I was totally wrong. Well, maybe if the batch I have now was as good as the last one, then it could be quite different, but the reality is that is much worse and much more reinforcing so 2-fa would have been a much sustainable option, you redose 2-4 times in a day of working (writing things for university at the moment) and you can end up sleeping....which is NOT the case with 2-fma.


btw, it has 0 euphoria so it's pretty confusing as a psychoactive substance... 2-fa has a clear rush when done nasal.

2-FA was weird for me, I got a gram from a reputable vendor, and ended up doing the whole thing in one night, looking for something good or interesting... never found it.  I felt something, but it was strange and wasn't really stimulating much at all.  I don't know if I got a bad batch or what, but it wasn't doing it for me.


The 4-sub amphetamines are much better IMO.  4-FA is a classic, a great cross between a roll and a speedy high.  4-FMA is great too, like a more serotonergic meth.

Need to talk again against this NL batch of 2-fma, 

Today is my birthday but I didn't really want to get into hard stuff like some MiPTs I have around (and I barely have any hard stuff in my stash at the moment..) so I think I could try again the 2-fma I had with a "little" IN dose of like 20-40mg.

 It has been a mistake, 

I was sleepy and not very happy to begin with but after the burn I started to get really moody and dysphoric, I don't even remember when I got this dysphoric (maybe a-php comedowns, years ago). I wanted to be more "up", but I almost get asleep, surely couldn't because the only thing this does is promoting wakefulness..

I needed to go to my bed for a while, feeling so incredibly tired. I thought it was due to high doses when binging... but no, this batch is pure shit and who knows if it's not cut with something else (I'll test when having the means).

 Even with that dose I'm getting vasoconstriction and low level anxiety now that I'm "coming down" so to speak. 

Be very careful with the typical NL vendor (the one who has most substances..), their stuff is getting worse each day, specially with stims.

I must say that there's a possibility that this last horrible experience of mine with 2-fma on 22th june could have been influenced by the fact that I started with covid symptoms around  26-27 june so there's the possibility that I already had sars-cov-2 circulating in my body (without causing symptoms yet) around 22th june,

maybe that was the reason I had such a bad experience (totally dysphoric and exhausting) with only 20-40mg of 2-fma. 

Is not something that could be proven, but makes some sense to me... 


In anycase I didn't use that batch again and I'm happy of it, it was such a shitty 2-fma. Since then I've read in another forum that some people wanted to get 2-fma from other vendors and those vendors told a guy that the current 2-fma batch was "not ok", but well, who knows if that's real or not, what's so sure is that the batch I got is sketchy and shitty as fuck.

Oh God, I hope I could get proper adhd medication asap....

Seems that no one is interested in this substance lately (for what concerns me, I totally understand) 

I'm finishing a master thesis and waiting for NEP to come, I have my 4f-mph somewhere else so I needed to use 2-fma again, 

I sniffed 2 little lines in the course of 2 hours, ..

Honestly I cannot bear non-euphoric stims, it's like, where's the happiness man? it doesn't motivate me if I don't have any euphoria, it's so cold it's boring as fuck

Cold dopamine is just a way to procrastinate more, having ADHD, so I consider it to be rubbish even for adhd...

If you redose too much, then it's useless, tweaky but braindead, without euphoria,

it's honestly the worst functional stimulant I tried, because you know, the norepinephrine reup-inhibition of 4f-mph makes it more pushing than this, 2-fma is not-pushy, completely not pushy and non euphoric, so I don't want to work on something boring AS FUCK while on it, it doesn't seem less boring


for me less boring = Euphoria, there's no other way.

That's why good kratom motivates much more, or even NEP or 3-mmc, you're floating, maybe you want to do something fun, but I can control myself if I'm feeling some euphoria, not just laser-focused on anything. With boring stims I just feel dull as fuck, not depressed, but not motivated,I just feel : whatever...

I think I will try 3-FA next time.

yep, in fact is the only time I enjoy it, with a good bunch of kratom over it, then it's even a bit euphoric.

like... I would say, most stimulants, yohimbe and kratom are like strawberries and cream.

you're lucky you found a good batch, I don't trust anyone at the moment in terms of vendors, I fear using some sort of venom or contaminated crap, lately, when thinking about ordering RCs, specially stims.

Task-starting and sustained attention are different beasts for sure.  When I was finishing my dissertation, dextroamphetamine definitely provided both, along with some of the mood lift, bordering on euphoria.  The mood lift makes starting tasks less daunting, and the tunnel vision/hyperfocus help keep effort consistent.


Are you saying you think 2-FMA is worse for you because it's a stronger dopamine releaser?  My understanding has been, lacking actual binding profile studies, racemic 2-FMA is probably actually a stronger NE releaser than *d*-amph, which in turn is stronger than *d*-meth.  I haven't seen anyone even speculate as to enantiomer-specific activity of 2-FMA, but pulling things out of thin air, I would guess, as with meth, the *l*-enantiomer of 2-FMA is extremely biased towards NE, and the *d*-enantiomer is more balanced.  This would explain the apparent ceiling effect of 2-FMA.  Since reports are that high doses increase vasoconstriction and tachycardia without more central stimulation, it would make sense that racemic 2-FMA, which as far as I know is all anyone has ever taken (correct me if I'm wrong), would be NE biased as a single drug.  2-FMA is also less associated with psychosis and mania in user reports, which suggests less dopamine bias.  This could all be complicated by metabolism—there's a paper on plausible metabolites of 2-FMA, but as with its binding potency, the literature is sparse.


I do agree that dopamine release is not strictly better for ADHD pharmacotherapeutics.  Most anecdotes I've read about attempts to use *d*-meth for ADHD suggest that it can be counterproductive, but more so *because* of the heightened euphoria.  I view mood lift as something that needs to be optimized: enough to overcome task anxiety and increase task enjoyment, but not so much you stop worrying at all about the actual life obligation ADHD is interfering with.  I also personally wonder if the apparent anxiolysis along with more subtle stimulation of 2-FMA might be due to interactions with sigma receptors, or maybe a relative lack thereof compared to meth.  Since 2-FMA is unlikely to be enough of a cash cow to merit clinical trials, and hasn't been the subject of alarmist media reporting, I think the motivation to do binding assays on it is weak, and so insight about its pharmacology is likely to continue only at a trickle.


Good luck in any case with your research and writing.  It's not the easiest thing for those of us with ADHD diagnoses, and optimizing medication goes a long way to help with that.

My problem is task-starting, much more than sustained attention, except for super boring tasks like studying or reading/doing something I hate (like paperwork)

I guess that I don't respond well to NE releasers, but that's not the case with NE reuptake inhibitors... for me yohimbe feels pretty nice, I feel *very*  motivated while on yohimbe, but I'm totally unfocused, same with NEP which seems to be pretty potent on NE ...

I do consider 2-fma useless but I remember that my first batch was pretty nice, and it worked nicely, but it was *much more euphoric*.... So, what was that? who knows, I guess we are receiving poison from China/India and not actually any pure racemic anything, let alone pure l-/d-enantiomers...

I also think you're right about euphoria and mood lift, too much is too distracting, but not enough makes everything robotic and boring, and 4f-mph and specially late batches of 2-fma feel too robotic for me , boring as fuck (but I much prefer 4f-mph as functional adhd medication).

3-mmc after peak effects would be the perfect adhd medication for me but obviously it's too much serotonin to waste daily...

The problem is that any dopamine releasers that create serious task-starting inducing  euphoria doesn't  seem  sustainable long term in terms of subjective effects... for example kratom could be euphoric for a bit more than a year, taking daily, but after that... it's "something" but not enough to induce starting tasks....


In anycase, I subjectively feel 2-fma more much dopamine dominant than 2-FA or 4f-mph, but yeah, you could be right and perhaps it's the sigma fuckery what feels so zombieish, I don't like that feeling to be honest, I only enjoy the 2-fma "rush", if we can call it that way..., the comeup, maybe?

Grading papers, for me, was always hell on Earth, partially because of the classes I had to teach, and for that, BOTH initiation and attention were problems.  Sometimes, psychostimulants alone won't do it, and the fear and dread of missing an obligation has to be added on top...


Aside from testing what you have, it's hard to say what you're getting.  That's a problem with RCs, but also a problem, obviously, with medical and pharmaceutical regulation since it is hard in most countries to get affordable, convenient treatment and in sufficient doses of the right agents to effectively treat symptoms.  In America, for dextroamphetamine prescription, I have to pick it up at the pharmacy on the exact right day, or else have to schedule an appointment with the physician a month early, and it is difficult to manage obligations and trips to the pharmacy during the day sometimes.  The alternative is unfortunately not always being sure ahead of time what you're getting.  Impurities, like unreacted reagents, leftover solvent, and so on, can definitely be in RCs, but obviously the worst case is that the substance is incorrectly or fraudulently identified.  Government agencies, sometimes foreign ones (foreign to the sellers), have a habit of crashing the parties of RC sellers, which I'm sure makes the reliability of the sellers lower given they're playing a cat-and-mouse game at the same time as they're trying to offer grey-market retail services.  This reliability problem happens with street drugs too, as in the case of PMA being sold as "ecstasy," which to normal people means MDMA.  If the effects really feel different, testing might be a good idea, either with common reagents, or a friend in the chemistry department...  That said, if other agents work better than 2-FMA, or "2-FMA," for you, I hope your loss is at least limited to the money invested in it.


I'm just speculating on (making up) the pharmacology.  The 2-fluoro substitution in the ring theoretically, I'm not sure if it's been measured specifically for 2-FMA but the models are pretty well characterized, increases lipophilicity, but if that were the only relevant action, the 2-FMA would just be "more lipophilic meth," and yet the 4-fluoro substitution also increases lipophilicity, and yet 4-FMA is a much less potent compound with stronger entactogenic properties (so also not "more lipophilic meth"); calculated logP for 2-FMA is 2.3, and for 4-FMA is 2.2, which is consistent with the greater potency of 2-FMA, but is 2.1 for meth (it's a logarithmic scale, so 2-FMA is about 50% more lipophilic than meth).  Another reason lipophilicity can't be the entire story is because 4-FMA intermediate in lipophilicity, but lowest in potency, and highest in entactogenic effects, there is a clearly not a linear relationship in all properties from meth -> 4-FMA -> 2-FMA.  So the fluoro- ring substitution is affecting some combination of metabolism and binding properties.  Non-psychedelic substituted phenethylamine tend to not bind to NE and DA receptors directly, but α2 binding could be another mechanism of anxiolysis, for example.  I doubt 2-FMA is an α2 ligand, though, given it's apparent effects on vascular tone.  NE release *will *increase α2 activation (via NE itself), but any agent that causes NE release would do so.  Lipophilicity could, however, alter tissue volume distribution, even in the brain, so the biasedness towards certain NE/DA pathways might be altered, changing effects.  *d*-meth and *d*-amph are already anxiolytic for most people at low doses, but also anxiogenic in higher doses (I would guess 2-FMA would become anxiogenic too, if your heart were racing and fingertips blue from >100 mg or etc.). All of this, of course, is caveated by the fact that even this rampant speculation requires that the agent in question *is* actually 2-FMA.


A lot of drugs, approved pharmaceuticals, plant compounds, and RCs alike, do have "rush"-like properties.  And yes, subjective rushes are great for getting going, but sustained mood lift and enthusiasm is better for focus.  Drugs can be tremendously beneficial in ADHD, as with many other conditions, but none are miracles, at least not yet, and at least not after tolerance and adaptation to their subjective effects.  It's certainly worthwhile to get one's treatment regimen in order, but sometimes the best point of view is "I have to do this work that sucks, and I'll do it, and drug therapy will help it only suck two-thirds to three-quarters as much."  Of course the more optimistic view is that medication can make already gratifying things incredibly sublime.

Well I decided to buy a gram of 2-fma. Been years since I’ve tried it and I think the last batch was a bad synth. Been overdoing the 4f-Mph and it’s starting to turn on me. Need something for school that doesn’t make me feel like my heart is about to explode

Hello guys, I have a question regarding 2-FMA, after reading psychonautwiki's guide on volumetric liquid dosing.


What solvent should I use? I've heard 2-FMA is soluble in Distilled Water, but I've seen threads of bacteria forming in users mixtures. Should I instead use Alcohol, or a mix of both?

Additionally, what mg/ml would be stable? I plan on using anywhere from 15-30mg per dose.


I've already purchased an MG scale to weigh my powder, along with 1g calibration weights, and have all the consumables such as syringes, Distilled Water and various Alcohols including Vodka. 


Sorry for the barrage of questions, I'm new to this, having only dabbled in Modafinil. I'm studying a competitive course in University and have a busy lifestyle, which when compounded with the fact that I have undiagnosed ADHD (I'm currently in the process of getting a diagnosis, but the process here is extremely drawn out) makes it extremely hard for me to perform until I can get a proper prescription. 


Thanks for any clarifications you guys can provide ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)!

2-fma is not that potent. Just weight out powder. Assuming your scale is few mg +/- that’s totally fine with it.

Just bombed 50mg of 2-fma. From what I recall it’s a bit weaker per mg than adderall IR. With adderall I usually take 22.5mg which is followed by a 15mg redose approximately 3-4 hours later. I prefer less serotonergic activity as my sole intent with this compound is to be utilized as a study aid. I’ll report back later with an update.

Well 1 1/2 hour later and it lines up with my previous experiences I’ve had with it in the past so I’m glad this batch is on par, if not even better, than the stuff I had years ago. Provides a sense of alertness and clean energy without the nasty peripheral side effects that adderall can lead to. Definitely less “euphoric” than adderall, but for my purposes as a study aid it makes it even more effective. So far so good.

Thanks for the reply mate! Actually, I was thinking for convenience sake it would be easier to create a solution as I plan on using it 3-5 days a week for the next month or two, to get me through this busy period.


If I do follow your suggestion though, would placing a 1g calibration weight first THEN adding the powder lead to better accuracy? I forgot the source, but I read it helps.

Has anyone confirmed what compound they are actually consuming?


Both para and meta mon-substitutions of the amphetamines with halogens is well researched and most tended to be toxic in one way or another (neurotoxic or cardiotoxic) but I don't believe anyone expected ortho substitution to significantly alter affinity, merely alter the MW, LogP and (I would assume) pKa.


I should add that the fluorines were magnitudes less toxic - virtually the same as unsubstituted amphetamine 


Unexpectedly, 4-flouro derivative of aminorex was > x4 the potency of aminorex in animal models. In that case it will certainly slow down metabolism (and the few reports mention 16 hours plus) and possibly it improves VMAT-2 transport but nobody ever asked WHY it was so significantly more potent.  


Does anyone have any references for ANY ortho monosubstituted amphetamines? Everywhere I look are papers on the 'designer drug' but nothing on actual activity.


It's going to increase steric bulk and slightly move the aromatic but it's just so...  unanticipated. 2-methyl amphetamine is well explored.

Well it depends on how good/cheap is your scale. Some cheapish scales tend to be less accurate when weighting out very small amounts. So check it for yourself, measure 1g + 30mg and 30mg alone.


And use your calibration weight to calibrate it from time to time. Be sure surface you measure on is perfectly leveled. Don’t measure where there are air currents.


Put to capsules for convenience rather than making solution.


Expect tolerance and some level of addictivity even with your intended dosing schedule.

To clarify just in case, measure 1g and add what it shows to be 30mg and than weight out that alone and see how/if it’s showing different result.

Got it! Also, the scale I got has this thing called a wind shelter, which should prevent the environment from skewing the results.


And absolutely, I know the nature of what I'm going to take, and will try my best to control myself.

Then again, its easy to say the above when I'm not actually on 2-FMA (still on the way), so I guess we'll see.

My German is poor but the 2,4,5-trifluoroamphetamine is mentioned.


But beware, fenfluramine is an example of how toxicity of ring-substituted amphetamines may be chronic rather than acute.

I don't think you're implying they are similar, but obviously, fenfluramine vs. a monosubstituted, especially *ortho*- monosubstituted, analog is not very similar, even if "fluorine is involved."  Also, the *n*-ethyl substitution on fen makes is different.  But let alone the *meta*- position, obviously, a carbon-carbon bond ring substitution is very different from ring halogenation.  Again, I know you understand... I'm not a chemist anyway.  Obviously caution is warranted no matter what, because you're right: the pharmacology of 2-FMA is not well characterized.  However, cardiac valve leaflet pathology also seems poorly understood from what I can tell—guanfacine is a putative 5-HT2B agonist, but is used, if uncommonly, to treat hypertension, so it seems that post-trial evidence doesn't indicate a valvulopathy risk.  Nevertheless, there might be such a risk, and others, from 2-FMA.  Edit: just because it seems obviously to have, as expected, pro-hypertensive and a positive chronotrope, as could be explained by NE release/reuptake inhibition, the usual chronic risks, like cardiomyopathy, caution is obviously warranted even w/ out knowledge of *novel* ways it might cause harms.  Some are clear!


I've found 2-FMA mentioned in patent apps (US 2022/0152088 A1) and patents (11,045,465 B2), but certainly not relating to its potential legitimate application as a pharmaceutical.

No - I'm not suggesting that. But aminorex was another stimulant that proved to have 5HT2b activity proved to be chronically cardiotoxic. It's just one of those things that medicinal chemists are wary of. Any new medicine would specifically be tested for such activity.


The N substitution was not involved in the 5HT2b affinity of fenfluramine. N-dealkylation occurs and the primary amine actually had MORE 5HT2b affinity.


I was merely reminding people that ring-substituted amphetamines have a pretty bad record. Sibutramine (look closely, it's got the p-Cl amphetamine scaffold within it) and phentermine are two more examples that proved to be cardiotoxic.


Put simply, such simple molecules don't tend to be especially selective BUT ring-substitution can produce unsought selectivity.


I posted that German patent merely because it was the only related compound I could find and if you read it, it does actually cover a number of different ring-substitutions. Sadly my German isn't good enough for me to draw much inference  from it and hoped that someone else might be able to shed some more light on the topic.


As previously stated, I think medicinal chemists presumed that an ortho substitution wouldn't make much of a difference BUT ortetamine shows that certain ortho substitutions can make a big difference. I'm speculating that the increased steric bulk means that VMAT2 cannot actively transport.

It's certainly a worthwhile experiment.


Of course the outcomes from a single person don't even constitute a study BUT nonetheless if some highly unexpected (very unlikely) outcome is found, it does lend weight to a proper study.


I'm sure the people who made 2-FA did so simply to avoid legal control but 2-methylamphetamine (oretamine) is known although I don't think it was ever granted a market licence.

Above is a link in which ortho, meta and para methylamphetamine were all tested in animal models.


I do appreciate that an -F is much smaller than a -CH3 but it's the closest I can find.

Very interesting the 1° amine is stronger 5-HT2b ligand.  Didn't know that.


Also interesting is that fenfluramine and sibutramine share at least general cardiotoxicity risk, both largely withdrawn, but fen's mechanism does appear to be cardiac valve leaflet hypertrophy/myopathy w/ pulmonary hypertension but sibutramine appears to instead primarily exert its cardiotoxicity through reuptake inhibition and hypertension (non-pulmonary), which is obviously much less unique/specific to it.  Any substituted PEA can cause cardiotoxicity through this mechanism, but sibutramine is worse.  4-FMA I know is also dramatically worse in terms of effects on blood pressure than analogs, whether structure or in terms of desired effects, i.e., it's much worse the MDMA.  Again, *ortho*- subs not implicated, but the caution you suggest seems prudent.


The literature shows sibutramine and fenfluramine share that they are not enjoyable recreationally, similar to the *para*-methoxy monosubstituted amph/meth, but 4-FMA is.  Lots of overlapping circles in the SAR.

I was simply noting that their have been an unusually large number of PEA derivatives that reached market and then were proved to be toxic in one way or another.


But mono ortho substitution doesn't appear to be well studied.


It should be noted that the -F will act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor. That might mean nothing but it does open up the possibility that the compound binds to other molecular targets. Since their is precisely NO research, nobody knows what it does.


But if it's only around 10% the potency of amphetamine then at least that marries up with the action of 2-methylamphetamine. 


I SUSPECT it might display increased SERT activity which offsets stimulant activity.

BTW 2-methoxyamphetamine is also known. It also has that extra hydrogen-bond acceptor.

Small aside...


Carl Hart mentions 2-FMA in *Drug Use for Grownups*.  This wouldn't be very interesting by itself except in the same paragraph he mentions only a few other substances as examples of amphetamines—amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, and 6-APB—two of which are prescription pharmaceuticals, or OTC in the case of levomethamphetamine, another of which is massively popular and has a history (and future) as a research therapeutic, and the last of which, like 2-FMA, sort of stands out as unusual, and it suggests he might know a thing or two about it, rather than having selected it by throwing darts and a board containing the names of random substituted amphetamines.  I have the electronic version of the book, but it's page 117 in that and may be the same in print.

Well the above patent doesn't explicitly cover 2FA but I note that the 'most preferred' is 2,4,5-trifluoroamphetamine. Like an -OCH3, an -F provides a hydrogen-bond acceptor but with much less steric bulk. They seem to be claiming that it increases dopamine levels without having any 5HT2a affinity. In fact they mention that MDMA reverses catalepsy in mice lacking dopamine BUT is psychoactive.


- We provide a fluorine-substituted amphetamine or amphetamine derivative with the Formula (I):
- where a) at least one of the residues R1 or R2 is different from H and Ph is a phenyl ring, which is substituted with fluorine in at least one position or b) the residues R1 and R2 independently of one another are H or are different from H and Ph is a phenyl ring, which is substituted with fluorine in at least three positions or c) the residues R1 and R2 independently of one another are H or are different from H and Ph is a phenyl ring, which is substituted with fluorine in at least one position and has a substituent different from H in at least one other position.

Clean productive stimulation lasting all day without come down or redose urge.

I also liked it, solid stimulation without much side effects but its a fair Bit less potent than plain methamphetamine. Id say around 30-50 %.

Meth is definitely not a functional stimulant (for me).

What makes 2-fma great is that I can take a single dose in the morning, have a productive day, a good night's sleep and don't feel tired the following days.

Well my 2-FMA landed today, along with some O-PCE and FXE. Been quite a while since I’ve used this substance. From what I recall, I enjoyed mixing adderall and FXE. I’m guessing 2-FMA and FXE would compliment eachother well. I know a lot of people don’t like mixing stims and dissos, but I find it makes the experience more lucid and clearer. Just plugged 35mg. I’m gonna wait a min then go from there. I sort of binged of BDO, so not feeling that great.

Well I received an even better batch of. 2-fma. Just ran out of my regular amp sulfate, which was the best amp I’ve done outside the real deal. I nabbed the last 8 gs so I’m hoping it gets here this week. 2-FMA is useful, but concerns about cardiotoxicity, whether valid or not, will most likely prevent me from ordering it once more. Just doesn’t provide that energy I’m looking for, albeit it’s better than nothing. I still find it odd that halogenated methamphetamine is weaker than regular amphetamine.

I don't even find 2-fma stimulating, at all...

but it keeps me awake for more than 48 hours, so it's horrible, I will never use again that substance, I think it did something bad to my brain, since I have bad insomnia since using it (I used it once every 2 days for a couple weeks). It may be "coincidence" but I won't put my brain on such a risk again. I ended up hating 2-fma. Not euphoric for me, not stimulating, just bland focus and bland feelings of I don't give a damn. Blank and risky substance in my book.

Low dose a-php oral or 4f-mph seems better for what I need (a-php oral it's nothing like intranasal, totally different experience).

It really is bland man and I’m not stimulated after taking 60mg orally with 500mg DLPA. That was 6 hours ago or so and I just tired. Difficult to go from 90% plus amp sulfate to this. I feel like I might as well drink coffee. Ima add a lil 3-meo-pce into the redose and see if that does it.

Interesting.  Haven’t had much issues with my sleep but everyone wired differently. But yeah it’s almost imperceptible to me. It helps for sure but it’s so subtle, like a whisper of a stimulant. I took 10mg 3-meo-pce couple hours ago and I’m feeling way better. I’m more alert, thinking is more fluid. Sometimes it enables me to attain a state of ataraxia.

Yeah, I think drug-induced ataraxia is not something that I like to obtain... perhaps while on opioids or things like amanita, but not with a stimulant...

perhaps your batch is not as dirty as mine, the one I got first (6-7 years ago) was much better, the last one I got was horrible (2022)
