## Dosage & Duration

### Insufflated

**Dosage:**
- Light: 20 - 40 mg
- Common: 40 - 80 mg
- Strong: 80 - 110 mg
- Heavy: 110 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 2 - 4 hours
- Onset: 5 - 20 minutes
- After effects: 1 - 3 hours

**N-Ethyl-N-propyltryptamine** (also known as **Ethylpropyltryptamine** and **EPT** ) is an obscure novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. EPT is chemically related to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and belongs to a series of psychedelic compounds known as unsubstituted tryptamines.

The original synthesis date of EPT is unknown. It first appeared for sale on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market in 2016. Unlike most research chemicals, EPT has no documentation in the scientific literature. It appears to be an entirely novel product of clandestine drug design.

Initial reports describe the effects of EPT as mild and indistinct compared to structurally similar base tryptamines such as [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) and [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) , all of which are highly powerful psychedelics. Of these, it is reported to be most similar to [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) , albeit less potent and with a less immersive headspace.

Virtually no data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of EPT. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

EPT, or N-ethyl-N-propyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole molecule of the tryptamine chemical class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. EPT features one propyl and one ethyl groups bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone. EPT is the N-ethyl analog of [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) and the N-propyl analog of [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) . It is also an analog of [4-HO-EPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-EPT) and [4-AcO-EPT](/w/index.php?title=4-AcO-EPT&action=edit&redlink=1) .

EPT is a unsubstituted tryptamine that is chemically related to DMT. The original synthesis date of EPT is unknown. It first appeared for sale on the online research chemical market in 2016. Unlike most research chemicals, EPT has no documentation in the scientific literature. It appears to be an entirely novel product of clandestine drug design. Ept is usually sold in its ethylpropyltryptamine fumarate form rather than the traditional HCl form that other tryptamines might be sold as.

Unfortunately, virtually no data exists about the metabolism and potential toxicity of EPT.

## Pharmacology

Like with most [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) tryptamines, EPT is thought to act principally as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The psychedelic effects are believed to come from EPT's binding efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. Most serotonergic psychedelic tryptamines have a very strong structural similarities to serotonin itself, which partially explains the affinity for certain 5-HT sites. It is almost unanimously agreed that most serotonergic psychedelics - such as EPT - produce their effect by acting as strong partial [agonists](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) at the 5-HT 2A receptors.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.* The effects of EPT have not been researched as well as many other tryptamines. The following effects are drawn from a relatively limited sample size.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational EPT use have not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because EPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a very limited history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying EPT by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Anecdotal reports suggest that EPT does not produce dependence and has low abuse potential. It is believed to be similar in this respect to other unsubstituted tryptamines like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) , and [MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MET) .

Unlike DMT, tolerance to the effects of EPT appears to form almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). EPT produces cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of EPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Due to its relative obscurity, the possession and sale of EPT is unscheduled in most countries.

- **Germany** : EPT is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Switzerland** : EPT is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United Kingdom** : EPT is a Class A controlled substance in the United Kingdom as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : EPT is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , which is a Schedule I compound under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or industrial intents and purposes could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Italy** : EPT is a Schedule 1 controlled substance.
