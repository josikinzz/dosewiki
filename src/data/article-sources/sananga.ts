## Subjective Experience

Sometimes used as a precursor to ayahuasca ceremonies, sananga is primarily known
for its use as a tribal Amazonian eye medicine, and in particular to sharpen night
vision. However, the Internet is also awash with claims regarding psychoactivity and
spiritual use, hence its inclusion in this book.

For example, katukina.com, states that “This sacred and potent medicine is used for
healing physical and spiritual ailments, by clearing the mind and energies and
gaining a complete new way of perception and focus.”, and psychedelictimes.com
claims that “These powerful eye drops have a healing power that’s more energetic
than physical, and that has the capacity to increase spiritual insight in the minds of
those who use it.”

Some sources go further still, with nextlevelsmart.nl offering “On an energetic level,
Sananga helps to open the inner vision, the third eye, visions, activates the pineal
gland, erases all spiritual confusion, frees negative thoughts and deeply cleanses
the entire aura from the inside out.”

In terms of administration there are ample warnings of intense stinging and burning
on application. This apparently subsides after a few minutes, and is often regarded as
being an important part of the process. It’s not something, however, that I relish.

Regarding dose, one or two drops per eye are usually referred to, with one often cited
as being more than sufficient.

Finally, on the issue of set and setting, general advice is to find a quiet and peaceful
location and to relax or lie down with meditative intent. The intensity allegedly fades
into the longer term benefits after 15 minutes or so.

Having obtained my supply via a known vendor on eBay I am ready to go. I decide to
undertake the exercise on my bed, and lie down with the already opened bottle. I
squeeze gently with the nozzle over my third eye (forehead) until a drop falls. I
quickly repeat over my right eye and then left eye.

It stings and burns as anticipated and my closed eyes water despite my attempts to
retain the fluid. I blink and a few tears run down my face on to the pillow. There is a
rush of blood to my head and a humming sensation but all quickly passes and I lie
still and quiet for 5 minutes or so.

As I get myself up and walk downstairs vision appears a little refreshed, as probably
normal for any eyewash. I suspect placebo may be a factor here as well. Fifteen
minutes after launch I feel fairly normal, possibly (or not) with a minor reset in play,
as I often find with an intense experience (e.g. with nitrous).

An hour later I have had a short walk. Vision could be sharper or I could be looking
for it. I feel neutral. Overall, it is inconclusive.

I repeated the exercise at 4:30pm the following day. First came the sting, then the
burn, after which I sought to meditate into the headiness and focus on my breathing.
I soon relaxed and after 5 minutes I returned to my office. I noticed subsequently
that I was less stressed and more serene. Whether this was due to the process itself
or the sananga I cannot say, but my disposition was slightly altered.

The same sort of aftermath as yesterday ensued, and I note that I felt no ill effects or
any subsequent issues with my eyeballs.

I should also note the possible relevance of location and circumstance. I do feel that I
am cheating somewhat by testing this without ceremony and outside indigenous
surroundings. These factors do contribute to the nature of spiritual and psychoactive
experiences, and an important ingredient may well be missing.

Note: I am very well aware that at the start of this book I mocked the very idea of
applying any drug via the eyeball. Given the context this was with good reason and I
would stress that sananga is a sole exception.

## Summary
Tabernaemontana sananho is a tropical tree species in the family Apocynaceae known as lobo sanango. Lobo sanango grows in the Amazon Basin of northern South America.

## Chemical composition
The plant is reported to contain coronaridine, 3-hydroxycoronaridine, (-)-heyneanine, (-)-ibogamine and voacangine.

## Traditional use
In Amazonian traditional medicine, preparations of the leaves, pulp, bark, and latex are either applied topically or taken internally to treat various conditions. Extracts from the tree are antiinflammatory and effective against the protozoan Leishmania.
In Peru, this tree is sometimes known by the Spanish–Quechua name lobo sanango ("wolf plant") or simply as sanango. Throughout the Amazon the species has numerous other aliases in several languages. The Secoya people of Ecuador call this plant baĩ su'u and put the sticky liquid from the fruit into dogs' noses so they can "smell far in hunting." They also eat the fruit of baĩ su'u.

## Taxonomy and phylogeny
T. sananho is one of 126 species recognized by the Catalogue of Life as of March 2021. Phylogenetic studies suggest T. markgrafiana to be its closest relative with the following phylogenetic relationships:
