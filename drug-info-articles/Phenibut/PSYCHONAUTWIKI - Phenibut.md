**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**β-Phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid** (also known as **Fenibut** , **Phenybut** , **Noofen** , **Citrocard** , and commonly as **Phenibut** ) is a lesser-known [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [gabapentinoid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoid) class. Phenibut acts as a [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) for [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) , the major inhibitory [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) in the brain. It is chemically related to [baclofen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Baclofen) , [pregabalin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pregabalin) , and [gabapentin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentin) .

Phenibut was developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, where it has been used as a pharmaceutical drug to treat a wide variety of conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, asthenia, insomnia, alcoholism, stuttering, and vestibular disorders, and others. In the rest of the world, phenibut is not approved for clinical use and is instead sold as a nutritional supplement.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [enhanced motivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Lower doses (under 1 gram) are typically used as a cognitive and lifestyle supplement while higher doses are used for a recreational high that is reported to be subjectively similar to [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , and certain [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) .

Although phenibut is commonly marketed as a [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) by retailers, evidence that it enhances cognition is limited. It is generally accepted that phenibut has anxiolytic effects in both animal and in humans. Due to its habit-forming properties, it is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Phenibut is a derivative of GABA with a phenyl group in the β-position. The addition of a phenyl ring to the GABA molecule allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier and produce psychoactive effects. Phenibut has a near-identical structure as baclofen, lacking only a chlorine atom in the para-position of the phenyl group and contains phenethylamine in its structure. [Pregabalin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pregabalin) also has a near-identical structure as phenibut, except it has an isobutyl group instead of a phenyl group.

Phenibut is a chiral molecule and thus has two potential configurations, as (R)- and (S)-enantiomers.

Most commercial phenibut is reported to be in the form of the hydrochloride salt (HCl). In this form, the phenibut is reacted with hydrochloric acid to form a stable, easily dissolvable, acidic, crystalline salt.

Alternatively, phenibut can exist as a free amino acid (FAA). In this form, phenibut is close to pH neutral, non-crystalline, slow to dissolve and mildly bitter. The FAA form has about 20% more phenibut molecules on an equal mass basis compared to phenibut HCl. Phenibut FAA has the advantage of being suitable for [sublingual](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) , [rectal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Rectal) , or [intranasal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Snorting) use, which can be more efficient, faster-acting, and predictable for some. Phenibut FAA is converted to phenibut HCl in the stomach. Equal masses of the two forms will have roughly equivalent effects when taken the same way (FAA may be slightly stronger).

## Pharmacology

Phenibut has a more complex pharmacological profile than many other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) . Unlike [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , for example, phenibut acts as a full [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) of the [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) B [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) , similar to baclofen and high doses of [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) . At higher doses, phenibut loses its selectivity of GABA B , and gains additional activity as a GABA A [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) . Phenibut's effects at the GABA B receptor are responsible for its sedating effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Recent research has shown that phenibut binds to and blocks α2δ subunit-containing voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), similarly to gabapentinoids such as [gabapentin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentin) and [pregabalin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pregabalin) . Both enantiomers of phenibut show this action with similar efficacy. The R-enantiomer possesses five-fold greater affinity for α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels relative to the GABA B receptor, whereas the S-entantiomer does not have any efficacy at the GABA B receptor.

The [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) effects of phenibut in rodents are not mediated by the GABA B receptor but by the blockage of α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to other commonly used [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) depressants such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , phenibut is reported to be longer-lasting, more euphoric and more recreational at higher doses.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** *or* **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Phenibut has different effects on physical energy levels depending on the dosage used. At lower doses, phenibut has a mild physical and mental stimulation effect, encouraging movement, wakefulness, and productivity. At common doses and higher, phenibut is physically sedating, encouraging sleep and lethargy. Sleeping after dosing a small amount results in a deep, restful sleep which can leave the user feeling refreshed and alert upon waking.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - This effect is generally mild compared to that experienced on many other depressants. However, it may become dangerously amplified if phenibut is combined with other substances that depress breathing.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Phenibut can induce mild to extreme nausea depending greatly on dose and tolerance. When it occurs, it usually manifests roughly 5 hours after the initial dose and generally involves waves of nausea accompanied by vomiting and excessive sweating.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - Phenibut is reported to enhance sexual desire and energy. Combined with its disinhibiting and euphoric effects, it can increase the likelihood of unplanned sexual activities in a manner similar to [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)** - At higher doses, rather than reducing sensitivity, phenibut has a propensity to cause spontaneous motor control loss when nearing orgasm.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)** - This effect is more commonly reported with the hydrochloric acid form (phenibut HCl).
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)** - This effect is uncommon, and mostly occurs on higher doses.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - Moderate to high doses can induce a mild headache many hours after dosing.
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)** - Muscle cramps and joint pain are sometimes accompanied at high doses.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - This effect generally only occurs after frequent usage.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** - This effect is common at high doses.
- **[Appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement)** - This effect is uncommon and inconsistently produced. ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - One may experience a state of semi-consciousness and [hypnagogia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) during heavy dose "nodding" which results in dream-like states and up to level 3 [imagery](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming#Internally_sourced_sensory_input) . This may be accompanied by ill-defined [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - Phenibut has medium to strong anxiolytic effects, equivalent to alcohol but generally less powerful than [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) .
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)** - Phenibut has strong disinhibiting effects comparable to that of higher doses of [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , or [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) .
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect is more pronounced than that of [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) and [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , most likely due to more clear-headed and stimulative nature of phenibut.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - Phenibut has been reported to produce prosocial and mild entactogenic effects which, although much weaker than that of traditional [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , are prominent and well-defined even at common doses.
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - Lower doses of phenibut can enhance focus and concentration. This effect typically reverses as the dose is increased.
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)** - High doses will usually induce a state of mild stupor and confusion.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** ### After effects
 
- - **[Rebound anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Rebound anxiety is a commonly observed effect with [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) substances like phenibut. It typically corresponds to the total duration spent under the substance's influence along with the total amount consumed in a given period, an effect which can easily lend itself to cycles of dependence and addiction.
- **[Residual sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - While phenibut can be used as an effective [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, their effects may persist into the morning afterward, which may lead users to feel "groggy" or "dull" for up to a few hours if not longer.
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)** - A low mood can be experienced as an after-effect of high or frequent dosing.
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)** - Feelings of mild to strong depersonalization may present themselves after phenibut usage, particularly when it is taken frequently at higher doses.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - This is caused by phenibut's REM sleep suppressing activity, resulting in REM rebound upon cessation of dosing.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Phenibut has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

Phenibut hydrochloride is highly caustic and in sensitive users can cause intestinal discomfort and [diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea) with some lower digestive tract bleeding. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Due to the extremely long come up period relative to other substances, some users may experience an urge to redose out of the belief that it is weak or not working. This should be avoided to prevent overdose.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Phenibut is moderately physically and psychologically addictive, although this usually only occurs with heavy abuse of the substance.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Withdrawal symptoms include severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , nervousness, hallucinations, tremors, agitation, [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) , tension, irritation, [rapid heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) , [loss of appetite](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , vomiting, [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) .

Phenibut produces cross-tolerance with all [GABAgenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) depressants, meaning that after its consumption, depressants will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If a sudden loss of consciousness occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Phenibut is reported to enhance the positive effects of [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) as well as reduce jitteriness and anxiety. However, this combination can be dangerous due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effects of phenibut; once the stimulant wears off, the depressant effects of phenibut will be significantly increased, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) as well as [other effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut#Subjective_effects) . If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to a certain dose of phenibut prior to stimulant consumption and not redose. This combination can also potentially result in significant dehydration.
