***Alpha* -GPC** ( **L- *alpha* -glycerophosphocholine** , **choline alfoscerate** ) is a water-soluble nutrient which serves as a precursor to both [choline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Choline) and glycerophosphate within the brain. In humans, choline is considered to be an essential nutrient as its role in reducing the risk of neural tube defects, fatty liver disease, and other pathologies has been well-documented.

Notably, alpha-GPC is one of the three choline-containing phospholipids that can be orally supplemented (the other two being [citicoline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citicoline) and phosphatidylcholine) and its popularity may be due to it being the most efficient pro-drug of choline (with the ability to influence both systemic and brain concentrations of choline). Due to the provision of the other half of the alpha-GPC molecule (glycerophosphate), it also appears to support the structure and maintenance of cellular membranes, similarly to [citicoline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citicoline) .

Athletes have been known to use alpha-GPC due to its purported ability to enhance growth hormone production and to enhance power output (which is based on a lone pilot study in support of subjects ingesting 600 mg alpha-GPC prior to exercise ).

When taken as a supplement, this compound has [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects which may have the potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other related disorders. It is easily available and commonly sold for this purpose via online supplement and nootropic vendors.

## Chemistry

Alpha-GPC is a naturally-occurring choline compound found endogenously (naturally) in the brain which is also made and used for oral consumption. Structurally, Alpha-GPC is comprised of a choline group bound to a glycerol molecule via a phosphate group.

Choline is a quaternary ammonium salt, containing a positively charged ammonium cation substituted with three methyl groups and a hydroxyethyl chain. Glycerol is a polysubstituted alcohol consisting of propane with one hydroxyl (-OH) group bound to each carbon in the chain.

In alpha-GPC, the terminal oxygen of the choline chain and a primary hydroxyl group of glycerol are integrated as bridging oxygen into a phosphate group. This phosphate group is a quaternary-substituted phosphorus atom connected to four oxygen atoms, two of which serve to bind the choline, glycerol, and phosphate groups into a unified molecule.

## Pharmacology

Alpha-GPC breaks down into two key components, [choline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Choline) and glycerophosphate. Choline and its metabolites are needed for three main physiological purposes: structural integrity and signaling roles for cell membranes as well as cholinergic neurotransmission ( [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) synthesis). This process essentially allows acetylcholine to accumulate at higher levels than it otherwise would. As acetylcholine is involved in the function of memory and other essential cognitive functions, this could potentially account for its [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects.

Glycerophosphate, the other component, can also help with the production of cellular membranes, but this remains largely unstudied and is not well understood by the scientific literature.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - The stimulation which alpha-GPC presents can be considered as primarily subtle and similar to that of [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) .
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Body odor alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_odor_alteration)** - This can be caused in some populations, especially those suffering from trimethylaminuria. [Choline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Choline) (a byproduct of alpha-GPC) is a precursor to trimethylamine, which those with trimethylaminuria are not able to easily break down, oftening resulting in smelling similar to fish. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - In comparison to [citicoline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citicoline) , alpha-GPC manifests itself primarily in a physically stimulating manner over a mental stimulation.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

## Toxicity and harm potential

Alpha-GPC is non-addictive, is not known to cause harm, and has an extremely low toxicity relative to dose. Similar to many other [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) substances, there are relatively few physical side effects associated with acute choline exposure. Various studies have shown that in reasonable doses in a particular context, it presents no negative cognitive, psychiatric or toxic physical consequences of any sort.

Regardless, it is strongly recommended that one is familiar with and uses [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Alpha-GPC is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of alpha-GPC is built after prolonged and repeated usage. After that, it takes about 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Alpha-GPC presents cross-tolerance with no other known compounds, meaning that after the use of Alpha-GPC all other psychoactive compounds will not have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

*alpha* -GPC is a suspected monoaminergic substance. Alpha-GPC and [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of Alpha-GPC unpredictably. Taking this chemical while on prescription MAOIs is strongly discouraged.

## Legal status

- **United States** - Alpha-GPC is completely legal to purchase in the United States as a dietary supplement.
- **Canada** - Alpha-GPC is completely legal to purchase in Canada as a dietary supplement.

L-α-Glycerophosphorylcholine (alpha-GPC, choline alfoscerate, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a natural choline compound found in the brain. It is also a parasympathomimetic acetylcholine precursor which has been investigated for its potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
Alpha-GPC rapidly delivers choline to the brain across the blood–brain barrier and is a biosynthetic precursor of acetylcholine. It is a non-prescription drug in most countries. The FDA determined that intake of no more than 196.2 mg/person/day is considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

## Production

Industrially, alpha-GPC is produced by the chemical or enzymatic deacylation of phosphatidylcholine enriched soya phospholipids followed by chromatographic purification. Alpha-GPC may also be derived in small amounts from highly purified soy lecithin as well as from purified sunflower lecithin.

## Safety

A retrospective cohort study involving 12 million participants in South Korea found that α-GPC users had a higher risk of stroke (46 % higher). The authors suggested that one possible explanation is that dysbiosis may lead to α-GPC being metabolized into trimethylamine (TMA) in the gastrointestinal tract, and then to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the liver, which has implications for cardiovascular health. However, they also noted that the study could be influenced by confounding variables, as α-GPC is often prescribed to individuals with preexisting health risks.
A later systematic review and meta-analysis criticized the statistical analysis of the South Korean cohort study, describing it as questionable and imprecise. The review concluded that α-GPC has a favorable safety and tolerability profile and is effective in improving cognitive function and daily living in patients with dementia disorders of neurological origin, adult-onset vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease.
