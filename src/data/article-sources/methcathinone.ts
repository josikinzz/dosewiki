## Subjective Experience

Best known for its behavioural effects on the cat family, catnip has also been used as
a traditional home remedy for headaches, stomach and digestive pains, menstrual
cramps, colds, fevers and a variety of other ailments. More relevant to this book are
the suggestions that it is a cure for insomnia, and that it acts as a relaxant and a
sedative.

For my first experiment I smoked it from a bong. It wasn’t a particularly nice smoke,
and the effect was somewhat disappointing. I felt that there was something there, but
it could easily have been invoked through the act of smoking itself (oxygen
deprivation), or via placebo, or both. At the mild end of the scale it is sometimes
impossible to say, particularly if there is uncertainty about how clean (drug free) your
body is. The catnip itself was also very dry, so could have lost potency through age.

Notwithstanding this, I decided to sample again, this time via the most widely
recommended method: tea. On this occasion I made absolutely certain that I had no
residue from other psychoactives in my system. I proceeded as follows:

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I boil some water. Given that it is frequently stated that boiling water
destroys the active ingredients I allow it to stand for 10 minutes.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I then place 4 tablespoons of catnip into the teapot, pour the hot water over it,
and leave it to steep for 10 minutes or so. I begin to sip slowly from a small
cup. The taste isn’t bad. There is no bitterness or particularly strong flavour or
smell, and it goes down easily when it has cooled a little. [3:45pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
At the start point I feel of fairly average disposition. I have had an afternoon
nap, and I am fully awake. I am not particularly anxious or calm, but perhaps
have a slight edge, although nothing more.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I have now drunk all the tea and refilled the teapot. I do feel slightly
more relaxed. There’s a minor headiness to it in the form of a mild dreamy
buzz, and I am now warmer than I was. I feel calm and more content.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 Whilst this isn’t strong or overwhelming it is quite pleasing. I suspect
that expectation would significantly impact the experience: expect a lot and
you will be disappointed, but expect nothing and you will be pleasantly
surprised. Pleasant is the operative word, because that is basically what it is.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 The refilled teapot has now been polished off, and I am feeling
generally sedated. My mind tends to drift with a relaxing aura, as I ease into a
more positive ambiance and a gentle sense of well-being. This is definitely not
a placebo effect.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As there are online suggestions that excessive dosing can cause nausea and
vomiting, I won’t consume any more, particularly as I have probably had quite
a large dose already. Indeed, 2-3g is often cited as being adequate.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 The effects are now wearing off somewhat. That slight tummy edge
has returned, although mentally I still feel a buzz and some sedation.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I should note that a curious moment arose earlier, during which I felt that I
entered some sort of collective unconscious in terms of thinking competitors’
thoughts during a parlour game. This was fleeting and sounds irrational, but I
document it partly as a marker for my own future research.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:30 I now feel, more or less, back at base.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+16:00 The anxiolytic properties dissipated as the evening progressed. The
night’s sleep was fairly standard, although I detected a mild headache and
heaviness during the early hours. However, on rising this morning I feel
completely normal.
\`\`\`
This was quite a nice experience, which may have been better suited to an evening
foray than late afternoon. It wore off after about three hours, leaving a bit of a void
prior to bedtime. Had I consumed at perhaps 8pm, I may well have drifted off into a
peaceful slumber as the effects waned.

Nonetheless, catnip was more interesting than I expected, and was worth the effort
taken to conduct the experiment in a more determined manner.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 25 mg
- Light: 50 - 100 mg
- Common: 100 - 200 mg
- Strong: 200 - 300 mg
- Heavy: 300 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 4 - 6 hours

**Methcathinone** (also known as **Ephedrone** and **MCAT** ) is a synthetic [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) chemical class. It produces standard [amphetamine-like](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) stimulant effects. It is similar to the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) compounds found in the [khat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Khat) plant of eastern Africa and [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) in its structure and effects.

## History and culture

Methcathinone was first synthesized in 1928 in the USA and it was used in the Soviet Union as an antidepressant. It is common in central and eastern Europe, often sold as the more well known [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) or synthesized from OTC drugs containing [ephedrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephedrine) or [pseudoephedrine](/w/index.php?title=Pseudoephedrine&action=edit&redlink=1) .

## Chemistry

Methcathinone is comprised of a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain containing a beta-ketone group (what is known as a **cathinone** molecule) with an additional methyl substitution at R α . It can be thought of as the cathinone homolog of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) as it has the same general formula, differing only in the addition of a single double bonded oxygen.

## Pharmacology

Although the effects of methcathinone have not been formally studied on the same level as [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) , it is possible to speculate that like other simple [substituted cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) , it most likely acts primarily as a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) . The result of this is an effective increase in the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally clear those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within the key area of the brain linked to reward and pleasure to extra-endogenous levels, resulting in stimulating, motivatory and euphoric effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Methcathinone is reported to be extremely stimulating and energetic. The style of stimulation can be described as "forced". This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily body shakes and vibrations become present.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Physical euphoria is very prominent when used responsibly (i.e. reasonable dosing and spacing between experiences) and can lead to profound feelings of social and physical disinhibition.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - The **Dehydration** that is experienced during a methcathinone experience is generally **more severe** than with other stimulants like Amphetamine. Due to this, you must take extreme care and **hydrate yourself constantly** , so that you do not suffer from [Rhabdomyolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis) . This is done generally by observing your body, if there is any pain, if your kidneys feel weird, and if your urine is yellow to green-yellow like tea. Read the wiki and inform yourself on rhabdomyolysis since it is a very bad thing to have, you could die from it if it is severe enough and untreated over long time. Generally you can mitigate it by seeing if your urine is yellow, then if it is, and you do not urinate regularly **drink a glass of water every 15 or 30 minutes** (as long as you don't drink too much and hurt yourself) and your urine should become clear. As Long as you keep hydrating yourself your kidneys will be normal and functioning and you will be good, keep drinking water constantly after it becomes clear, for some few more hours but a bit less amount wise so that you don't have the problem again.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - The increase in heart rate is generally **weaker** than with other stimulants like Methamphetamine.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)** - The amount of perspiration is **very high** . You will sweat extremely easily in hot places and if you do any physical activity. Mixing Methcathinone with DXM will make you drip drops of sweat literally all the time. Hydrate yourself due to this increased perspiration or you will lose a large amount of water very fast.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** -
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)** - These sudden muscle contractions are experienced **during** the **comedown** . This is due to the deficiency of Dopamine in the brain, which replicates symptoms to Parkinson's disease. These tremors are **temporary** and will subside within a few hours.
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)** - Typically occurs during the Comedown. This is due to depletion of Dopamine in the brain.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of Methcathinone can be characterized as a moderate to extreme euphoric sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. *-*
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)** -
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This effect when experienced alongside euphoria can often lead to users mildly or intensely clenching their jaw muscles, sometimes even to the point where the individual’s facial expression begins to change. This is sometimes colloquially called “gurning” and is typically only experienced in common to high dosages.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of Methcathinone can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Methcathinone is extremely stimulating and energetic.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Empathy, love, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This particular effect, although distinct, is far less prominent than the same effect found within traditional [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) .
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** or **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)**
- **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Anhedonia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anhedonia)**
## Toxicity and harm potencial

### Neuro toxicity

Illicit methcathinone manufactured using potassium permanganate oxidation of [ephedrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephedrine) or [pseudoephedrine](/w/index.php?title=Pseudoephedrine&action=edit&redlink=1) has been connected with neurotoxicity caused by [manganese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese) poisoning.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Methcathinone, due to its highly addictive nature, can often cause extreme [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

## Legal status

Internationally, methcathinone is a Schedule I controlled substance under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

- **Australia** : Methcathinone is a Schedule 9 controlled substance.

## Effects
The effect of methcathinone is in no way directly comparable to that of the khat plant, which is traditionally consumed in Yemen, Ethiopia and Kenya. It is much more similar to the effect of other uppers such as speed. Methcathinone suppresses fatigue and hunger. It causes an increase in drive and performance, euphoria, an increased urge to talk, disinhibition, extroversion, inner restlessness and hyperactivity.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Methcathinone puts considerable strain on the heart and circulation. Since the effect of methcathinone seems rather subtle at first, there is a risk of overdose by refilling. Overdoses can cause fluttering of the heart, stomach problems, restlessness and sleep disturbances. According to reports from users, there is an increased urge to urinate, but urination can be difficult.
Some users report depressive states when coming down.
Methcathinone, like speed, can have increased impurities and high levels of extenders as it is often produced in illegal home labs.

### Long-term Risks
There is a risk of dependence with psychological symptoms. In the case of long-term, high-dose consumption, the psychological and physical risks are similar to those of speed, cocaine or methamphetamine. In the laboratory, a so-called "craving" (urge to consume even more) could also be observed in experimental animals.

## Safer Use
- Dose methcathinone carefully and do not add more right away.
- Refrain from mixed use whenever possible. Above all, do not mix methcathinone with other drugs such as speed or cocaine.
- Do not mix methcathinone with alcohol, this only increases the side effects.
- Methcathinone has a very draining effect - so take breaks from using it and give yourself enough rest.
- Drink water or fruit juices regularly, but not too much, as urination on methcathinone can be tedious.
- Make sure you eat a balanced, healthy diet with enough vitamins and minerals.
- Follow the safer sniffing rules!

  "wikipedia": `# Methcathinone
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methcathinone*

Methcathinone  (α-methylamino-propiophenone or ephedrone) (sometimes called "cat" or "jeff" or "catnip" or "M-Kat" or "kat" or "intash") is a monoamine alkaloid and psychoactive stimulant, a substituted cathinone. It is used as a recreational drug due to its potent stimulant and euphoric effects and is considered to be addictive, with both physical and psychological withdrawal occurring if its use is discontinued after prolonged or high-dosage administration. It is usually snorted, but can be smoked, injected, or taken orally.
Methcathinone is listed as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the United States' Controlled Substances Act, and as such it is not considered to be safe or effective in the treatment, diagnosis, prevention, or cure of any disease, and has no approved medical use. Possession and distribution of methcathinone for the purpose of human consumption is illegal under any/all circumstances in the United States and is either illegal or highly regulated in most jurisdictions worldwide.

## History

Methcathinone was first synthesized in 1928 in the United States and was patented by Parke-Davis in 1957. It was used in the Soviet Union during the 1930s and 1940s as an anti-depressant (under the name Эфедрон—ephedrone). Methcathinone has long been used as a drug of abuse in the Soviet Union and Russia.
Circa 1994, the United States government recommended to the UN Secretary-General that methcathinone should be listed as a Schedule I controlled substance in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In 1995, following US advice, China added the drug to its list of prohibited substances and discontinued its pharmaceutical use.
It is currently a Schedule III drug in Canada along with codeine, anabolic steroids, and testosterone. It is legal to possess in Canada, but illegal to purchase. Methcathinone used to have the nick-name "bath salts", to avoid restrictions on importation.

## Chemistry

Methcathinone is a beta-keto N-methylamphetamine and is closely related to the naturally occurring compounds, cathinone and cathine. It is also very closely related to methamphetamine, differing by only the β-ketone substituent and differing from amphetamine by both a keto and N-methyl substituent. Its carbon skeleton is identical to pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine. It differs from pseudoephedrine in that the hydroxyl beta to the aromatic ring is oxidized to a ketone.
Methcathinone possesses a chiral carbon atom, and therefore two enantiomers are possible. When it is made semi-synthetically  from pseudo/ephedrine as a starting material, then only a single enantiomer is produced. Given that the chiral center has an alpha hydrogen and adjacent the carbonyl group, the molecule will racemize in solution via an enol intermediate. This process is known as keto–enol tautomerism.
Methcathinone production utilizes the oxidation of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, the former being preferred because of much higher yields achieved. Oxidation of pseudoephedrine to methcathinone requires little chemistry experience, making it (relatively) easy to synthesize. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is most commonly used as the oxidant.
In clandestine laboratories, synthesizing methcathinone using potassium permanganate is considered undesirable because of the low yields and the high toxicity of this oxidant (see Manganese toxicity); however, if done in a proper laboratory using the proper procedures potassium permanganate can be a high-yielding reactant. A method that yields more methcathinone is oxidizing (pseudo)ephedrine with chromium (VI) compounds, which are far more toxic than permanganate compounds.
Methcathinone as free base is very unstable; it easily loses its ketone group, which is substituted with a hydroxyl group, yielding pseudoephedrine, in the reverse of the typical synthesis reaction.  Structurally, this occurs when the C=O bond at the Rβ-position is converted into a C-OH bond. Additionally, a dimerization reaction has been observed in solutions of freebase methcathinone, which yields a biologically inactive compound.

## Effects

Methcathinone hydrochloride increases spontaneous rodent locomotor activity, potentiates the release of dopamine from dopaminergic nerve terminals in the brain, and causes appetite suppression.  Users can easily forget to consume fluids leading to increased thirst and dehydration. The effects of methcathinone are similar to those of methamphetamine, initially deemed to be less intense by the inexperienced user, and often more euphoric.  The effects have been compared to those of cocaine, since it commonly causes hypertension (elevated blood pressure) and tachycardia (elevated heart rate).
Reported effects include:

Feelings of euphoria
Increased alertness
Slurred speech
Shaking of the limbs
Increased heart rate
Increased blood pressure, risk of stroke or heart attack
Increased empathy and sense of communication
Both decreased and increased sexual function and desire
Bruxism
The effects of methcathinone usually last from four to six hours.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Methcathinone is a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). Methcathinone has very strong affinities for the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Its affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) is less than that of methamphetamine.
The C=O bond at the Rβ-position (directly right of the phenyl ring) is slightly polar, and as a result the drug does not cross the lipid blood–brain barrier quite as well as amphetamine. Nevertheless, it is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Chronic high dosage use may result in acute mental confusion ranging from mild paranoia to psychosis. These symptoms typically disappear quickly if use is stopped.
Anecdotal reports have provided some information on patterns of methcathinone use. The most common route of administration is via nasal insufflation (snorting). Other routes of administration include oral, IV injection and smoking.

## Illicit usage

Methcathinone binges resemble amphetamine binges in that the user may not sleep or eat, and takes in little in the way of liquids. The methcathinone binge is followed by long periods of sleep, excess eating, long-lasting nosebleeds (insufflation of methcathinone is corrosive to the nasal mucosa in the same manner as methamphetamine) and, in some cases, depression.

## Addiction

In preclinical studies, methcathinone hydrochloride produces an abuse potential similar to that of the amphetamines.
Methcathinone can be highly psychologically addictive, and can produce a methamphetamine-like withdrawal.
In drug discrimination studies, methcathinone hydrochloride evokes responses similar to those induced by both dextro­amphetamine sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride.

## Intravenous usage

Injecting this substance has been associated with symptoms similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (manganism) due to the compound manganese dioxide which is a byproduct of synthesis with permanganate.

## Legal status

The Convention on Psychotropic Substances lists methcathinone as a Schedule I substance which restricts its use for government-approved medical and scientific uses.

### Australia

Methcathinone is a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2021). A Schedule 9 substance is defined as a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

### United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, methcathinone is listed as a Class B drug with no clinical uses.

### United States
