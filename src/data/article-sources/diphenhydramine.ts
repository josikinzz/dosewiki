DPH (Diphenhydramine) is a legal and freely available over the counter first-generation antihistamine possessing anticholinergic and sedative properties. It was one of the first known antihistamines, invented in 1943 by Dr. George Rieveschl and usually sold under the brand name of “benadryl”. This substance is available in many forms of generic or store brand medication which are mainly used to treat allergies or as a general sleep aid. When taken in “recreational” doses however, DPH becomes a notorious and extremely powerful deliriant.

Diphenhydramine is classed as an anticholinergic which is functionally similar to tropane alkaloids found within Datura stramonium and other plants in the nightshade family. This substance works via its antagonistic action on acetylcholine receptors. It’s this inhibition of acetylcholine which leads to delirium, sedation and intensely realistic hallucinations along side of some extremely uncomfortable and dysphoric physical side effects.

DPH and other deliriant hallucinogens are generally considered as both physically and psychologically unsafe by the online psychonautic community. This is further backed up by the consistent way in which almost everybody who tries this substance immediately regrets the experience.

Although we strongly discourage ever trying such a drug, the experience itself can be fascinating in itself and worthy of scientific documentation none the less.

In terms of it’s subjective effects, the DPH has a dosage scale unlike anything found within psychedelics or dissociatives. It is not like other drugs in sense of dosage, as a light dose does not equal a light trip. Doses under 300mg induce more of a restless feeling, body high, and muscle relaxation. Doses typically 600mg+ are what make the user enter delirium and begin to see fully formed hallucinations.

Anything in between these two extremes is often a disappointing and uncomfortable experience, characterized with twitching and only very minor hallucinations, mostly in the peripheral vision.

The DPH experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe…

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of DPH are usually described as extremely uncomfortable. They can be broken down into nine components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Increased bodily weight** - The first noticeable sensation is that of having an extremely heavy body, as if the gravity has been multiplied by a thousand. This makes it extremely difficult and uncomfortable to move.
- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - Users commonly report all-encompassing, sharp and extremely painful jolts of electricity that spontaneously manifest themselves in a similar rhythm to hiccups.
- **Muscle cramps**
- **Nausea**
- **Dizziness**
- **Restless leg syndrome**
- **Abnormal heart beat**
- **Frequent urination**
- **Difficulty urinating** - This can be described as a feeling of concrete blocking your urethra and painfully conflicts with a frequent need to urinate.

The physical effects of DPH and other deliriants are thought to occur when the concentration of acetylcholine in the vagus nerve decreases due to acetylcholine inhibition, leading to the commonly experienced physical dysphoria.

The levels of dysphoria experienced, however, vary between people with a very small percentage of users reporting that they do not seem to experience them at all.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of DPH is described by many as generally negative and dysphoric throughout the trip, generally consisting of extreme paranoia and feelings of impending doom. It is largely confusing and disorienting often leading to a complete inability to communicate or understand normal language. It contains unique cognitive effects found almost exclusively in the deliriant class.

The most prominent of these effects include:

- **Depression**
- **Anxiety**
- **Thought deceleration**
- **Suppression of emotion**
- **Suppression of information processing**
- **Amnesia**
- **Suppression of language**
- **Time distortion**
- **Paranoia**

**Visual effects:**

*Suppression*

DPH does not enhance visual stimuli in the way that psychedelics do, instead it tends to decrease visual aptitude both increasing hallucination and degrading vision.

- Decreased visual acuity
- Suppression of pattern recognition
- Blurred vision

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*Melting, Breathing, Morphing and Flowing*) - In comparison to other hallucinogens, this effect can be described as intricate in complexity, jittery, slow and rigid in motion, static in their permanence, realistic in believability, and interactive in plasticity.
- **Visual haze**
- **After images**

*Hallucinatory states*

DPH and other deliriants are unique in that they offer solid hallucinations which display themselves seamlessly into waking consciousness, similar to fully formed dreams or delusions. In contrast, classical psychedelics and dissociatives have progressive levels of multiple all encompassing sensory effects, before reaching the level of concrete hallucination.

These can literally encompass anything but common manifestations include,

- Black phosphenes
- Spiders and various insects
- Shadow people
- “Hatman”
- Animals and pets
- Human beings, usually behaving completely normally
- Phantom cigarettes, spliffs and bowls
- Phantom water and drinks
- Floating inanimate objects that appear out of nowhere, only to disappear after your hand goes directly through the object while trying to grab hold of it.
- Every day conversations with friends, family members and fictional people that aren’t really there.

The hallucinatory states in DPH and other deliriants are more delirious and uncontrollable than that of any other commonly used hallucinogen. These states alternate between waking external hallucination and internal hallucinatory states.

The effects of such hallucinatory states include two separate components:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations**

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of DPH are common in their occurrence and exhibit a range of effects which commonly includes:

- Suppression
- Hallucinations

**Physical health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

If taken on any kind of a regular basis, DPH can have some serious but unstudied adverse effects on ones kidneys and result in bladder issues similar to that of ketamine cystitis.

It is assumed non-addictive by most due to the nature of the experience but many people do find themselves coming back to it on a regular basis. This can often lead to addiction and extreme caution should be taken.

Diphenhydramine can become fatal if amounts close to or exceeding 2 grams are consumed and can result in death when combined with most stimulants and MAOI inhibitors. It is worth noting however that a dosage of 1 gram is considered extreme in its strength and could potentially result in a fatal overdose if a person happened to be particularly sensitive to this substance.

In terms of its tolerance, this forms very quickly with DPH trips, meaning that a trip can only occur at full effects every 2-4 weeks.

**Available forms:**

DPH is available in several different forms over the counter and online.

- **Capsules** - available over the counter and online. Well-known brands include Benadryl, Benylin, Nytol and Sominex. Many of these products contain other medicines, including dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, and ephedrine. Care should be taken when using these products to ensure that there is no overdose on other medicines in the DPH-containing product.
- **Liquid** - available over the counter and online. DPH in liquid form can be taken orally or injected. Well-known brands include Benadryl, Benylin, Nytol and Sominex. Many of these products contain other medicines, including dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, and ephedrine. Care should be taken when using these products to ensure that there is no overdose on other medicines in the DPH-containing product.
- **Powder** - available online. DPH in powdered form can be taken orally, via injection or insufflation.

**Legal issues:**

DPH is available either over the counter or by prescription in most countries. Some countries however require the purchaser to be over 16, 18 or 21.

- **Zambia:** Possession and sale is illegal.

**Conclusion:**

The subjective effects breakdown contained within this article was written by the [PsychonautWiki](http://www.PsychonautWiki.org) admin known as *[Cocoanatta](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/User:Cocoanatta)*.

Nobody is going to stop you from trying this but if you’re completely set on it, at least wait until you have had a large amount of experience being out of your mind on psychedelic and dissociative substances first.

The fact that this substance is completely legal and available to the masses, despite being far more dangerous than comparatively benign psychedelics such as LSD shows that our governments are not concerned with the dangers of drug induced hallucination in itself. They are instead concerned with the secondary effects, namely the drug induced changes of perspective which psychedelics offer but deliriants do not.

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diphenylmethanes. These are compounds containing a diphenylmethane moiety, which consists of a methane wherein two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two phenyl groups.

### Background

Diphenhydramine - perhaps known most commonly as its brand name formulation Benadryl - is a first-generation H1 receptor antihistamine that is used extensively for the treatment of seasonal allergies, insect bites and stings, and rashes
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
. However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties
11
,
16
. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for "night time" use
9
,
12
,
13
.
Diphenhydramine is also used in combination with
8-chlorotheophylline
as the anti-nausea drug
Dimenhydrinate
where it is utilized primarily for its antagonism of H1 histamine receptors within the vestibular system
4
.
Diphenhydramine has also been shown to be implicated in a number of neurotransmitter systems that affect behaviour including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and opioid
3
. As a result, diphenhydramine is being investigated for its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties.

### Indication

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist (H1 antihistamine) that is widely available as a non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medication. As an OTC medication, diphenhydramine is typically formulated as tablets and creams indicated for use in treating sneezing, runny nose, itchy/watery eyes, itching of nose or throat, insomnia, pruritis, urticaria, insect bites/stings, allergic rashes, and nausea
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
.
Additionally, when the use of oral diphenhydramine is impractical, there are also prescription-only formulations such as diphenhydramine injection products that are effective in adults and pediatric patients (other than premature infants and neonates) for:
i) the amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after acute allergic reaction symptoms have been controlled, and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated
16
;
ii) the active treatment of motion sickness
16
; and
iii) use in parkinsonism when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups, and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents
16
.

### Pharmacodynamics

Diphenhydramine has anti-histaminic (H1-receptor), anti-emetic, anti-vertigo and sedative and hypnotic properties
12
. The anti-histamine action occurs by blocking the spasmogenic and congestive effects of histamine by competing with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, preventing but not reversing responses mediated by histamine alone
12
. Such receptor sites may be found in the gut, uterus, large blood vessels, bronchial muscles, and elsewhere
12
. Anti-emetic action is by inhibition at the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone
12
. Anti-vertigo action is by a central antimuscarinic effect on the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone of the midbrain
12
.

### Mechanism of Action

Histamine H1 receptor
Inverse agonist
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2
Antagonist

### Absorption

Diphenhydramine is quickly absorbed after oral administration with maximum activity occurring in approximately one hour
6
,
13
. The oral bioavailability of diphenhydramine has been documented in the range of 40% to 60%, and peak plasma concentration occurs about 2 to 3 hours after administration
6
,
13
.

### Metabolism

Diphenhydramine undergoes rapid and extensive first-pass metabolism
18
,
13
,
8
. In particular, two successive N-demethylations occur wherein diphenhydramine is demethylated to N-desmethyldiphenhydramine (the N-desmethyl metabolite) and then this metabolite is itself demethylated to N,N-didesmethyldiphenhydramine (the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite)
18
,
8
. Subsequently, acetyl metabolites like N-acetyl-N-desmethyldiphenhydramine are generated via the amine moiety of the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite
8
. Additionally, the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite also undergoes some oxidation to generate the diphenylmethoxyacetic acid metabolite as well
18
,
13
,
8
. The remaining percentage of a dose of administered diphenhydramine is excreted unchanged
18
,
13
,
8
. The metabolites are further conjugated with glycine and glutamine and excreted in urine
13
.
Moreover, studies have determined that a variety of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in the N-demethylation that characterizes the primary metabolic pathway of diphenhydramine, including CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19
7
. In particular, CYP2D6 demonstrates higher affinity catalysis with the diphenhydramine substrate than the other isoenzymes identified
7
. Consequently, inducers or inhibitors of these such CYP enzymes may potentially affect the serum concentration and incidence and/or severity of adverse effects associated with exposure to diphenhydramine

### Half-life

The elimination half-life ranges from 2.4-9.3 hours in healthy adults
18
,
13
. The terminal elimination half-life is prolonged in liver cirrhosis
13
.

### Toxicity

Overdose is expected to result in effects similar to the adverse effects that are ordinarily associated with the use of diphenhydramine, including drowsiness, hyperpyrexia, and anticholinergic effects, among others
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
18
. Additional symptoms during overdose may include mydriasis, fever, flushing, agitation, tremor, dystonic reactions, hallucinations and ECG changes
13
. Large overdose may cause rhabdomyolysis, convulsions, delirium, toxic psychosis, arrhythmias, coma and cardiovascular collapse
13
. Moreover, with higher doses, and particularly in children, symptoms of CNS excitation including hallucinations and convulsions may appear; with massive doses, coma or cardiovascular collapse may follow
18
.
Although diphenhydramine has been in widespread use for many years without ill consequence, it is known to cross the placenta and has been detected in breast milk
18
. This medication should therefore only be used when the potential benefit of treatment to the mother exceeds any possible hazards to the developing fetus or suckling infant
18
.
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate no major differences in the distribution or elimination of diphenhydramine compared to younger adults
18
. Nevertheless, diphenhydramine should be used with caution in the elderly, who are more likely to experience adverse effects
13
. Avoid use in elderly patients with confusion
13
.
The results of a review on the use of diphenhydramine in renal failure suggest that in moderate to severe renal failure, the dose interval should be extended by a period dependent on Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
18
.
After intravenous administration of 0.8 mg/kg diphenhydramine, a prolonged half-life was noted in patients with chronic liver disease which correlated with the severity of the disease
18
. However, the mean plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution were not significantly affected
18
.
LD
50
=500 mg/kg (orally in rats). Considerable overdosage can lead to myocardial infarction (heart attack), serious ventricular dysrhythmias, coma and death.

### Associated Therapies

### Mechanism of action

Diphenhydramine predominantly works via the antagonism of H1 (Histamine 1) receptors
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. Such H1 receptors are located on respiratory smooth muscles, vascular endothelial cells, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), cardiac tissue, immune cells, the uterus, and the central nervous system (CNS) neurons
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. When the H1 receptor is stimulated in these tissues it produces a variety of actions including increased vascular permeability, promotion of vasodilation causing flushing, decreased atrioventricular (AV) node conduction time, stimulation of sensory nerves of airways producing coughing, smooth muscle contraction of bronchi and the GIT, and eosinophilic chemotaxis that promotes the allergic immune response
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
.
Ultimately, diphenhydramine functions as an inverse agonist at H1 receptors, and subsequently reverses effects of histamine on capillaries, reducing allergic reaction symptoms
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. Moreover, since diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and inversely agonizes the H1 CNS receptors, resulting in drowsiness, and suppressing the medullary cough center
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
.
Furthermore, H1 receptors are similar to muscarinic receptors
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. Consequently, diphenhydramine also acts as an antimuscarinic
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. It does so by behaving as a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in its use as an antiparkinson medication
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
.
Lastly, diphenhydramine has also demonstrated activity as an intracellular sodium channel blocker, resulting in possible local anesthetic properties

### Volume of distribution

Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS
18
. Following a 50 mg oral dose of diphenhydramine, the volume of distribution is in the range of 3.3 - 6.8 l/kg
18
.

### Protein binding

Some prescribing information records the protein binding of diphenhydramine as approximately 78%
18
while others have suggested the medication is about 80 to 85%
13
bound to plasma proteins.

### Route of elimination

The metabolites of diphenhydramine are conjugated with glycine and glutamine and excreted in urine
12
,
13
. Only about 1% of a single dose is excreted unchanged in urine
12
,
13
. The medication is ultimately eliminated by the kidneys slowly, mainly as inactive metabolites
12
,
13
.

### Clearance

Values for plasma clearance of a 50 mg oral dose of diphenhydramine has been documented as lying in the range of 600-1300 ml/min

### Kind

Protein

### Organism

### Pharmacological action

Unknown

### Actions

Inhibitor

### General Function

Sodium-ion dependent, high affinity carnitine transporter. Involved in the active cellular uptake of carnitine. Transports one sodium ion with one molecule of carnitine (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938, PubMed:17509700, PubMed:20722056, PubMed:33124720). Also transports organic cations such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) without the involvement of sodium. Relative uptake activity ratio of carnitine to TEA is 11.3 (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938). In intestinal epithelia, transports the quorum-sensing pentapeptide CSF (competence and sporulation factor) from B.subtilis which induces cytoprotective heat shock proteins contributing to intestinal homeostasis (PubMed:18005709). May also contribute to regulate the transport of organic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable)

Diphenhydramine Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
Diphenhydramine comes in different forms. The most common are various over-the-counter antihistamines, cold remedies and sleeping aids (including Benadryl, Sominex, Sleep-Eze D and several generic brands). Brands may contain different quantities of diphenhydramine, generally in the 25-50 mg per dose-unit (pill, capsule) range, as well as a variety of other potentially dangerous drugs. It is easy to mis-calculate dosages, so be careful and check to ensure that the product does not contain other dangerous active ingredients. 
 
 Diphenhydramine causes drowsiness, lethargy, and sleep even at doses recommended for anti-histamine use. The dosages below are reflective of recreational use where users take doses 4-20 times the recommended dose, stay awake, and try to enjoy the "drunken", delusional state. 
 
 Note: Some internet sources equate Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). They are actually different chemicals, with different effects and dosage ranges. 
 
 The chart below shows approximate recreational dosages for pure diphenhydramine, measured in milligrams (mg).
 
- Oral Diphenhydramine Dosages(Recreational) Threshold10 mg Light25-150 mg Common150-300 mg Strong250-500 mg Heavy400-700 LD50 (Lethal Dose*)500 mg/kg in rats | Oral Diphenhydramine Dosages(Recreational) | Threshold | 10 mg | Light | 25-150 mg | Common | 150-300 mg | Strong | 250-500 mg | Heavy | 400-700 | LD50 (Lethal Dose*) | 500 mg/kg in rats
**Oral Diphenhydramine Dosages(Recreational)**
- Threshold: 10 mg
- Light: 25-150 mg
- Common: 150-300 mg
- Strong: 250-500 mg
- Heavy: 400-700
- LD50 (Lethal Dose*): 500 mg/kg in rats
**Duration : 4 - 8 hours**
 
 * LD50 = dose which will kill 50% of the tested animals. It is difficult to extrapolate from animal data to human fatal doses, which would be much, much lower in this case. 
 
 * LD50 of 500 mg/kg in rats from Merck: "ld50 orally in rats (Gruhzit, Fisken)". 
 
 
---
 
 
Warnings Acetaminophen Warning : Diphenhydramine products containing acetaminophen/paracetamol should not be used recreationally. High doses of acetaminophen can be fatal. 
 
 Diphenhydramine products containing other medicines can be harmful if taken in doses above the recommended limits. Dangerous interactions can occur. 
 
 
 
Notes
 
1. As with any powerful psychoactive substance, high doses are more likely to induce difficult experiences, negative side effects, allergic responses, etc.

[Deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) are highly unpredictable and may result in erratic behaviors, self-injury, hospitalization, or death. It should be noted that most individuals do not choose to repeat the experience due to its unpleasant nature.
 
Please use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) if using this substance (e.g. starting with a low dose and always having a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) ). Refer to [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPH#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**Diphenhydramine** (also known as **DPH** , **Dimedrol, Benadryl** , and many others) is a [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) substance of the [ethanolamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethanolamine) class. It is a first-generation H 1 [antihistamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antihistamine) that is widely used as a generic, over-the-counter medication to treat allergies. When exceeding approved doses, diphenhydramine produces powerful deliriant effects.

Diphenhydramine was first synthesized in 1943. In 1946, it became the first prescription antihistamine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It was approved for over-the-counter use in the 1980s. Today, it is typically used to treat allergies, but it may also be used for several conditions, including itchiness, insomnia, motion sickness, nausea, and the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [tactile hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucinations) , [memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression) , [thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization) , [dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria) , and [external hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) . Lower doses tend to produce a stoning, body-high effect, while higher doses produce a state of [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) in which the user sees and hears fully-formed, compelling [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinations) . Doses between these two points are uncomfortable and dysphoric.

Notably, it is frequently reported to produce significant [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and bodily discomfort ("body load"). Most people who try diphenhydramine do not report positive effects and do not wish to repeat the experience.

It is generally considered to have low abuse potential due to its dysphoric effects. The toxicity of recreational use is not well-studied. Anecdotal reports suggest that chronic use (i.e., high dose, repeated administration) may cause persisting hallucinations and impairments in cognition & memory. High doses have also been linked to seizures and cardiotoxicity.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Diphenhydramine was discovered in 1943 by George Rieveschl, a former professor at the University of Cincinnati. In 1946, it became the first prescription antihistamine approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

In the 1960s, diphenhydramine was found to inhibit reuptake of the [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . This discovery led to a search for viable [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressant) with similar structures and fewer side effects, culminating in the invention of fluoxetine (Prozac), a [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor) (SSRI).

## Chemistry

Diphenhydramine, or 2-(diphenylmethoxy)-N,N-dimethylethanamine, is an organic compound in the ethanolamine class. The chemical structure of diphenhydramine consists of an ethylamine chain with two methyl groups bonded to the terminal nitrogen group R N . This ethylamine chain is also substituted at R 2 with a diphenylmethoxy group, forming an ether. The diphenylmethoxy group consists of two aromatic phenyl rings bonded to the carbon member of a methoxy group CH 3 O-.

DPH is produced as a hydrochloride salt.

## Pharmacology

Diphenhydramine is an [inverse agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#agonists) of the peripheral histamine H 1 receptor and a central histamine H 1 receptor. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] The peripheral inverse agonism induces the allergy reducing effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Like many first-generation antihistamines, it is also a competitive antagonist at [mACH receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Diphenhydramine is an [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) . Although the precise mechanism is not understood, the inhibition of the action of [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) is thought to be primarily responsible for the delirium, sedation, and intensely realistic hallucinations alongside the extremely uncomfortable and dysphoric physical side effects.

Diphenhydramine has been shown to block sodium channels and inhibit the reuptake of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . It also blocks voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs), meaning it has the potential to cause or lead to *torsades de points* , a potentially dangerous cardiac condition that can lead to sudden cardiac death.

The receptor binding affinities are listed as follows:

## Subjective effects

According to user reports, diphenhydramine displays a non-linear dose response, meaning the effects don't correspond directly with the dose. Doses under 300 mg are reported to produce restlessness, [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , and a [body high](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations) . In comparison, doses above 500 mg begin to produce a state of [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) in which the user sees and hears fully-formed, compelling [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinations) . Doses in between these two extremes are said to be uncomfortable and dysphoric. [Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and bodily discomfort ("body load") are reported almost universally.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Diphenhydramine produces considerable sedation, and low doses are commonly used as a sleep aid. This sense of sedation is accompanied by a heavy body load, which can become overwhelmingly uncomfortable. However, higher doses of diphenhydramine also have a stimulating quality that can make actual rest difficult.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - Users commonly report all-encompassing, sharp, and painful jolts of electricity that spontaneously manifest themselves uncontrollably in a similar rhythm to hiccups.
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - One of the most apparent effects is having a massive body as if gravity multiplied tenfold. This makes it extremely tough and uncomfortable to move.
- **[Restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome)** - Restless legs are very prominent and arguably one of the most uncomfortable side effects of diphenhydramine. It can also last for days after the experience and can even be chronic when it is abused repeatedly.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - This results in increased feelings of touch, pain, warmth, and orgasms. It is usually only present at the peak, not during the come-up or down.
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - Diphenhydramine produces feelings of numbness throughout the body. This is attributed to its ability to block sodium channels within the nerves.
- **[Tactile hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucination)** - This is often a direct result of visual [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , and they commonly feel and look as if insects are crawling on one's skin.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** or **[Nausea suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression)** - Depending on the dose, diphenhydramine can both suppress and cause nausea. Low doses effectively suppress nausea, which is why it is marketed and sold as a motion sickness suppressant, while high doses cause it in significant amounts.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - Diphenhydramine can prolong the QT interval, potentially leading to torsades de pointes, an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause sudden cardiac death.
- **[Cough suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Diphenhydramine can be extremely dehydrating, which often leads to dry mouth and skin, chapped lips, and nose bleeds. Users should drink plenty of water before and after an experience.
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)** - Along with dehydration, diphenhydramine makes your mouth very dry. Water can temporarily remedy this, although it usually persists for the entirety of the trip.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)** & **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Diphenhydramine has the strange effect of making the user want to urinate while making actual urination extremely difficult frequently. This sensation is described as very uncomfortable.
- **[Gustatory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gustatory_hallucination)** - A foul metallic-like taste is present throughout the entire experience, combined with a dry mouth, which can be a very uncomfortable effect lasting for days after the experience. Eating or drinking flavored drinks will only make the taste go away temporarily. It can also appear as a sign of addiction, where it acts as a trigger for cravings.
- **[Hypotension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypotension)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - This effect can lead the user to experience shivers, especially during the come-up phase.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)** & **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)** - Sudden muscle cramps and spasms can form unexpectedly. This is common at the beginning of the trip and usually passes quickly.
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)** - It is common for users to smell a mild, thick, and dull smell in the air that can easily be ignored most of the time. Some users also notice a smell enhancement [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue)**
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)** *or* **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** - While it is known that diphenhydramine constricts pupils minimally , many people also report that their pupils dilate, especially at high dosages when anticholinergic effects take place similar to substances like [atropine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Atropine) or [scopolamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scopolamine) .
- **[Rapid breathing](/w/index.php?title=Rapid_breathing&action=edit&redlink=1)**
- **[Skin flushing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Skin_flushing)** - Flushed skin occurs mostly around the eyes but can also be seen all over the body.
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)** - This effect happens in high doses. However, it reduces itchiness in lower doses due to [histamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Histamine) antagonism.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - Some users report jaw clenching. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - Possibly due to the bronchodilation that makes swallowing uncomfortable, [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] DPH is able to make eating uncomfortable as well. This could make a user force themselves to eat, or to stop eating entirely despite hunger before the effects kick in. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- While diphenhydramine produces visual hallucinations, it does not enhance visual stimuli in the manner of [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . Instead, it tends to degrade and decrease visual acuity and processing, which results in increased hallucinations and degraded vision. This becomes more apparent in darker areas than in well-lit ones. 
#### Suppression
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This effect is commonly present at moderate to high doses.
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)**
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - This effect can result in blurry vision to the point of blindness. It sometimes can last for days after the experience itself.
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) )* - Compared to hallucinogens, this effect can be described as intricate in complexity, jittery and flexible in motion, static in their permanence, realistic in believability, and interactive in plasticity. It is also very faint.
- **[Object alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Object_alteration)** - The textures seen are described as transparent whirling lines and swirls that move at changing speeds and jitter uncontrollably. They only appear slightly above surfaces, walls, and ceilings and can not be felt.
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - Diphenhydramine can cause one's vision to decrease in brightness and become dark and gloomy.
- **[Visual haze](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_haze)**
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Relative to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) , this effect occurs more frequently at moderate to heavy doses and is the defining feature of the experience. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, controllable, or autonomous in controllability and solid in style. The most common themes for these hallucinations include those of everyday occurrences such as smoking phantom cigarettes, talking to people who are not there, seeing and feeling insects, and immersion in sinister or nightmarish experiences.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Relative to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) , this effect occurs briefly and spontaneously at moderate doses but becomes progressively extended in its occurrence and duration proportional to dosage before eventually becoming all-encompassing. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, interactive in style, equal in new experiences and memory replays in content, autonomous in controllability, and solid in style. [Internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) may occur at lighter dosages than needed to cause [external hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) and [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) .
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)**
- **[Shadow people](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Shadow_people)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Unspeakable horrors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unspeakable_horrors)**
- **[Object activation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Object_activation)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The headspace of diphenhydramine is described by many as generally negative and dysphoric, often consisting of extreme paranoia and feelings of impending doom. It is highly confusing and disorienting and usually results in a complete inability to communicate or understand standard language. 
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)** - At higher dosages, a person could experience a complete halt of external information processing, which can make the user unable to perform simple tasks or make decisions.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - Anxiety and paranoia are more commonly reported on diphenhydramine than almost any other substance. However, there is a threshold dose (around 500mg) where it begins to disappear.
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - Diphenhydramine is reported to be extremely tiring. Low doses are often used and sold as a sleep aid.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - Even though diphenhydramine is primarily a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) and causes sleepiness, it has stimulant effects on the body, which can also keep the user awake. This effect predominates sleepiness at higher dosages.
- **[Dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria)** - The levels of dysphoria experienced, however, vary between people, with a tiny percentage of users reporting that they do not seem to experience them at all.
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect is rare, usually in lower doses. This is likely caused by serotonin inhibition and sedation.
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - Diphenhydramine causes significant confusion, resulting in a complete inability to understand others' intentions, emotions, humor, and even simple sentences.
- **[Creativity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_suppression)**
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)** - Interestingly, one's sex drive seems to have diminished, although sex and masturbation are considered more enjoyable in a unique way and often come with powerful orgasms.
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)** - Delirium may be experienced with extremely high doses, which may necessitate hospitalization.
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)** - Disinhibition on diphenhydramine is different from substances like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , as it may not even be present in certain situations and is heavily influenced by anxiety and paranoia.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - Diphenhydramine is extremely effective at potentiating dreams. This can result in not just increased intensity but a change in dream content, leading to dreams that are both vivid and extremely bizarre.
- **[Dysarthria](/w/index.php?title=Dysarthria&action=edit&redlink=1)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Slurred speech and speaking with a different voice is common on DPH.

- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - At higher dosages, diphenhydramine can cause a complete halt of external information processing, making the user unable to perform simple tasks or make decisions.
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - Diphenhydramine can cause a complete loss of motivation to do almost anything. This is often accompanied by [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) and can make the user extremely bored and restless.
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Although not extreme, time dilation is felt and can be overwhelming if the user is having a difficult trip. ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** - Auditory hallucinations like voices and screams are commonly reported on diphenhydramine.

- **Liquid** is available over the counter and online. Diphenhydramine in liquid form can be taken orally or injected. Well-known brands include Benadryl and ZzzQuil. Rarely, some of these products may contain other medicines, including [dextromethorphan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) , guaifenesin, and acetaminophen. Care should be taken when using these products to ensure no overdose of other medicines in DPH-containing products.
- **Powder** is available online. Diphenhydramine in powdered form can be taken orally or via injection. Any other routes of administration are not recommended because diphenhydramine burns and dehydrates skin tissue, leading to extremely painful burns and bleeding.

### Dimenhydrinate

**Dimenhydrinate** ( **DMH** ) is a combination drug of diphenhydramine and [8-Chlorotheophylline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8-Chlorotheophylline) , marketed as **Draminate** , **Dramamine** , and **Gravol** among others, it is used to treat [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) . It is most commonly available as tablets, although it is also available in liquid form and as a [suppository](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Rectal) . In practice, dimenhydrinate is half as potent as pure diphenhydramine. By weight, dimenhydrinate is between 53% to 55.5% diphenhydramine. The addition of the caffeine-like stimulant 8-Chlorotheophylline is reported to increase the dangerous cardiovascular effects diphenhydramine already has alone. This stimulant effect is also reported to make the trip more restless and dysphoric, with the added negative of being too wakeful to sleep the trip away.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational diphenhydramine use have not been studied extensively.

Diphenhydramine can be highly unpredictable, and the mechanism by which it produces hallucinations has the potential to result in serious injury, hospitalization, or death. Additionally, diphenhydramine puts users in a state where they have little control over their actions. Diphenhydramine can provoke bizarre and nonsensical behavior, which may put the user at risk.

Anecdotal reports suggest that regular use of diphenhydramine can have profound effects on one's kidney and bladder with the potential to result in issues similar to that of [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) cystitis.

Cumulative diphenhydramine use has been tentatively linked to an increased risk of developing dementia.

Some chronic users also report the worsening of mental illnesses (e.g. [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) , [anxiety disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder) , [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) ) [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Overdose

The overdose threshold for diphenhydramine is commonly held to be around 1000 milligrams; however, sensitive individuals or individuals taking other drugs alongside it can overdose with less. The main effects of an overdose are similar to those of heavy doses. Effects include [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [hypotension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypotension) , dryness, [urinary retention](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating) , [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) , [dilated pupils](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation) and [increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) . Some of the more serious side effects at these doses include an even higher risk of [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) and dangerous cardiovascular effects such as arrhythmia ( [abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat) ).

The user may be completely unable to distinguish reality from hallucinations. For this reason, there is a significant risk of the user responding to a delusional environment and injuring themselves or others, as well as the possibility of engaging in too much physical activity which can further strain the heart or cause [rhabdomyolysis](/w/index.php?title=Rhabdomyolysis&action=edit&redlink=1) . Individuals experiencing delusions should, if possible, not be agitated. The first line of treatment for overdose should be [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , although medical attention should always be sought.

Diphenhydramine can become fatal at amounts close to or exceeding 2 grams. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This can result in death, especially when combined with most [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) and [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) .

### Psychosis

Some anecdotal reports suggest that diphenhydramine causes [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) at a significantly higher rate than other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) (i.e. [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) and [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) ). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] There are a large number of experience reports online that describe states of psychotic delirium, amnesia, and other serious consequences after abusing the substance. In many cases, it has resulted in hospitalization and death. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The recreational use of diphenhydramine is generally not advised. If deciding to use this substance, one should use extreme caution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as having a sober [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) .

### Dependence and abuse potential

Diphenhydramine produces dependence with chronic use. In comparison to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) , DPH has been reported to have significantly less abuse potential than other hallucinogens. Most people who try it do not wish to repeat the experience.

Tolerance to many of the effects of DPH develops with repeated use. Users have to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the impact. After that, it takes about 1 - 2 weeks for tolerance to return to baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DPH presents cross-tolerance with all [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) , meaning that after the consumption of DPH, all [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_re-uptake_inhibitors) (SSRIs)** - SSRIs can suppress the visual effects of diphenhydramine. However, this combination may elevate the risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) due to diphenhydramine's weak serotonergic effects.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Due to diphenhydramine's excitatory cardiac effect, combining it with stimulants poses a risk of an abnormal heart rhythm, severe tachycardia, or a heart attack as well as other cardiovascular events.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines can suppress the visual effects of diphenhydramine. However, this combination can produce a dangerous amount of sedation and respiratory depression. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Anticholinergics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticholinergics)** - Due to diphenhydramine's excitatory cardiac effect, combining it with other anticholinergics poses a risk of an abnormal heart rhythm, severe tachycardia, or a heart attack as well as other cardiovascular events (inhibition of acetylcholine causes increased heart rate).

## Legal status

Diphenhydramine is available either over the counter or by prescription in most countries. However, some countries require the purchaser to be over 16, 18, or 21.

- **Zambia:** Diphenhydramine is illegal to possess and sell in Zambia; foreigners have been detained for possession.
- **United States:** Diphenhydramine is widely available over-the-counter in the United States. It is an approved drug and is legal to buy, possess, and ingest without a license or prescription.
- **Poland:** Diphenhydramine is not a controlled substance under Polish law, it can only be bought by individuals over the age of 18 and is found only in sleep medication.

Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine and anticholinergic which is commonly used to combat allergies, insomnia, and cold symptoms. Once you move beyond the recommended dose range, it can have strong sedating and deliriant effects.

Those sedating and deliriant effects have led to its use as a recreational drug. However, the delirium it produces is almost always unpleasant .

At sub-deliriant doses, it can act as a sedative on its own and it can also potentiate the effects of other depressants.

  "tripsit-wiki": `# Diphenhydramine

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Diphenhydramine*

**Diphenhydramine** (DPH, also sold as Benadryl) is an antihistamine with anticholinergic and sedative effects. It is found in both OTC and prescription drugs used in the treatment of allergy-related symptoms, some cold and flu symptoms, insomnia, motion sickness and Parkinson's disease. It has also been researched for many other medicinal uses, including the treatment of OCD.

It has also seen recreational use as a [depressant](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Depressants) or [deliriant](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Deliriants) drug, with high doses inducing vivid hallucinations which users are often unable to distinguish from reality. Most recreational users find the drug causes a negative experience, due to the profusely negative experience it tends to provide - along with the large amount of negative physical side-effects.

## History

DPH was first discovered in 1943 in the USA during a research project fielded around relieving muscle spasms - and in 1946 it became the first prescription antihistamine approved in the USA - therefore, it is known as a 'first generation antihistamine.'

In the 1960s, it was discovered that DPH inhibited the reuptake of serotonin, which, through research of chemicals with similar actions causing less side-effects, led to the development of the antidepressant class [SSRIs](/index.php?title=SSRIs&action=edit&redlink=1) which are still in heavy use today.

In the 1980s, the drug became approved for over-the-counter use as a sleep-aid (due to its sedative effect) and antihistamine.

## Dosage

Overdoses of DPH may cause seizures, coma and ultimately an acute overdose of DPH can be fatal through cardiovascular collapse - though the threshold for this type of reaction is relatively unknown.

DPH is primarily taken orally.

| Therapeutic (insomnia) | 50mg |
| --- | --- |
| Light | 150-300mg |
| Common | 250-500mg |
| Strong | 450-700mg |
| Heavy | 650-800mg |

## Duration

| Onset | 60-120 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Total | 6-8 hours |
| After-effects | 24 hours |

## Effects

Though DPH causes hallucinations and distortions in the perception, which are often effects sought by the recreational users of [psychedelics](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics), these effects are often negative in nature due to the [deliriant](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Deliriants) nature of the chemical and experience.

### Positive

- Increased awareness and appreciation of music
- Dream-like experiences
- Vivid hallucinations
- Muscle relaxation

### Neutral

- Visual distortions

- Sound distortions

### Negative

- Dry mouth

- Delirium

- Confusion

- Muscle cramps

- Nausea

- Loss of coordination (ataxia)

- Increased heart rate

- Photophobia

- Flushed skin

- Itching

- Heart palpitations

- Tremors

- Vomiting

- Stomach pain

- Dysphoria

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Chemical name: 2-(diphenylmethoxy)-N,N-dimethylethanamine

Diphenhydramine is an inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. It is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistaminergic agents. By reversing the effects of histamine on the capillaries, it can reduce the intensity of allergic symptoms. Diphenhydramine also crosses the blood–brain barrier and antagonizes the H1 receptors centrally. Its effects on central H1receptors cause drowsiness.

## Harm Reduction

- Many oral diphenhydramine preparations contain analgesics such as acetaminophen/paracetamol or aspirin, which can be toxic to the liver in high doses. Some adulterants, such as paracetamol, can be removed by [Cold Water Extraction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Cold_Water_Extraction).

- Do not combine LARGE, recreational doses of DPH with any other depressant drugs such as benzos, DXM, alcohol, or opiates

- DPH in high doses may induce delirium, making him or her unpredictable and possible dangerous, especially in public

- Never drive or operate heavy machinery under the influence

- If taking high doses, it is a very good idea to have a sober tripsitter or a friend with you

- High doses have led to seizures.

Diphenhydramine, sold under the brand name Benadryl among others, is an antihistamine and sedative. Although generally considered sedating, diphenhydramine can cause paradoxical central nervous system stimulation in some individuals, particularly at higher doses. This may manifest as agitation, anxiety, or restlessness rather than sedation. It is a first-generation H1-antihistamine and it works by blocking certain effects of histamine, which produces its antihistamine and sedative effects. Diphenhydramine is also a potent anticholinergic. It is mainly used to treat allergies, insomnia, and symptoms of the common cold. It is also less commonly used for tremors in parkinsonism, and nausea. It is taken by mouth, injected into a vein, injected into a muscle, or applied to the skin. Maximal effect is typically around two hours after a dose, and effects can last for up to seven hours.
Common side effects include sleepiness, poor coordination, and an upset stomach. There is no clear risk of harm when used during pregnancy; however, use during breastfeeding is not recommended.
It was developed by George Rieveschl and put into commercial use in 1946. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 294th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700,000 prescriptions.
Its sedative and deliriant effects have led to some cases of recreational use.

## Medical uses

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine used to treat several conditions including allergic symptoms and itchiness, the common cold, insomnia, motion sickness, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Diphenhydramine also has local anesthetic properties, and has been used as such in people allergic to common local anesthetics such as lidocaine.

### Allergies

Diphenhydramine is effective in the treatment of allergies. As of 2007, it was the most commonly used antihistamine for acute allergic reactions in the emergency department.
By injection, it is often used in addition to epinephrine for anaphylaxis, although as of 2007 its use for this purpose had not been properly studied. Its use is only recommended once acute symptoms have improved.

Topical formulations of diphenhydramine are available, including creams, lotions, gels, sprays, and eye drops. These are used to relieve itching and have the advantage of causing fewer systemic effects (e.g.,, drowsiness) than oral forms.

### Movement disorders

Diphenhydramine is used to treat akathisia and parkinsonism caused by antipsychotics. It is also used to treat acute dystonia, including torticollis and oculogyric crisis caused by typical antipsychotics.

### Sleep

Because of its sedative properties, diphenhydramine is widely used in nonprescription sleep aids for insomnia. The drug is an ingredient in several products sold as sleep aids, either alone or in combination with other ingredients such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) in Tylenol PM and ibuprofen in Advil PM. Diphenhydramine can cause minor psychological dependence. Diphenhydramine has also been used as an anxiolytic.
Diphenhydramine has also been used off-label by parents in an attempt to make their children sleep and to sedate them on long-distance flights. This has been met with criticism, both by doctors and by members of the airline industry, because sedating passengers may put them at risk if they cannot react efficiently to emergencies, and because the drug's side effects, especially the chance of a paradoxical reaction, may make some users hyperactive. Addressing such use, the Seattle Children's Hospital argued, in a 2009 article, "Using a medication for your convenience is never an indication for medication in a child."
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of diphenhydramine in the treatment of insomnia, because of poor effectiveness and low quality of evidence. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of diphenhydramine for insomnia.

### Nausea

Diphenhydramine also has antiemetic properties, which make it useful in treating the nausea that occurs in vertigo and motion sickness. However, when taken above the recommended doses, it can cause nausea (especially above 200 mg).

### Anxiety

Diphenhydramine is not typically used to treat anxiety because its long-term use may cause adverse effects, such as memory loss, especially in the elderly. Diphenhydramine is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating anxiety. On the other hand, hydroxyzine, a first-generation antihistamine that lacks significant anticholinergic effects, may be used to treat anxiety, although benzodiazepines and antidepressants are considered more effective by most clinicians. The mild anxiolytic effects of hydroxyzine are mostly due to its weak but significant activity as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, a common target of most antidepressant drugs (as well as certain other antihistamines like cyproheptadine and promethazine). Diphenhydramine is not known to bind to the 5-HT2A receptor, though it is a weak antagonist of the related 5-HT2C receptor, which is another target of antidepressant drugs and has a significant role in mood and anxiety.

## Contraindications

Diphenhydramine is contraindicated in premature infants and neonates, as well as people who are breastfeeding. It is a pregnancy Category B drug. Diphenhydramine has additive effects with alcohol and other depressants. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effect of antihistamines.

## Adverse effects

The most prominent side effects are dizziness and sleepiness. 
Diphenhydramine is a potent anticholinergic agent and a potential deliriant in higher doses. This activity is responsible for the side effects of dry mouth and throat, increased heart rate, pupil dilation, urinary retention, constipation, and, at high doses, hallucinations or delirium. Other side effects include motor impairment (ataxia), flushed skin, blurred vision at nearpoint owing to lack of accommodation (cycloplegia), abnormal sensitivity to bright light (photophobia), sedation, difficulty concentrating, short-term memory loss, visual disturbances, irregular breathing, dizziness, irritability, itchy skin, confusion, increased body temperature (in general, in the hands or feet), temporary erectile dysfunction, and excitability, and although it can be used to treat nausea, higher doses may cause vomiting. Diphenhydramine in overdose may occasionally result in QT prolongation.
Some individuals experience an allergic reaction to diphenhydramine in the form of hives.
Conditions such as restlessness or akathisia can worsen from increased levels of diphenhydramine, especially with recreational dosages. Normal doses of diphenhydramine, like other first-generation antihistamines, can also make symptoms of restless legs syndrome worse.
As diphenhydramine is extensively metabolized by the liver, caution should be exercised when giving the drug to individuals with hepatic impairment.
Anticholinergic use later in life is associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia among older people. Drowsiness, memory loss, confusion, dry mouth or constipation may also occur in elderly people.

### Special populations

Diphenhydramine is secreted in breast milk. It is expected that low doses of diphenhydramine taken occasionally will cause no adverse effects in breastfed infants. Large doses and long-term use may affect the baby or reduce breast milk supply, especially when combined with sympathomimetic drugs, such as pseudoephedrine, or before the establishment of lactation. A single bedtime dose after the last feeding of the day may minimize the harmful effects of the medication on the baby and the milk supply. Still, non-sedating antihistamines are preferred.
Paradoxical reactions to diphenhydramine have been documented, particularly in children, and it may cause excitation instead of sedation.
Topical diphenhydramine is sometimes used, especially for people in hospice. This use is without indication, and topical diphenhydramine should not be used as treatment for nausea because research has not shown that this therapy is more effective than others.

## Overdose

Diphenhydramine is one of the most commonly misused over-the-counter drugs in the United States. Overdose symptoms may include

Acute poisoning can be fatal, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death in 2–18 hours, and in general, is treated using a symptomatic and supportive approach. Diagnosis of toxicity is based on history and clinical presentation, and in general, precise plasma levels do not appear to provide useful relevant clinical information. Several levels of evidence strongly indicate diphenhydramine (similar to chlorpheniramine) can block the delayed rectifier potassium channel and, as a consequence, prolong the QT interval, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.
No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known, but the anticholinergic syndrome has been treated with physostigmine for severe delirium or tachycardia. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the likelihood of psychosis, agitation, and seizures in people who are prone to these symptoms.

## Interactions

Alcohol may increase the drowsiness caused by diphenhydramine.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Diphenhydramine, while traditionally known as an antagonist, acts primarily as an inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. It is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistaminergic agents. By reversing the effects of histamine on the capillaries, it can reduce the intensity of allergic symptoms. It also crosses the blood–brain barrier and inversely agonizes the H1 receptors centrally. Its effects on central H1 receptors cause drowsiness.
Diphenhydramine is a potent antimuscarinic (a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) and, as such, at high doses can cause anticholinergic syndrome. The utility of diphenhydramine as an antiparkinson agent is the result of its blocking properties on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain.
Diphenhydramine also acts as an intracellular sodium channel blocker, which is responsible for its actions as a local anesthetic. Diphenhydramine has also been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. It has been shown to be a potentiator of analgesia induced by morphine, but not by endogenous opioids, in rats. The drug has also been found to act as an inhibitor of histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT).

### Pharmacokinetics

Oral bioavailability of diphenhydramine is in the range of 40% to 60%, and peak plasma concentration occurs about 2 to 3 hours after administration. Diphenhydramine, available in various salt forms, such as citrate, hydrochloride, and salicylate, exhibits distinct molecular weights and pharmacokinetic properties. Specifically, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and diphenhydramine citrate possess molecular weights of 291.8 g/mol and 447.5 g/mol, respectively. These variations in molecular weight influence the dissolution rates and absorption characteristics of each salt form.
The primary route of metabolism is two successive demethylations of the tertiary amine. The resulting primary amine is further oxidized to the carboxylic acid. Diphenhydramine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
The elimination half-life of diphenhydramine has not been fully elucidated, but appears to range between 2.4 and 9.3 hours in healthy adults. A 1985 review of antihistamine pharmacokinetics found that the elimination half-life of diphenhydramine ranged between 3.4 and 9.3 hours across five studies, with a median elimination half-life of 4.3 hours. A subsequent 1990 study found that the elimination half-life of diphenhydramine was 5.4 hours in children, 9.2 hours in young adults, and 13.5 hours in the elderly. A 1998 study found a half-life of 4.1 ± 0.3 hours in young men, 7.4 ± 3.0 hours in elderly men, 4.4 ± 0.3 hours in young women, and 4.9 ± 0.6 hours in elderly women. In a 2018 study in children and adolescents, the half-life of diphenhydramine was 8 to 9 hours.

## Chemistry

### Detection in body fluids

Diphenhydramine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can be used with electron ionization on full scan mode as a screening test. GC-MS or GC-NDP can be used for quantification. Rapid urine drug screens using immunoassays based on the principle of competitive binding may show false-positive methadone results for people having ingested diphenhydramine. Quantification can be used to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in people who are hospitalized, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or assist in a death investigation.

## History

In 1943, diphenhydramine was discovered by chemist George Rieveschl and one of his students, Fred Huber, while they were conducting research into muscle relaxants at the University of Cincinnati. Huber first synthesized diphenhydramine. Rieveschl then worked with Parke-Davis to test the compound, and the company licensed the patent from him. In 1946, it became the first prescription antihistamine in the United States approved by the FDA.
In the 1960s, diphenhydramine was found to weakly inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This discovery led to a search for viable antidepressants with similar structures and fewer side effects, culminating in the invention of fluoxetine (Prozac), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). A similar search had previously led to the synthesis of the first SSRI, zimelidine, from brompheniramine, also an antihistamine.
In 1975, diphenhydramine was still available only by prescription in the US and required medical supervision.

## Society and culture

### Marketing

Diphenhydramine is sold under the brand name Benadryl by McNeil Consumer Healthcare in the US, UK, Canada, and South Africa. Trade names in other countries include Dimedrol, Daedalon, Nytol, and Vivinox. It is also available as a generic medication.
Procter & Gamble markets an over-the-counter formulation of diphenhydramine as a sleep aid under the brand ZzzQuil.
Prestige Brands markets an over-the-counter formulation of diphenhydramine as a sleep aid in the US under the name Sominex.

### Cultural impact

Diphenhydramine is deemed to have limited abuse potential in the United States owing to its potentially serious side-effect profile and limited euphoric effects, and is not a controlled substance. Since 2002, the US FDA has required special labeling warning against the use of multiple products that contain diphenhydramine. In some jurisdictions, diphenhydramine is often present in postmortem specimens collected during investigation of sudden infant deaths; the drug may play a role in these events.
Diphenhydramine is among prohibited and controlled substances in the Republic of Zambia, and travelers are advised not to bring the drug into the country. Several Americans have been detained by the Zambian Drug Enforcement Commission for possession of Benadryl and other over-the-counter medications containing diphenhydramine.

#### Recreational use

Although diphenhydramine is widely used and generally considered to be safe for occasional usage, multiple cases of abuse and addiction have been documented. Because the drug is cheap and sold over the counter in most countries, adolescents without access to more sought-after illicit drugs are particularly at risk. People with mental health problems—especially those with schizophrenia—are also prone to abuse the drug, which may be self-administered in large doses to treat extrapyramidal symptoms caused by the use of antipsychotics.
Recreational users report calming effects, mild euphoria, and hallucinations as the desired effects of the drug. Research has shown that antimuscarinic agents, including diphenhydramine, "may have antidepressant and mood-elevating properties". A study conducted on adult males with a history of sedative abuse found that subjects who were administered a high dose (400 mg) of diphenhydramine reported a desire to take the drug again, despite also reporting negative effects, such as difficulty concentrating, confusion, tremors, and blurred vision.
In 2020, an Internet challenge emerged on the social media platform TikTok involving deliberately overdosing on diphenhydramine; dubbed the Benadryl challenge, the challenge encourages participants to consume dangerous amounts of Benadryl to film the resultant psychoactive effects and has been implicated in several hospitalisations and at least two deaths. An entity reported to have been seen by people while under the effects of diphenhydramine, known as the "Hat Man", has become an Internet meme and an urban legend.
