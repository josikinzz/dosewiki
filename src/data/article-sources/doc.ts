2,5-Dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine (DOC) is a psychedelic substituted alpha-methylated phenethylamine, a class of compounds commonly known as amphetamines. The phenethylamine equivalent of this substance (lacking the alpha-methyl group) is 2C-C.

This substance has no history of human usage prior to the 1991 publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in the book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved) by Alexander Shulgin. In modern times it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and described in his 1991 book.

In terms of its pharmacology, this substance acts as a selective 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist. Its psychedelic effects are thought to be mediated via its actions on the 5-HT2A receptor.

DOC is a highly dose sensitive psychedelic that is often sold on blotting paper and known for its strong visuals and intense body load. Many reports also indicate that the effects of this chemical may be overly intense for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics.

The DOC experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of DOC can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of DOC is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, DOC is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming, resulting in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging trippers to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most DOC trips.
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Vasoconstriction** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages but can be particularly uncomfortable.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of DOC is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation and a powerful enhancement of a person’s current mental state.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

DOC presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and unrealistic/ cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT or ayahuasca than that of LSD, 2C-B or 2C-I. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory states*

DOC and other substituted amphetamines produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, DOC is extremely high in imagery embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of DOC are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- Enhancements
- Distortions
- Hallucinations

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational DOC use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because DOC is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried DOC within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly but nothing can be completely guaranteed.

DOC is not physically addictive and many users experience a frequency self-regulating quality to the drug. Tolerance for DOC seems to be very mild and does not build up without repeated use over a short period of time.

**Legal Issues:**

- **Denmark:** DOC is a Schedule I drug.
- **Finland:** Possession, production and sale is illegal.
- **Israel:** Possession, production and sale is illegal.
- **New Zealand:** DOC is a Class C drug.
- **Poland:** DOC is not controlled in Poland and no analog law covers it.
- **Germany:** DOC is listed in Anlage I in Germany, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess without a license
- **Canada:** DOC is Schedule III in Canada, making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess without a license.
- **UK:** DOC is a Class A drug.
- **USA:** DOC is technically not scheduled in the United States, but could be considered an analogue of DOM or DOB and therefore a Schedule I drug.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, I was surprised at the extent to which DOC manifested positive cognitive alterations, hallucinatory states and a style of visual effects which is similar in appearance to mushrooms or 2C-E. The substances ability to maintain a level of stimulation which is not overly forceful makes it extremely useful for both psychonautic exploration and recreational events such as music festivals and raves.

## SYNTHESIS

## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 2.4 mg) âThis is what I might call an archetypical psychedelic. Everything is there in spades, with few if any of the subtle graces, the âgentle imagesâ and âgentle fantasiesâ of the 2-carbon phenethylamines. This is the works. There are visuals, and there are interpretive problems with knowing just where you really are. The place where nothing makes sense, and yet everything makes sense. I have just slept for a few hours, and now I am awake and it has been eighteen hours, and there is a lot still going on, although I have a relaxed, good feeling. Anyone who uses this had better have 24 hours at their disposal.â

(with 2.4 mg) âHere I am at the sixth hour, and I am still roaring along at a full plus three. I have established that this material is neither anti-erotic nor anorexic. The body is very comfortable, and so is the mind. There is an interesting aspect, perhaps peculiar only to this experiment and under these conditions. With my eyes closed the fantasy is a completely dark screen, lovely and seductive, subtle, and yet light must be deliberately brought in. This is not in any way negative for being in the dark, but is just unusual. I will have to try this in the daylight next time, to see what the eyes-closed brings to the mind-screen. At 24 hours, I have found that my sleep was not too great. My dreams were tight, and I kept defending against trouble; the nervous system was too alert. I was in a good humor, though, and I still am. This is excellent stuff, but start early in the day.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
In the making of this, by the procedures that have been followed in Canada, there are two chemical intermediates which might, some day, be looked at as potential psychedelics under their own colors. Reduction of the compound that is called DON in this Book II (2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitroamphetamine hydrochloride) with Pd/charcoal and hydrogen, gives the 4-amino derivative. This is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-aminoamphetamine dihydrochloride, DOA, which melts at 248â250 Â°C. And the reduction of an oxime intermediate gives rise to the acetamido analogue, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-acetamidoamphetamine hydrochloride, DOAA, with a mp of 249â250 Â°C. Neither compound has been tasted, but someday this omission will be corrected. DOA and DOAA have a sinister ring to them, however, and some changes of terminology might be needed. DOA, in the coronerâs vocabulary, means Dead-On-Arrival. But then, AMA (the American Medical Association) just happens to also mean (in the jargon of emergency medicine) Against-Medical-Advice. Everything averages out, somehow. Remember that the amyl homolog (amyl at the 4-position) follows the 4-letter convention of all of the DOM homologues, and has the code name of DOAM. Thus, DOA, amino; DOAA, acetamido, and DOAM, amyl.

One must learn to keep oneâs sense of humor. The immortal humorist Wavy Gravy once said, âIf you canât laugh at life, it just isnât funny anymore.â The code name of this compound, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine is, after, all, DOC. This should certainly appeal to some physicians.

**4-Chloro-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine** (also known as **DOC** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. It is a member of the [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) family of psychedelic amphetamines, which are known for their long duration and mixture of psychedelic and stimulant effects.

DOC was first synthesized by a team at the University of Alberta in 1972. However, its usage in humans was not popularized until the 1991 publication [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved") by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) . Preceding this, a 1989 forensic analysis of designer amphetamine samples identified DOC in Canadian drug seizures.

DOC is known as a highly dose-sensitive psychedelic that is often sold in powder form or on blotting paper and known for its long duration (over 12-24 hours), strong visual effects, a unique form of [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , and a significant body load.

Along with its sensitive dose-response and unusually long duration, many reports also suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely for those who are not already very experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . Therefore it is highly advised to approach this unusually dose-sensitive, and long-lasting [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if choosing to use it.

## History and culture

DOC was first synthesized by 1972 by Ronald Coutts and Jerry Malicky at the University of Alberta. While human usage was popularized by the 1991 publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved") by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , a 1989 forensic analysis of designer amphetamine samples identified DOC in Canadian drug seizures.

## Chemistry

DOC or 4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxy-amphetamine, is a molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Amphetamines are substituted phenethylamines containing a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and a methyl group bound to the alpha carbon R α . DOC contains methoxy functional groups OCH 3 attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 and a chlorine atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. DOC is the amphetamine analogue of the phenethylamine [2C-C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-C) .

DOC is a substituted alpha-methylated phenethylamine, a class of compounds commonly known as amphetamines. The phenethylamine equivalent (lacking the alpha-methyl group) is 2C-C. DOC has a stereocenter and ( *R* )-(−)-DOC is the more active stereoisomer.

## Pharmacology

DOC acts as a selective 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , and 5-HT 2C receptor partial agonist. Its psychedelic effects are mediated via its actions on the 5-HT 2A receptor.

DOC's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - DOC is usually reported to be extremely stimulating at levels which are capable of becoming uncomfortable and overwhelming. This can result in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging one to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) are generally sedating and relaxed. The type of stimulation is generally encouraged but can also present some forcefulness to it.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of DOC is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin, but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - It should be noted that this effect is not as reliably induced as it is with substances like stimulants or entactogens, and can just as easily manifest as physical discomfort without any apparent reason. DOC and other psychedelic amphetamines tend to lean towards physical dysphoria more so than other psychedelics.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at low to moderate levels throughout most DOC experiences.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the person has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages, but can be particularly uncomfortable when it manifests, and may persist throughout as well as after the main duration of the experience.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - This effect is more prominent than it is with other psychedelics like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rarely observed effect but is known to happen in those who are presumably predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, undernourished, overheated, or generally fatigued. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- The visuals of DOC are commonly described as being very simplistic, cartoon-like and linear, when compared to [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry encountered on DOC can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) than that of [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, synthetic in feel, structured in organization, brightly lit, multicolored in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equally rounded and angular in its corners, non-immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, this geometry is significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
DOC and other [substituted amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) produce a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more or less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , DOC is extremely high in internal hallucinations when approaching higher dosages. They are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensibly described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations)** - These are often present during the comedown and can include [shadow people](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Shadow_people) , among other indescribable beings. These external hallucinations are often lucid, interactive, autonomous, and robust. As [sleep deprivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation) and [stimulant psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant_psychosis) surface, a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) should accompany individuals sensitive to stimulants for the last part of the comedown. The visual effects of psychosis have been reported to blend into the psychedelic visuals around the 16-24 hour mark, sometimes accompanied by auditory hallucinations. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of DOC are described by many as characterized as prominent mental stimulation combined with a powerful amplification of the user's current mental state. The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect is not as common at low to moderate doses and is less likely to occur when the basic rules of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are taken into account. It should be noted that this inconsistently induced effect is seemingly more likely to manifest when used with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . This combination should be used with extreme caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics, meaning that the user should adequately pace themselves with a fraction of their usual amount. It is commonly reported that psychedelics can to a certain extent counteract some of the perceived mental cloudiness or intoxicating effects of THC causing the user to in turn use more cannabis than is needed which can often lead to an overwhelmingly anxious and paranoid headspace which can trigger a ["bad trip"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) .
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is typically manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others, and only at lower, non-impairing doses. These feelings of sociability, affection, and empathy tend to be weaker and less consistent than those produced by substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , but can still prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and [outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) dominant.
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - This can manifest prominently during a DOC experience, particularly during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) phase, often resulting in bouts of uncontrollable giggles and laughter that can form a feedback loop if around others who are also under the influence.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)** - While DOC is technically able to produce states of ego dissolution, it tends to more often than not develop only in extremely high doses, with grave physical and mental side effects being apparent and is often of a terrifying nature.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience for those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DOC use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying DOC by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

Medical literature reports multiple physical complications associated with the use of DOC. An individual's cause of death was reported as DOC toxicity and confirmed with GC-MS in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology. Seizures have been associated with the use of DOC in another medical journal.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

DOC is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of DOC is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DOC presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of DOC all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

The risk of a DOx overdose is present starting in or past the heavy dose range with sensitive people, or when a DOx is mixed with other substances, particularly [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) . Non-oral routes also seem to exhibit a higher chance of overdosing, perhaps owing to differences in bioavailability, potency and unpredictability of dosage and effects. The effects of a DOx overdose typically include bizarre, [delusional](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) and sometimes violent behavior, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) . The user may not be able to communicate and can be severely agitated. At appropriately high doses, more serious side effects such as [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) which in turn further affect a dangerously [elevated heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) may occur. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Severe vasoconstriction typically develops to its peak several hours into the intoxication and may require medical assistance if blood flow is significantly cut off for extended periods of time.

In the event of an overdose, [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can be administered to mitigate the hyperagitative effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] A powerful vasodilator may also need to be administered to prevent a hypertensive emergency, or in more serious cases, necrosis, organ failure and death from the resulting hypoxia. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] As a result, emergency medical services should always be sought in the event of a DOx overdose.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of DOC. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

  "tripsit-wiki": `# DOx

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOx*

**DOx** is a chemical class of substituted amphetamines that persists of many long lasting and very potent psychedelic drugs.
DOx not only includes [DOB](/index.php?title=DOB&action=edit&redlink=1), [DOC](/index.php?title=DOC&action=edit&redlink=1), [DOI](/index.php?title=DOI&action=edit&redlink=1) and [DOM](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM), but also as number of lesser known substances, such as the [Aleph](/index.php?title=Aleph&action=edit&redlink=1) and [TMA](/index.php?title=TMA&action=edit&redlink=1) series.
Almost all substances of the DOx series have a very long duration (12-30 hours), are extremely potent (active at just a few miligrams) and have a very slow onset.
They're often described as less spiritual and more stimulating compared to classic psychedelics.

## History

The DOx series was first researched by Alexander and Ann Shulgin, who rated [DOM](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM) as one of the most important phenethylamine compounds, the so called "magical half-dozen", in their book PiHKAL.
The most popular substance of this class is [DOM](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM), also known as STP (Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace), which first appeared in tablet form in 1967.
As of 2014, drugs of the DOx series are sometimes mistakenly sold as "acid" on blotters, and once again [DOM](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM) is the most widespread compound among users of psychedelic amphetamines.

## Effects

### Postive

- Mood lift, euphoria, sense of well being

- Tactile sensations

- Introspection

- Increased empathy, love and sociability

- Visuals

### Neutral

- Stimulation

- Time distortion

### Negative

- Nausea

- Vasoconstriction

- Anxiety, restlessness, confusion

- Insomnia

## Harm Reduction

Due to DOx' nature as substituted amphetamines, they pose some risk as  potent stimulants; take similar harm reduction precautions as one would  on [stimulants](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Stimulants).

See [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for general information.

### WARNING

DOx compounds have a very long duration and also a long comeup, redosing is not recommended, as it may take multiple hours to peak.

### Potentiators

- [Cannabis](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Cannabis)

### Interactions

Check out our [Drug Combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_Combinations) page and chart for interactions and combinations of common drugs.

Under no circumstances any DOx compound should be combined with a MAOI.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

DOx is a chemical class of substituted amphetamine derivatives featuring methoxy groups at the 2- and 5-positions of the phenyl ring, and a substituent such as alkyl or halogen at the 4- position of the phenyl ring. The compounds of this class are  potent and long-lasting psychedelic drugs, and act as highly selective 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonists.

## Legal status

Most substances of the DOx class are controlled substances in almost every country. DOC and DOI are unscheduled in the US and a few other countries.

  "wikipedia": `# 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,5-Dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine*

2,5-Dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine (DOC) is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and DOx families. It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Analogues of DOC include 2C-C, DOB, DOI, DOM, among others.
DOC was first described in the scientific literature by Ronald Coutts and Jerry Malicky in 1973. Subsequently, it was described in greater detail by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). Recreational availability and use of DOC are rare. The drug is expected to become a controlled substance in the United States in the near future as of 2025.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists DOC's dose as 1.5 to 3 mg orally and its duration as 12 to 24 hours. The effects of DOC have been reported to include closed-eye imagery, visuals, introspection, lightheadedness, disconnectedness, and spaciness, among others. In one of the reports, it was described as an "archetypical psychedelic", with the full spectrum of psychedelic effects. This was contrasted with 2C psychedelics, which were described as more subtle and gentle.

## Toxicity

Very little data exists about the toxicity of DOC. In April 2013, a case of death due to DOC was reported. The source does not specify whether the drug alone caused the death. In 2014, a death was reported in which DOC was directly implicated as the sole causative agent in the death of a user. The autopsy indicated pulmonary edema and a subgaleal hemorrhage.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

#### Actions

DOC acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor agonist. Its psychedelic effects are mediated via its actions on the 5-HT2A receptor.
The drug is inactive as a monoamine releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor.

#### Effects

DOC produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents.
DOC has shown reinforcing effects, including conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration, in rodents similarly to methamphetamine. This is analogous to other findings in which various 2C and NBOMe drugs have been found to produce dopaminergic elevations and reinforcing effects in rodents. Conversely however, in contrast to amphetamines like (−)-cathinone but similarly to mescaline, DOM has shown no stimulant-like or reinforcing effects in rhesus monkeys.

## Chemistry

DOC is a substituted α-methylated phenethylamine, a class of compounds commonly known as amphetamines. The phenethylamine equivalent (lacking the α-methyl group) is 2C-C. DOC has a stereocenter and (R)-(−)-DOC is the more active stereoisomer.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DOC has been described.

### Detection

DOC may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma DOC concentrations are expected to be in a range of 1–10 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >20 μg/L in intoxicated patients and >100 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage.

### Analogues

Analogues of DOC include DOB, DOI, 2C-C, DODC, and ZDCM-04, among others.

## History

DOC was first described in the scientific literature by Ronald Coutts and Jerry Malicky in 1973. Subsequently, it was described in greater detail by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved).

## Society and culture

### Popularity

Although rare on the black market, it has been available in bulk and shipped worldwide by select elite "Grey Market" Research Chemical suppliers for several years. Sales of DOC on blotting paper and in capsules was reported in late 2005 and again in late 2007. According to the DEA's Microgram from December 2007, the Concord Police Department in Contra Costa County, California, in the US, seized "a small piece of crudely lined white blotter paper without any design, suspected LSD 'blotter acid'". They added "Unusually, the paper appeared to be hand-lined using two pens, in squares measuring approximately 6 x 6 millimeters. The paper displayed fluorescence when irradiated at 365 nanometers; however, color testing for LSD with para-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (Ehrlich's reagent) was negative. Analysis of a methanol extract by GC/MS indicated not LSD but rather DOC (not quantitated but a high loading based on the TIC)". DOC is sometimes misrepresented as LSD by unscrupulous dealers. This is particularly dangerous, as DOC is not known to have the safety profile of LSD. It can be particularly unsafe, in comparison to LSD, for those suffering from hypertension, as amphetamine compounds are known to cause sharp increases in systolic blood pressure.

### Legal status

#### International

In December 2019, the UNODC announced scheduling recommendations placing DOC into Schedule I alongside another several research chemicals.

#### Australia

Unscheduled but can be controlled as schedule II as an analogue of DOB.

#### Canada

Listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine. The CDSA was updated as a result of the Safe Streets Act changing amphetamines from Schedule 3 to Schedule 1.

#### China

As of October 2015 DOC is a controlled substance in China.

#### Denmark

Denmark added DOC to the list of Schedule I controlled substances as of 8.4.2007.

#### Germany

Scheduled in Anlage I since 22.1.2010.

#### New Zealand

Scheduled.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdag added DOC to schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as narcotics in Sweden as of Aug 30, 2007,  published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2007:10 listed as DOC, 4-klor-2,5-dimetoxi-amfetamin.
DOC was first classified by Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Jul 1, 2004,  in their regulation SFS 2004:486 listed as 4-klor-2,5-dimetoxiamfetamin (DOC).

#### United Kingdom

Class A.

#### United States

DOC is not scheduled or controlled at the federal level in the United States, but the Department of Justice considers it to be an analogue of DOB and, as such, possession or sale could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act. In December 2023, the US Drug Enforcement Administration issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would classify both 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine as schedule I controlled substances.
In the United States, the analogues DMA, DOB, and DOM are Schedule I controlled substances.
