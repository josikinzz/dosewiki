### INTENSITY

3 to 8 for most experiences.

### MATERIAL

Mescaline is a naturally occurring
psychedelic found in several cactus species, most notably, Peyote (Lophophora
williamsii) and San Pedro (Trichocereus pachanoi). Several other
members of the trichocereus family also contain mescaline.
Mescaline belongs to a family of compounds
known as phenethylamines, making it quite distinct from the other major
psychedelics which belong to the indole family. LSD, psilocybin, harmaline,
and DMT are all indoles. Many synthetic "designer" psychedelics, such as
ecstasy (MDMA) and 2C-B, are phenethylamines, and are related to the chemistry
of mescaline.
In addition to containing mescaline,
the cacti mentioned above contain a large variety of related psychoactive
compounds, and will produce experiences that are qualitatively different
than pure mescaline. The experience produced by Peyote is also quite distinct
from that produced by cacti from the trichocereus family.
The literature I've read indicates
that many members of the trichocereus family are psychoactive. I've only
tried three or four of these and found them to be basically equal in potency.
Many references indicate that one variety, Trichocereus peruvianus,
is several times as potent by weight as the other trichocereus species.
Psychoactive species include:
T. bridgesii, T. cuzcoensis, T.
fulvinanus, T. macrogonus, T. pachanoi, T. peruvianus, T. taquimbalensis,
T. tersheckii, T. validus, T. werdermannius.
### HISTORY

Peyote and San Pedro are New World
psychedelics. In ancient times their use was concentrated in the regions
to which they are native. Peyote was used throughout Mexico to as far north
as Texas, San Pedro in the Andes mountain region of South America. The
earliest known depiction of San Pedro cactus is on a stone tablet found
in Peru dating to 1300 B.C. Ritual objects containing images of Peyote
have been found dating back to 500 B.C. The introduction of Peyote into
the U.S. and Canada, and its use by North American Indian tribes, occurred
much more recently, beginning sometime in the late 1800s.
As with mushrooms, the Roman Catholic
church tried to abolish the use of Peyote and San Pedro. However, they
were only partially successful. Peyote use spread from Mexico to North
America, and the Native American Church was formed in 1918 to preserve
Native Americans' right to use Peyote. And with San Pedro, the ceremony
practiced by many South American shamans continued while incorporating
several Christian symbols into the rituals. The name of a Christian saint
was even adopted for the cactus.
Mescaline was the first psychedelic
compound to be extracted and isolated, which occurred in 1896. In 1919
it became the first psychedelic to be synthesized. For the next 35 years
it remained a somewhat obscure compound known primarily to the psychiatric
community. In 1953 the popular novelist Aldous Huxley read about mescaline.
Soon thereafter Huxley tried mescaline, and brought it to the attention
of the public by writing The Doors of Perception.
Today, natives throughout North America
still perform sacred Peyote rituals. In South America shamans continue
to hold traditional San Pedro ceremonies which are associated with healing,
imparting or counteracting witchcraft, and putting one in touch with supernatural
and divinatory powers. A claim frequently heard about the San Pedro experience
is that the user embarks on a flight of a telepathic nature being transported
across time and space. A user who embarks on this "astral journey" may
perceive events happening in distant parts of the world, or in metaphysical
realms. This flight phenomenon, which I have not encountered in my experience
with San Pedro, may result from solanaceous plants which are frequently
included in the San Pedro brew and contain the Belladonna alkaloids.
### SOURCES

In the U.S. Peyote is illegal for
all but members of the Native American Church, and it is seldom seen in
the psychedelic underground. Apparently there is even becoming a shortage
for the Native American population, since the cactus grows at a very slow
rate. A typical 2" diameter Peyote button may require 20 years to reach
that size, and it has been harvested much faster than it can grow for many
years.
Synthetic or pure crystalline mescaline
is one of the rarest psychedelics, and misrepresentation of other substances
as being mescaline is very common. I've only come across true synthetic
mescaline once in my life, but have seen items ranging from LSD to DOB
(a relative of 2C-B) being sold as mescaline several times.
Illegal drug labs rarely produce mescaline
for the underground market because of its inefficiency, high cost, and
lack of a market. It requires approximately 1/2 gram of mescaline sulfate
to produce a psychedelic trip. This same amount of material would represent
4 doses of ecstasy, 20 doses of 2C-B, 50 doses of psilocin, or 2500 doses
of LSD. And without the large market of substances like ecstasy, smaller,
less efficient batches must be produced, raising the cost of production
even higher. The small amount of mescaline that is produced for the psychedelic
underground typically fetches from \$100 to \$200 per gram, (\$50 to \$100
per dose), clearly too expensive to become a popular street drug.
Mescaline sulfate can be distinguished
by the structure of its crystals. These are approximately 1/4" long and
look like fine needles or shards of glass. The amount of mescaline needed
for a high can fill two double 0 gelatin caps. Those who claim they've
had mescaline in tiny microdot pills, or as a white powder in a capsule
where only 1/8th of a gram produced a powerful experience, have been given
something other than real mescaline. Another form of mescaline which I've
never tried, mescaline hydrochloride, is said to be about 25% more potent
than mescaline sulfate.
The most readily available source of
mescaline is trichocereus cacti which can be found in many large nurseries,
particularly ones that deal exclusively in cacti and succulents. I tend
to buy only from nurseries that mark their cacti with the botanical names,
and try to avoid asking for psychoactive cacti by name. I was quite blown
out when a redneck cacti wholesaler responded to my request for Trichocereus
peruvianus with "That's supposed to be a high alkaloidal content cactus,
I don't know if that's the reason you're looking for it." Another cacti
wholesaler sold me an unmarked cactus claiming it to be T. peruvianus.
It was psychoactive, but no more so than other trichocereus species
I've tried.
If the cacti sellers do not know people
are buying their cacti for psychoactive purposes it is less likely to become
an issue with the authorities. And since this magical plant is one of my
favorite "legal" highs, I'd like to see it remain legal and available indefinitely.
Trichocereus cacti are considered legal for ornamental purposes only. It
is illegal to ingest, extract, or sell for psychoactive purposes: a fairly
gray area of the law.
Before going cactus shopping I've found
it useful to look at pictures and read physical descriptions of these varieties.
Many large libraries will have a selection of books on cacti and possibly
lexicons. Most varieties of trichocereus are difficult to tell apart, and
I've even seen conflicting information in the keys of lexicons. However,
these books should at least give one an idea of which cacti to examine
the name tags on. These cacti are also frequently available from various
herb and plant dealers that cater to the underground.
### DOSAGE and PREPARATION

The amount of mescaline sulfate required
for a full experience is about 500 mg. (or approximately 350 mg. of mescaline
hydrochloride) Pure mescaline should be taken in two half-doses about 30
minutes apart. This will minimize disturbance of the stomach, which usually
passes after the first couple hours of the high. When consuming whole cacti
one is actually taking a combination of alkaloids which synergistically
interact with each other, producing an experience which is different, and
sometimes more desirable, than pure mescaline.
The potency of Peyote, as well as different
people's tolerance to it, seems to vary widely. Some people report powerful
experiences from as few as three or four Peyote buttons. More often users
consume 12 to 15 buttons, and eating more than two dozen is not unheard
of. The amount of San Pedro one must consume to obtain the full effects
is a piece approximately 10" long and 3" in diameter. Cactus is most potent
when harvested during the hotter times of the year.
Trichocereus cacti are relatively quick
growing and easy to make cuttings of. Each plant may produce one or more
highs worth per year. When harvesting these cacti the top four inches of
growing tip can be cut off to be replanted. A length from beneath this
can then be cut to consume. The remaining cactus stub will also continue
to grow, frequently putting out several branches where it was cut off.
The tip cutting should be laid on its side in the sun until the exposed
flesh calluses. Once this has occurred, it should be placed upright in
a half soil/half sand mixture with good drainage. When cutting the lower,
consumable section of the cactus, care should be taken to cut at an angle,
going upwards toward the middle of the plant. The fleshy part of the cactus
will shrink in where it was cut, and if cut straight across it will form
a bowl that will hold water and tend to mold.
To prepare San Pedro for consumption
I first cut out the spines, which is fairly easy to do on most trichocereus.
The next step I take is to cut the skin off in "V" strips, cutting from
the outside of each rib into the central section of the cactus. These "V"
strips are saved as they contain the most potent flesh, although the skin
itself is thick, waxy and not edible.
The process of eating San Pedro is
definitely not fun. It can be tolerated by most serious trippers, but it
is difficult to consume enough cactus to get a powerful high. The taste
of different trichocereus species ranges from very bitter to tasteless,
the varieties with less taste tending to have a slimy consistency. With
these varieties the texture is the main obstacle to consuming large quantities.
I chew the cactus to a pulp and then wash it down with some liquid. It
also helps to eat some full-grain bread as I'm doing this to soak up the
liquid in my stomach.
The dark green flesh next to the skin
is the most potent part of the cactus and should be eaten first. I do this
by flattening out the "V" strips and scraping the flesh off of the skin
with my teeth. I then proceed to the central part of the cactus. This should
be eaten around like corn on the cob. The flesh on the protruding ribs
should be eaten first. The core is woody and not edible. The high begins
coming on some 45 minutes after ingesting, and since it takes a while to
consume the cactus, one may start feeling high while they are still eating.
The psychoactive alkaloids can also
be extracted using water or alcohol. To extract in water one needs to mash
the cactus and boil for several hours. One friend reports excellent results
by boiling just the skin with 3/8" of flesh attached to it, evaporating
off all the liquid at about 140 degrees F, and then powderizing the resulting
residue and packing it in gelatin capsules.
Peyote is even more difficult to eat
than San Pedro as the taste is extremely bitter. Some people find that
by accepting the flavor and not cringing from it they are able to get past
any aversion to eating it. One friend even told me that dried Peyote took
on the flavor and consistency of good chocolate. However, those like myself
who find the taste intolerable can pulverize the dried buttons and pack
them into gelatin capsules.
### THE HIGH

The mescaline experience is my favorite
of the traditional psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline). I find it
has the advantages of acid: a lucid, penetrating, focused ability of the
mind, rather than the more dreamy, drifting state I get from mushrooms.
However, I feel totally relaxed with mescaline, even calmer than I feel
on mushrooms, and there's no trace of the metallic edge usually felt on
acid.
Eating whole cactus produces a more
body-oriented high than pure mescaline. San Pedro usually produces a very
smooth, flowing experience. However, the effects of Peyote are quite different
due to its unique mixture of alkaloids. With Peyote, the first couple hours
of the experience are very dream-like, drifting, almost a delirium type
state. During this time I feel groggy and sleepy and can do little more
than lay back and sink into the feeling, which is not unpleasant. Some
element of Peyote also acts as an emetic, making most people nauseous about
two hours into the trip.
I find the mescaline experience to
be more visual than mushrooms or acid. However, I've only experienced really
spectacular visuals when using synthetic mescaline. My high tolerance to
most psychedelics, along with the capacity of my stomach, has prevented
me from ever being as high as I would have liked when eating whole cactus.
Like psilocybin, mescaline tends to link me with collective evolutionary
consciousness more than synthetics like LSD. The experiences produced by
these natural psychedelics seem more "significant" than an acid high, which
is more analytical. An acid high often seems to be a by-product of magnifying
the mind, whereas with mushrooms and cactus one feels they are in touch
with something ancient, spiritual, and personal. Mescaline has a unique
signature in this context which I find most magical, a feeling that the
Gods or protective allies are smiling down on me. The duration can be 6
to 14 hours depending on the amount consumed. The "coming back" portion
of a mescaline trip is smoother than with the other traditional psychedelics.
And I've never felt the "drained of energy" or "neural overload" feeling
that can come after an intense acid trip. This allows for a more conscious
and therapeutic return to regular consciousness, after which I can easily
sink into sleep and wake up feeling refreshed.
Some aspects of the mescaline high
are quite distinct from LSD or mushrooms. The visions produced by mescaline
have a different character and structure. When being overtaken by a full
strength mescaline trip, I've felt more than with any traditional psychedelic
that I was an extraterrestrial being, immersing myself in new sensory phenomena
for the first time. Where LSD or psilocybin heighten and clarify the sense
of hearing, mescaline produces auditory hallucinations, heightening the
hearing sense but also causing sounds to be quite different than normal.
Mescaline also sharpens the olfactory sense to a much finer degree than
LSD or psilocybin. I've particularly noted this in my ability to perceive
the smells of numerous different plants when using synthetic mescaline
outdoors. As for aphrodisiacal use of mescaline, wow!, it brought energies
out of me that I never knew I had.
At the conclusion of this chapter is
one of my favorite descriptions of a psychedelic experience. It illustrates
the depth and spiritual significance that a mescaline experience can produce.
This is a description of a Peyote experience which Bernard Roseman undertook
with members of the Native American Church in the late l950s. It was published
in The Peyote Story, Wilshire Book Company, 1963.
### COMBINATIONS

The Belladonna alkaloids are reputed
to potentiate mescaline. I haven't tried this.
Mescaline may be significantly intensified
and possibly dangerous if combined with MAO inhibitors.
Bernard Roseman from The Peyote Story
The only mind that strayed from the meeting
was my own. The resounding drum thundered throughout my being. I could
not distinguish the hogan from the interior of my own skull. I drifted
further away from the meeting until I was completely unaware of sounds
or the presence of others. I walked over to a huge velvet curtain and as
I touched it, it slowly parted...
On the other side a magnificent world
sprang up. This world was sprinkled with little shining crystals, and the
absolute silence lent itself to a silent song that continued without an
apparent end. Little droplets of pure molten silver were falling from the
heavens, and each blending of non-existent sound had blended to become
the purest light. Each sight in this most magnificent of worlds represented
infinite perfection. A sharp knife-like distinction separated each spectacle
from all others.
All about were the most perfect cogs,
too perfect to be known in my everyday world. These cogs were spinning
in opposing direction to one another, with no other purpose than BEING.
The universe was enclosed in a huge round dome and contained millions of
replicas of the same world, each representing a different plane of consciousness.
These worlds were forever missing each
other by inches; and as I mentally moved them up a degree where they met
and formed the one complete world, the state of perfect order became. I
laughed at my former prejudices and what I had considered to be sin in
myself and others. I saw all this as being my own manifestations, and only
my considering it sin had made it so.
I was living in a timeless pulsation
that bridged the gap between all barriers. I reached many eternities, and
felt akin with infinity. At long last I knew the relation all things had
for one another!
All objects seemed to be complete in
themselves; as I searched the depth of an object I would see many worlds
buried in it. And as I examined each world, I saw that each had objects
of its own which were seen as worlds and objects endlessly. Everything
had a new interest for me, for everything was continuously in flux, and
each new thing became newer than it was the instant before.
All my senses merged and acted as one
as they caressed and encompassed everything they perceived. A thousand
sense feelings closed in upon me, stirring up within waves of climaxes
that kept sending my mind to even greater, undreamed-of heights. The beginning
was forgotten and no end was in sight. I had arrived back to the place
of my origin. As each mystery exposed its true nature to me, each revelation
was accompanied by vast explosions of vibratory color, flowing liquid blending
perfectly together to form a sea of radiant beauty.
A consummation of me, my purpose and
creator unfolded and seethed to further heights undreamed of; a tremendous
upsurge of blissful emotion poured its intention into a tiny shell that
expanded larger and larger. It reached its unbearable breaking point, and
then release as the shell burst and a huge burning white flower grew bigger
and bigger at a slow unceasing rate; the petals reached out to their fullest
extreme, and then closed at the same unceasing rate, to rest...
I continued to float in this heaven
of satisfaction and contentment for an immeasurable time. Then far off
in the distance I heard a thunderous sound which vibrated my world of infinite
color; the sound became louder, and I was wisked backwards through the
velvet curtain of confusion once again.
As I returned to the hogan I saw myself
as a huge magnet and all my worldly emotions and attachments as being small
iron shavings
and at the instant of returning these
shavings sprang up, charging in on me, until I was once again a victim
of sense objects and emotions. I reluctantly opened my eyes and saw the
Indians across from me still singing and chanting. Tears formed in my eyes
and I realized the world that someday awaits my return. A peace descended
over me that I was heretofore not familiar with, and I recognized it as
being the peace that descends when life transcends to death.
I looked about me and felt more Indian
than white as I was carried along in the rhythm of the chants as we gave
our combined thanks to Pioniyo.`,

## Subjective Experience

The san pedro cactus has been in continuous spiritual and medicinal use in Peru for
over 3,000 years. This even survived post Spanish Conquest attempts to suppress it.

I had originally booked a San Pedro Experience whilst I was on my ayahuasca
mission, but I was far too ill to proceed (due to a mixture of altitude sickness and a
bug I imported from the UK). I did, however, benefit from a detailed introduction to
this remarkable cactus, and its shamanic use, as the organizer was generous enough
to spend time with me and provide a degree of education.

The psychoactive part of the cactus is layered just inside the skin. Apparently, this is
scraped off, and then dried and turned to powder. I have also seen this sold on the
markets as “chips”, which are simply cut from the plant.

Regarding dosage, I researched this heavily, particularly online, but with little joy. To
put it mildly, the forums were all over the place: some posters cited modest amounts;
others suggested doses which bordered on the ludicrous. It was very hard to find any
real consensus.

I therefore asked the vendor, which was tricky given that this was sold as “not for
human consumption”. However, through various coded messages, I eventually got
there: 25g should be sufficient for a first dose.

This did seem to be sensible, and looking at toxicity data for mescaline, it wouldn’t
create undue risk. I therefore placed this measure into a large mug, and poured
boiling water upon it. I stirred occasionally.

Over the next half hour I sipped this slowly. It was revolting, but I had tasted worse. I
then sat back and waited, not really expecting too much. My pessimism was wholly
misplaced.

Soon, I was flying high, and I knew that I was still coming-up. At one point I felt
momentary alarm, wondering how far this would go. Fortunately this passed as the
mescaline pulled me along with a significant mood lift. I knew I was tripping hard.

My expectation had been set by the many posts across social media, and substantially
by those who claimed similarity with LSD. So was it really like LSD?

Yes and no. It was certainly LSDish in broad terms, with similar visuals, general
headspace and so forth, but there were real differences. It did seem to be more
natural although I have to accept that knowing that this was a botanical could have
influenced this perception. The wave I felt myself riding felt richer in nature, and the
euphoric edge felt more intense.

The nausea I had anticipated didn’t materialize, which was a bonus. The bottom line
was that I really enjoyed it. It was intense, it was compelling, and it was profound. It
was a ride I was not expecting. I was floating for hours, well into +++ territory.

In terms of recording the trip I was ill prepared, as I had expected merely to scratch
the surface: hence the brevity of this report. This in no way does justice to this
remarkable cactus.

I fully intend to repeat this exercise, as I feel certain that it has much to offer in terms
of personal development.

## Effects
Before the effect sets in, nausea and/or vomiting can often occur. Hot and cold flushes as well as sweating and dizziness may also occur. These side effects usually subside after a while. The trip begins with hyperactivity and inner restlessness, followed by altered, sharpened perception and intensified colour vision. In a second phase, a more meditative concentration occurs. Users report visions and a euphoria of religious depth, the feeling of a visionary experience and the change of ego sensation as well as feelings of ego dissolution.

## Dosage
The mescaline content can vary greatly from plant to plant.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The pharmacological effect of mescaline and the bitter taste usually lead to nausea and vomiting in the initial phase of the trip. Mescaline is toxic in high doses (from approx. 2 g) and can lead to liver damage and respiratory paralysis. Other side effects may include an increase in pulse and blood pressure, initially dry mouth, then increased salivation, pupil enlargement, increase in body temperature and a reduced feeling of hunger during the period of effect. During vomiting, users may choke on the vomit (danger of choking!).

### Long-term Risks
The use of mescaline can trigger latent (hidden) mental disorders even with single use.

## Safer Use
- Mescaline is not suitable as a party drug and should only be used by experienced users.
- Use mescaline only if you are well prepared and in an environment where you feel comfortable. Use mescaline only in the presence of friends who are experienced users (good setting) and/or a sober person (tripsitter).
- Only use mescaline when you feel good mentally and physically (good set).
- You should have respect but not fear for the mescaline effect.
- Mescaline should be taken on an empty stomach. Fasting before the trip may help to reduce the likelihood of nausea and vomiting.
- For nausea, it helps if you take mescaline in small doses at a time.
- Don't add to it if it doesn't work right away.
- Let yourself go during the trip, don't try to fight the effects of mescaline. A trip sitter can help you with this.
- Dextrose can help against circulatory problems.
- Avoid roads and other "dangerous" places. Your orientation may be disturbed.
- Drink enough water during the trip.
- Mixed use of this potent substance should be avoided at all costs, as the effect can then no longer be assessed.
- Plan enough time for recovery after the trip (at least 1 day)!
- Mescaline trips should remain exceptional experiences and should in no case be experienced more than once a month.
- People with mental problems or illnesses, people taking neuroleptics and people with circulatory and heart problems should refrain from using mescaline.

  "wikipedia": `# Mescaline
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mescaline*

Mescaline, also known as mescalin or mezcalin, and in chemical terms 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine, is a naturally occurring psychedelic protoalkaloid of the substituted phenethylamine class, found in cacti like peyote (Lophophora williamsii) and San Pedro (certain species of the genus Echinopsis) and known for its serotonergic hallucinogenic effects.
Mescaline is typically taken orally and used recreationally, spiritually, and medically, with psychedelic effects occurring at doses from 100 to 1,000 mg, including microdosing below 75 mg, and it can be consumed in pure form or via mescaline-containing cacti. Mescaline induces a psychedelic experience characterized by vivid visual patterns, altered perception of time and self, synesthesia, and spiritual effects, with an onset of 0.5 to 0.9 hours and a duration that increases with dose, ranging from about 6 to 14 hours. Ketanserin blocks mescaline’s psychoactive effects, and while it's unclear if mescaline is metabolized by monoamine oxidase enzymes, preliminary evidence suggests harmala alkaloids may potentiate its effects.
Mescaline primarily acts as a partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, with varying affinity and efficacy across multiple serotonin, adrenergic, dopamine, histamine, muscarinic, and trace amine receptors, but shows low affinity for most non-serotonergic targets. It is a relatively hydrophilic psychedelic compound structurally related to catecholamines but acting on the serotonergic system, first synthesized in 1919, with numerous synthetic methods and potent analogues developed since. Mescaline occurs naturally in various cacti species, with concentrations varying widely, and is biosynthesized in plants from phenylalanine via catecholamine pathways likely linked to stress responses.
Mescaline-containing cacti use dates back over 6,000 years. Peyote was studied scientifically in the 19th and 20th centuries, culminating in the isolation of mescaline as its primary psychoactive compound, legal recognition of its religious use, and ongoing exploration of its therapeutic potential. Mescaline is largely illegal worldwide, though exceptions exist for religious, scientific, or ornamental use, and it has influenced many notable cultural figures through its psychoactive effects. Very few studies concerning mescaline's activity and potential therapeutic effects in people have been conducted since the early 1970s.

## Use and effects

Mescaline is used recreationally, spiritually (as an entheogen), and medically. It is typically taken orally. The drug is used as a psychedelic at doses of 100 to 1,000 mg orally. Low doses are 100 to 200 mg, an intermediate or "good effect" dose is 500 mg, and a high or ego-dissolution dose is 1,000 mg. Microdosing involves the use of subthreshold mescaline doses of less than 75 mg. In addition to pure form, mescaline is used in the form of mescaline-containing cacti such as peyote and San Pedro.
The onset of the effects of mescaline given orally is 0.5 to 0.9 hours on average with a range of 0.1 to 2.7 hours. Its effects peak after 1.9 to 4.0 hours with a range of 0.5 to 8.0 hours. The duration of mescaline appears to be dose-dependent, varying from 6.4 hours on average (range 3.0–10 hours) at a dose of 100 mg, 9.7 to 11 hours on average (range 5.6–22 hours) at moderate doses of 300 to 500 mg, and 14 hours on average (range 7.2–22 hours) at a dose of 800 mg.
Mescaline induces a psychedelic state comparable to those produced by LSD and psilocybin, but with unique characteristics. Subjective effects may include altered thinking processes, an altered sense of time and self-awareness, and closed- and open-eye visual phenomena. In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin comprehensively described the effects of mescaline based on a collection of experience reports. Its effects included brightened colors, increased visual contrast, open-eye visuals like colors and patterns, pareidolia, increased significance of objects, enhanced music appreciation, feeling intoxicated, self-analysis, insights, increased body awareness, feelings of joy, happiness, and peacefulness, feeling hyper and energized, feelings of empathy, things feeling ridiculous, humor and laughter, religious feelings, restlessness, social discomfort and avoidance, and nausea, among others. Mescaline was one of Shulgin's "magical half-dozen" psychedelic compounds in PiHKAL.
Prominence of color with mescaline is distinctive, appearing brilliant and intense. Recurring visual patterns observed during the mescaline experience include stripes, checkerboards, angular spikes, multicolor dots, and very simple fractals that turn very complex. The English writer Aldous Huxley described these self-transforming amorphous shapes as like animated stained glass illuminated from light coming through the eyelids in his autobiographical book The Doors of Perception (1954). Like LSD, mescaline induces distortions of form and kaleidoscopic experiences but they manifest more clearly with eyes closed and under low lighting conditions. Heinrich Klüver coined the term "cobweb figure" in the 1920s to describe one of the four form constant geometric visual hallucinations experienced in the early stage of a mescaline trip: "Colored threads running together in a revolving center, the whole similar to a cobweb". The other three are the chessboard design, tunnel, and spiral. Klüver wrote that "many 'atypical' visions are upon close inspection nothing but variations of these form-constants." An unusual but unique characteristic of mescaline use is the "geometrization" of three-dimensional objects. The object can appear flattened and distorted, similar to the presentation of a Cubist painting.
According to a study in the Netherlands, ceremonial San Pedro use seems to be characterized by relatively strong spiritual experiences, and low incidence of challenging experiences.

## Side effects

Side effects of mescaline include fatigue, weakness, impaired concentration, restlessness, tension, anxiety, panic, and social discomfort and avoidance, headache, pupil dilation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, trembling, discomfort, feeling hot or cold, palpitations, chest and neck pains, shortness of breath, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and increased body temperature, among others. In addition to its psychoactive effects, mescaline elicits a pattern of sympathetic arousal, with the peripheral nervous system being a major target for this substance. Rarely, in susceptible individuals such as people with a family history of schizophrenia, mescaline may cause psychosis.

### Tolerance

Mescaline is associated with rapid tolerance development, including cross-tolerance with other psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin. This tolerance is apparent within a few days and resets after 3 or 4 days of abstinence.

## Overdose

In terms of extrapolated human lethal dose based on animal studies and human case reports, the lethal dose of mescaline relative to a typical recreational dose is estimated to be 24-fold. The LD50 of mescaline has also been determined in various animal species, with the values including 212 to 315 mg/kg i.p. in mice, 132 to 410 mg/kg i.p. in rats, 328 mg/kg i.p. in guinea pigs, 54 mg/kg in dogs, and 130 mg/kg i.v. in rhesus macaques. It has been said based on the animal data that it would be very difficult to consume enough mescaline to cause death in humans.

## Interactions

The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin has been found to block the psychoactive effects of mescaline.
It is unclear whether mescaline is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes or whether monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) might increase the effects of mescaline. However, there are preliminary reports that harmala alkaloids, which are reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs), may potentiate the effects of mescaline in humans, and the combination of mescaline or mescaline-containing cacti with harmala alkaloids has been referred to as "peyohuasca". In accordance with these findings, the harmala alkaloid and RIMA harmine has been reported to augment the effects of mescaline in animals.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

In humans, mescaline acts similarly to other psychedelic agents. It acts as an agonist, binding to and activating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Its EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is approximately 10,000 nM and at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor is greater than 20,000 nM. How activating the 5-HT2A receptor leads to psychedelic effects is still unknown, but it is likely that somehow it involves excitation of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. In addition to the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, mescaline is also known to bind to the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor and a number of other targets. The drug shows pronounced biased agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor.
Mescaline lacks affinity for the monoamine transporters, including the serotonin transporter (SERT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and dopamine transporter (DAT) (Ki > 30,000 nM). However, it has been found to increase levels of the major serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) at high doses in rodents. This finding suggests that mescaline might inhibit the reuptake and/or induce the release of serotonin at such doses. In any case, this possibility has not yet been further assessed or demonstrated. Besides serotonin, mescaline might also weakly induce the release of dopamine, but this is probably of modest significance, if it occurs. In accordance, there is no evidence of the drug showing addiction or dependence. Mescaline appears to be inactive in terms of norepinephrine release induction and indirect sympathomimetic activity. Other psychedelic phenethylamines, including the closely related 2C, DOx, and TMA drugs, are inactive as monoamine releasing agents and reuptake inhibitors. However, an exception is trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA), the amphetamine analogue of mescaline, which is a very low-potency serotonin releasing agent (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 16,000 nM). The possible monoamine-releasing effects of mescaline would likely be related to its structural similarity to substituted amphetamines and related compounds.
Mescaline is a relatively low-potency psychedelic, with active doses in the hundreds of milligrams and micromolar affinities for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. For comparison, psilocybin is approximately 20-fold more potent (doses in the tens of milligrams) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is approximately 2,000-fold more potent (doses in the tens to hundreds of micrograms). There have been efforts to develop more potent analogues of mescaline. Difluoro­mescaline and trifluoro­mescaline are more potent than mescaline, as is its amphetamine homologue TMA. Escaline and proscaline are also both more potent than mescaline, showing the importance of the 4-position substituent with regard to receptor binding.
There is no evidence of acute tolerance with mescaline. However, tolerance to mescaline builds with repeated use, lasting for a few days. The drug causes cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin.
The cryo-EM structures of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with mescaline, as well as with various other psychedelics and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists, have been solved and published by Bryan L. Roth and colleagues.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

Mescaline is usually taken orally, although it may also be insufflated, smoked, or given intravenously. Taken orally, it is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The oral bioavailability of mescaline is unknown. However, since at least 53% of orally administered mescaline is excreted in urine unchanged, the bioavailability appears to be at least 53%. Peak concentrations of mescaline occur after approximately 1.6 to 2.3 hours on average (range 1.0–6.0 hours). The pharmacokinetics of mescaline are dose-proportional over an oral dose range of 100 to 800 mg.

#### Distribution

Mescaline is distributed to the liver, spleen, and kidneys at many times higher levels than blood or brain based on animal studies. It is said that a great proportion of mescaline is combined with hepatic proteins, which is said to delay its onset and elimination half-life. The exact portion bound to plasma proteins appears to be unknown.
Mescaline appears to have relatively poor blood–brain barrier permeability due to its low lipophilicity. However, it is still able to cross into the central nervous system and produce psychoactive effects at sufficiently high doses. The poor central permeability of mescaline appears to be responsible for its delayed onset of effects and is also thought to contribute to its low potency.

#### Metabolism

Mescaline given orally appears to be subject to first-pass metabolism of about 50%. Following the first pass, mescaline appears to be subject to relatively limited metabolism.
The primary metabolic pathway of mescaline is oxidative deamination. The specific enzymes mediating the deamination of mescaline are controversial however. Monoamine oxidase (MAO), diamine oxidase (DAO; histamine oxidase), and/or other enzymes may be responsible. Preclinical studies of mescaline given in combination with inhibitors of MAO and/or DAO, such as iproniazid, pargyline, and semicarbazide, have been conducted, but findings have been conflicting. Mescaline has been reported to be a poor or negligible substrate of highly purified human MAO in-vitro.
Mescaline appears not to be subject to metabolism by CYP2D6 based on in-vitro studies with human liver microsomes. Similarly, the in-vitro cytotoxicity of mescaline does not appear to be affected by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme inhibitors. Conversely, it was potentiated by the MAO-A inhibitor clorgiline but not by the MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline. These findings were in contrast to those with the related compound 2C-B, which was potentiated by rasagiline but not by clorgiline.
Circulating peak and area-under-the-curve concentrations of mescaline and 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic acid (TMPAA) are similar with oral administration of mescaline. Conversely, levels of N-acetylmescaline (NAM) are far lower than those of mescaline or TMPAA and are thought not to be of clinical relevance. Intravenous injection of mescaline may result in less hepatic deamination than with oral administration.
Active metabolites of mescaline might contribute to its psychoactive effects. However, both TMPAA and NAM have been said to be inactive based on human tests. Similarly, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylethanol (TMPE), 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetaldehyde (TMPA), and NAM all failed to produce mescaline-like effects in rodent drug discrimination tests.
3,4,5-Trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA), the α-methyl analogue of mescaline and an MAO-resistant psychedelic, is only about twice as potent as mescaline as a psychedelic in humans despite having similar serotonin receptor affinity. This suggests that the deamination of mescaline has a relatively limited impact on its potency, compared to for example the 2C series of psychedelics.

#### Elimination

Mescaline given orally is excreted 87% in urine within 24 hours and 92% in urine within 48 hours. During the first hour after administration, 81.4% of mescaline is excreted unchanged while 13.2% is excreted as its deaminated metabolite 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic acid (TMPAA). However, after the first hour, the percentage excreted as unchanged mescaline declines and the percentage excreted as TMPAA rises. Ultimately, mescaline is excreted in urine 28 to 60% unchanged, 27 to 30% or more as TMPAA, 5% as N-acetyl-3,4-dimethoxy-5-hydroxyphenylethylamine, and less than 0.1% as N-acetylmescaline. Other minor or trace excreted metabolites have also been observed. In a more modern study published in 2025, mescaline was eliminated in urine 53% as unchanged mescaline and 31% as TMPAA.
Mescaline was originally reported to have an elimination half-life of 6 hours based on a study conducted in the 1960s. However, subsequent research published in the 2020s found that its half-life is actually about 3.6 hours (range 2.6–5.3 hours). The previous higher estimate is believed to have been due to small sample numbers and collective measurement of mescaline metabolites. The elimination half-life of mescaline does not appear to be dose-dependent. TMPAA has a half-life of about 3.7 to 4.1 hours, similar to that of mescaline. Mescaline has a similar half-life as LSD yet has a longer duration. This is due to mescaline having slower absorption and onset rather than a longer half-life.

## Chemistry

Mescaline, also known as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine (3,4,5-TMPEA), is a substituted phenethylamine derivative. It is closely structurally related to the dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine), norepinephrine (3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine), and epinephrine (3,4,β-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine). In contrast to the catecholamine neurotransmitters however, mescaline acts on the serotonergic system rather than on the dopaminergic or adrenergic systems.

### Properties

The physical properties and general chemistry of mescaline have been reviewed. The compound is relatively hydrophilic with low fat solubility. Its predicted log P (XLogP3) is 0.7.

### Synthesis

Mescaline was first synthesized in 1919 by Ernst Späth from 3,4,5-trimethoxy­benzoyl chloride. Several approaches using different starting materials have been developed since, including the following:

Hofmann rearrangement of 3,4,5-trimethoxy­phenyl­propionamide.
Cyanohydrin reaction between potassium cyanide and 3,4,5-trimethoxy­benz­aldehyde followed by acetylation and reduction.
Henry reaction of 3,4,5-trimethoxy­benz­aldehyde with nitromethane followed by nitro compound reduction of ω-nitro­trimethoxy­styrene. This was the method used by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).
Ozonolysis of elemicin followed by reductive amination.
Ester reduction of Eudesmic acid's methyl ester followed by halogenation, Kolbe nitrile synthesis, and nitrile reduction.
Amide reduction of 3,4,5-trimethoxy­phenyl­acetamide.
Reduction of 3,4,5-trimethoxy­(2-nitrovinyl)benzene with lithium aluminum hydride.
Treatment of tricarbonyl-(η6-1,2,3-trimethoxy­benzene) chromium complex with acetonitrile carbanion in THF and iodine, followed by reduction of the nitrile with lithium aluminum hydride.

### Analogues

A large number of structural analogues of mescaline that act as psychedelics have been developed. These drugs often have far greater potency than mescaline itself. Examples include scalines like escaline, 3Cs like 3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA or TMA-1; α-methylmescaline), 2Cs like 2C-B, and DOx drugs like DOM, among others. Other notable analogues of mescaline include N-methylmescaline (found in Pachycereus pringlei), trichocereine (N,N-dimethylmescaline), mescaline-FLY, and NBOMe-mescaline, among others.

## Natural occurrence

It occurs naturally in several species of cacti. It is also reported to be found in small amounts in certain members of the bean family, Fabaceae, including Senegalia berlandieri (syn. Acacia berlandieri), although these reports have been challenged and have been unsupported in any additional analyses.

As shown in the accompanying table, the concentration of mescaline in different specimens can vary largely within a single species. Moreover, the concentration of mescaline within a single specimen varies as well.
In plants, mescaline may be the end-product of a pathway utilizing catecholamines as a method of stress response, similar to how animals may release such compounds and others such as cortisol when stressed. The in vivo function of catecholamines in plants has not been investigated, but they may function as antioxidants, as developmental signals, and as integral cell wall components that resist degradation from pathogens. The deactivation of catecholamines via methylation produces alkaloids such as mescaline.

### Biosynthesis

Mescaline is biosynthesized from tyrosine, which, in turn, is derived from phenylalanine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. In Lophophora williamsii (Peyote), dopamine converts into mescaline in a biosynthetic pathway involving m-O-methylation and aromatic hydroxylation.
Tyrosine and phenylalanine serve as metabolic precursors towards the synthesis of mescaline. Tyrosine can either undergo a decarboxylation via tyrosine decarboxylase to generate tyramine and subsequently undergo an oxidation at carbon 3 by a monophenol hydroxylase or first be hydroxylated by tyrosine hydroxylase to form L-DOPA and decarboxylated by DOPA decarboxylase. These create dopamine, which then experiences methylation by a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) by an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent mechanism. The resulting intermediate is then oxidized again by a hydroxylase enzyme, likely monophenol hydroxylase again, at carbon 5, and methylated by COMT. The product, methylated at the two meta positions with respect to the alkyl substituent, experiences a final methylation at the 4 carbon by a guaiacol-O-methyltransferase, which also operates by a SAM-dependent mechanism. This final methylation step results in the production of mescaline.
Phenylalanine serves as a precursor by first being converted to L-tyrosine by L-amino acid hydroxylase. Once converted, it follows the same pathway as described above.

## History

Archaeological evidence from sites in the United States, Mexico, and Peru indicates that mescaline-containing cacti have been used for over 6,000 years. Europeans recorded use of peyote in Native American religious ceremonies upon early contact with the Huichol people in Mexico. Other mescaline-containing cacti such as the San Pedro have a long history of use in South America, from Peru to Ecuador. While religious and ceremonial peyote use was widespread in the Aztec Empire and northern Mexico at the time of the Spanish conquest, religious persecution confined it to areas near the Pacific coast and up to southwest Texas. However, by 1880, peyote use began to spread north of South-Central America with "a new kind of peyote ceremony" inaugurated by the Kiowa and Comanche people. These religious practices, incorporated legally in the United States in 1920 as the Native American Church, have since spread as far as Saskatchewan, Canada.
In traditional peyote preparations, the top of the cactus is cut off, leaving the large tap root along with a ring of green photosynthesizing area to grow new heads. These heads are then dried to make disc-shaped buttons. Buttons are chewed to produce the effects or soaked in water to drink. However, the taste of the cactus is bitter, so modern users will often grind it into a powder and pour it into capsules to avoid having to taste it. The typical dose is 200 to 400 mg of mescaline sulfate or 178 to 356 mg of mescaline hydrochloride. The average 76 mm (3.0 in) peyote button contains about 25 mg mescaline. Some analyses of traditional preparations of San Pedro cactus have found doses ranging from 34 mg to 159 mg of total alkaloids, a relatively low and barely psychoactive amount. It appears that patients who receive traditional treatments with San Pedro ingest sub-psychoactive doses and do not experience psychedelic effects.
Botanical studies of peyote began in the 1840s and the drug was listed in the Mexican pharmacopeia. The first use of mescal buttons was published by John Raleigh Briggs in 1887. In 1887, the German pharmacologist Louis Lewin received his first sample of the peyote cactus, found numerous new alkaloids and later published the first methodical analysis of it. Mescaline was first isolated and identified in 1897 by the German chemist Arthur Heffter. He showed that mescaline was exclusively responsible for the psychoactive or hallucinogenic effects of peyote. However, other components of peyote, such as hordenine, pellotine, and anhalinine, are also active. Mescaline was first synthesized in 1919 by Ernst Späth.
In 1955, English politician Christopher Mayhew took part in an experiment for BBC's Panorama, in which he ingested 400 mg of mescaline under the supervision of psychiatrist Humphry Osmond. Though the recording was deemed too controversial and ultimately omitted from the show, Mayhew praised the experience, calling it "the most interesting thing I ever did".
Studies of the potential therapeutic effects of mescaline started in the 1950s.
The mechanism of action of mescaline, activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, became known in the 1990s.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United States

In the United States, mescaline was made illegal in 1970 by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, categorized as a Schedule I hallucinogen. The drug is prohibited internationally by the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Mescaline is legal only for certain religious groups (such as the Native American Church by the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978) and in scientific and medical research. In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Oregon could ban the use of mescaline in Native American religious ceremonies. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in 1993 allowed the use of peyote in religious ceremony, but in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that the RFRA is unconstitutional when applied against states. Many states, including the state of Utah, have legalized peyote usage with "sincere religious intent", or within a religious organization, regardless of race. Synthetic mescaline, but not mescaline derived from cacti, was officially decriminalized in the state of Colorado by ballot measure Proposition 122 in November 2022.
While mescaline-containing cacti of the genus Echinopsis are technically controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, they are commonly sold publicly as ornamental plants.

#### United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, mescaline in purified powder form is a Class A drug. However, dried cactus can be bought and sold legally.

#### Australia

Mescaline is considered a schedule 9 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A schedule 9 substance is classified as "Substances with a high potential for causing harm at low exposure and which require special precautions during manufacture, handling or use. These poisons should be available only to specialised or authorised users who have the skills necessary to handle them safely. Special regulations restricting their availability, possession, storage or use may apply."

#### Other countries

In Canada, France, The Netherlands and Germany, mescaline in raw form and dried mescaline-containing cacti are considered illegal drugs. However, anyone may grow and use peyote, or Lophophora williamsii, as well as Echinopsis pachanoi and Echinopsis peruviana without restriction, as it is specifically exempt from legislation. In Canada, mescaline is classified as a schedule III drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, whereas peyote is exempt.
In Russia mescaline, its derivatives and mescaline-containing plants are banned as narcotic drugs (Schedule I).

### Notable individuals

Ken Kesey took peyote prior to writing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
Jean-Paul Sartre took mescaline shortly before the publication of his first book, L'Imaginaire; he had a bad trip during which he imagined that he was menaced by sea creatures. For many years following this, he persistently thought that he was being followed by lobsters, and became a patient of Jacques Lacan in hopes of being rid of them. Lobsters and crabs figure in his novel Nausea.
Havelock Ellis was the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline (1898).

Hunter S. Thompson wrote an extremely detailed account of his first use of mescaline in "First Visit with Mescalito", and it appeared in his book Songs of the Doomed, as well as featuring heavily in his novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
Psychedelic research pioneer Alexander Shulgin said he was first inspired to explore psychedelic compounds by a mescaline experience. In 1974, Shulgin synthesized 2C-B, a psychedelic phenylethylamine derivative, structurally similar to mescaline, and one of Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds together with Mescaline, 2C-E, 2C-T-7, and 2C-T-2.

He experienced a psychedelic trip that caused profound changes in his life and outlook.

## Research

Mescaline has a wide array of suggested medical usage, including treatment of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and alcoholism. However, its status as a Schedule I controlled substance in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances limits availability of the drug to researchers. Because of this, very few studies concerning mescaline's activity and potential therapeutic effects in people have been conducted since the early 1970s.
