I actually just started doing some research on this and have been debating on whether or not I want to invest in it.

So far I have only found 1 vendor and the price isn't terrible, but it isn't inexpensive at all. 


I would love to hear more trip reports and more info on the physiological and psychological effects. It seems like it could be comparable to MDMA, but I would prefer an actual report over my assumption before I go buying this stuff.

Also, any info on drug interactions would be great (including opiates (bupe too,) benzos, ssri's, snri's, and muscle relaxers.) 


p.s. I am not really sure if this post even makes sense right now - i am pretty benzoed up and this took me like 15-20 minutes to type out, so i will be sure to reread this tomorrow and edit if necessary.

Yes it feels kind of MDMA. Makes you emphatic, really social and overall really good feeling. Even when taken by oral, you get nice tingling feeling up to you're head while it comes up.  It has also amphetamine like speediness and makes your head clear. Works about 4h, you can boost it by one or two times but after that it won't work anymore.

I have sampled it two times at 100mg (oral). 


Nice euphoria. Good for a chill afternoon with friends and good music. I haven't felt any negative effects on onset, comedown or afterwards. I usually take two 5-htp (100mg) before I go to sleep.


I think I will try 150mg (oral) next time.

Sounds to be really good, always meant to try it but never quite got round to it. From all reports i've heard do not snort, it burns on a par with the 2cx's apparently

sweet.... considering i'll be snorting my 2C-E (prefer the come-up) i'll have to see if it lives up to the 2C-Ellish standards... héhé, nah i'll see.... i also sniffed 5-meo-DMT which was pretty nasty

Insufflation is not recommended. It tastes horrible as well. Rectal admin should suffice for those looking for a quick onset. 


I must say that this substance is very promising. I've been using it frequently as a study aid for the past few weeks and have no serious complaints. You get your run-of-the-mill amphetamine sweats, tight muscles, irregular bowel movements, lack of appetite, etc... but other than that 4-fa appears to be a winner. Mind you, the duration is extremely long, although I don't find that to be much of a bother. %)

Addiction potential is definitely there for those prone to 'fiend' for that initial rush.


There are also the obvious risks involved when playing with RCs:

But 4-fluoroamphetamine's structurally going to be closer to 4-fluoromethcathinone (4-FMC), which IS close to 4-methylmethcathinone (4-MMC/meph).  So by transitivity, the stuff's going to be pretty darn close to mephedrone, for better or WORSE.

So ya, 4-MMC would act in a similar fashion to 4-FA on a global substituted cathinone level (again, whatever that may be, with the lack of long-term research), and given that it's similar the similarity of these two (or three) chemicals with respect to their optional substitutions/replacements, I'd say that they'd have similar physical effect means when compared to all substituted cathinones.  Meaning any unknown dangers for 4-FA would be quite similar to unknown dangers for 4-MMC.  I say "unknown," again, as these are modern-age RCs.  If you get what I'm sayin'...

Also, I don't see why we should consider mephedrone more neurotoxic than MDMA on an a priori basis.  As of yet, we don't really know what its receptor affinities, etc. are like, even.

well the first 100mg gave me a slight mood lift, feeling slightly stimulated, in a very good way... i later bombed another 100mg's and waited 30 minutes, sniffed a 20+mg line of 2C-E and now feel very stimulated, euphoric, jaw clenching slightly... slight visuals from the 2C.... but definately feeling more stimulated than 2C alone, i'm sweating quite a bit, but feeling on top of the world.... sort of like a cleaner version of mephedrone


i've prepared 200mg parachutes for me n a couple of mates to sample tonight at a Drum n bass party... should be interesting

The abbreviation "4fmp" will get rather confusing rather quickly, as people begin to sample "4-fluoro-methyl-amphetamine" more often.

Cleaner, less intense, slightly less empathogenic, longer-lasting meph. Think meph meets ordinary amphetamine. More euphoric than regular amp, less so than meph, more empathogenic than amp, less so than meph, longer-lasting than meph, and from my experiences, very mellow comedown - actually more like a plateau reminiscent of acid, as opposed to a "crash" like many empathogenics.


Don't expect it to blow your socks off like meph does when it start rushing; it's basically speed that feels a bit better in the beginning half and feels decidedly less shit towards the end.

In addition to the above - I don't know if it was because of the mix of methylone but there was definately light visuals both times I've done this (textures, patterns).

I've been reading from many about the supposed low neurotoxicity of 4-fa if compared to other halo, but never seen any source for it. Does anyone have link or paper related to 5-fa's toxicity or pharmacodynamics? 

And another thing I don't get: anyone who tried it seems happy with it, then why it's so rare and unknown? Theories?

It's already rather confusing; I thought that this thread was about that compound when I read the title.

Yes, and I believe 4-FA (4-fluoro-amphetamine) to be a more useful name for this compound, longterm.  I believe 4-fmp was created as a name only to avoid selling an RC with the name amphetamine in it.  I would think that 4-fluoro-methyl-amphetamine (4-fma) would be better and probably more 4-mmc like.


For me 4-fa is a fairly effective stimulant with empathic and ectactogenic overtones.  I have had it on about a dozen occasions (in doses ranging from 75mg nasally to 100-300mg orally) and I found it far less euphoric than mephedrone, methylone, or mdma.  Even when combined with butylone it fell far, far short of mephedrone.  Not to say that it was bad, just expect it to be more amphetamine-like than most other empathogens.  It's great for keeping you going on those late nights out, but without blowing your mind like mdma and 4-mmc can.


Is it worth it? depends on how cheap you can get it.  I can get mephedrone much cheaper and I prefer the high of mephedrone so I would usually opt for that.  Now as far as the safety index, I would say that 4-fa (4-fmp) feels like it is probably much safer than mephedrone, due to the fact that you aren't anywhere near as fucked up, but then I have never taken 850mg of 4-fmp at once (I have taken that much meph at one oral dose! rough night).  Even at 75mg nasally it wouldn't even touch the euphoria of 75mg mephedrone nasally.  4-fa definitely won't have you redosing compulsively like meph since 4-fa lasts 12hrs+ and by the end you will be so worn out redosing will sound like a bad idea.


Is it good? meh, it's ok.  Would I do it again, yes! But it's not very high on the list of things to go out and buy.  When I used to be addicted to amphetamines I probably would have been more enamored with it, but that's about how it is. Almost like slightly trippy adderrall.


Cheers,

SimStim


PS- the burn is not as bad as 2c-x compounds.  It is VERY bad, but it subsides very quickly and does not linger or cause me to feel like I am going to drown in mucous and then vomit like 2c-e and 2-ct-2 do (but not for some reason 2c-i).

More euphoric than regular amp, less so than meph, more empathogenic than amp, less so than meph, longer-lasting than meph, and from my experiences, very mellow comedown - actually more like a plateau reminiscent of acid, as opposed to a "crash" like many empathogenics.

All in all: probably the best pure stimulant (not empathogen) I have tried. If you like speed, switch to this stuff. Less bad side effects, better effects.

First, I completely agree with an opinion that the nomenclature of this substance is 4-FA better than 4-FMP. 4-FMP is aggression of **4**-**F**luoro-(alpha)-**M**ethyl-**P**henthylamine, however it's not systematic chemical nomenclature (it's 1-(4-Fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine), moreover it's difficult to understand what it means unless having high-level knowledge of chemistry and psychopharmacology, and this name sometimes potentially confusing with other substances like 4-FMA. 4-FA, in contrast, many researchers may easily guess that it's aggression of 4-Fluoro-Amphetamine, it's clear. I think 4-FMP is named by some vendors because of the name 4-FA has a risk to be mistaken illegal Amphetamines so to prevent these problems they used 4-FMP. It's scientific discussion so I will use 4-FA.

There's an article about differences *in vivo* pharmacokinetics between d-Amphetamine (d-AMP), d-Methamphetamine, 4-FA, and 4-FMA in Japan (This article is Japanese only so I'll introduce the summarise of this in English). These data are not human's but rats so this may not be adopted to human, so please consider as only scientific data, but it's so precious data.

According to this article the half life of d-AMP (1 mg / kg, and  so forth) in rats is approx. 100 min., in contrast 4-FA is approx. 205 min., about 2-fold longer. Interestingly, comparing d-MAP with 4-FMA it's opposite, d-MAP is approx. 110 min., 4-FMA is approx. 60 min.

There are many differences between human and rat in metabolise pathway so it should not too simplify to interpret of course, but if these differences could be neglected, medical research shows that the half life of d-AMP (as prescription medicine Dexedrine in the US) is about 9 hours in children and 11 hours in adults, then 4-FA has potentially over 23-24 hours half-life so it could be ideal medicine for AD/HD because it's no need to take divided and not too long to cause insomnia when comply to the prescription issued by specialist.

And this article also hypothesised the reason why 4-FMA has shorter half life than d-MAP, it says demethylation of 4-FMA is rapidly processing than d-MAP. I cannot any skeptical point in this hypothesis in my knowledge, so please point out if exist something skeptical point in it.

It may support that many researcher said that 4-FA is better than 4-FMA, because many people think that Methamphetamine is stronger than Amphetamine and indeed that's right, but it's not the nature of substances but the fact is only MAP is far more lipophilic than AMP due to -CH3 so easily penetrate BBB then has higher activity than AMP. In fact AMP is slightly stronger than MAP *in vitro*.

It's shown that Fluorine increase lipophilicity then it's no wonder 4-FA has stronger biological activity than 4-FMA.

Subjectively 4-FA is not so worth to recreational use however it has potentially more effective because due to has less adrenargic property than d-AMP or rac-AMP (Adderall or Dexedrine), it must reduce side effects like agitation, cardiovascular side effects and so on, moreover, weak entactogenic effect might have good influence to those who have AD/HD with Autistic Spectrum for 10-20 mg low dose.

I hope that this substance will not be only treated as "Drugs of abuse" but approved as Rx medicine for AD/HD someday.


(4-FA is completely legal in my country unless to sell or give to others, however it may show pseudopositive reacion to simple drug  screening test then it has some difficulties for therapeutic use instead of Adderall which is illegal with no exception, even if doctor's prescription possessing here)

Quick question - might have been answered before.


Both times I've tried 4-FA I've had a g, and a g of methylone between two people. Would it be worth buying 2g of 4-FA for redosing over the night or is this overkill - would it still give the same rushes?

In addition: If I were to take the 4-FA, wait a while then take a bomb or two of mephedrone instead of M1 would the fiending still be apparent? I'm assuming yes, 4-FA and M1 however I don't find myself fiending on it at all but mephedrone is the most fiendish drug I've tried...

**Greenish 4-FA**


My sample of 3g 4-FA just arrived this morning.


I'm a bit concerned about the appearance of my sample. Mine has a distinct benzole-like chemical smell and a greenish/yellowish color. In contrast to previous white odourless batches, i wonder if this one has more impurities. The greenish batch may even present nastier side-effects like it has been reported in another 4-FA thread:

I've been enjoying this stuff in small doses as a replacement for coffee. At no more than 1mg/kg I've found it to be satisfyingly stimulating for my entire (physically demanding) work day. It also puts me in a great mood for socializing (that interesting empathogenic touch), and my general motivation to do drone-like work seems to have greatly benefited as well. Great stuff, but I tend to get some lasting dry mouth sometimes. No other negative symptoms noted.


Can anyone comment on the solubility of this substance?

Update on my notes for this substance:


Under heavy stress I've gotten acute muscle cramps that are sharp and localized to one area. Could just be the effects of a stimulant allowing one to push oneself before realizing the detriment, but worthwhile to note anyways.


Impurities can be cleaned up using anhydrous acetone. A warmed solution will dissolve everything, and a freeze precipitation will crash out all the 4-FA without consequence.

Has anyone experimented with different ROAs?  Can it be smoked?  I'm considering getting this over mephedrone, I like amps and I really would enjoy a long lasting euphoric amp...it sounds like meth minus a lot of the shitty parts.  You guys say it lasts long, altho it seems ppl aren't overly impressed with its entactogen/empathogen effects.  Is it that this chemical has these properties but just doesn't compare to the intensity of mdma/meph or that the effects are negligible? I personally find meth or high dose dex to be a very social and euphoric high, I love when I get methbomb e pills, so I'm wondering will this probably be something I'd love?  


I feel like getting 5 or so grams of this stuff will be much more bang for my buck and be more quality time and thoughts and activities done and its just cleaner than meph too.  However if its not that impressive and its sorta just like adderall...i dunno..I have that...then I may opt for meph even tho i binge and fiend for it

First post!


So here's my experience with this stuff, really great and subtle. Obviously I don't think I went about this in a very not so smart manner but at the same time I don't think this stuff is very harsh on the body.


Received about a gram of 4-FA on a Thursday and was used up within a week, with a break on the Saturday and Sunday. The days I took it, I would bomb about 50mg, then redose 2-3 times at around 50mg each time, and I never went over 230mg in an entire day. No comedowns, no crashes, although I would supplement with a good bowl or two of dank towards the end of the day to help sleep. The above posters saying it lasts 12 hours is I think kinda bullshit, it's more like 4-6 hours, with the nice entactogenic tingles around the 2-3 hour mark. I used it primarily as a replacement for addderall as a study/school aid and I think it does well in this area, especially I noticed it made me much more sociable. Not that I am anti-social, it just made interacting with people pleasurable in a sense. I did notice after shutting out the lights after going out to smoke weed and heading for bed was a distinct psychedelic effect: I looked out the window and the buildings far off in the distance would kinda warp and breathe, but that's about it, and I'm guessing this is the serotogenic activity here. I also think it had a lot to do with me smoking weed but eh guess we wont know for sure.


It doesn't have the push of the regular amph, and definitely none of the harshness that comes with regular amphs. The friday after I ran out I felt a bit tired, but was more tired than usual the second day after stopping, but honestly, other than a little lethargy, there wasn't any other complaints.


I can kinda see this being used a few times a week, maybe even everyday. It might seem to have serotonin effects but from what I have read and from personal experience, this is very slight and quick to recover from, especially when taking your daily vitamins/eating right and whatnot.


Oh and I started taking the 4-FA about a month into my piracetam regimen, and about a few days after stopping the 4FA, I added oxiracetam to see what it does.


I ordered another gram of 4-FA and will keep a more detailed report of it when it arrives. I hope to be more controlled in terms of using it but who knows how it will play out. I also ordered 500mg of MDPV but I know ahead of time to take this substance with caution. Also, these are being used for study purposes.


And for what it's worth I plan on trying low doses of 2C-E, like 5mg as a nootropic, but I think ordering some 2C-D will be a better idea, eh who knows how it'l go.

No amount of caution can curb a shitty experience with peevee, friend. It's also not a very valuable study aid--gets jittery and uncomfortable quickly.


Glad you liked 4-FA though; great chem IMO.

Yeah the 4-FA is definitely one of my favorite substances, kinda wish I just opted for more of it instead of the peevee. Is that stuff really not worth the time or is there some usefulness to it? From the sounds of it, doesn't seem too much different from wayy too much caffeine (sorry to get off topic =p)

The only time peev can be useful for studying is when used in *very* low doses (2-3mg range assuming you have good product). Even then it's questionable. If you do more than that (10mg+ for recreational doses), the initial euphoric push eventually shifts to a paranoid ride down fiend lane. If you manage not to redose, you're left with Parkinson esque shakes, no appetite, increased heart rate and other uncomfortable side effects. 


It's euphoria is short lived and leaves the user wanting more. It keeps you up for hours after your last ingestion and can delude the end user into incessant redosing even when it doesn't make any sense. Tolerance builds immediately (you'll be taking 50mg doses in no time). That said, peev does shine through on the rare occasion. Just be careful mate.


Amphetamine intake of any sort (d-amp, 4-fa, etc...) within 1.5-2 weeks will most certainly detract from an experience with MDMA. To avoid cross tolerance you will definitely want to take a break. How long is up to you (I'd say two just to be safe), but the more time in between the better.

Okay, so I had my first trial with 4-fmp and wanted to share.


I took all in all 85 mg (dunno how reliable my cheap wheight is so make it 90-95).


T+00:00First I took 1/4 of the "pile" of powder. I insufflated it despite the horrorstories. After 3 minutes I feel more clearheaded, a bit like a low dose of amphetamine. 


T+00:15 1/4 extra is ingested orally mixed into lemonsoda and dry martini. I soon feel a little tickly on my arms and head, not unlike amphetamine. There is some very (very) faint hint of methyloneish feeling going on in the background. If I do anything I forget it though.


T+ 00:45 The rest is taken. It soon builds up. I would say it feels like as if methylone and amphetamine had a child, and only the best of both were passed on. Very mild methylonish experience, but with the clearness of amphetamine. I am connected to my emotions, yet in controll. I could see this working out great at a party or with some friends. Sex is awesome, but not as overwhelming as on methylone. 


The effects are steady like this - sometimes a bit stronger, sometimes a bit weaker - but overall i'm loving it (more than I love McDonald's). I can eat a little.

I have a few drinks and write some schoolwork on Plato. My assignment is improved by the presence of the stimulant, and at the same time it feels great. Peaking and orgasmic euphoria. A weird mix of "doing your job" and "rolling" at the same time.


T+4:30 The effects are subsiding. From now on and untill T+ 10:00 I am slowly coming down. No ill effects. This is surely a chemical to keep in the arsenal. 


Conclusions:


I love it. It is not as powerfull as MDMA or methylone, yet it has some of those chemicals qualities. It is deeper, more versatile than plain amphetamine, but still it has the clearness and some of the bodile sensations (like tickly hair etc.). All in all it feel (feels, not is) less harmfull than both amphetamine, methylone and MDMA. I think insomnia could be an issue though, as I took it after waking up at around 12, and now, almost 10 hours later am barely back at baseline. Probably wont sleep until midnight or maybe in the morning. 


Mind you, it is very potent stuff. I think that going over the dose I tried now (max 90 mg) would increase the negative effects. I don't think I will ever go above 120 mg. I have only tried it once, but I think that snorting a little and ingesting the rest orally might help potentiate a bit. Snorting is a bitch, though, and I have to admit it made my soul cry like a baby. 


Edit: I think it is wrong to compare this substance to anything (in order to evaluate it). Granted, it has very clear similarities, but I think that this is where its quality lies. It has *some* of the best trades of other substances, but it simply lacks most of the bad ones. Of course you could drive the roll into heartattack-land, but I for once did not feel like redosing. If this chemical came first, amphetamine would be called a bad, lightversion of 4-fmp, and MDMA would be called an overwhelming copy that leaves you brainfisted the next weeks. Right now I am sitting with a wonderfull feeling inside me. I think I finally found a chemical that fits my weak soul. This one will never leave me yelling at my own stupidity for taking drugs - or at least I hope so.


Take care!

What, seriously? I thought it was intense enough - not overwhelming, but still. How about negative aspects? Do they increase much or is it the same? I mean, how much strain does it put on heart and vascoularsystem? 


Right now I'm still feeling pretty hot. My bodytemperature is probably 39 degrees celsius, but my heartrate is fearly stable, so there is absolutely no anxiety. There are still some trace-stimulation, but I will probably be able to sleep in 1-2 hours.

Another gram came in this week. I wanna go for insuffulation, so how should I adjust my dosages?


Also I think redosing more than 2 hours after doesn't do anything for the euphoria, but does definitely prolong the stimulation so from now on I think it'd be better to just bomb a larger dose, like 50-70mg and then throw in 30-40mg within 2 hours for it to be anything worthwhile.


I actually had kind of a shitty comedown from it on Saturday but I blame this weeks drug usage on it, not the 4-FA:


Starting on Tuesday with 5mg, 10 on Wednesday and Thursday and 13mg on Friday of 2C-E. This I have to note was the most effective and productive nootropic study aid regimen I have ever used, I literally went from retard in organic chemistry on monday to fucking raping my exam Friday morning, it went wayy better than expected, like I was blown away at how useful this shit is to study and understand concepts(trivial to this thread but eh what the hell might as well write it down somewhere). Then later that friday I dosed about 110mg of 4-FA with no ill effects and then Saturday I took 50mg, then another 100 an hour later and by nighttime I felt like shit. And yet another thing I just realized, I didn't eat anything between Friday noon and Saturday evening soo, hell, we have a lot of factors here don't we?


Tomorrow I don't think I'll play around with 4-FA, but definitely will this week, with full rest and food ofcourse =]


BTW, is snorting it even worth it or should I just stick to oral dosing? I'm wondering primarily for efficiency because this stuff seems to go fast for me =p

Plugging is your best bet; fast onset and slightly increased bioavailability (ime). 4-FA is extremely painful when insufflated.

Watch out on this combo! Some people have reacted in a very strong way to this combo. Did 80mg of 4-fmp/50mg of methylone and my gf did 50/50mg. I had a mild experience (due to tolerance to 4-fmp) but my girlfriend had major heartissues from 5 minutes after dropping the methylone throughout the entire night + tremor and cramping of the thighs and also confusion. She is overall healthy and reacts fairly normal to both methylone and 4-fmp on their own, though butylone fucks her up.


We first dropped 4-fmp and ca. 2-3 hours later we did the methylone, if it is of any use to know this.


Just wanted to let you all know, combos on these chems are pretty hard to "predict". But for most it seems good.

Actually I only feel pain on the first insufflation. Try insufflating first like 5mg, let the pain settle and then do very small lines. It wont be healthy for the nose but I find that the pain is litterally gone. Also mixing routes of administration lets a very little amount stretch a long time with nice euphoria:


40mg plugged at T+00:00

10mg insufflated  T+00:20

20mg oral            T+00:40  


I had the euphoria and empathy going strong (compared to what little amount I took) for about 4 hours, then it slowly subsided into pleasent mild stimulation with great bodile sensations for another 5 hours before softly landing. Sleep wasn't hard to achieve.


Tried a similar low dose for 2 days but effects really diminished. Will break 1 week and try a slightly higher dose (50plugged 10 insuf.+30 oral).

Felt that I could easily have redosed on the first trial without any complications.

Can anyone comment on the hyperthermia characteristics of this compared to MDMA?


A friend of mine is planning to have some for a gig but he had some pretty exciting heatstroke and couldn't be in the thick of the crowd after ~200mg of mdma (his first time). According to wikipedia this causes less heatstroke and he says that means he'll be fine, but won't listen when I point out that wikipedia is neither cited on this, nor is it in comparison to amphetamine or MDMA.


Would this be suitable for an intense gig at a lower dose (80-100mg, no tolerance)? 

Does it give a good confidence with the energy?


From what I've read here it seems like it would be ideal for those occasions when you'd like to trade a little empathy for some more stimulation.


P.S. please can we change the title to 4-FA, this thread took me ages to find.

Well, maybe this is to late but will answer anyways:


I did feel hot the first and second time I tried it. I have done it 3 times since then, two times at quiet parties at around 100mg+20mg redoses. Didn't feel any complications and I am a very, very weak person when it comes to stimulants. I am a bit afraid that the mildness does not reflect the drugs objective harmfullness because it feels safer than anything I have tried so far. Actually I have outfased alcohole and other drugs from my arsenal and know 4-fa has taken their spot. Then it is all about limiting my use, I guess, but stopping is out of the question since 4-fa is the only drug that hasn't given me any complications mentally or physically. 


My guess would be that 80mg is safe, even on an intense gig. But if it is a first time on it try with less, like say, 50-70mg. Better safe than sorry.

I've ordered some of this.


Just wondering, does anyone have any experiences with using it as an (ADHD) study-aid? Currently using ritalin, but I was thinking I might give this a try at 20-30mg doses. Only going to use it for a few days max.

I tried it a few times at 20-30 mg, as a study aid.

Was definitely helping me to focus for longer than the usual 30 minutes.

However, my appreciation of music was also markedly increased, as was the feeling of thirstyness.

Perhaps a dose of 10-15 mg would already be enough to help you focus during study.

I suggest you start with 10 mg and up your dose with 5 mg on consecutive days, until you reach the desired level.

If that takes you past 40 mg, better give up on the 4-FMP imho.


You should keep in mind that amphetamines interfere with your memory though.

It is a kind of conditional learning; what you learn while on amphetamines is best remembered when on amphetamines again.

But for finishing essays or other projects, it is definitely word a try. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

And yeah I'm aware of conditional learning, but without ritalin studying is very inefficient for me, I can't concentrate for shit. I'll be reading something, lose focus and my mind starts wandering. I'll then stand up from my desk, walking towards the door and suddenly realise that 'Oh shit I was studying'. Or I'm trying to read something but I constantly get distracting thoughts: 'Let me just check facebook for 2 minutes', 'I'm thirsty/hrungy, let's check the fridge', 'I wonder where I left [Object X], let me see if I can find it', .. Even if I ignore to act on those impulses (which is hard because they're so frequent), they're still interfering. I can't imagine the diminished memory due to effects of conditional learning weighing up against the increase in attention span stimulants give me. I can still take a small dose when taking my exams so I'm in the same 'condition' so to speak ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hyperthermia in comparison with MDMA is virtually non-existent.

I must say I am not really into the higher doses of 4-FMP (140 mg max), but I expect blood pressure/heart rate issues to become apparent much sooner than possible hyperthermia.


The dosage of 80-100 mg looks perfect to me for a first try.

Not really sure what you mean with 'intense gig' though...you mean like very crowded?

Don't think it should be problematic, 4-FMP gives lot of empathy and euphoria, so you'll merge nicely with the crowd.

It also gives good confidence with the energy, as you put it.

Not as much as MDMA might give you, but you'll be easily in the 'let's call my parents and tell 'em I am high and I love them' mood. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Depending on the duration of your gig, you might consider taking a supplement for the final hours.

Effects of 80-100 mg of 4-FMP will probably wear off after about 6 hours, the euphoric rush might last a max of 4 hours.

You could either supplement with 40-50 mg of 4-FMP, about 80 mg of MDMA or 100-120 mg of methylone, whichever you have available.

Personaly, supplementing with MDMA gives me the best experiences.

That MDMA magic really adds a little something to the speedy after-space of 4-FMP. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I'm getting some of this soon, maybe two weeks or so. From what I read it is a mixture of MDMA and amphetamine, but has significantly less neurotoxic effects than MDMA, which isn't even that neurotoxic at all. I can't find any sources for this though.

No studies, I guess its all subjective. I've taken Selegiline, Dexedrine and about to take some of this 4FA. I'm doing it at a low dosage since I've already had so many stimulants.

^No, neurotoxicity is not subjective. It is definitely really happening independently of mind.


Selegiline and 4FA sounds like a recipe for disaster to me, I hope you know what you're doing.

I know its toxic, and I won't pretend that it is harmless. All amphetamines hurt your brain, but I don't have a correct comparison for how toxic it is.


You are correct that those substances can be disastrous. I have done the combination (amphetamine and selegiline) a few times, and after a few days, I lose feelings and feel cold and robotic. 


This substance tastes of a sour, slightly bitter taste. It is pleasantly serotonic, but causes great amounts of vasoconstriction, especially my feet.

Selegiline stops the enzymes that normally break down amphetamines from working. Those enzymes also break down the neurotransmitters that amphetamines release. When you combine those two drugs, you run the risk of neurotransmitters reaching dangerous levels. Psychosis, serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crises are not trifling matters. Please, please be careful. The comparison isn't to the toxicity other amphetamines, this particular combo is a can of worms that presents hazards above and beyond normal stimulant use. I wouldn't touch it, but it's your funeral. Not literally, I hope.

Does that mean that its protecting me by combing both? I think you're trying to say that the enzymes are MAOIs and they break down the transmitters? I have experienced psychosis only by staying up, and serotonin syndrome I have never had. My BPM is still under 120, 108 and my normal resting rate is 77. [I've combined it before.](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=557158)

Thank you for caring. I have always been careful, except this combination is indeed dangerous. I think it would be a sudden effect rather than a combined effect of taking it often, but I'm not sure.

NO! The enzymes are MAO (monoamine oxidase), selegiline is an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) that stops those enzymes from working. MAO would usually catalyse the breakdown of amphetamines, and of serotonin, adrenaline and dopamine. Selegiline stops the enzyme from doing that, so you end up with much higher levels of amphetamine, and of neurotransmitters, than you would otherwise have had. Sorry I did not explain clearly. 


Perhaps you should read up on the subject a little:

Thank you, I knew of that, but I didn't understand it by your previous wording. I have researched the subject previously, but it seems that selegiline isn't as dangerous as other MAOIs, I've even eaten cheese on it with no problem. I don't think its that dangerous, because I have done it before, but the danger of course is present. I don't suggest others do what I have done of course.

Perhaps it should be mentioned that amphetamines are a bit (like a factor 100) more worrisome then tyramine, which is - by the way - only present in significant quantities in certain types of (overaged) cheese. (This is serious, no intention of mockery or anything here)

Fuller RW, Baker JC, Perry KW, Molloy BB. "Comparison of 4-chloro-, 4-bromo- and 4-fluoroamphetamine in rats: drug levels in brain and effects on brain serotonin metabolism." Neuropharmacology. 1975 Oct;14(10):739-46.


> Abstract
> 
> The ability of 4-chloroamphetamine, 4-bromoamphetamine, and 4-fluoroamphetamine to deplete brain 5-hydroxyindoles and some pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs were compared in rats. Half-lives of the three compounds in rat brain were 3.7, 4.4, and 5.7 hr, respectively for the 4-fluoro, 4-chloro, and 4-bromo amphetamines. The tendency of the drugs to be associated with paniculate material in brain homogenates or to prefer an organic versus an aqueous phase in vitro varied in the order 4-bromo > 4-chloro > 4-fluoro. This order of activity also applied to the inhibition of monoamine oxidase in vitro. All three 4-haloamphetamines reduced the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase and lowered the levels of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in whole brain initially. With 4-chloroamphetamine and 4-bromoamphetamine, the depletion of brain 5-hydroxyindoles lasted for at least a week. 4-Fluoroamphetamine, in contrast, lowered serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels only for short times (2–6 hr) after drug injection, and 5-hydroxyindole levels were essentially back to normal within 24 hr. Prior treatment with an uptake inhibitor prevented the serotonin depletion by all of the haloamphetamines, indicating they all required the membrane uptake pump for entry into the neurone. The effect of 4-bromoamphetamine, like that of 4-chloroamphetamine, could be reversed by subsequent injection of the uptake inhibitor after short periods but not after 24–48 hr. The failure of 4-fluoroamphetamine to produce a long-lasting depletion of brain serotonin like that produced by 4-chloroamphetamine or 4-bromoamphetamine may reflect the inability of the fluoro-compound to be metabolized in the same way as the other haloamphetamines.

There is no mention of toxicity with regards to dopaminergic neurons, but I am hopeful.

Thanks for the link. It doesn't do anything to serotonin, but there isn't mention of dopamine. I've combined Dexedrine, Selegiline and 4FA, and its pleasant, but nothing more than a feel of amphetamine. No empathy at 10mg dosage.

There's some reason to believe it won't, 4-Cl/4-Br amphetamine are selective for 5HT toxicity (6-OH-DA is what you use for selective DA toxicity!)

No problem.  The three drugs weren't really designed per say but incidentally discovered in the 60's when there was a big push to find drugs that could me administered to mice to emulate disease states such as depression or schizophrenia so that drugs could attempted to be created to treat the disease states they induced.  They had been synthesized quite a while before, though.  There are a few books full of research from the 60's and 70's that pertains the synthesis and effects of monoaminergic neurotoxins.


A part of the field which is sort of a large oversight is norepinephrinergic neuronal toxicity, DA and 5HT received disproportionate amounts of research attention.

I'm Dutch yes, and although I do not particularly like oude kaas, you are probably right and I think the problem lies with translation... With over-aged, I meant cheese beyond a certain age (like 'overjarig' in Dutch). Generally speaking, the older the cheese the higher the tyramine content and thus the more likely and adverse reaction when eating said cheese while taking MAOIs.

The funny part was that you admitted to combining a MOAI with dexedrine and 4-FMP, and were happily proclaiming that 'even eating cheese does not cause me problems!'. It's especially funny when taken out of context, where it comes down to comparing 50-100 grams of cheese with 100-150 mg of 4-FMP. It had nothing to do with dick cheese of any kind or age whatsoever. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well I love the hell out of meph, but I am finding that it gives me ADD...if 4-fa can give me the same kind of stim but where it helps me focus instead of gives me more add then it would be a big winner.  I do meph mostly for the stim rather than the euphoria, the euphoria is fun, but I like how it gives me energy without being jittery like caffeine.  


Basically meph has a special place in my heart and I'll always love it but if I want to sit down and get to work for six hours on a project and focus cleanly it sounds like 4-fa may be able to provide me with that?  It does cost more than meph, but meph is probably going to get banned soon...

Hi guys, anyone has ever mixed this with MDMA? 


Im just looking for a push to the MDMA roll, I do not want to be floored, and I cannot get a hold on any stims besides this (I actually already have it)... I was thinking 80 mg should add the wanted stim, what do you gusy think?

^ yes do it.


Does anyone have any information about the stereochemistry of 4-fa?

like whats more active levo or dextro 4-fa?

High probability that both stereoisomers are active, just as with 'normal' amphetamine. If so, it's more about which 'activity' you prefer: dopaminergic or noradrenergic (although most people will obviously prefer dopaminergic activity).

^I ask because i have a sample, its definitely 4-fa and its certainly very pure.

I've recrystallized multiple times and gotten back almost all of it, i am absolutely certain of its purity.


except a threshhold dose is around 200-400mg and i've found i get the best effect from about an entire gram..


Now i've had 4-fa from elsewhere before and it was how everyone in this thread reports it.. active at 30-40mg.. strong effects from 200-300mg, any more and its overkill.

Just three question:

- Do you have an NMR or GC-MS-MS at home? If not, how can you be so sure that it is genuine 4-FA, while everything you report suggests it is anything but 4-FA?

- Did you wash the crystals before recrystallization and if so, with which solvent(s) did you wash the crystals?

- How likely do you think it is that anyone would bother with a stereoselective synthesis of 4-FA, and then on top of that: How likely would it be that said person would then choose to produce a stereoisomer of almost zero activity?

just 4 answer 4 u:


-no don't be a cock, i barely have enough for a kettle.

-I can be certain it is 4-fa by its reaction to marquis reagent

-no

-If someone knew what they were doing i'd agree, but cutting costs by using another route is a great way too save thousands in chemical synthesis.


So my question too you is:

Do you know anyone who has any constructive information about the stereoisomers of 4-fa?

refer them here please.


AND.. just in response to your statement above regarding regular levo-amphetamine, i'd like to state that levo-amphetamine is in no way even close to being a contemporary of dextro-amphetamines potency and obvious subjective effects.


So if we assume 4-fa follows the same rule as amphetamine, we can assume levo-4-fa is bound to be far weaker with subjectively less focusing and pleasant effects.

my experiences support this, but i'd like confirmation from someone who has tasted both isomers separately.


Better yet can i do an isomeric separation at home, easily?!?!?!

If you haven't washed the crystals, recrystallization does not provide a lot of evidence for purity. Furthermore, marquis reagent should primarily be used for negative identification (i.e. 'it is not...'). There are possibly hundreds of different chemicals that all give the same reaction as 4-FA. Besides that, heavily cut 4-FA might also still give a normal reaction with marquis.


You cannot do an isomeric separation at home.


My advice is to abandon the idea you are stuck with levorotary 4-FA and start searching for another vendor.

8)


would anhydrous acetone be suitable to wash it with?


How does 4-fa recrystallize? can you provide a description of the crystal structure? a photo?


Why can't i perform an isomeric separation? what is involved?


Seriously if you cannot answer these questions, stfu please.


I'm not going to give up my hunt for answers because a single fucking self proclaimed expert tells me too on a forum that frankly, is full of textbook professors.


I'd like to think that bluelight does actually have a place for real analytical science on it, but so far i have been let down by you 'harm reductionists' with nothing but pure speculation and unwarranted doubt.

If anyone on here sounds like a 'textbook professor', it is you. Asking for a photo of the crystal structure, what were you planning on doing with that? Put your 4-FMP under the microscope and see if it matches? ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


You can probably wash 4-FMP with cooled anhydrous acetone.


You can't perform an isomeric separation because:

1. You don't know what's involved

2. You can't pay what's involved

3. You seem to be lacking the required general knowledge of chemistry to not fuck it up


It's just hilarious how you are so convinced that someone sold you levorotary 4-FMP instead of just crappy shit or 4-FMP cut with crappy shit... I pride myself on being called a textbook professor by someone of your level. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

If you would not tell me to 'stfu' and respect what I have told you so far, I would be glad to tell you what you need. However, as I tried to explain to you before: Since this is all drug-business, the chance is more than 99% that you just got sold something shitty or something that's not 4-FMP. It's okay if you keep insisting that it is genuine 4-FMP, just try to understand that EZ-test is never 100% reliable evidence. Especially not with a substance like 4-FMP which does not give that much of a typical colour anyway...


For an isomeric separation, you would basically need a pressure system (like HPLC) with a chiral column or a column based on - for instance - specific cyclodextrins. Both are not readily available to the general public, and quite expensive. For some substances, you could try a stereospecific crystallization with an optically active resolving agent like tartaric acid. However, it seems to me that this approach is not fit for 4-FMP, especially not since you would first have to convert the (likely) HCl salt to freebase 4-FMP.

I thought you said you were sure it was 4-fa?  Anyways we can't identify what chemical you have over the internet.  You would need GC-MS to do that.  In fact even then wouldn't be able to tell between 3-Fa and 4-Fa which would need IR analysis.


Could be any of these or others...

Jesus kid, slow down and take a step back. You are asking some dumb ass questions, receiving valid answers, and then lashing out when they aren't the answers you are looking for? 


Really, read through this thread and see how you are holding yourself. It is disgraceful. Be honored that someone is even taking the time to answer your silly questions.. . time that you could have spent  thinking before posting and saving some potential embarrassment.


Sooooo....why are you *sure* it is 4-FA again? Certainty is a rare beast. It sure doesn't sound like it.  Reagents tests are designed to work as a process of exclusion. . you've got it backwards. 


Separating the isomers requires  mechanical separation (like using column chromatography) or chemical (like salting with out with an optically active acid, like tartaric) and is most certainly beyond your means. it is *highly* unlikely that you have the levo isomer alone.


This blind vendor trust in spite of evidence to the contrary is not in anyones best interest. Even if you may trust your vendor what about if *they* are getting hoodwinked by the manufacturers or distributors? 


Trust evidence and facts.


You cannot know what you have without access to analytical equipment.


And please refrain from being an ass to people that are patient and sympathetic enough to try and educate you.

I'm sorry but i don't accept **give up and try again**, as a useful answer when it comes to finding out what i've got here.


Amphetamines without a methylenedioxy bridge produce an orangish colour when applied to Marquis reagent right? 


I'm certain of it's purity and i'm certain its pharmacology shares an aspect of the accepted 4-fa's effects.


What makes it so hard to believe that the supplier chemically separated the substance too get the most active and favorable isomer before selling the shit to the vendor and then on to me?


whats so difficult about chemically separating isomers? 

Do you honestly believe its beyond a hobby chemists means to perform?


Tartaric acid is not difficult to acquire.

So can you give me a link with instructions on how i might be able to perform it?

Prices of 4-FMP when buying +10 kg are certainly below $ 1 per gram. This means most solvents become more expensive then the extra money to be made when separating the isomer. Since 4-FMP has only one stereocenter, the most likely consistency of the 'normal' product is racemic. This means you can - in the most favorable conditions - cut your good isomer on a 50/50 basis with an inert substance, while you get a lot of bad attention by selling the other isomer. Add to this the cost of the solvents, equipment and time involved and it is just very, very unlikely anyone would do this. Don't forget your inert filler will also have a price, since you want a substance that matches 4-FMP in terms of color/particle size and other features.

It takes *skill*, *patience* and *expensive equipment*. At least two of these three things are usually not available for vendors operating in the semi-legal drug-trade.

Yes it is. And btw, al your previous posts don't exactly give *you* any credit as someone that has even the slightest idea about what tasks a hobby chemist can and cannot easily perform.

Just get a microscope from ebay and put it on maximum zoom, have a look at some of the molecules, you should be able to see if there are two optical isomers or just one.


I know it probably seems like some people are ganging up on you, but take the "textbook chemists'" word for it tits, it's a complex procedure which is totally unnecessary for such vendors. Not to mention the fact that (assuming one isomer is inactive) this has clearly been cut way past 50:50, so it'd be a fool's move anyway, just driving away customers. We've not got some other agenda! 


A significant number of other amphetamines give an orange marquis reaction, and even then a 1:9 cut would still give a coloured reaction. As has been said already, test kits are for confirming that something is **not** present.

Hey TTT,


I'm still confused about what you are trying to get out of this.  Since you think your sample is only one of the isomers why would you want to perform an isometric separation?  You can always check if you got your hands on a polarimeter I suppose.  I'm guessing from your questions you might not know what that is eh.  Polarity has to do with the oscillation of waves. I haven't studied this crap in years but I do remember going a little cross eyed back in the day ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).


Ho humm look up how for transverse light waves their electric field will be at right angles to their velocity.  The field can either rotate about the direction of travel (important see NSFW pic below) or just point in one direction.


(nsfw just for size)


**NSFW**: 


![300px-Rising_circular.gif](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F4%2F41%2FRising_circular.gif%2F300px-Rising_circular.gif&hash=9253fe5e628e08c4a9dd03b9d32626b0)


The isomer mixture in neutral solution will polarize light passing through it.  So for a polarimeter you beam polarized light (which can be described as the vector addition of a left-hand circling polarization and right-hand circling polarization) and then measure how much it was polarized left or right to determine the ratio of L and D.


For isolation (though I can't possibly see how it'll get this far as if it turns out you do have just one isomer you won't want to do this and if it turns out you have both then the bioassay shows it's not 4-Fa) you'll want to look into an optical resolution.  I have no idea if this will work but just by pulling off the top of my head have the racemic freebase mixture dissolved in a nonpolar solvent and add either left or right tartaric acid to get proportionally more of the left or right amp salt to precipitate out and repeat.

ok, thankyou.

finally this information is actually useful, not simply, fuck off and buy it elsewhere.


As i said, bioassay gives the impression it is certainly somewhat 4-fa, it has the same onset and extremely similar taste.

Its effects however are far more peripheral than central, again i have taken it upto 1 gram doses, this keeps me awake for atleast 12 hours.. but euphoria is limited too the first say 10 minutes and at that it is not in any way spectacular.


Also, why is noone willing to do a comparitive recrystallization?

I realize it is not the most definitive method of identification.. but compared to subjective bioassay it is by far more useful.

^One of the reasons they aren't willing to help is because it is against the rules.  We can't be sure of what you have and it is a huge waste of time speculating like this.  Especially when we are speculating about such an unlikely occurrence.


I've given you enough terms as a starting point now to be able to do your own research on the internet, and spend your time and money on whatever you'd like.  I won't recommend anything past basic chemical (e.g. reagent) and physical (e.g. melting point, solubility) tests though.

It is not as if it would become an ad war if one were, i don't think these particular companies are into shilling.

Thankyou for finally posting useful information though ^ all the above.

I bought some 4-fa and am wondering what a good threshold dose would be?  I'm using it to help me improve focus to work on some projects, not really trying to trip on it.

Grrl, best thing would be to start at 20 mg, working your way up in increments of 5 mg if needed.

This is a real low dosage, but most people already notice improved attention span on such a low dose.


Personally I have tried it as a study aid up to 45 mg, and I have found that above 40 mg there is already too much stimulation to get any benefits from increased attention.

Like when I would listen to some music, I would just get lost in the music instead of focusing on the project at hand.

Be sure to have a bottle of water within reach btw, since 4-FMP is notorious for causing unquenchable thirst (although not that bad on such a low dose, obviously).

Tried this one out last weekend and I am very happy with the results. Took 100mg's in a bomb to start and tried a small bump around the 3 hour mark(bad idea). The burn is worse than meph......a lot worse. 


As far as effects go I use a 3 part system:

**Euphoria**-7/10.....almost as nice as mephedrone but it has slightly less entactogenic qualities

*Comedown*-6/10.....took a good amount of time to sleep but comedown was much easier than drone/lone

*Overall rating* 7/10....great substance that serves as a lite entactogen and euphoric stimulant. I was searching for a meph replacement and this seems like a good candidate

I just took roughly 20mgs. Although sadly I can`t be sure because my scale isn`t as accurate as I`d hoped it was. It`s been about an hour since I dosed. I`m not hungry,had the urge to pay some bills,dropped a deuce and can tell that I`m not sober. So I think I may try another 20-40mgs and see where that takes me. 

          Any advice?

I should mention that I have to work in the morning and so won`t be re-dosing after this last time. I guess for next time I`ll take a bigger starting dose. I just wanted to play it safe and start small for my first time.

Hey, from what I gathered, you trust your vendors but know it isn't 4-FA? You will not be able to separate the isomers, best thing is really to buy it somewhere else. Its cheap, practical, and the least wasteful. The similar taste you describe can be an impurity that is shared by both samples. What is the taste ? Mines is extremely bitter, and slightly sour.

When it was all said and done I did experience a caffeine-like crash although it wasn't quite as bad as one.  That is unfortunate as mephedrone does not have a crash for me.


However I think this drug is a winner overall.  I like it, it definitely gave me motivation and cut through my tendency to procrastinate.  It also got rid of my add and helped me focus.

So I`ve spent the last few days testing 4-fa. I started with a 20mg dose the first day. It was very underwhelming,I actually fell asleep for a few minutes about 45 minutes after taking it. 

                The next day I upped the dose to 60mgs for me and my girlfriend, She didn`t feel it at all and took a nap. i re-dosed another 40mgs and felt effects.  It felt like I had taken a small amount of speed,but it didn`t last very long. I still felt a bit let down but had gathered some important info in the process.

                 Today I took 100mgs on an empty stomach. I felt some really nice positive effects for the first time. It wore off rather fast and I ended up dosing another 100mgs a few hours later. I regained the positive effects and felt rather nice.

                   The only down side is that the euphoria (for me) doesn`t last that long. Maybe  60 to 90 minutes. Then I`m left with stimulation for a few more hours,which can be nice in the right setting.   I`m going to wait a few days and up the starting dose and see what effects I get.  I know I should be spacing the days between doses more  to avoid tolerance but I`m impatient and want to fine tune the amount for me. Overall, I think this is promising.

Is 4-fmp smokeable? Didn't find any information about that excepting one tripreport on erowid but I dont think that's objective.

And did anyone try more than 200mg oral? I think the best dose is about 250mg swallowed.

Has anyone had any addiction or habitual problems with this stuff? Can you eat on it?


I actually snorted a couple of 10mg lines yesterday at my mans, & yes it fucking hurts like hell. But it felt lovely, really smooth. Didnt last long but no obvious comedown. My nose bled a little this morning though & because it fucking hurts I'm dubious about purchasing. I actually like to snort phet, ket, methoxetamine, meph but this... nah! lol


If snorting 2c-e is a 100 on the pain scale & meph, say a 60... I'd give 4-fa a rating of 90! Yeah, it's NASTY!


Hows dabbing? I used to dab speed before dropping E at raves, back in the day, so as to reduce me pill usage. It worked well, I wonder if dabbing this will work. Either way, fucked if I'm ever snorting THAT shit again.


Oh and... although obviously it's quite bitter there seemed to be a subtle, sweet flavour underneath. Do you think it's cut with something? 2 x 10mg lines were effective, so IF it's cut it's lightly cut!

^ if by dabbing you mean sublingual, it worked fine for me.  But it is kinda gross tasting.  When I mix it in water and chug it the taste is very minimal, about 1/4 the taste dissolved mephedrone has.


I'm not going to bother snorting it.


I'm still playing around with the dosages and adjusting things.  I've found that 60mg + 1.6g of piracetam is a very meditative state, my mind is completely blank like what the goal is for meditation.


The next day I tried 60mg + 30mg mephedrone, and wow the mephedrone synergized quite strongly with it and the combo effects lasted at least 3 hours.  It felt like I feel on 120mg mephedrone alone, except it lasted longer.  The only thing that was odd is it seemed to make me empathetic on the level of mdma which may or may not be due to using mdma recently.


So this drug so far has serious potential for multiple uses.


Right now I'm concerned with getting tons of work done so I'm going to try again with 75mg by itself, and maybe dose 800mg piracetam later on.


What I love about this is that it gives me the super clean headspace where I'm just moving from one item to the next on my task list with no ADD or distractions.  Seeing how this is considerably less expensive than an Adderall script without insurance, I think it can be used effectively for cognitive enhancement.


When I have more time I plan to try comboing 100mg of 4fa with 60mg of mephedrone and see how that hits me for going out dancing. 


I'm starting to notice that I have a considerably lower tolerance for things than many other people.  I suspect that 100mg of 4-fa would blow me away given my experiences at the 40-60mg levels. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I haven't had any problems with it.  I have felt compelled to redose, but never have given into that namely because it ends up being like 8 or 9pm when I feel that, and I just really have no desire to mess up my sleep schedule unless I'm really "in the zone".  


I do find that it completely kills my appetite.  I am thinking that I need to do a meal plan and start setting timers, because I have issues when my blood sugar gets too low from not eating for 6+ hours.  I've lost several pounds in the last couple weeks, and my desire to eat unhealthy has really gone away.  The problem is that I really should be eating light meals every 3-4 hours and with no appetite it is super easy to forget until 6+ hours has gone by and I start feeling sick.  At first I thought this was the drug crashing, but I now know it was my diet being the issue and not the drug.  4-fa does have a bit of a crash to it, and it is similar to a caffeine crash for me, but it still works much better for me than caffeine and I don't get withdrawal headaches from it like I do with caffeine.

Thanks for your reply ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yeah, I'm with you regarding caffeine. Coffee downs suck! 


I've been reading alot about this stuff coz it's a facinating compound & I'd appreciate any links other than the usual erowid/wiki etc. I want to use it with respect & not "meph" my-fucking-self again. It's taken 6 months to gain the weight I lost on meph & I was hardly at it 24/7 or anything! But I've been on the fa all day today, at work & all I've eaten is 2 slices of brown bread at breakie & a beer Lol Did 100mg at 8:30am & had a cracking day at work. My works physical. Felt so good working hard & fast! I also bombed 75mg when I got home at 4pm, so that's NO food today. Not good. Been having fun racing Xbox touring cars, chatting to friends & smoking herb this evening big time ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Felt a redose urge about 9pm but it's too late so snorfed some mxe instead & that brought a nice headspace into the equation. Later start tmr so no panic hitting the sack yet. I'll smoke some shit & chill with some deep grooves or a crap horror Lol


BUT, I'm aware of this appetite thing early this time (unlike with meph) & I'm going to eat well now that my supply of fa is running low anyway. & before I get more. My gf loved this (& hasn't gotten on well with ANY stims or entactogens except our trusted old mdma) & neither of us could belive how good it felt & how little hangover was apparrent. I mean, what hangover? It was almost a shroom like afterglow of contentment! How can a compound that feels SO like E not give the usual blues in the following days, what action on serotonin is it having to produce MDMA-like effects without the MDMA-like recovery issue. Damned curious!


Girlygirl, you sound very clued up with this stuff, I'm a complete novice. Did I get you saying the crashing feeling (& subsequent redose urge) can be mitigated by eating? If it's just an appetite problem I can FORCE myself to eat at the proper times, but if I feel sick or wierd eating on a drug, it ain't gonna happen ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I need my weight to remain stable now that I've bounced back from the minor hold meph had on me last year.


Ahhh! Hunger came on a minute ago, so I'm scoffing a big, healthy bowl of muesli with soya milk right now ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) A BIG bowl Lol Gonna crash soon & if the herb & bad movies dont put me to sleep I'll bang down an Etiz at 11pm, I love them things!

Yeah I'm saying what I thought was a 4-fa crash turned out to be a blood sugar crash, because I felt good again after eating.  


I have noticed that I am more tired than usual when it wears off, but this has fixed my sleep schedule.  I no longer have insomnia somehow, which frankly was a worry for me since Erowid was reporting people developing insomnia from 4-fa.  Maybe because I haven't been redosing or doing large amounts.


I am seeing now the need to fix my diet and start eating on a schedule.  I honestly think if I do that then I'll lose weight the healthy way and won't be feeling a crash.


I love the mdma as much as you and your girlfriend do, in fact I've been using it quite often since I managed to finally get pure product and have figured out a safe pre and post-dose regimine.  But that is for my leisure time, what 4-fa does is make my work time more fun.  I'm not sure if that is affecting my 4-fa experience or not but I'm finding myself both much more empathetic and much less willing to put up with BS.  My anti-BS filter is as high as it was when I did LSD, and my empathy seems almost on par with mdma, but with less compulsive need to overindulge things.


I agree with you on the contentment afterglow ... I have worried a bit that I'm almost TOO content, like my anxiety has gone down, what I don't want to lose is my ambition for creating the lifestyle I want.  But I have found myself much less worried about things and not sweating "the small stuff" so much.  


If you haven't yet seen the movie Limitless I suggest you watch it, I found that inspiring, and that is what led me to try out 4-fa and piracetam.  I honestly think that if one is willing to be their own guinea pig and is willing to scientifically adjust their substance usage then they can unlock their full potential ... drugs don't just have to be used for partying or deep spiritual exploration but I think can actually be used as performance enhancement for life in general, if one is willing to be very honest about their experiences and is willing to constantly adjust the experience until they hit "the sweet spot".


I was able to find that sweet spot with mephedrone and it makes me sad that this drug is now up for schedule I ... but 4fa seems to have even more potential then meph as it seems to give me the things that Adderall promises to do.

Nope. I found the substance relatively benign  in terms of re-dosing and euphoria. The euphoria is very mild anyway.


IMO this stuff lasts far too long to be re-dosed. I foresee amp. psychosis with this substance for those with lack of self-control.

^ yeah probably best to skip the overnighters unless absolutely necessary.  If you feel you have to do that then give yourself several days for recovery and fixing the sleep schedule.


jblz - Comboing with m1 ... well I haven't had great experiences with the bk derivative so I stick with the original sassafras variety.  I may combo with molly at some point but I haven't tried this.  What I have tried is combo with mephedrone and IME it made the mephedrone about 4x more potent than mephedrone alone, so start with low doses if you're going to do a combo.  I also noticed a big effect when I took piracetam...so this drug definitely has some synergistic stuff going on with other substances so be careful.

^+1 with M1 + 4-MMC. Mephedrone is heavily boosted with M1. Though i would find Methylone to be a fairly useless combo with 4-FA. I'd rather take the methylone by itself than with 4-FA just because of the substances profile.


Methinks if you're going for a speedy version of methylone you should just switch to Butylone or m-Butylone. If you're looking for pure entactogen effects to compliment 4-FA try with a bit of MDAI or something similar.

^ I really enjoy low doses of 4-mmc + medium/strong doses of real mdma ... as long as I predose with some magnesium it is pretty amazing.


I'm surprised at how much longer 75mg of 4-fa lasts compared to 40-60mg ... it appears that there may be a strong tie between dose and duration.

I'm inclined to agree... tried my last bit of 120-125mg 4-FA orally a few days ago... was entirely too much stimulation for my tastes and i was awake for about 40 hours. After initial euphoria it really just seems to drag on.

Woah that IS some duration! In some cases this can be handy but the overstimulation sounds like an issue.

Well the energy it gives me is tons nicer than the energy 2c-e gives me.  When I do a big does of 2c-e then it is impossible to sleep at all.  I definitely don't get the jitters I get on caffeine or ephedra.


Last night i ended up staying up really late, not because I couldn't have slept, but because I just didn't feel like going to sleep.  If that makes sense.  I was pretty cranky though when it wore off.  I am still trying to figure out the relationships with food, I really think that if I eat healthy and exercise daily it will get rid of the negatives, but I'm only going on intuition.


But I feel good this morning, so no hangover, maybe a bit tired since I only got like 5-6 hours of sleep and I generally prefer 8-9 hours but not different than if I hadn't dosed yesterday.


I think it may be good to get ahold of some benzos if I'm going to keep going with this on a regular basis.


Looks like 2-fa is starting to hit the vendors, I wonder what differences that drug has to 4-fa?


At any rate the duration between 60mg and 75mg was many hours longer.  Probably best to stick to the lower doses.  I also don't think redosing is necessary, maybe just start with a large enough dose to get you a full day's worth of stim.  However it is possible that the considerably longer duration was metabolism-related and had to do with eating a huge meal right before dosing.

What's interesting is after a week of using 4-FA daily I woke up this morning and didn't feel like taking it, and my headspace is much cleaner and more focused than it was before I started taking 4-FA.  It's like it has balanced out my brain chemistry or something.  


I'm glad that it is easy to just stop suddenly and magically wake up feeling great instead of feeling like crap, that is a nice surprise.  ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Funny that you mention that. I really enjoy methylone(bk-mdma) but after a night of using it both myself and my lady feel kind of dirty and beat. I don`t get that feeling with 4-fa at all. To me that is a great positive,who doesn`t want to feel awesome after a night of fun when they wake up?

    Although for me I do feel the urge to want to do more if I have it laying about.

After a little more experimentation I feel this compound does bring a slight serotonin-type crash in the week if it is used at 100mg+ dosage more than once a week. This "crash" seems much lighter & shorter lived than that which occurs after use of MDMA, Meph, M1 or indeed normal speed, & still remains a firm favourite.


I've yet to try combinations but will ease in & keep my research up-to-date for those interested.


Hope you're well Grrl! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My friends took 100mg and I took 120mg oral and got borderline effects. We then proceeded to vape 40mg more, in 20mg portions, and it blew me the fuck away. Immediately after exhaling a fiery feeling raced through my body and I just sat there staring at the pipe thinking "Woah".


It produced a lot of vapor, I wouldn't recommended trying to use foil, get yourselves a meth pipe (glass rose) if you wanna inhale this. It didn't puddle very well and kinda left white granules in my pipe, which annoyed me as normally I use it for psychedelics and now there's speed all up in there ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I do get a "crash" from 4fa but it usually is around bedtime and as long as I get a good night's sleep I wake up feeling really good, like no depression, no mental fogginess.

I think I probably overdid it a little with my first gram. Musta had 3 or 4 runs with about 700mg or 800mg within one week & this probably explains my "Tuesday Blues" effect. I reitterate that this was pretty easy-going compared to other stims & entactogens.


Today I have had 2 seperate 50mg doses with the same amount of MDAI & I found some nice synergy & longevity with this combo. The doses are low because I am sensitive to this class of chems (& chems in general) & I weigh 50kg. Presently enjoying the second dose & am going to try doing some drum practice on it, while my neightbour happens to be out! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Using so many serotonin releasers in such a short period of time is likely to have negative effects.

Thank-you, I'm just working out the limits of this compound & unfortunately I don't tend to rely on anecdotal reports & need to find these limits myself.


Didnt eat a great deal yesterday. I DID eat, but not properly, y'know? Anyway, woke up a few hours ago, didn't feel too good, bit fed up, as expected. But, instead of my usual 2 slices of toast & off to work, I've had a proper breakfast, sausage, bacon, egg & fried tomatoes, & I feel 1000% better now. 


I'm much more aware of how this stuff affects me now & have stashed my remaining supply, just in case of spontaneous use & it'll be out of reach for the time being. I've had trouble with compulsive use of only one chemical so far in my life & thats Mephedrone. I'm really making sure 4-fa doesnt slip me into the same trap but I honestly doubt it's possible. Because, firstly, it's effects last much longer. Second, I dont (ie CAN'T) snort it. & third, because 4-fa's effects are muh more subtle & less pushy.


Drum practice yesterday was GOOD FUN!


Thanks again for your concern, don't worry I know what I'm doing. Now that breakie has gone down I honestly feel pretty much 95% back to normal. Not planning a busy wknd so, just gonna eat well & chill with my favourite drug, WEED! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Good to hear you are doing well. 

As far as combos go with 4-fa....so far I have just tried it with mdai. It added some empathogenic qualities to the experience but it still just wasn't that magic ahhhhh like drone/lone or mdma. Gonna try it soon with methylone to see how that goes.

I'm not too worried dear, I just don't want you to burn out on it.  4-fa is magic, it is not mephedrone and not mdma, but it certainly is a lot more worthy of a caffeine replacement than mephedrone is.  Somehow I wake up the next day with mdma afterglow headspace but feeling physically charged instead of physically drained like I am on a mdma afterglow.


Anyway food is super important!  I'm of the opinion that a large chunk of the issues people have with stims is related to the appetite suppressant effect and so they get issues from low blood sugar that are unfairly blamed on the drug.  I have noticed that the crash I thought I was getting from 4-fa went away completely when I started being more diligent about eating regularly and eating healthy food instead of junk ... it not only kickstarted my diet changes but it made the new healthy food seem to taste really good somehow.


I also noticed that I get tons less cranky on the comedown after using it for awhile ... it seemed I had pavlovian responses going on to the comedown because it felt similar to caffeine comedown so I kept expecting to feel the way I did after drinking energy drinks, which generally have a pretty bad hangover for me.  So I had to retune my expectations and not expect all these band withdrawals that never seemed to come with 4-fa but always seem to come with caffeine.  ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Seeing as I found 4-FA to be most effective snorted, I went ahead and bought a little empty nose spray bottle for spraying whatever you want in your nose. It should spray roughly .1ml of water after filling it with 1ml and spraying it empty several times. I added 3ml of water and 500mg of 4-fa, putting it at about 16mg per spray. I just spray three to four times and I feel fine. I read online a long time ago about a cocaine addict doing the same with a cologne bottle and knowing that snorting a dissolved chemical is much easier than it's solid form (Thanks mephedrone) I went ahead and tried this, and I feel little to no burn, and my sinuses aren't clogging up and I feel stimulated.


Very recommended.

^ thank you for this, I have often considered dissolving chemicals in saline solution and using a spray bottle to mist the chemical the way Flonase works.  Flonase has a really gross drip but doesn't clog the sinuses at all since it's liquid (and well it is also for allergies so it helps clear out the system anyway)

Just don't start making your best stash of MDPV into a solution for nose spray. You'll be highly disappointed a few hours later.

this post in itself may not be particularly helpful, and a i apologize if it is not, but...


i just ordered my first batch of this and i'm super excited to try it! it sounds like what i have been looking for. a stimulant that can be utilized in a variety of public environments such as work and school without attracted much attention or feeling so euphoric that you, the user, feel somewhat uncomfortable going about your business at work. or maybe that's just me that feels odd about that! haha. 


i will post back when i receive my order & let you guys know how it goes!

^ Please let us know your experience, 4-FA seems to be a wonder drug IME.


Compared to caffeine it is longer-lasting, not jittery, even though it makes me super thirsty to where I'm drinking tons of fluid I am not feeling the need to pee every 5 minutes like I do on caffeine.  


The comedown feels like a caffeine comedown, but it doesn't crash out the way caffeine does.  


Because the comedown feels so similar to caffeine comedown it took some time to remap my Pavlovian responses to those feelings ... I kept expecting to get caffeine headaches and other negative side effects like I do when I drink a pot of coffee or multiple energy drinks ... except it just wears off.


The only crashes I've really had with it were blood-sugar related, it definitely cuts appetite so you will want to pay attention to food and make sure you eat good foods often enough to avoid a blood-sugar crash.  Otherwise you'll blame 4-FA for the crash when it was actually just you not eating when you needed to.


It seems to not have a hangover, at least at the doses I've used, which are generally 60-80mg.


Compared to mephedrone it is not nearly as euphoric.  However it is much more focused energy, you can put full attention on whatever you are working on, and it has the effect of making you less prone to pay attention to distractions.  Basically the same kind of anti-ADD and anti-OCD effects that Adderall has, whereas mephedrone seems to increase ADD/OCD.


It does have some mephedrone-like euphoria, it just is not super strong.  It is easily just as sociable as mephedrone, it is super easy to hold conversations and it gets rid of all shyness the same way mephedrone does.  This is great for socializing, but it is a slight negative for the "study aid" effect and you'll feel somewhat inclined to call/text/IM/hang out with people instead of focusing on work, but if you do keep yourself focused on work then you can stay focused pretty easily.


Primarily it feels like a MDMA afterglow IME.  Very similar headspace to an afterglow, this warm feeling of connectedness and this self-forgiving kind of healing energy that makes it seem like everything is alright and that any problems in life are solvable.  The difference is that it is much more energetic, whereas MDMA afterglow generally leaves one feeling drained and devoid of motivation.


It doesn't really compare to MDMA other than headspace.  I don't notice any pupil dilation or rushing.  Music sounds great the way it does on MDMA, but your mental space seems sober.  If you like MDMA you may find yourself expecting to feel euphoria rushes on music, but you don't.  Nonetheless it still feels very good and is plenty of energy for dancing if that's what you're going for.  Frankly I think this would combine much better with MDMA than the usual stimulants found in most pills.


I really love the hell out of mephedrone but honestly 4-FA is giving it a run for the money.  I have used mephedrone as a caffeine replacement / anti-depressant before, but I don't think it is as good in that role as 4-FA.  Mephedrone just is not as focused or directed, it is more fun and euphoric, which is great when that's what you're after.  


But if you want to feel an anti-depressant effect, go to work and kick ass, then socialize after work, go to sleep, and wake up the next day feeling great I don't know if there is a better option than 4-FA.  


I really really hope that it stays legal and doesn't end up getting banned like mephedrone is about to...this really would be good in energy drinks, much better than whatever crap they have been putting in them.  It doesn't seem to lend itself to binging and abuse like mephedrone does and it has much less crash IME than caffeine.  


I don't think that 4-FA is the best drug for euphoria or rushing, but it may be the best drug for clean sober anti-depressant energy that lets you focus instead of being scatterbrained.

It definitely has some push in the cardio department. I have combined cautiously with methoxetamine recently & find the cardio push is greater but the increase in colour enhancement & CEV's is worth the slightly greater stimulation.


> I'm not too worried dear, I just don't want you to burn out on it. 4-fa is magic, it is not mephedrone and not mdma, but it certainly is a lot more worthy of a caffeine replacement than mephedrone is. Somehow I wake up the next day with mdma afterglow headspace but feeling physically charged instead of physically drained like I am on a mdma afterglow

Thank-you GG ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I too do not wish to burn out. I've been in the recreational dance scene in London for alot of years now & I've seen an many people who can't control their usage fall by the wayside & give it all up, while I continue onward & upward ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) I've always been a powerful advocate of responsible drug use & often deliberately distance myself from people who are overdoing things & won't listen to my advise. I had a mate back in the 90's who was teaching himself to DJ, on speed (amphetamine sulphate) at the weekends, & wouldn't sleep. He thought it was okay to stay up from Friday morning until midnight Sunday practicing almost incessaantly without food or sleep. Needless to say, he changed within a couple months from an pleasant enough chap to a complete fucking psychopath. I told him a dozen times, you cant do this, it'll fuck you up but he was a big, strong rugby playing South African & was convinced he was strong enough (physically) to handle anything. He didnt consider "psychological harm" a possibility in the slightest. So I backed off, stopped advising him when parties were ocurring & generally gave him space. He eventually lost his job & his gf & went a bit nuts for awhile before kicking the speed on the head & getting his head back together. Then he had the cheek to come to me & ask me why I let him get into such a state in the first place. "You got in that mess because you wouldnt fucking listen to me at the time, mate", was my responce!


&... poor guy he is STILL one of the worst fucking DJ's I have ever heard! lmao ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

The law seems rather vague here in the UK. I havent actually had anyone tell me the legitmacy of this compound who seems to know what they're talking about.


Personally, I find 4-fa more pleasant than meph coz it has less push, less euphoria & less rush. All these effects are ones I mitigate on mdma by using small, staggered dosings. I also feel that because of the longer duration of 4-fa, redosing is less compulsive. With 4-fa I'm doing 80mg, followed after couple hours by 40mg followed another 2 hours later by 20mg (I wanna avoid the 200mg mark). If that was meph, I'd start at about 30mg & each snorted line every 30 minutes or so would get bigger & bigger & I'd find myself really buzzing & unhappy about stopping & end up using TOO much & feeling dreadful the next day. I also have to take Benzo with meph coz it makes me very anxious, even more so on the comedown. I have no problems like anxiety with 4-fa.


We're calling 4-fa "fuckall" so my gf no longer has to lie to her work colleagues about her weeknds antics. If anyone asks what she did at the wknd she can just say, "fuck all" lol


Snorting liquid 4-fa could cause me meph-type problems but, having said that, I did enjoy snorted doses emotionally & physically but OUCH is fucking burns! I may consider it but with caution & an sharp eye on compulsive use...

I pushed myself to the limits yesterday to see what would happen...


The night before I went to bed around 12:30am and then woke up around 4am and instead of going back to sleep like I usually do I dosed 120mg of 4-FA and 1.6g Piracetam.  I ate a decent healthy breakfast and even though it started kicking in right away I was able to complete my meal.


I turned on my music and this song hit and it was magical: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM88ks931j0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM88ks931j0) 


I must have played it about a dozen times before trying to get to work.


For some reason at least in the first two hours every song I played sounded like it did the first time I took MDMA ... basically really really good.  No rushing though unlike MDMA or Mephedrone.


Anyway it was super early in the morning so I had no distractions or interruptions like I usually do.  I was able to sit down and work on my project for about 6 hours straight.  Then I started feeling weird and realized I needed to eat something so I had a small snack.  I then was able to work for about two more hours really effectively.


Considering I can usually only get like two hours work done in a day I was happy to have gotten eight hours done in a short period of time.


Anyway at this point I was super hungry all of the sudden, and it seemed like effects were wearing off.  I ate a big meal and dosed 2.4g piracetam and 35mg of 4-FA.  I tried to work but found myself incredibly extroverted and needing to socialize in a bad way, so I spent a couple hours socializing.  Then the 3 hours of sleep caught up to me and as energetic as I was I felt exhausted.  I guess the original dose was wearing off and because of the big meal it was taking awhile for the redose to kick in.  So I forced myself to nap even though I was really amped up.


I had some weird effects from the nap, the nap itself was very tossing and turning and the dreams were super weird and made no sense.  I slept for about two hours and when I woke up I had anxious rushing.  The 4-fa redose kicking in mid nap definitely triggered an adrenaline release.   


My heart was beating faster than usual like it would if I had just gotten in a car accident or something.  I was hallucinating in an odd way and having various psychedelic thoughts that reminded me of a LSD comedown.  It wasn't a lot of fun, I had to sit down and just calmly meditate with my eyes open and try to calm down the thoughts as I was worried about psychosis.  


I felt like I was being flooded with adrenaline the way I do if I'm in the middle of a deep dream and then am woken up suddenly.  Suffice it to say it was a bad idea to nap when I had just redosed on top of a big meal and it hadn't metabolized yet, I put myself into a sleep-deprived adrenaline-interrupted waking dream state.


Anyway I meditated for like 45 min to an hour or so and the adrenaline wore off.  Then it's like all the effects of 4-FA came back and I went back to work for a few hours.  I felt compelled to redose another 25mg as I was feeling good but wanted to feel more like the original 120mg dose.  I took another 1.6g of piracetam as well.


When the second redose hit I realized I had gotten like 14 hours of work done on my project and just didn't feel like working on it.  Instead I did the sorts of things I do on a recreational mephedrone trip.  Primarily listen to music, dance, and socialize.  I felt *extremely* extroverted and was having multiple text and instant messaging and IRC chats going on all at once.  It was the opposite of my usual introverted state.  I was posting lots of pics on facebook and that sort of thing.


At the same time I did still feel the effects of sleep deprivation.  I was tired and could tell I was artificially energetic.  And although earlier in the day the extroversion from the first redose made it super easy to talk on the phone, the second redose made it easy to text chat but I had a really hard time with verbal communication.  I just seemed unable to pay attention to what someone was saying to me vocally, and told the person I was talking to that he needed to text me because I was zoned out.


Anyway I realized that on the second redose I did not eat at all and that blood sugar crash hit somewhere at the same time as the 4-fa started wearing off.  When it wore off I was dead tired and hungry, so I snacked on a couple things, popped a 5-htp and went to sleep right on the dot of midnight.


I slept for 7.5 hours and felt like I was dreaming the entire time, I had weird dreams, and was tossing and turning in my sleep apparently since my sheets came completely untucked.  Usually after sleep deprivation the previous night and working my butt off and socializing I'd still be kind of tired and want to sleep another cycle but this morning I just feel awake and refreshed.  No hangover whatsoever, no compulsive need to grab the cup of coffee or energy drink to get going like I do when I'm taking equivalent amounts of caffeine for similar drug-binge sleep-deprived work sessions.


I've long said that I prefer mephedrone to caffeine, but the truth is that mephedrone is too euphoric and too scattered IME to take the place of caffeine when it comes to certain things like overcoming sleep deprivation to finish something when a deadline is looming.  4-FA gives energy drinks a run for their money, honestly, I really do think it would make the world's best energy drink if someone were able to make that happen.   For the amount of equivalent stimulation 4-FA has almost no side effects compared to similar caffeine and energy drink stimulation.  


The main issues I see are sleep deprivation and blood sugar.  No matter what stim you take sleep deprivation will catch up with you, you can cheat sleep for the short term but you'll feel it.  The appetite oppression is somewhat too good on 4-FA to where you forget to eat.  This is especially true if you're up for 30 hours or whatever, and remember eating several meals already.  The sense of time is kind of off, it is probably a good idea to get a timer to go off every 4 hours to remember to eat.  I don't know if its just me but when I haven't eaten in 6 or 7 hours I start feeling like crap, and it is easy to blame on the drug when in fact it was just not paying attention to eating patterns (which I guess is somewhat the drug's fault for killing appetite).  


The nice thing though about the appetite suppressant is that you don't feel opposed to eating, it is not difficult to eat like it is on other appetite suppressing drugs.  Healthy food actually feels and tastes healthy and there is no compulsion to overeat.  I think this could be used for dieting if one can set timers to remember to eat.  You can easily eat small meals throughout the day which is the best way to get high metabolism.  But the double edged sword is that it is super easy to forget to eat, and the time wonkiness makes it seem like you already ate recently but it could have very well been four hours since the last meal, and only feel like an hour from a memory perspective.


Anyway I am still very impressed by this drug.  It is not flawless, but I feel like it has far more benefits than negatives and that all negatives can be compensated for.  It honestly seems safer than caffeine, and certainly doesn't have the physical addiction and withdrawal issues that caffeine does.  It took some time to get used to the 4-fa comedown because it reminded me of caffeine comedown and I kept expecting to get migraines and wake up the next day needing coffee to function, but those issues haven't ever come.


I am completely sober today and feel well-rested and as if I did no drugs yesterday.  I feel calm and peaceful and in a good mood.  If instead I had binged yesterday on coffee or energy drinks I'd feel drained and anxious and depressed and like I needed a fix.  I do still feel extroverted, which is new for me since my whole life I have been pretty introverted.

Well, I finally got around to trying this stuff. I don't see what the hype is about personally. It feels clean enough and the price is right but I don't think it holds a candle to amphetamine salts, methylone, or MDMA.


If this was the only stimulant available it is certainly better than nothing. The serotonergic action is nice enough. I only took 100mg maybe it gets better at higher doses but I'm not all that interested to be honest.


Interesting enough to try once though. It's worth mentioning that I used to abuse adderall for a couple years and I lost the magic with MDMA long ago so I probably burned out quite a few receptors ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

A wizz it`s not. That being said I do really enjoy it for what it does have to offer. It`s a pleasant stimulant that makes socializing with others and playing guitar or listening to music extra nice. The one and biggest downside it has is (for me) it`s very short duration. I feel it coming on fast,lasts about an hour then trails off into a low level stimulation that can be annoying. It does seem to  have a cumulative effect,where if I redose over the course of the night my jaw will start to grind.

     I would really like this chem if it lasted a bit longer.

^sounds like you're getting 4-fluoro-methcathinone


4-fa comes on strong, plateau's like that for about 3 hours and then slowly trails down..


The cathinone is alot weaker and shorter acting... i should know i used up half a page of this thread arguing about it. ![:o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png)

I ended up redosing and went to a total of 210mg. Last dose was 10 hours ago and it is still going.. definitely *not* a short duration drug


I smoked a little JWH-122 and drank some kratom and I'm feeling pretty damn nice. I usually get bad comedowns from stims but this is exceptionally smooth. 


I doubt I'll do it again, but if I do it will be one single dose of ~175 or less.

I have to side with tits, 4-fa lasts a long freaking time change-jug, it sounds like a different drug from your description.  You'll feel 4-fa for at least six hours even at low doses; while the euphoria wears off early in the trip it certainly keeps you stimulated for a very long time.

It totally works and it doesn't taste that bad. I put 20-30mg in a meth pipe at a time and vapourized, effects were definitely felt by the time I had consumed about 50-60mg.

I had 2 years ago some yellow colour 4-fa from a well known EU vendor that now changed to a new name. All i can say is bad side totally out weights the good.... It was smooth ride, very amphetamine like with a mdma push toward the peak, but after 2h started to comedown really bad, with severe high temp (on the bring of fever), and very high heart rate, that made me totally paranoid, and freak me out. ALso next day big hungover. Im now wondering if had a bad batch of 4fa, or did this happened with anyone else?

So much good reports are making curious again about this compound.

It's possible the batch you had was impure, I have never seen yellow, everything I've had is pure white, not even off-white.


However from the effects it sounded like you got the real product.  So my questions for you are:


1. did you eat regularly?  blood sugar crash can make you very sick and is easy to mistake for a hangover


2. did you take way too much?  4-fa isn't mephedrone, for me 120mg was extremely strong, I recommend keeping doses as low as possible


3. were you sleep-deprived?  if your body is super tired and you're using it to keep you awake you may find the comedown unpleasant.


4. did you combo with anything else?  especially caffeine?


The only issues I've had with heartrate was trying to nap during the come-up...my normal resting bpm is around 50-60, but every time I've napped on it then my heartrate goes up to 84bpm and I get some adrenaline release, and I find that unpleasant.  Napping on come-up or peak definitely released adrenaline and is not recommended.


I've only once gotten paranoia on it and that was entirely set/setting related.  But that can happen on any stimulant.

I just checked back in here for the first time in a few days. Interesting to hear the idea that I`m not getting the real thing......it never crossed my mind. I`m not being a smart ass either. I guess I just took it for granted that I was getting the real thing. I think next time I`m going to check out a different vendor. I blew through a gram in 3-4 days the last time I had it,starting last Thursday till Sunday afternoon. I wasn`t up the whole time,I slept every night for a good 8 hours each night. Then after starting my day would get high.

                  I thought it was just the way that the chem effected me that it only lasted so long. I`m kind of excited to give it a go from a different source.

^ cool, good luck and post your results here if you can ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I bought 4-fa from two very highly rated vendors, and both batches are identical in consistency.  So I have high confidence that I got the real thing.


OTOH I have had 2c-e and mephedrone from different vendors, and different batches have had different potency and effects.  So when a new chem looks promising I try to test it out from at least two different vendors before making an assessment, as the product quality and legitimacy can vary.

I had such a beautiful amazing experience on 4-fa/mdma/piracetam last night.  I rolled with my brother and it was the cleanest and happiest roll I've had in ages.  For the first hour or so it was like my very first roll.  4-fa really took away any of the "e-tarded" feelings, my headspace was perfect and crystal-clear.  I had nice euphoria rushes and slight eyewiggles, but it wasn't speedy at all.  I'm going to write up a trip report after I've taken a nap since I'm going on 3 hours sleep.  But if I had gotten a full 8 hours sleep I feel like I'm more functional from mdma+4-fa afterglow than from mdma alone. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I really enjoyed this compound a few years back as it was my first or second empatogene experience. It wasn't really punchy but i had some fucking great time without been totaly smashed (until i put some methylone on the mix --> overheated!)! Did someone tried to take some 2C-D on the comedown? 


Hehe i want to give it an other try, like in the good old times! Cheers!


And sorry but what is flux? I find that piracetam and rhodiolia rosea fight well against the e-tard feeling. GBL too, but be carfull not become G-tarded if you dose too much^^

Tried 2FA for the first time yesterday.  Started with 1mg allergy test followed by 35mg a hour later with 1600mg piracetam.  I was aware of the stimulation even at this dose as my heart rate went up and I had increased perspiration.  Maybe a slight mood lift but nothing I would consider euphoric?

Any time I've heard 2-FA mentioned it's been as a less recreational, more study focused version of 4-FA, I think you'll be lucky to get much euphoria at all.

Is it safe to take benzo (xanax or diaz) with 4-FA. I usually find amps make me very anxious on the come up, ok after that

 so I was thinking a small dose of benzo before the amp kicks in might smooth it out a bit, good idea or not ?

^ 4-fa has a very smooth come-up, and really shouldn't make you anxious, especially if you're doing reasonable doses instead of heroic doses.


That being said a friend of mine has taken xanax on it and he had no ill effects or weird interactions from the combo, so it seems plenty safe.

**4fa, mpdv questions**


the first RC i was introduced to was mpdv. i was told about it (by someone who knew about RCs but not enough to inform me of other kinds and drawbacks i guess) because i was complaining that i cant find any adderal and vyvance for  appetite suppression and to aid in wakefulness and productivity


i was told later 4fa would suit my needs better. what are any particular drawbacks to 4fa? the mpdv makes me sociable as well which is good, but it makes me bloated and makes my gums hurt and the comedown sucks

This is a fabulous substance.  Better IMO than 4-MMC or bk-MDMA.  "Cleaner" VERY euphoric, tons of energy and in lower doses, concentration.  Long lasting.  In lower doses, it feels like Adderall.  In higher doses, it feels like a 3 hour long "orgasm" with energy.  


This may sound a little odd to some people, but I find this stuff MORE fiendish than mephedrone, and probably the same or possibly a bit higher than coke.  To an occasional responsible user, this is a GREAT substance....always in moderation folks!!!!!!!!!!

I agree, there is definitely a sweet spot, I think 50-100mg is a good sweet spot.  Good concentration, good mood, and stimulation.


Did anybody else take closer to 200+mg?  I don't know how much I took to two times i've tried this chemical but I do know that one session was around 500mg over the course of the day.  My pupils were EXTREMELY DIALATED.  I mean so much that I could just barley make out a small green circle around my pupil.  I did get some minor visuals as this does...I probably over did it that time.

It seems the new batch is an entirely different texture than the last, which mostly resembled salt.  The new stuff is a clumpy white-ish powder that also smells very different when snorted and burns far less.  


Think I liked the old stuff better ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


Still dig it though.


*Only side effects I've noted on 4-FA so far have been diarrhea on the comeup, jaw tension and an ADHD-like effect in which I feel restless but can't decide what to do.  Can sleep on it much easier than propylhexedrine, and it doesn't seem to raise my blood pressure as much from what I can tell (no lightheadedness when standing up).  Good stuff.

update!


Glad everyone's well here, interesting reading about your travels GG! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I combined M1 & 4-fa for a party a few weeks back. Doses were 15mg Methylone & 35mg 4-fa each, in three bombs. Worked beautifully, had a great night dancing about & chattings shit. Didnt feel too bad afterwards, despite sleepless night.


Also, I recently suffered a mild chest infection which, as I'm asthmatic, made breathing slightly difficult. I spent one evening worried that if the condition continued I'd end up in A&E. The next day the asthma was worse, so I dosed 4-fa in the evenin when my gf came round coz I didnt wanna be anxious about an asthma attack & suspected 4-fa stimulating properties would act on my lungs. & I was right, felt fine all evening, no tight chest, no anxiety over the illness & the next morning my lungs had cleared a little. I've almost entirely kicked the cold now but still have a slight cough.


So, all good here & I hope the sames with all you's! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

15 mg MDMC, are you sure? Looks like perhaps you omitted a 0, because 15 mg MDMC and 35 mg 4-FMP would barely have any effects in most people, let alone feeling a clear contribution (i.e. synergy) of the 15 mg MDMC in this combo.


> Were they both better together than each of them apart?
>

I would say so, yes. 4-FMP adds focus/clearheadedness to the MDMC (unless you overdo it ofcourse), while MDMC lengthens/increases or bumps (if taken as a supplement) the euphoria of 4-FMP - which most people consider relatively short in comparison with the residual stimulation. Only drawback of this combi is that both substances (especially MDMC) can be somewhat fiendy, which becomes particularly pronounced if you keep taking small bumps of MDMC.

I get these, "are you sure, you're not missing a 0 here are you?" questions ALOT. I'm very light & small, 50kg & 168cm. I'm very fit & lean. I also, after more than 20 yrs experience, definitely have a greater sensitivity to psychedelic & stimulant compounds than most people. I have also used entatogens, stims & psychedelics very sensibly & have very litle tolerance.


These doses may indeed have very little if any effect in "most" people, but not me. I felt this combo without question & enjoyed it thoroughly. Bear in mind that once I'd finished dosing I'd had 45mg of bk-mdma (M1/Mehylone) & just over 100mg of 4-fa. I LOVED it ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

as i've got adhd this appeals greatly to me (for college/projects etc) however if it is closely related to 4-mmc, having a previous habit with that shit... is it going to create a crave?

For those who are interested in combos with 4 Fa, try MDAI. That combo quickly became my favorite combo after the first time I had it.

Why should Adamski stick to dextro-amphetamine in your opinion? I find 4-FMP to be much less prone to abuse than dex, plus the feeling in low dosage is much more natural. This might partly be subjective of course, but still I am wondering why you say 'stick to the dex'. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This new batch was way better than what ever I had before. How ever I noticed that on my third day doing it I began to feel off balance and a bit wobbly about 2 hours into the session. I don`t believe I topped 100 to 120mgs today spaced out over 2 doses.

   Has anyone here had any similar negative or worrying symptoms  from 4-fa?

Not before, but after doing a stupidly large amount in one night, 4-FA and 4-FMA combined gave me some of the worst depression I've ever had from a substance for 3 days after. My poor serotonin system ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) 


I REALLY think this substance needs to be used responsibly.

QFT and even then be careful. 4-F(M)A was a lot of fun (though not nearly as much as, say, mephedrone, or even dexamp, to me) and had very unique euphoria distantly related to Methylone or weak MDMA; but, for me, the side effects FAR outweighed the enjoyable parts of them...


Though keep in mind, my dose was irresponsible. I suppose that should be expected ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My reasoning might be partly subjective as well, but matter of an opinion coming from someone that has both ADD and ADHD and has used d-amph successfully for over 12 years with only uping the dose once. I guess I would have to play more with a continued dose of 4-FMP, but it just wasn't cutting it when I did research with it. Then again, everybody is different.

This thread is on a "roll", lol!


Can I ask anyone with experience with BOTH 4FA and M1 (Methylone) to compare them?  I do enjoy both, but I definitely feel more body "rushes" with 4FA.


Can anyone give any insight on your experiences with the two?

@FlyBoy81--


Here are my comparisons:


Methylone:  more entactogen/serotonin type of euphoria; shorter-acting; more intense comeup and body high.


4-FA:  more stimulant/dopamine type of euphoria; longer-lasting; less like MDMA.


YMMV


I've taken a liking to combining low doses of the two, though I'm starting to realize I like m1 a bit more than 4-FA...the latter irritates my stomach and makes me kind of tense/irritable, but I like it.  My first batch (4-FA) was better than this current powder one.

I tend to disagree here. The 'magic' is pharmacologically defined and thus can be pharmacologically reproduced by similar compounds. Although I do agree there is a different feeling to 4-FMP and MDMC, your statement seems more like you are putting MDMA on a pedestal - which is uncalled for. Take for instance the euphoria experienced when combining 4-FMP with a small dose of 2C-D, this is virtually indistinguishable from the euphoria experienced when taking regular MDMA.


The most pronounced difference between MDMA and MDMC/4-FMP is the increased dopamine release/reuptake inhibition of the latter two. This causes a more clearheaded and energetic feeling, which indeed gives a different headspace. However, lots of adventurers actually like the clearheadedness better than the typical MDMA-feeling, which is why I believe a subjective term like 'magic' is better replaced by a more objective description of the actual feeling. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I now am really questioning the quality of 4-FA out there because some of the reports I'm hearing in this thread sound crazy to me.  I understand the feeling of a drug is subjective but I can't imagine how anyone would think dexamp is better than 4-FA.  To me dexamp is just speedy (enjoyable and slightly euphoric but nothing compared to 4-fa). 


I am a veteraned MDMA user and have done dexamp many times also.  I have now done 4-FA a few times (all from the same batch) and it was fucking magical.  I mean to me it was pretty similar to MDMA.. maybe even better.  I didn't notice a huge difference.  Maybe the 4-FA you guys are getting is shit? I dunno, I know it's all subjective but 4-FA was intense and just had this amazing body buzz and was just fucking unbelievable feeling.  Every time I've done it I've done 170mgs.. i'm a 180lb male. 


My first few times I also re-dosed with M1.. which was awesome but the comedown the next day was pretty rough.  Has anyone else had glowing experiences like this?

I've tried both MDMA, Methylone, and 4FA, and they are all great!!!  I've done MDMA twice, Methylone maybe 3-4 times and 4FA twice...They are all "magical" but you really have to limit how often you take them (the one month rule is probably good for all three of these chems).


There is something about this stuff....4FA.  I mean it a was really magical experience.  It's hard to put a finger on it, but when I think about the experience, I was like "holy shit, that was incredible".  Kinda similar to my first experience with opiates.


I can't help but make comparisons to MDMA, M1, and 4FA...

That's what I'm saying.  Don't get me wrong, MDMA is awesome but I literally wouldn't say it's better than 4-FA. Again, subjective, but to me it is very similar.  I do need to experiment more with 4-FA being it's only been under 10 times and my MDMA has been well over 50 times throughout my life but this substance wow's me just as MDMA did when I first discovered it in high school.

What traditional stims are you referring to? I ask because there are a lot of stims I've never tried before so I'm trying to get an idea.  I have never tried meth before so I can't compare it to that.  Would you say it's similar to meth? 


Also, not sure, but I think my dose was on the higher end.. I hear most people dosing 4-fa between 120 and 150mg but I usually dosed 170.  Do you think that has a profound effect on my differed experience? I agree that the empathogen effect is somewhat lessened with 4-fa (although it's presence is undoubtedly there).

@3rd I: sure thats partly true. but this is a 4FA thread, not a "what can you combine to get MDMA like effects". not to mention mixing 4fa and 2c-d even at the perfect doses, will NOT be exactly like MDMA. MDMA is MDMA. 


sure 4fa makes you feel loved up and want to hug and fuck everyone. but MDMA makes you "understand" why you want to love everyone. 


Not to mention im sure a lot of people posting here havent tried high purity MDMA. 


4fa feels like a shitty thizz pill. and seeing as how the average amount of MDMA in a E tab right now is ~40mg, and most tabs ive come across have none in them at all, id say there are many who have yet to actually experience the magic. try a 100 mg line of GC/MS and NMR tested 99% pure MDMA and tell me if its anything like 4fa, because its NOTHING like 4fa.


theres a flourine at a 4 position, and an MD ring at the 3,4...there a HUGE pharmacological difference and the balance of monoamine function that MDMA produces is one of a kind.

^I would have to agree with nut man. I've had 4-Fa several times from several vendors. I know where the best 4-Fa is and it doesn't compare to even a low dose REAL mdma roll.


Don't get me wrong at all I like 4-Fa, it just doesn't give me that roll like mdma. Neither does m1.  Now high doses of either mixed with MDAI? that's a whole different story.

Don't you think we should try to keep this discussion limited to the (verifiable) facts? These kind of debates where people that disagree are 'probably getting unpure or mislabeled product' don't really lead to anything. Besides that, in my country of residence there are free drug tests and 4-FMP was widely available in headshops until a few years ago, so I am pretty sure that even if your assumption holds true it does not apply to me, my friends and all the people from my local scene. Free drug testing, abundant supply of A-quality XTC/MDMA, and (legally) available 4-FMP for the past 15-20 years or so...


For the rest of your post, I generally agree that 4-FMP is not the same as MDMA. However, I have never stated otherwise and merely tried to point out that some people (including you) report the effects of MDMA very subjectively, while there are also people that do not like certain aspects of MDMA and thus are more interested in a 4-FMP type of high. If you think 4-FMP feels like a 'shitty thizz pill' that is fine by me. However, I know at least 20 people that prefer 4-FMP over MDMA, while 150-180 mg dosed tablets (pure MDMA) are more or less the **rule** where I'm from. So again: Your subjective presumption about the quality of other people's supplies does not hold true.

Well said.  I agree. I feel that too many posts are just subjective opinions but people stating them as facts.  I too have posted my subjective opinions but I labeled them as being so.  Also, you can't assume what anyone's quality of mdma is. 


I'd like to hear some peoples opinions on the body buzz/rush on 4-fa.  I found it extremely profound and a little more intense than MDMA.  Anyone else?

yes the body rush is more profound, because its an amphetamine stimulant with hardly any serotonergic properties. emoticon sad face emoticon sad face.

Hey! I personally found that 4-fa & MDAI did NOT work well together. I can't really put my finger on it, but it just didnt feel right, felt kinda anxious & lasted a bit toooo long. I only did it once & didn't enjoy it so I havent repeated the experiment. 


Careful with this combo, just in case my experience is a sign of contra-indications.

The "traditional stimulants" I`m referring to would be amphetamine,dextroamphetamine,Adderall(a mix of amphetamine salts) and Ritalin(MPH). I have yet to come across methamphetamine or use it.  What I mean is that 4-fa gives focus and drive,much like the chemicals I mentioned but with an added euphoria. But,the euphoria isn`t as overwhelming as mdma or methylone. I just dosed 90mgs and felt for me that might be a bit too high of a dose. Although I do dose repeatedly over the course of the day/night. Not a binge as I go to bed at a normal time,but I like doing smaller doses spread out across a few hours.

Interesting.  This has me thinking now about different batches of 4-fa going around.  I found no similarities with adderal. I always dosed 170mg, never less, and felt such an intense body buzz, extreme euphoria, and a pretty decent empthananogenic quality (not as much as MDMA but still a decent amount).  


Of course euphoria and other effects are subjective but I really found no similarity with dexamp or ritalin.  To me those are just like straight stims, not much euphoria, I would almost be willing to compare it more with MDPV than 4-fa.


I wonder where the difference in effects felt per person come from.

I think dexamp has a nice amount of euphoria to it. 4-FA has a lot more but not as much as mdma or mdmc. At least to me. I do really enjoy it though and I think it blows mdpv totally out of the water(I don`t get any euphoria from it).

  I`m sure if I dropped 170mgs I would feel a TON more good feelings. But I tend to get a upset stomach and mildly pukey if I take too high of a dose. 90 mgs had me reaching for the mylanta. Do you take yours orally? I do but have been thinking of intramuscular injecting it.

the real problem i see is miscommunication of terms. euphoria means a lot of different things to people. some people say dexamp is completely non euphoric, some say it is. etc etc. these things must be qualitatively agreed upon or something. 


4-fa oral is the way to go.

This is not really a question that can be answered unequivocally, since this largely depends on your dosage and - besides that - it is a typical 'YMMV' kind of factor.

So now, instead of the purity of other people's MDMA, it is their definition of 'euphoria'? Does it not seem a lot more logical to assume that not every single person experiences a chemical - like dextro-amphetamine - exactly the same? Making it more than likely that some people report euphoria where others do not. As for your suggestion for a qualitative agreement on the exact definition of euphoria: It's [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria) (notice the 'sometimes induced by the use of psychoactive drugs' ?). Perhaps [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine#Psychological_effects) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine#Psychological_effects) will also interest you.

I agree 100%. Intramuscular injections of any amphetamine immediately raises questions. However, i.m. bioavailability is likely comparable to i.v. bioavailability, making it a valid alternative in that respect.

Thanks for the thoughts on IM`ing. I haven`t tried it yet or really have any desire to go that route. I thought I had read about IM`ing either in this thread or somewhere else on BL.Meh,no biggie.

   I have tried rectal 4-fa. It was alright. I`ve only gone that route twice(with this chem at any rate). I felt that while I could use less of the substance to get similar effects(a good thing),it also came on and wore off a lot faster as well(not always a good thing). YMMV

  In regards to using the term "euphoria",I agree that it`s very subjective term that will change from person to person. 

If I were to describe the effects with out using the word I`d have to say that it produces feelings of love,excessive talking/rambling,enhanced music enjoyment,some sexual enhancement,lack of appetite,energy,some focus,sleeplessness and general mood lift.

do you mean the "main effects" came on and wore off much faster or was there still stimulation present after the initial effects (and most desirable ones IMO)? I couldn't sleep until t +10h and would prefer it if the stimulation following the initial "euphoria" subsided much quicker.

Both. The main effects wore off(for me) in about 4 hours and I was able to be in bed and sleeping 2 hours after that. I might have taken a benadryl to help me get sleepy but I`m not sure.

 I should mention that I don`t seem to suffer from any prolonged stimulation from 4-fa,no matter what batch or vendor used. But rectal admin definitely sped up the time frame and all effects wore off much faster.

Sorry if this is asked before but id like to know if its possible to take a normal dose of 4-FA when youre on celexa (SSRI)? As i understood it its less serotonergic than for example mdma? Will it work at all? And should i worry for serotonin syndrome? Thanks!

^towards the beginning of 4-fa being a commercial item there were some large bunk batches that got passed around. there was also 4fa labeled as 4fma. it took a few months for the real deal to actually show up.

Does anybody notice any massive fatigue a few days after taking 4-fa? Last week I took some Monday and Tuesday(or maybe it was Sunday and Monday) and by Wednesday even after a good full nights sleep I was just super tired. 

    I`m not a napping kinda guy at all, but Wednesday and Thursday I came home from work around 2:30pm and was falling asleep watching tv by 4pm. Then I went into the bedroom and took a 2 hour nap(on both days) got back up around 8:30,ate,then went back to bed by 10pm.

  It was very aggravating to be so sleepy so constantly!

    So it got me wondering if I was so tired from the 4-fa earlier in the week. Even though I went to bed at a regular time on the days I dosed and didn`t really do any thing more physical than normal perhaps my body still needed a rest?

^^ I have not noticed any prolonged fatigue except for obviously the day after dosing; but I've also never taken it two days in a row like  you.  I normally dose 170mg 4-fa and then at +4 I dose the same amount of methylone which is awesome but leaves me wicked tired the next day. I've done this only a few times and always spaced out a month or more in between.


Last night however, I dosed 170mg 4-fa and at +4 instead of methylone i did another 170mg of 4-fa.  I feel much less tired and "hungover" today.  I think from now on I will not be combining the two since it leaves me with a shitty next day hangover.  Also noticed less intense jaw clenching than with the combo.

I forgot to ask, has anyone else experienced this:  Every time I take 4-fa later that night and the next day my tonsils and uvula are all red and inflamed and soar.  Wtf is up with that? I am not snorting it as you might think.. only have ever taken it orally. 


Anyone else experience this?

its probably impurities due to the shitty synth. but 4fa is also known to fuck up nasal tissue so its possible you just fucked it up a bit, it burns longer than other drugs ive snorted. still, i only have throat problems when theres impurities.

it could also be an infection from bacteria that found its home in your throat flesh that was burnt up by the 4fa.

Yea, I'm going to look into this.  This weekend was the first time I took 4-fa alone.. usually i dose it with some methylone after the 4 hour mark.  I'm going to try methylone alone next and see if that has any effect on my throat.  It's just weird.

That reminds me, has anyone ever tried dope (or any sort of opiate) along with 4-FA?  I can imagine since they both are awesome that you would feel duper awesome but I wonder how much the sedative effects of opiates would affect you?

Worse for your heart than a traditional speedball? Or are you just saying any time you mix depressants with stimulants it's bad for your heart?

mixing uppers and downers isnt the BEST idea, but its not super bad. although opiates in general arent heart-friendly, and serotonergic stimulants (such as 4-fa) probably agonize the 5ht2b receptors, as well as increasing heart rate and such at the same time. thats why speed balls are so bad IMO. many have died from it. 


not worse than a traditional speedball (esp. because a speedball is usually shot up) but ive never "really" done it (ive only mixed a few codeine) so im sure theres other members who are much more knowledgeable on the subject than I

Makes sense.  Pharmacology isn't my strong point.  I was under the impression that speedballs were only considered dangerous and that all the deaths attributed to it were because of the higher than normal dose of respitory depressants that people use when mixing with stimulants?  For example: Say I normally get off on 10mg's of heroin.  But when I speedball, the coke makes me feel like I can do much more heroin so I up the dose to say 40mg.  While the cocaine is still active I am fine but once the coke wears off (which is much sooner than the opiate wears off) I am now fucked with a very high dose of heroin than I am used to and suffer from respitory failure... therefore dead. 


That was always my understanding of why speeballs are so dangerous... but if you are willing to keep your normal opiate dose the same then you would be fine.  Again, pharmacology = not my forte.. so I am willing to be schooled.


Also, sorry to derail thread.  In other new, I am awaiting a shipment of 6-abp which I'm EXTREMELY excited for.  As well as some mxe and mpa.  I've heard different accounts on mpa and some say it sucks and some like it.  I heard the same about 4-FA and I fucking love that shit. Should be good.

Kinda like drinking a lot when you're doing coke. Then when the coke wears off, you're just completely hammered. I've definitely been in that boat before.![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I agree..."speedballs" are EXTREMELY euphoric!!  But I would do the stimulant first, and as the stimulant euphoria is beginning to peak, then do the opiate...  If the stimulant is just coke, do them simultaneously, but if it's an ampetamine, stagger them that way.


I can still "nod," but the nod is different....

Have any of you tried this stuff at WORK???  I know that 100mg is way too euphoric to not seem high as a kite at work....


What would be a good dose for work?  I'm talking something similar to coffee.  A dose that will wake you up, help you concentrate/work better, put you in a better mood, but NOT make you appear too fucked up (pupil dilalation, appear tweaked, etc.)

30-40mgs at work (if youre experienced with drugs/enactogens) will probably be very similar to taking adderall at work. make you more productive and outgoing. dont make a habit of it though, and dont do too much because then youll end up trying to make out with a customer or rub their head or something haha :D

I tried this at work today...I did 45mg and really didn't feel a whole lot...maybe like a cup of coffee or something.  Four hours later I took a little over 50mg (55 max), and I thought that was the perfect dose...I didn't feel tired and was feeling pretty good but not too fucked up or anything.  Pupils maybe slightly dialated, but not enough to draw too much attention.


I feel 50-60mg would be good for a work type enviornment.  Anything over 60mg I think would draw too much attention as I have done 125mg followed by 100mg, and was practically rolling ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

has way too much serotonin activity for that, imo. my pupils are already saucersize at 30-50mg. and it's too tingly, i don't want to do that too often (tingling). 

i'm OK with the occasional crumb of regular amphetamine in the morning (preferably dex), but then a real subtle dose-- that actually feels lighter on my system than drinking coffee throughout the day.

damn, even at a light dose I can't see 4-FA being a "functional" drug.  Clearly this is all subjective but IMO dex is perfect for that but 4-FA is just way too fun.  Did that little bit really last for 4 hours? 


I love this stuff.. i'm curious as to what people would think mixing it with 6-abp?

not sure about the 6-apb, as i've never tried it, but 4-FA on its own is so incredibly stimulating that i can't imagine combining it with another upper.


135 mg taken orally along with 2 friends (on the same dosage) led to 3 or 4 hours of shockingly strong MDMA-esque euphoria followed by another 4 hours of pleasant speeding.  spent the entire night jabbering away at each other, listening to techno and dancing like maniacs.


The initial phase of 4-FA feels like a more energetic, speedy, clearheaded version of MDMA.  Like MDMA without the sloppiness.  Too often when I roll I feel so smacked out and caught up in the body rushes that I can't even move or interact properly with anyone.  This can be an amazing experience, to be sure, but sometimes you want to have a little more control over yourself...


in medium doses (120 - 150 mg), 4-FA seems to offer the perfect balance between the robotic focus of regular amphetamine and the all-encompassing bliss-overload of pure molly.  it provides the same feelings of openness, trust, and empathy, along with the clarity and energetic drive of regular amps. 


-------


however, the story is slightly different for low dosages, at least in my experience so far.


Out of boredom and curiosity I have tried using 4-fa several times at low doses as a cognitive enhancer / productiveness aid and it never worked out well.  Dosages varying from 20 - 50 mg oral and 10 - 40 mg rectal before going to work have always ended up with me feeling anxious, strangely out of it, and unable to interact like a normal human.  I had to constantly fight to appear sober.  And with doses above 30 mg, my pupils became extremely dilated.  


One day, after taking 50 mg of 4-FA along with 50 mg of 2-FA, my pupils were dilated for nearly 48 hours!  I only felt the effects of the stimulants for about 4 hours, but for the next 2 days I looked like an owl.  So... take caution when and where you take this stuff, because people will definitely notice.  it has a very long half life.

I've been quite curious about the other FA's but obviously dont have any intention of combining them at the mo, just looking for a proper, pure stimulant.


On the subject of sore throat/immune systems...


I posted a few pages back about using 4-fa to help me through a chesty cold. The drug worked great as a cardiovascular stimulant, much preferable to the thoroughly unpleasant Prednisolone (a stimulating corticosteroid for asthmatics & those with COPD). Unfortunately I DID end up with a chest infection & it took 2 courses of different antibiotics to kill it off.


A couple weeks later I snorted a small line of 4-FA (against my better judgement, to test a new supply) & later that same weekend, snorted some bad quality meph. I caused a wound in my nostril that became infected but I was lucky enought to get this one early enough to avoid another course of antibiotics. I now seriously advise against insufflating this compound under any circumstances. I in fact do not intend to snort any Goddamn thing again, given how much I have suffered in the past week. My nostril has been VERY painful. It's almost healed now & any new batches of 4-fa will be tested orally.


Anyhoo, the earlier post about sore throats got me thinking that perhaps 4-fa has a similar effect on my immune system that MDMA does, in that it interfere's with my ability to fight infection & "seems" to make me more susceptible to an infection, especially of the lungs.


So, I'm kinda thinking that 4-fa needs to be given the same respect as MDMA & should be used only occassionally & in moderate dosing & NEVER, EVER up the fucking nose!

I hope no one is bothered by me bumping this thread...but


Got to try approximately 50mg of 4-FA today. (had to eyeball it so maybe 40-60mg)

Placed it on my tongue, tasted sweet at first until it got around to the back of my tongue and tasted pretty gross.

Also seemed to make my tongue slightly numb.

Within the next 10 minutes I was feeling pretty nice, slight body tingles and general giddiness.

Everything seemed to have a comedic feel to it and I had a nice uplifted mood.

I started to play my guitar and noticed that I could come up with new material pretty easily.

The chords seemed to flow easily and the music had profound depth to it.


Overall I would say this was even better than mdma.

It lasts just longer, (took it at 3:00 pm, still feeling it now at 10:30) put me in a good mood, but also has more energetic effects.

I'm planning on trying 80-100mg in a few days, should be fun.

Has anyone connected appearance to purity?  I've had 3 different looking and after researching, obvious purity differences in 3 samples.


#1 was bright white with a pink tinge, very sparkly and consistent.  not fluffy, and dry.


#2 looked like #1; if it was mixed with magnesium powder.  or chalk powder.  Also had hard lumps/ slightly wet.


#3 looks wet but consistently white and sparkly.  is very fluffy when handled.


The 1st sample was best and is my standard.  The second was missing at least 1/3 of 1st samples strength and seemed to have shorter duration.   3rd was maybe half strength, if that.  3rd sample also did not really burn when smelled.  Other 2 burned pretty good!  Also was faint smell of cat urine when all 3 were smelled.


Anyone else have similar experiences?  I hope to find that 1st type again.

Between 6 and 8, depending on your level of tolerance and how much this substance agrees with you.

For me it is definitely an 8, given that I would rate MDMA 6.5ish and LSD a 9 or higher. But that's just me, ofcourse.

Well, a lot of the properties you describe can be due to particle size alone, without the necessity of differences in purity.

I have had fluffy white powder, more chalky powder with hard lumps and even a grainy PVC-like powder.

All were 95-100% purity, so...


Anyway, a pink hue is not an indication of quality but of some kind of adulterant (probably very low concentration).

So if anything, don't go looking for pinkish 4-FMP, LOL.

mdai and 4FA is interesting...mutlitple goes/testing at MDAI and my friend is not sure if its a + or -....its a good mixer, but mixing with MDAI and other things could be dangerous., but my friend preferred 4FA alone with a few adderalls later on. He would take an empty adderall XR pillcapsule and fill it and swallow 3 at a time( had to be around 200mg).he never dosed based on weight (which is dumb, and everyone should) but he had a very high ampth tolerance. the come on is smooth and nice.  A sudden urge to do something. its almost like a mild mdma come up but overall adderall/rital mixture without the known bad sideefffects. Euphoria was uinigue as it was not so overpowering, but just felt good. and helped a lot with getting housework done. there wasnt any uncomfortable stimulating fx, but vaiulum and JWH=250 was consumed at the same time...with adderall addeed as a booster a few others later. 


he compared it the the good feeling you get the first titme you get that rush from addies before the magic goes mixed with a mild mdma come on...def a good RC in his opinion.

I'd give it a solid 9.  I feel really really good on this stuff. I've done it mulitple times (not as many times as MDMA but enough) and it is consistently pleasing.  9 all the way.

Hey guys first post here on Bluelight.


I remember hearing in this thread that 4-fa + a small does of 2c-d was very MDMA-like? Just wondering if anyone could clarify this or could provide further insight on mixtures with 2c-x's because a friend and I plan to take 100mg 4-fa each orally with my friend considering adding in 5 - 10 mg 2c-i.

Thank you very much for the input, 3rd_I_Blind


So you have a bit of experience with 60-80 mg 4-FA with 14-16 mg 2c-I? What do those in your group say about that mixture and do you end up feeling the 2c-I after the effects of the 4-FA have worn off? We might go at your suggestion with ~12mg of 2c-I + 100mg 4-FA, possibly upped to 120mg. Also I probably should mention, I will be in a home environment for the majority of the day so probably looking for more empathic effects as opposed to the stimulant effects of 4-FA.


Wish I had some 2c-d at the moment ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Of course the results vary, especially between different persons. However, general concensus is that:

- The high (especially the first 3 hours) is a lot like MDMA, only more clearheaded and a bit more talkative (in a 'good' way, usually).

- Taking more 4-FMP tends to 'overrule' the 2C-I, giving more stimulation, slightly less euphoria and less visuals.

- Taking more 2C-I tends to potentiate the effects of the 4-FMP, giving a slight increase in stimulation, more euphoria and more psychedelic effects.

- Redosing with 4-FMP sometimes gives a nice second euphoric rush, but tends to leave you with residual stimulation once the 2C-I wears off.

- Redosing with MDMC/MDMA is more interesting (however, I see no need for this when using 'at home', redosing is more applicable to festivals where you want the last two hours to be the best).

Based on the above, I would suggest to up the 2C-I a bit, and to keep the 4-FMP around 80 mg (keeping in mind possible tolerance from previous stimulant [ab]use).

Depending on previous experience with psychedelics, 14-18 mg of 2C-I is more than feasible for a good time, especially when combined with 4-FMP.

Also keep in mind that 2C-I potentiates 4-FMP, but 4-FMP 'dominates' over 2C-I; this potentiation is especially true for the emotional aspect (i.e. euphoria).


Hope you'll be having a good time! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Ah, thanks. Above info was helpful indeed. When you say 2c-i potentiate's the effects of the 4-FMP, does this also affect the duration?

For my friend, his first and only experience with 2c-I was a ~12.5mg dose with nothing else except maybe a beer and a half. He liked it very much and was happy to try it again (which would then be this weekend, w/ the 4-FMP). What are your thoughts on initially taking a smaller amount (50-60mg?) of 4-FMP along with the 2ci and then sometime later bomb down the same amount of 4-FMP?

Not significantly, 2C-I influences the subjective parts of the experience. So intensity of the euphoria, amount of energy you have. Duration is only influenced by the total amount of substance, there is no real effect of 2C-I on 4-FMP metabolism or anything.

In that case, I would recommend for your friend somewhere between 12 and 14 mg of 2C-I, wouldn't wanna start off too fast/eager.

50-60 mg sounds perfect to me, for myself I hardly exceed 50 mg to be honest.

Dropping a second bomb of 4-FMP is fine, but I would dose that one about 40% lower than your initial dose.

This way you decrease the risk of the 4-FMP in the second bomb pushing away the 2C-I, plus less is more in my opinion anyway.

You could also think about adding 6-8 mg of 2C-I to your second bomb, might make things a bit more interesting if you like the psychedelic touch.

Always an option to make a separate bomb with 6-8 mg 2C-I, so you can decide later on if you will drop it or not. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Or make up a solution of 2C-I, so that you can then take as much or as little as you like at any point in time.

Valid point, but personally I do not like the idea of preparing/measuring a dose when already tripping balls. Especially not with something as itchy on the nose as 4-FMP, LOL, wouldn't be the first time a sneezed half a g of dope into oblivion. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) (Obviously you won't have the sneezing problem with liquid measuring)

Thanks for all of the input guys. I'm pretty excited for this Saturday, it's been a while since our group of friends gathered at a house rather than at some kind of event ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Anyways, does anyone have any first hand experience with LSD and 4-FMP?

Even with its low neurotoxicity, I'm still a bit concerned about it. Is the mechanism of neurotoxicity the same as mdma or amphetamines? Does it behave like an amphetamine? Really, what I want to know is

- Will taking antioxidants help prevent neurotoxicity? 

- Will taking something like baking soda prolong the effects like it does with d-amp? 

- Will taking magnesium reduce tolerance? 

- Between 4fa, d-amp, amp, mdma, and methylone, what is the order of neurotoxicity?


I got some of this last week. 20mg test dose. At t+4 hours, no side effect, just feeling good so I ended up taking more. 

Just so happened that old friends were in town and ready to party... ended up taking 210 mg of 4fa and 175mg of methylone. That was a great time haha. Surprisingly, no hangover or crash the next day. If anything, i still had euphoria. No hangover or crash after that either so it wasn't just that it was still in effect in my body.

I didn't even mean to take anywhere near that much. I just got..um..."loved up"... and ended up sharing with a bunch of friends, so OBVIOUSLY 8( I had to take some more with them. 

I'd like to know just how neurotoxic seeing the ready access and my predisposition toward large doses...

4-FA is definately one of my favourite stims... i'd rather have 4-FA 99% pure than cocaine 10% pure....


For me 4-FA makes me very chatty and is quite euphoric... a good RC in my books.

found this RC a little bit weird...

Last week, first time I tried - mixed with 4MEC to give it a boost. so i'll review today's experience.


I am 32, 100kg, 1,83m. huge tolerance (takes modafinil several times a day everyday and sometimes ritalin - not frequent lately)

Worth noting that I'm a psychonaut for 10 years now, had my *HUGE* share of MDMA until recently when I moved to Czech Rep. and cant find real MDMA


Anyway, I made a capsule with 170mg for me and one with 80mg to my wife. 

Same shit from last week: After 30 mins, felt anxious, in the verge of a panic attack. and LOTS of discomfort in the chest. very cardiotoxic.

After that, a nice come up - very stimulant, not at ALL near MDMA: - little to no extra energy, no 'love', no sex drive. kinda underwhelming under this aspect.

As soon the peak starts to recede, I redosed with a 150mg capsule and my wife a 70mg.

Until then, was able to work - oh yea, i got chatty, that was nice - and made a lot of shit that needed to be done.

After the second come up (less chest pain this time) things started to be complicated. Complete lack of concentration and short span memory. But feels good - not great, but good.

Wife backs up most of those claims, btw. 

Anyway, decided to go to the bathroom (hell, those liters and liters of water have to come out) and felt like fainting. had to sit and have to sit currently still after being up for very short. Low blood pressure all the way, had the same thing last week. Wife also experienced same symptoms, but mildly, unlike me.

Sometimes while on Meph i had low blood pressure and also started to faint (actually once I collapsed pretty badly - at home, at least). But this RC is much worse.

Now we're listening to music (nothing special) and waiting for it to go away. 2nd time, Can't say I liked, i think the negatives mount to a large number and the positives are very subtle and now reading, dose oriented. So if you find your sweet spot, stay there. I still prefer 4MEC by leaps and bounds: i can insufflate or drop, duration is right and almost no side effects. but 3FA wise, your mileage may vary. This is highly subjective and I think my report is a downer, but anyway, thats that.

Poor oral hygiene maybe? Inflation has to come from somewhere. MDMA etc. are definitely not good for your immune system, but since the oral inflammation is not really that common, it seems logical something else in your mouth has to be the problem.

I love 4-FA! Mephedrone is still my favourite stimulant but 4-FA is a great drug to take clubbing. Also, the fact that you don't need to redose every hour means it's much better for taking into town! Euphoria is great, not as good as Mephedrone or MDMA here but it's about on par with Methylone in my opinion, add to the fact that it has a duration of about 3-4 hours. I dose and re-dose once after I've been out for a few hours. Comedown is easily beaten with some opiates or benzos - and it's not that bad to begin with anyway. It's a shame it's already a class A here. I imagine it may become quite a popular street drug as I've seen it mentioned as a growing problem in some north-east England towns. :D

Firstly, try not to go above the 200mg mark!


Second, dosing varies person to person. I have a mate who's quite happy with 35mg of 4-fa. I'd start no higher than 50mg, & prepare another couple doses the same size. Things start fast on empty stomach (withn 40mins), it's a smooth, pleasant come-up. Can take 2 hours on full stomach.


I take very small doses of MDMA, coke, phet, meph, M1 etc etc but I need 180mg of 4-fa. I start with 80mg which I follow a couple hours later with 60mg & finally another 40mg couple hours after that. This can easilly keep me amused all night/all day. It has a sexual push, much like meph or mdma. Sexy time is fun, orgasm is delayed in men. Erection can be inhibited, but not always. Music & dancing is fun, walking fun! Very, very slight colour enhancement for me, or maybe it's the herb I always smoke.


Some posts above do not sound at all like 4-fa, physical discomfort or powerful stimulation are not, generally, characteristics of this compound. Go slow if you have any doubt as to the quality of your product...


... best of luck, enjoy!


edit - DON'T FUCKING SNORT IT! Lol Torture, wounding! NO SNORTING 4-FA!

This shit is great!!! I'm usually not a fan of stimulants at all, but I just ate 100mg for the first trial, and this stuff really putting a pep in my step at T+2:00.  Feels very smooth right now, no pupil dilation, but I also ate my usual couple grams of Bali kratom at the same time.

At first it felt great for 4 or 5 hours but then Had an adderall feeling comedown.  I felt I had the engergy drained out of me after about T+5:00 or 6:00  and the stim comedown hit me hard and I had to take 5mg of clonazepam to help me sleep it off after I couldn't take the stimulation anymore.


On the other hand, I gave 300mg to a friend who loves adderall and he ate all 3 100mg capsules through the course of 5 hours ontop of his daily insanely high adderall dose and he really loves the stuff already.  He said it added a layer of increased qualitative depth to the speedy buzz.

I prefer 2-FA over 4-FA, although I took 4-FA only twice, and 2-FA only once. Maybe it was a problem of dosing.

Some cross-tolerance with MDMA, probably no cross-tolerance with 2C-C.

I would say that even with MDMA the cross-tolerance would be hardly noticable, and only if you are talking about taking the second drug on the day after.

With a period of more than a few days, there won't be any residual tolerance left (assuming 4-FA before MDMA, the other way around might be more tricky to predict).

Really good stimulant IMO. I'm more into opio than stims, I hate that feeling inside me like if I was going explode on stims.


On this, I don't have that effect, moreover, I feel fucking good, just the euphoria and energy. I don't even have my usual stims gastro issues (burping all the time), my body is hella calm. I took 100mg in a capsule then after 1 hour I've added 100mg. 


I really like it. I don't even sweat as much as on other stimulants. I'm 2 hours and 20 minutes after first ingestion, let's see how far will it go.

For those of you that have dosed 4-fa in an amount that's enough to produce real euphoria.. (mdma-like or as similar as it can get), what dosage was that? I see a lot of posts about it not being all that euphoric , and instead better suited as a study aid or a caffeine replacement etc, but I'm not talking about that. 


What dosages, in first hand experience, have resulted in full blown euphoria or as close as you can get to mdma effects with this substance?

Euphoria? Maybe not, however a massive mood enhancement. Doses were:


100mg oral

100mg oral t1h+

100mg oral t9h+


I have a bit of headache right now. The drug is slighty sedating and not as tearing from the inside as other stimulants i've tried. Also no gastro issues still, I'm now at t14h+ and I don't feel any anxiety or bad body feelings. Sedative effects and stim effects still remain. Clear-headed.


Just the headache. Really good stimulant for me imo, however a good starting dose would be 100mg and if it doesn't work very well try 150mg.


forgot to add it makes you talkative in a good manner

I love 4-FA. I bought a gram, went in with low expectations and was completely blown away by how good it was. But tolerance builds very quickly.

Im very interested in the idea of potentiating 4-FA with 2C-D, what is 2C-Ds mechanism of action? Im on SSRIs and am trying to find if its safe for me to try

I wouldn't recommend mixing SSRIs, 4-FA and 2C-D.


Which SSRIs are you on?

Sorry if I missed something in the first big part of this thread but I've been playing with this stuff, and IV is THE way to go, unless you want longevity (it lasts long enough as is). The IV doses interestingly enough aren't super different from basic oral doses, if you have some semblance of tolerance or experience 75-125mg is fairly safe. Start small though!!! 50mg will get you going. I just blasted about 75-100 and it's strong and nice, should wear off quicker too. I'm gonna use this for tomorrow/today/tonight to go out and rave for halloween along with some 4-MEC (which is also preferable IV'd although the duration is shoooort, use even smaller amounts of this if you have pure 50mg will get you. 75-100mg is for the tolerant. Be safe! Combining the two in smaller doses is nice too. The MEC is much more MDMA-ish for me, very clean and nice and comfortable. This is much more like amphetamines (duh) but still nice and less jitters. To someone above, don't overdo or rampage on this or the other similar drugs (esp MDPV) as psychosis will bite you and you will barely realize it... seriously! Be safe again!!

Amen to that brother.  I used to bang lots of mdpv.  Don't know how many times I ended up terrified for my life, possibly even holding loaded weapons, lit torches, or blades thinking people were trying to kill me.  Good way to end up in jail, too.....Not a joke.  I pretty much don't do stims at all anymore bc of last years meph and mdpv fueled insanity.  Damned if I didn't get some MDPV a few months ago and end up exactly how I was before from a combo of snorting and then deciding to take ambien to bail out of it (made it worse).


I think it's **far **less likely with 4-fa, but still be careful.  Especially with the needle.

Apparently there is some bunk 4-fa going around from at least one online vendor.


Two people dosed 150mg and experienced nothing after +1:30 than a dull headspace and perhaps extremely minor stimulation.  A 30mg booster was taken which did nothing for either person. No happiness/euphoria either whatsoever.   Sleep was easy when both people gave up and called it a night at about +3:30.  


The "4-fa" in question was fluffy white, but oily/wet.  It sort of reminded me of when a final wash with acetone is done on other substances and it isnt allowed to evaporate fully.   The vendor had a professional website and seemed as legit as any other.


Anyone else run into bunk 4-fa ??

Hello,


please, can someone tell me whats the potential neurotoxicity of this substance in combination with cocaine? 

Two weeks ago i took two 150mg doses of 4-FA during an evening (the second dose was taken just before midnight) and then later at about 4 am i snorted 2 lines of cocaine.

Now i think i have some problems with memory, which can be psychosomatic because i am just paranoid, but however, i would like to hear some opinions on the dangers of the combination mentioned above, and if it could have caused some lasting damage to me.


Thanks a lot

I just googled that and what I came up with was a chem supplier.  The pic is of what could be described as 4-fluoro-N,methyl-phenethylamine.  Doesn't sound like it would be particularly active to me.  Maybe as an intermediary for some other 4-fluoro PEA derivative

**4-FA comparing to Mephedrone as far as sexual**


I am curious since Mephedrone was a Favorite as far as getting the Lust and prosexual going with my girl and essecially during "alone" time with the computer monitor when you cant get ahold of your "friend". I am interested what other people expierence with 4-FA in that way and what dosage will trigger similar lust that mephedrone gave? And if MDAI adding to the mix will help???????

**How does 4-FA compare to BZP??**


Hi all,

Has anyone had experience with both 4-FA and BZP. I still have some BZP but will run out in a few weeks 

and wonder if 4-FA would be more enjoyable? I find BZP makes me horny and would love if 4-FA would be great for a long masturbation session...


Thanks to anyone that might shed some light on this

So you shoot a substance that's been on the market for a year or two (at best). Furthermore, the powder/crystals you shoot is/are not 100% pure. 98-99% purity means that 1-2% is... only god knows, and god doesn't exist. That 1-2% could be other chemicals that were synthesized and not washed out during purification, could be catalysts (iodine, chlorine, metals, whatever)... 


I'd either bang 10000 OC 80's in my life than 1g of that substance. But maybe I am wrong.


I am very sensitive to uppers (stimulants), but I wan't to try one again. I've shot pure coke (60% at least, the best was 99% pure, a chemist extracted it from tea and purified it) in the past, but one day I was taken to hospital because my heart was racing during come-down and now I have a huge respect for stimulants. 


I heard that 4-FA is a mild stimulant - is that true? Which RC-stimulant are recommendable?

Sorry, that's definitely wrong.  I'd rather inject a little bit of unreacted precursor or solvent in small concentrations that my system can effectively break down over the combination of garbage in pills, and think you would, too.  And you shoot unwashed coke, that's great...


Anyway, like 4-FA, I don't find IV 2-FA significantly different from oral 2-FA either.  Seems the halogenated amphetamines in general aren't really worth shooting.

I shot coke that was pure and cut by my best friend who cut it with lactose. That's not toxic. But that was just one time, all the other times my coke was at least 80-90% pure. I don't do uppers anymore.


I use micron-filters, and oxycontin is quite safe to inject.

Bullshit, 4-FMP has been on the market for at least 35 years. Shooting up cocaine (60% purity), which contains copious amounts of heavy metals and which is regularly sprayed with herbicides by the South-American equivalent of the FDA.

Is it? The majority of cocaine samples contain tracable amounts of copper, chromium, cadmium, nickel, lead, arsenic, manganese, and less toxic metals like iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc. Coca paste can contain up to 5% manganese, I believe this is because they use potassium permanganate in the extraction procedure. Not to mention the possible contents of every percent which is not pure cocaine. Truly rediculous, not?


4-FMP being on the market for 35 years was - perhaps - slightly exaggerated, but it is definitely more than 20 years. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

But I said I had pure coke. It was purified by a chemist. He even removed the cinnamoylcocaines and other alkaloids with an oxidation process (potassium permanganate or H2O2 will do it) and washed it several times with nonpolar and polar.


He's an expert, and I trust him. The coke was so freaking strong, even 0,01g would do it. That's 10mg. You'd get a rush when IVed. When I took 0,018g (I have a very good scale) IV my heart began to race and I panicked. I have to say that the non-purified coke that was from South America and that was at least 89% pure (that's the best you can get if you don't oxidize it, cause the remaining 10% are other alkaloids and byproducts from the synthesis) had more desirable effects. It seems that absolutely pure cocaine-hcl doesn't give you the common effects of very good coke. Although "pure" coke from illegal cartels (like the 89% pure coke I had) gives you totally different effects than street coke that's cut with god knows what, very often it's amphetamines to increase the effects (because amphetamines are cheaper) and cheap research-chemicals. 


That pure coke from south amerika had 89% at least. Purity was measured with a gas-chromatograph in Switzerland, and they found no toxic materials as I heard back in those days. It contained small quantities of non-polar solvents though. You know, when you perform a coke extraction, you extract it with non-polar solvents like kerosene (in German: Petroleum, kerosene doesn't mean Kerosin, Kerosin is the fuel of jets) and if you aren't a chemist or a pharmacist, you won't be able to get all of it out.


What do you guys say:

Is a mild dose of coke, amphetamine, methamphetamine or mephedrone more "mild" to the body or is it 4-FA or some other RC? Because people told me in German drug forums that 4-FA a.k.a. 4-FMP is very very mild and doesn't mess with your heart.

Fair enough, but I thought you also mentioned 60% purity cocaine? Nevertheless, this is a bit besides the point. Shooting up a research chemical like 4-FA is in the same league as shooting up coke, except perhaps the 0.00001% of users obtaining truly purified cocaine. But I doubt even your chemist friend can extract cocaine with less than 1% impurities. And I doubt that that Swiss GC-analysis protocol was fit for detecting heavy metals.

4-FA would be more mild to the body by far, keeping in mind your condition of a 'mild' dose. Especially in comparison with cocaine, 4-FA would be almost beneficial compared to the adverse effects of cocaine on your liver, heart, brains and what not.

^ I take Seroplex (escitalopram) 10mg every day and had a week in which I took some 4-FA, usually at 2pm, 80 to 100mg. Had no problems whatsoever.

Coca paste can contain up to 5% manganese, I believe this is because they use potassium permanganate in the extraction procedure. Not to mention the possible contents of every percent which is not pure cocaine. Truly rediculous, not?

I wasn't arguing---most street coke without a connection is nasty as fuck. Coke is gross in general to me I was trying to point out that it doesn't make you anymore right than the IV coke user. A Lot of 4-FA wasn't even pure when people started hoarding it just recently and not to mention all the different batches that were bad. There may be copious amounts of metals in a majority of blow but a lot of researching chemicals are not always as pure or clean as they advertise. Just be safe with it. Don't go overboard. I say this for your health and the chemicals sake.

Do you mean to say you took 4fa everyday for a week? What was that like after the week was over? What negative effects did you observe, if any? What made you decide to dose daily? Just curious (read: nosey).

^ Yep, a week, well, 8 days I reckon. Every day. No interactions that I know of between escitalopram and 4-FA.


Now the comedown is another story...

Those of you looking for a daily solution with no comedown should really check out 2-FA...  Please see the mega thread, I think it's on the second page of OD right now.  2-FA has no comedown and fewer side effects than any stimulant I've used and I'm able to take it daily without consequences.  It's the most viable productivity drug there is and should really be prescribed after the anticipated lack of neurotoxicity is determined through studies.  It never will be prescribed because it's too old to be patented and profited from.

I'm getting some of this stuff in the next few days. Considering I'm used to snorting burning substances, do you think I'd be okay snorting it or is it really THAT irritating to the nose?

Hi BananasAO. I can't tell you cos 2-FA, they were already in bombs, ready to be dropped.


4-FA is a plain white powder with no smell. It tastes horrid, though, so parachute it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I see that 2-FA is starting to appear on some websites, what would be the difference in effects between 2 and 4 - FA? , shame that I found getting 4-FMA quite hard where I am from.

I'm by no means a fan of FMA's nor many stimulants, it was just intresting for me. Definetly prefer 4-FA over FMA, so may give 2 a try. 4-FMP is exactly the same as 4-FA right?

All I know is this was the first time getting it. It was crystallineish so I mushed it into powder. It didnt feel like 4-fa at All just very strong stimulation with a tingly stomach it Did feel nice though. After awhile I Knew it wasnt the real deal then got the clumpy super white powder 4-fa. The first onejust differed so much I wish I knew what it was.

I got 10g of this stuff, knowing that I'd like it. White, fine, odorless powder, but I'm waiting on marquis reagent in the mail. (According to dancesafe it has no reaction to marquis or the other standard tests besides the one that looks for primary amines.)


Night 1:

Took 120 mg orally, 10 mg nasally at T+0:00. Friend (we'll call her R) took 120 mg, no tolerance to any kind of stimulant. First alert felt at T+0:30. The effects built until about T+1:30 and plateued for maybe 30 minutes then dropped off. R started experiencing nervousness at about T:0:50, which persisted for 20 or 30 minutes, until serotonergic effects kicked in and abolished her anxiety. The high lasted longer for her than for me: off of that one dose, she felt euphoric, or at least good, until maybe T+6:00. I believe her nervousness and longer-lasting reward were the result of her having no amphetamine tolerance: since I have a rather large amphetamine tolerance, I was probably less susceptible to DA/NA release. It was also far more sedating for me, which makes sense with this theory. It was like the E pills I've had in the past, but slightly less intense (never tried pure MDMA). I had, however, recently stopped taking St. John's Wort so it's possible my receptors/transporters were still downregulated. At T+4:00 I snorted a total of 120 mg. The burn was not as bad as I was lead to believe, and quickly went away. Went to go socialize, and began to feel the effects. I found it intensely sedating. Suddenly, I noticed a visual change: the amount of visual static I saw jumped. Tracers became apparent. Someone asked me if I was okay, because apparently I looked like I was about to cry. Really, I was just incredibly relaxed and euphoric. This was at least as intense as the E pills I have taken. Upon entering a dark room, I immediately noticed simple patterns of bright colors. I have never experienced psychedelic effects from E. Again, this lasted for a few hours, then dropped off. I did not attempt to sleep until T+12:00, but at that point sleep was easily attained with the help of benzos.


Night 2:

The next night, I took it again. This time, 240 mg intranasally. This was probably more intense than the effects received upon the second dose the night before (not too much tolerance). Again, intensely sedating, but dancing was very fun. Intense euphoria while dancing, but eventually I didn't like the loud and dark environment around me though. I wanted to talk to people but could only dance. Sleep was easily achieved at T+11:00, though I still saw patterning as I closed my eyes.


Some notes:

1. I found myself attentive to the concerns of my friends even after the overt euphoria had vanished. Perhaps serotonin release is still present in the cortex at this point but not the basal ganglia?

2. The euphoria comes in very distinct waves. At the peaks the euphoria is one of the strongest I've experienced. At the valleys it's closer to baseline than it is to the peaks.

3. Though 4-FA does last a long time, I find that it's actually possible to sleep much earlier than it is with d-amp. I may still feel the effects, but be able to sleep regardless. I attribute this to comparatively low NA release. 

4. What's up with this weird psychedelic effect? I've heard this mentioned only twice: on another forum, and the first page of this thread. (Haven't read through the rest of this thread.)

Quick clarification: The psychedelic effect was not a main aspect of the experience, just something I noticed a few times. The happy serotonin feeling was the focus: I got the tingly feelings that one gets from E, and at least as intense. Large sections of my body would alternate between tingling pleasurably. 


Also, I was extremely good at CoD despite not having played in years ;D

Euphoria seems to vary widely between people for this chemical. True euphoria for me seems to occur after consuming 240 mg. 130 was good, but not euphoric, and didn't last long enough.


By the way, why do some of you say not to consume more than 200 mg or to redose? I have experienced no toxic effects from this drug, maybe a hint of a headache as I came up the first time, nothing more. No nausea, reasonable heart rate, no anxiety. I assume others have had different experiences? Also, I remember reading somewhere that redosing just prolongs the stimulation but doesn't bring back the MDMA feel, but for me this is not true. I don't know whether it was the result of snorting it instead of taking it orally on my second dose, but I found that an equal dose by weight 4 hours later brought it back even stronger.


I suppose my next trial will be with a dose of 170 or so to see if it will provide the same effects as 240 (and make sure I'm not wasting anything!). Will report back.

[With regards to dopaminergic toxicity]

I've been wondering about this, and I was hoping one of the more neurochemistry knowledgeable people could give me an opinion on this. Yes, the other p-haloamphetamines are not neurotoxic to dopaminergic neurons, but it seems that neurotoxicity to 5HT or DA neurons correlates with a releasing agent's ability to cause the release of that chemical (correct me if I'm wrong). The thing is, para-chloro's IC50 for serotonin reuptake is a third of that for dopamine reuptake (meaning that, for a concentration of the drug that inhibits the dopamine reuptake to a certain extent, only a third of that concentration is needed to inhibit the serotonin reuptake to the same extent). 4-FA's IC50 for dopamine reuptake, however, is eight times that for serotonin reuptake. So, 4-FA inhibits DAT 24 times more strongly than PCA, per unit of SERT inhibition. Yes, these are reuptake inhibition values, but if these don't measure releasing properties in that they are derived from measuring the accumulation of the neurotransmitter (I am not well versed in this stuff so I don't know) then I'm sure that the drugs' relative affinities for the transporters are somewhat indicative of their relative amounts of DA/5HT release.

What would be the effects of taking 4fa and methoxetamine?

Is it even safe?

Many people indicate that stimulants and methoxetamine should not be mixed. From my personal experience this results in anxiety and feels quite bad on the heart.

Anyone have an idea of potential cardiotoxicity? The mild psychedelia worries me as far as 5-HT2 receptor agonism goes, and the similarity to norfenfluramine doesn't help.

Can anyone elaborate on the suspicion about cardiotoxicity? I have had no psychedelic effects at all on 4-fa, not even on high doses. And my heartrate is affected less by 4-fa than it is by most other drugs (which is why I prefer it). It there much reason to suspect that it is cardiotoxic?

I find it peculiar that I feel no effects of 4fa o

after the first redose. It's the exact same every time- first dose, feeling high, slowly feeling i'm coming down, redose, feeling as high as the first time, feeling i'm coming down, redose.. And nothing. Nada. Just doesn't work anymore.

> 			For serotonin releasing agents/agonists, the term "cardiotoxicity" is used to refer to a condition of ventricular hypertrophy (meaning overgrowth of a heart valve) which can occur as a result of activation of 5-HT2B receptors. Examples of this are MDMA, MDA, and fenfluramine (plus fenfluramine's major metabolite norfenfluramine, which is a rather strong 5-HT2B agonist), all of which directly activate the 5-HT2B receptor and are known to cause heart abnormalities. It is unknown if released serotonin directly contributes to this condition. Of course, it seems like there'd be reason to think that, since serotonin is a pretty potent serotonin receptor agonist, but SSRIs don't cause heart issues so it's hard to say.

> The reason I worry about psychedelic effects (which people besides me have reported from 4-FA, though others, like yourself, do not) is that, because they are both members of the 5-HT2 family of serotonin receptors, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors are somewhat similar as far as which compounds bind to them. So, if there is some psychedelic action by a compound, psychedelia being mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor, one might have suspicion that the compound has some affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor.

Thank you for the response. I am not wellversed in biochemistry or neurology or anything, but you have given some pretty easily understandable riskindikators. As for the SSRI thing, I actually saw an article two weeks ago in a danish newspaper (Urban or Metroexpress) claiming that SSRI in fact does cause heartproblems, and as a consequence measures are being taken to prevent doctors from throwing them in the face of every other patient. I don't remember the exact wording of the article or whether it had anything with ventricular hypertrophy to do though.


Edit: the drug in question is Citalopram and the problem seems to be that it interferes with electrical signals in the heart, leading to heart athrytmias and heartattacks in some, according to an american study. So it didn't have much to do with the topic.

Hey guys I just got some 4-fa. It seemed to have a salt texture. Very heavy and hmmm whats the word.... reminded me of salt. Is this normal??? I got it from a reputable vendor and looked the up on safeorscam. Thanks!

If you're concerned about the quality of your 4-FA, or really any drug for that matter, buy a testing kit from dancesafe. You can buy mecke, marquis, or simon reagents for 20 something USD individually, or 50 as a bundle. I recommend the bundle, as more information is always better when putting potentially toxic/potent chemicals in your body. You can use this to test basically any drug that comes in a powder and E pills (maybe pharmaceuticals too, I don't know). There's really no excuse not to get one if you have the money to buy drugs in the first place. Optimal results for 4-FA for marquis, mecke, and simon are no color change. (Dancesafe has gotten these results on 4-FA samples which they verified by mass spec.) Some people, however, who probably do have a decent product, report a yellow/orange color change with marquis I think. This is probably due to some minor impurity left over from the synthesis.

I can't say definitively that it is or isn't, but what I can say is that when I have gotten 4-FA it has always been a white fluffy powder.

Yeah, I got the same sandy, non-sticky, 4-FA. Very granular and coarse but supposedly, from reports by experienced users, still the real deal.


Different batches can have a different appearance, but that doesn't mean it's not the same compound.

Bigger crystals (translating to coarser powder) usually means a more hasty crystallization and thus less purity. But yes, it's still probably the right compound if the vendor has good reviews on safeorscam.

What is the best way to consume 4-FA and what is the best dose for focus/studying? I took approximately 50mg orally, and didn't feel a thing. 


This is what mine looks like: [http://i.imgur.com/Tadjb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Tadjb.jpg) (Reports say it looks legit)


Edit: No tolerance, 5'7, 110 pounds (if it matters)

Trash It. I have seen a few vendors or heard of some VERY trust worthy vendors having this salty garbage I got a few weeks ago. I swear I thought I was going to the hospital. It may have been panic but I have had 4-fa before. It was VERY VERYYYY Clumpy and Shimmers. If it doesnt basically clump like snow and Doesn't shimmer I think its bunk or something else. This is the second time I have encountered salty 4-fa and this stuff I Just got smells like fucking FISH!!!!! This is a warning to stay away or get it tested because I have a feeling a few suppliers are giving out bad batches because I had a Bizarree reaction to this New salty shit that people have been "claiming" Other reputable vendors carry and its Shit.

I think a lot of reviews are from customers that are NOT getting the same product or getting a little extra to say its the real deal. No way does 4-fa make you feel like your body is going numb and your brains almost going to explode. I cannot describe what happened but it was like a strong strong Brain zap feeling that would come in 15 minute intervals and it was almost TOO intense and it was in no way Pleasant and I have dosed on Salty 4-fa before that was supposedly Impurer than the batches that had been going around and it just lacked the same massive serotonin release but was def not like this granular stuff that you can crush and although clumpy does not shimmer which imho means Bullshit nastyness

You may be right, but the 4-FA I got has little to no smell, and admittedly, I've only tested a small dose so I don't know the full effects of this batch. How much did you take?

Larger crystals come from slower recrystallisations. Purer substances tend to form better crystals because the impurities will not disrupt crystal formation.


tha's not to say fine powders are impure, nor are crystals purer, either can be got from high or average purity.

**When ppl say 4-fa is toxic how much do they mean in comparison to other drugs?**


wtf does toxic mean anyhow. think i asked some time ago but didnt get an answer satisfactory enough that id remmeebr it apparently. 


Im interested in trying this rc as i was after a mild serotonin booster with the stim- which id been before doing mdppp and 6apb but apb is too strong of a releaser for me. 


Anyhow so what do they mean about it prob being toxic as compared to say mdma, amp, mephedrone? Moreso/less so what?


i know its guesswork but what is probably the case? 


This term 'toxic' seems to get thrown around willy nilly and im not sure what ppl mean by it but particularly in this case. 


If its likely worse than other rcs then id be encouraged to give it a miss since i was just getting settled into mdppp which i find miracuously benign physically and mentally just had to find a serotonin releaser to go with it. I find it annoying and stressful to always be hutning for my high. mdppp def has my dopa sorted i just dont have the serotonin side on lock yet. 


Thats why im intereted in this as it seems like what i was after effects wise all in one tho am concerned of this flouro toxicity shit.

4-FA is neurotoxic because of the unrestrained release of serotonin and by inhibiting the natural intracellular processes of neurons (i.e. reuptake inhibition) .

You guys need to check your facts and figures.


4-fluoroamphetamine is a serotonin/norepinephrine/dopamine releaser (**it's an amphetamine**) and should be no more neurotoxic than plain old amphetamine.


Perhaps you should refer to [this table of affinities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:El3ctr0nika/affinities)?

Toxic means it damaged your body. Medications or drugs has a therapeutic value. The closer the the therapeutic value and lethal value is the more dangerous the drug is. Most drugs have a wide theraputic index like Advil, Tylenol, hydrocodone, vitamins, other drugs I just can thing of many right now. But then you have drugs like warfarin, digoxin, lithium, and vacamycin that can be toxic at low levels. Does this answer your question?

hmm so the wiki is bollox then? doesnt surprise me. what jackass wrote it? 


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Fluoroamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Fluoroamphetamine)


Would their sources be inaccurate taking about it being a dari? 


hmm ill have to study the table more to understand it. I see 4-fa. 


Hmm well amphetamine felt the most fucking toxic thing ive ever taken if thats anything to go on (but at least its had a long history of use so it would be kinda reassuring if 4-fa is pretty much in line with that in terms of risks)...however ppl are saying there is hardly any comedown on 4-fa...what could be the explanation for this compared to the monstrous comedown of amphetamine? I thought that dopamine releasers were almost inevitably gonna blow you out similar to serotonin releasers- i read one of the bigboys on here saying how bad dopa releasers are compared to daris.


So long as i know its abour as safe as amphetamine and as long as i know it definately doesnt have the comedown of amphetamine as msot ppl are saying that would satisfy me to take it- altho i would still like to know why this lesser comedown could be the case since ppl are saying effect parallel amphetamine if not top it. I certainly wouldnt want it to be a false assertion because i dont know if my fragile mind could withstand another amphetmine comedown :S


Ive read reports tho of ppl with apparently equal weak dispositions saying its their new DOC due to its mild/almost non existent after effects.


Also I thought some of the worries ppl were tlkaign about were cos of the flouro part or is that a non issue?

 See I have had salty 4-fa Once the first time I messed with this. It was give or take not compareable to this most recent incident. Basically the first salty batch I had lasted a LONG time, was stimulating like an adderall but more sedating in the 30mg range.


This more recent salty 4-FA was smaller grains not fine by any means and not White at All. It had a clear hue almost milky I would say. I dumped 90mgs out. After consuming and not going anywhere I knew something was horribly wrong. I tried to turn some music on to pass this by praying for my safety and health. I got a wave that hit around 40 minutes later and it felt extremely weird.


I then got very clammy and then thought I was on a verge of passing out. I was NOT stimulated. It happened to me in a similar experience of too much caffiene but this kept going. Each wave of discomfort made me get up because I thought I was done for. I had someone come over literally almost in tears trying to talk but in utter panic. I ended up taking a Xanax and thinking I gave myself an anxiety attack. These waves were not relaxing by any means or stimulating. I had read several extremely positive reviews from this vendor and the thing was I just was testing for quality. I do not know why this happened but I do not know about this research scene any more.


Afterwards these graons I smashed into some gross smelling powder. Very foul. When I reported this I got nothing but attitude and I was just seriously worried. The shadiest experience from a vendor Ever. If anyone has experienced this please post for harm reduction. I had fluffy very clumpy 4-fa and it was par if not way better than meth but this has scared me. Also noteworthy was at the end I felt disconnected Completely! I had no stimulation but for 30 minutes And it still felt weird. By the time my help arrived I was heaving and sweating Badly.


Please be warned. The rc community has gone to shit. This vendor had very good reviews but I had my doubts. I did notice the taste was Hardly bitter and not sour tasting. It actually barely had a taste. Just fucking find a legit vendor do not assume your getting what everyone else is getting. That's my story.

I just received a batch of beige kind of 4-fa. I took a testdose on 90 mg and felt nothing, and my friend tried his normal dose at 135mg. He claimed that no real effect ever kicked in, and that he felt as if he was constantly on the comedown. Stupid as I was one evening i took 300mg and got the equal effect to a 100mg of pure 4-fa, without as much empathy. I wrote the vendor (who has been in the business for a looong time and always had pure methylone etc.) that I was unsatisfied with the product and worried about what it was. He promised to send me some of an older batch which is supposed to be pure and white (the only other batch I ever tried). The methylone from said guy seemed worse than normal. I had a very low peak on 200mg. No eyewobbles or anything. What the fuck is going on? If things don't start clearing up I will stop visiting RC's. The only upside to them was the fact that you usually knew what you where getting. Now buying streetdrugs seem almost as reliable as buying of the internet.

Just be warned of my report. This was from someone who was very well spoken for. It was very scary. I have never been scared like that in my life but almost passing out thinking I was going to die has made me believe Fuck the RC scene. You might as well seriously eat some pipers and yes I am serious a dirty e pill wasnt as horrible as this. Nothing will beat the horrible feeling that this shit delivered. Just be careful people. Clearly I did something stupid but I almost wound up calling 911. Dont fuck with this one for awhile is just my two cents.

Plain ol' amphetamine is neurotoxic. 4-FA is neurotoxic. Both are releasers AND reuptake inhibitors.

Considering amphetamines generally, I've heard these are quite non-neurotoxic if used in low doses or occassionally (meaning: not 5-day i'm-so-addicted binges). Amirite?

Everybody that received a bad batch should write the vendors they got it from and tell them that it is NOT okay. I did this and received an excuse and some good old 4-fa. Hopefully, if people show that they care about quality, the vendors will start putting a greater effort into providing it.

Don't be stupid and OD on 4-FA like I did. I took twice as much as my normal dose (eyeballed) and I just started profusely sweating (cold sweats) for the rest of the night along with my heart racing. Basically all the crappy peripheral effects with no fun effects.

I also plugged a large amount of 4-FMP respectively last night and felt only mild stimulation, also not like the first batch of 4-FA I bought, but I think I bought it too long ago to moan at the vendors at all.

Well, I'd assume mixing an SSRI with a serotonin releaser isn't good, but I've heard of people mixing MDMA and SSRIs and getting a reduced effect.

That's because SSRIs bind so much more effectively to the transporters and stop MDMA getting in there. I Imagine they would cause similar problems for 4-FA

I think 4-FMP is named by some vendors because of the name 4-FA has a risk to be mistaken illegal Amphetamines so to prevent these problems they used 4-FMP. It's scientific discussion so I will use 4-FA.

> 
> According to this article the half life of d-AMP (1 mg / kg, and  so forth) in rats is approx. 100 min., in contrast 4-FA is approx. 205 min., about 2-fold longer. Interestingly, comparing d-MAP with 4-FMA it's opposite, d-MAP is approx. 110 min., 4-FMA is approx. 60 min.
> 
> There are many differences between human and rat in metabolise pathway so it should not too simplify to interpret of course, but if these differences could be neglected, medical research shows that the half life of d-AMP (as prescription medicine Dexedrine in the US) is about 9 hours in children and 11 hours in adults, then 4-FA has potentially over 23-24 hours half-life so it could be ideal medicine for AD/HD because it's no need to take divided and not too long to cause insomnia when comply to the prescription issued by specialist.
> 
> And this article also hypothesised the reason why 4-FMA has shorter half life than d-MAP, it says demethylation of 4-FMA is rapidly processing than d-MAP. I cannot any skeptical point in this hypothesis in my knowledge, so please point out if exist something skeptical point in it.
> 
> It may support that many researcher said that 4-FA is better than 4-FMA, because many people think that Methamphetamine is stronger than Amphetamine and indeed that's right, but it's not the nature of substances but the fact is only MAP is far more lipophilic than AMP due to -CH3 so easily penetrate BBB then has higher activity than AMP. In fact AMP is slightly stronger than MAP *in vitro*.

Just tried 4 fa for the first time tonight. I did a bit of research before diving in, & felt comfortable with a 170 mg dose. I can see how people would make comparisons to mdma in as much as the initial elevated good mood & optimistic outlook I was imparted with at the onset of its effects. I also had a heightened sense of vision in that everything seems brighter. Overall, I am zippy & motivated tonight & socializing wouldnt be hard at all on this. I could see a 50% increase in dosage having rather profound effects. I like this one :b...

It is not "supposed" to look like anything. Particle size is not a measure of purity at all.


The only thing it indicates is the crystallisation speed either ante or post-synth.


Jakeperson - dissolve in a minimum amount of water and allow it to evaporate slowly.

So I have come to the conclusion that the 4-fa I got (which is a bit grainy) is cut because dosages of about 300 mg feels to me like 150mg of pure. I have not had pure but i assume this from reports. I know taking 380 should be overkill but its just very euphoric and euphoria last about 3 hours while stim lasts about 9 in total (including the euphoric time). So just my 2 cents. 


QUESTION:


**Does Baking Soda have the same effect on 4-fa as it would other amphetamines? Also what would this do to the exp? would it make it shorter with a biggger rush? I generally dont like rushes that come with mephedrone or MDMA and love the slow come up of 4-fa. If I decide to dose 400mg (about 200mg with my batch), would it make the come up way more intense rather than ease into it. I want to prolonge the euphoric stage as much as possible**


Thanks.

Would you guys say 4-fa allows for 'change work' similar to MDMA? I am not expecting the expansive acceptance that MDMA provides but a little bit of ego softening to allow some earnest reflection? 


I was deciding on 2-fa again or giving 4-fa a try and if 4-fa allows for this then I'll probably go with it this time as I could do with a little more depth in that direction for my next trip.

Nothing like finding out a good old batch and giving in to the temptation once in a while. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


If anyone will find this informative: 


When I was on a SSRI (Zoloft), the effect was veeeery weak. I got a buzz, and a physical good feeling, but not much else. I did (very stupid, I might add) 500mg one night and there was just a buzz all the time. Luckily I didn't get any bad side effect,s even though this dose was way too much, and the only bad thing that happened was wasting a good batch for nothing. 

I'm off zoloft now, have been for two months and haven't used any drugs since November. I orally ingested about 80mg, then in 15 minute another 50mg. It's been 45 minutes, I feel great and the feeling gets better every minute ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Okay, I now redosed about 5 five times in smaller amounts, as usual it turned out redosing 4-fa isn't worth it much, as I never reached even close to the initial high after the first dose. I've noted a new side-effect that I've never noticed before.

When I was high, I would be thinking very fast, coming up with these brand new ideas, theories. Every word the person I was talking to said reminded me of something and it just felt like thoughts are running through my head with extreme speed. But I had quite a problem with shot-term memory. And I mean, not just a little, it was close to ruining my experience. Whenever I'd come up with this idea to say something or whatever, I started talking and suddenly forgot about it. Also when my friend spoke more than 3 sentences of something, I'd forget what we were talking about. Over and over again. So annoying. Anyone else experienced that?

Another (side) effect noted. My eyes literally look different and change colour, starting somewhat later when the intense effects and feelings already diminished. Weird shit starts happening. First of all, my pupils don't just get big and then small again as they would with most substances. They freak out. Get really big and then really small in a second for no apparent reason, get in weird shapes and yeah... Then after 6 hours of last dose (and after an hour of sleep) they change from the usual grey-blue with a greenish outline to completely green eyes. Fucking amazing. :D

I have recently received a new batch of 4-FA myself, and I have the same ( I think ) problem that you are describing. In the picture I'm adding you can see the white fluffy, very good quality 4-FA in the capsules, whereas in the other bag is the new batch. both were tested positively 4-FA with no other active ingredients but no purity percentage is given by the dutch testcenters on RC's .


[http://i42.tinypic.com/2qtdfk7.jpg](http://i42.tinypic.com/2qtdfk7.jpg)


please add your thoughts on this, I currently don't have time to test them personally. still wondering what you guys think about it.

 I would take 200mg, and mix it with other stuff usually haha. The less you dose, the more it's a classic stim, the more you dose, the closer it feels to (a very speedy) MDMA

I used it as a study aid, 10/20mg oral, and after reading that thread on another forum I noticed a bad headache the day after. The thread on the other forum basically said that 4fa is neurotoxic (someone says so).

The first times it didn't notice any headache, then I read that topic ![(:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)D) and I noticed the headaches the day after. It happens to me if I use 4fa 2/3 times in a week, or even just one, so I think I'll switch to something else for my study sessions.

I was just going to write this now.


In total I had this substance 5 times. With smallest dose being 50mg and largest 500mg (with 100mg lines every 2-3hours). And sadly I have to say the comedowns are really bad for me. Worse than good (bad) old meph. 

The worst of all is the pain in nose, for the following week. I had it on sunday and still have clogged nose right now and had some bleeding, from 150mgs. But of course that's my thing that I can't resist snorting, if you eat it that's a big plus. Still, I'd always feel totally energyless and in bad mood the next day. There probably isn't any extra side effect compared to any other stim, but those common are really pronounced here.

In fact I'm unsure whether this substance is worth it for me. I still have a gram left and don't really look forward to use because I don't feel any euphoria whatsoever, just very talkative and speeded up, and the crash lasts about as long as the good effects.. hmhm.

I think I'll like 4-MEC, gonna try it next week

^yup, this is quite like my experience. I don't understand all the euphoria people are talking about on 4fa, maybe we have different definitions of euphoria or I might be spoiled from the over-use of mephedrone, which gave me the ultimate amazing euphoric feeling. But I have to say I quite like the fact that there's little to no mental comedown from 4fa (feelings of emptiness and depression etc), even though the physical side isn't pretty either.

Today one my friend received a batch of brown/"salmon" coloured 4-FA...! Never heard of it anywhere so obviously I ask, is it even 4-FA? Maybe cut with something, but it is consistenly slightly brown and also seems more crystalic, my own batches were a bit more like dust.. 


He also ordered some 3-FA which looks exactly like the old 4- but smells less intense.


I don't feel like trying that brown one myself really to check effects.

Ok so I have expericence with 4fa twice and the first time I already had mdpv in my system and didn't get to feel the actual effect.. me and my boyfriend and his friend did it last weekend about 150mg we thought it might be a fun way to move our furniture into our new place...it was pretty euphoric for about 3hours150mg and then speedy...we redosed late into it ...good expeirence overall..had suttle visuals even. We just got a gram of 4fastuff in the mail today; we plan on taking 200mg and redosing 3hrs into it..

**4-FA tested by police officers**


I had a bag of 4-FA (produced to a very high quality) tested by some police officers a short while back. It came back negative to all their tests. I can only assume which tests were tried but I'm fairly sure they tried all they had on hand (rich county outside NYC, I'm sure they had the gamut).


So, for me and my batch, it seems it will test negative to at least methamphetamine and cocaine. I am unsure if it is common for them to test for amphetamine or adderall as well, so I can't say whether or not it will pass for these.


A warning. It is also possible that many batches of 4-FA contain some unreacted amphetamine. Likewise 4-FMA can (apparently from what I have gleaned from this site and other sources) might very well contain some unreacted methamphetamine, and therefore test positive even if pure 4-FMA would not. So be very careful and don't assume it won't test positive just because mine didn't. By the way they had the powder for about 90-120 minutes. I don't know what tests they did but they didn't send it away because I was given the powder back. Probably the litmus style simple street tests.


Best of luck to you all! Especially those with legal encounters! By the way knowing a bunch of random scientific sounding words and chemical names and anecdotes regarding nootropics can be a helpful thing when trying to explain a mysterious bag of white powder. Might be worth a few hours of study and writing up a little cheat sheet to try to memorize some of. I wouldn't go so far as to say mislabel the bags when taken out of your house, but leaving them labeled with a shorthand version (my bag had 4A on it on a little sticker, no hyphen or A or anything) you recognize might be a fair idea.


Other tips. Stay cool and relaxed, but play a little concerned. Make eye contact. Don't bob your head or make furtive movements when being pulled over (tell your passengers too. This is a major red flag to police officers). If you remember tell passengers to make sure everything is away (this is how I was searched and brought in. IME it is almost always someone else who gets you in trouble). *Just get a plan for every case and bring it up in conversation now and again so that everyone has thought it through and knows how to act when being pulled over.* Also as you pull over use that time to synchronize your stories. They had 2 officers *run* out of their car up to both driver and passenger side and start viciously (to instill fear / nervousness and make us falter) interrogating both of us simultaneously. Be prepared!

**Comments, 4-FA solubility, possible cleaning method**

I'm not sure there is published data on 4-FA's true color when highly pure. Not all chemicals are pristine white in their most purified forms (for instance JWH-018 is a clumpy-ish yellow when pure according to the creator Mr. Huffman. It is fairly common practice for labs to cut or otherwise bleach the color out of these chemicals before selling them due to the common customer thinking whiter means purer). It is also interesting or at the very least relevant to note that even a disgusting looking powder can easily be 96+% pure. One example that comes to mind is some JWH-018 that was a deep brown sticky goo/oil was tested and still exceeded 96% purity. So an ugly chemical does not mean highly impure. Since the total dose of 4-FA in a night can exceed a gram in some individuals it is worthwhile to note the impurities can become dangerous in these amounts. 4% impurity in a 1000 mg sample is 40 mg. 40 mg of certain chemicals can be quite damaging (I don't know which precursors are likely to be in a contaminated sample of 4-FA so I can't guess how risky this is).


You might want to try cleaning it before tossing (or consuming) it. I did some solubility tests on my 4-FA. I didn't evaporate any of the solvent so I don't have exact numbers of solubility. As expected 4-FA is highly soluble in water (30 mg into a couple mL no problem. Quick with little agitation). Somewhat unexpectedly (for someone who knows nothing of other amphetamine solubility) undried acetone (so prolly 95-96% acetone and 4-5% water) was a poor solvent. It broke up the chunks / clumps into a fine powder that is easily stuck in suspension, but when left to rest settles out. No perceptible amount has dissolved into 7.5 mL of acetone. Again, though, I did not evaporate the acetone to see how much did dissolve. It did not seem like much, though (agitated ~20 minutes, room temp acetone). And I also did an undried heptane (should be roughly equivalent to naphtha) test. The heptane didn't seem to affect the 4-FA much at all. No powder appeared to go into solution. In addition the chunks and clumps didn't even break up at all unlike in the undried acetone test. The chunks stayed firmly grouped and settled immediately after ending the stirring. Heptane was cooler than room temp (prolly as low as 50-60 degrees F) and it was agitated for at least 20 minutes with no apparent change.


So. My recommendations considering the above. Try a naphtha (preferably dried, but mine wasn't) wash first. If that doesn't leave you with a white powder try an acetone wash (preferably dried) second. If that doesn't leave you with a white powder you might want to try to dissolve your impure powder into a few mL of water. Hopefully the impurities won't be water soluble and you can decant / filter them out and evaporate the water to get back the 4-FA.


Do a test wash before throwing your whole supply in. It is best for the solvents to be dried first (look up a tek with epsom salts for the simplest method). Just take a small amount (25-30mg) and do a naphtha (or heptane if you have it, but it's more expensive) wash. Just take a small thin jar, add the 4-FA, then add a few mL of naphtha/heptane. Stir / agitate for 10-15 minutes or so. Decant or filter out the crystals at the bottom and dispose of the naphtha. The same procedure would be used for the acetone (but you might want to use a smaller amount of solvent and even have it refrigerated to reduce the 4-FA solubility as much as possible) but it will take much longer to settle and be easy to disturb when decanting. You may or may not want to test how much acetone it takes to fully dissolve 25mg of your material. This will let you know how much 4-FA you will lose for each mL of acetone you use in the wash (it should be a very small percentage, but not as small as naphtha). The 4-FA should be left on the bottom of the container (NOT IN SOLUTION) just like the naphtha/heptane wash.


A last resort is the water dissolve. It is more time consuming and probably won't help, but it may just work. Dissolve your powder in as little water as possible. Just add it drop by drop and stir until the vast majority is dissolved (hopefully leaving behind a bit of yellow / brown gunk or goo. If this works it is because the impurity was less water soluble than the 4-FA. Using as little water as possible will give you the highest chance of a pure end product. Decant or filter off the water and evaporate it (this time the 4-fa should be IN SOLUTION) to recover your 4-FA.


I hope this helps someone at some point. Solubility data at least will be helpful to some googlers eventually.

How was redosing? I have read reports that it just draws it out, does not bring back euphoria or anything? WHen did you redose during your Exp? I have redosed once while peaking (not the best time to redose I realize) and didnt seem to do much but I did not redose a large amount, probably like 1/6 of the amount I initially took.


Also, anyone combine with tyrosine? Thinking about trying this when I do another trial soon. Will comment back later!

Thanks for the tutorials, I'll show this post to a friend and let him decide what to do with it, it's not a mine and it's just a couple of grams anyway (well that's still some euros so would be nice to get something of it).

I have 500mg coming my way. It cost me $0.00. Yay! Anyway, having very limited experience (weed, am-2201, Jwh-122, dxm, hydrocodone, alcohol, vyvanese, ritalin). What can I expect? And what roa/dose do you reccomend for a noob like me?

depending on your weight I'd suggest a dose somewhere between 120-140mg, more towards 120 if you're skinny, more towards 140 if you're heavier. this will surely induce the slight euphoric/energized buzz if you have good quality 4-FA.

I just received a gram of 4-fa that looks like this as well.  It is grayish/pink.  I have never had 4-fa before so I have no idea but this vendor has been totally legit in the past for other chems.

4-FA definitely has some comedown effects and slight next day feelings of depression ...1/10 as bad as MDMA comedowns though.The majority of it really seems to be sleep deprivation ,though. I was up 2 days before dosing 175 mgs spread out in two doses IV'd after eating about 300 mgs 2-FMA(this has really no comedown if you take care of yourself. best speed i've ever had,amazing.) ,the first two days and staying up through the night. 


I know its not smart to take SERT releasers after DA releaser (amp) use... 


I preloaded and post-loaded with : ALA 200mgs, NAC-1800 mgs + 500mgs vit c, b12 sublingually (methyl b12 is far superior BTW), phosphatidyl choline 800 mgs taken with 80% standardized milk thistle extract, zinc 50mgs, thiamine (b1) 250 mgs, dl-alpha vitamin e. I also take 2mgs xanax a day and 2 mgs suboxone a day. 


As far as herbs I drink various liver detox teas,chamomile, and green tea, but I took about 10 caps of ashwanga root and that seemed to really help. In the next few days I may use some liquorish root to help my adrenals.


I also took remeron at +5:00 and was out by +6:00, seems well suited to the task, and I just read its a CYP2D6 substrate meaning it increases metabolism and clearance of the drug, while also theoretically stopping any possible neurotoxicy,being a SERT antagonist/inverse agonist, kinda like what goes on with METH and seroquel or any D2 antagonists ... Tends to protect the axon from damage... 


I like to take gabapentin after doing any RC's ,as it's a neuroprotective agent and is generally good from stopping changes in the brain, at least temporarily. Seems to help.


Does anyone know how this is metabolized ,enzyme wise? Any hunches to what enzyme system it uses? CYP2D6 is probally it, but I don't have solid data to back that up yet, but its logical.

I`ve been using 4-FA for about a year( or maybe it`s closer to 2 years?) and this last batch I bought seems to produce a headache the following day. It`s a pretty crappy side effect that lasts up to 6mp the day after dosing.


Anybody else suffer from this? Any ideas why this happens? Could it be from impurities due to a less than stellar synth?

I never had this problem with any other batch.

I`ve been using maybe 1 to 2 times a month,maybe even less. When I had my last batch(about 5 months ago) I used maybe once a week. But then I ran out and had a 3 month break. I never had any headaches with the other batch. Only this new stuff.

I have used 4-FA often (started 10 months ago, use varying from 1 time/week to 4 times/week, and then not using for a month). About two weeks ago I started again and more recently I have noticed headaches towards the end of the comedown. I have been using the same batch that whole time, so perhaps the headache is something that develops with extended use, or has something to do with tolerance.

Hmmm. That`s a interesting idea. I ended up dosing some 4-FA tonight but I`ve got some L-Arginine(amino acid supplement) that should help with any headaches.

Has anyone combined this with 4-MEC ????   If so how was it?


4-FA at dosages (oral) of 150mg and above seems to be completely different experience then lower dosages. I was very impressed in that range and it seemed like a much more lucid version of rolling.  Wasn't as messed up, but felt tons of euphoria.  At least of the first 3 hours after which there was an alarming and abrupt switch to a more speedy side of it. But still enjoyable with weed and beer.   Not sure I'd like that second half without those, or just call it quits with some benzos or a sleeping pill.

once. it was weird. I wouldn't even say it was enhancing. it seemed like an overkill if I can remember correctly that and it seemed it could get way to intense in the worse way possible. Dirty drugs suck

I posted a trip report, it's on my blog. Click the little number to the left to see it. Actually here is the link: 

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/entries/5474-4-Fluoroamphetamine-%284FA%29-Trip-Report](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/entries/5474-4-Fluoroamphetamine-%284FA%29-Trip-Report)


Generally, this stuff is great, it is like Adderall but instead of making you all speedy, it makes you more mellow and SUPER empathetic and sociable. No real rush, and the euphoria isn't speedy like I like with Adderall. 


I like to take a pill and wake up feeling ready to do something. 4FA doesn't do that to me, it's very smooth up and down, I like it a lot, but i think I can find something better (more d-amp like) RC wise, I think I will try ethylphenidate next. Any suggestions are welcome.


It is probably best for a purely social drug, as it makes you want to socialize more than work...


This is very important: redosing is futile, it does NOTHING for your high. In fact, I don't even feel any additional stimulation. Seriously, redosing adds absolutely nothing to your high at all, i don't even think it prolongs it. 


Also, I wanted to note that on my 4th consecutive day of taking it, it made me feel like crap, dysphoria, no come up, just a come down. The next day, same thing, no matter how much I took. in fact, 100+mg didn't even get me out of bed.


I also want to note a big plus, and that is that this drug does not cause tachycardia for me like Adderall does. Sure, 100bpm at the most, but nothing like the 150bpm I get on d-amp. Usually, 4fa only raises my bpm by 10 resting. BP slightly elevated, prehypertensive range, but nowhere near dangerous. I think it's actually a pretty safe amphetamine, MUCH safer than Adderall. 


I will be ordering more, only because I know it will keep me stimulated for exams coming soon, and I am not comfortable testing a new substance right now. 4FA is not a good study aid, but it is a perfect social aid, you will connect with your friends and family like never before, and it doesn't make you act "over the top". You don't seem all speedy to others, it's a nice, natural hyperloquaciousness (over talkativeness).


(If anyone can recommend an RC that they think might suit me better, please PM me or respond in this thread).


Looking back I can see that even though I feel like crap, i wrote a lot and i would not have done that sober, so it does have some good qualities as far as functional stims go.


I also want to add, dosing ~75mg 4fa and taking 1mg of etizolam powder (which I can't find anywhere online now, dammit) and lying (or is laying, English confuses me sometimes) down in bed put me in this awesome, noddy, awakened dream-like state, where I was lying there with my eyes rolled back into my head in a state of bliss, almost as good as an opiate nod. 


I found that d-amp and alprazolam would do this to me too, but I'd have to wait until the d-amp was almost totally done, so i could only get to that state a day after taking d-amp. With 4fa, it's not so speedy so you can achieve that dreamy-nod-land that is so awesome.

Yeah... I find it difficult to find a dose that allows me to concentrate on working. Usually I get such a social mood that I have no interest in working, instead I chat chat and chat. Until the euphoria fades...

Right on, but I have made some good friends that i would have never talked to other wise, including some American students I usually find to be obnoxious and loud...turns out they're pretty interesting and really friendly.


Usually stims make me seem like a creepy schizo paranoid jacked up crazy person that won't shut up. On 4fa, I feel like a social grandmaster, it's great, but like I said: not good for much else...although I should mention sex is awesome on it and orgasms can be achieved one right after the other (even 20 seconds apart) and each time the orgasm is almost as strong as the first. I think i had 20 orgasms before I passed out, and they were all very strong. It was intense.

Random Data Point: I've been taking ~40mg of 4-FA, 3-12 times a day for over a week and I'm actually noticing less side effects as I continue.


Definitely noticing a tolerance because the first few days it was ~30mg a few times and as it's progressed, it's crept up to ~60mg doses. Much less effect than I got in previous days. I went from ecstatically high all day to a fun kind of zoned out artificial pleasure, to that artificial feeling with more peaks and valleys.


I've made sure to eat a bare minimum and sleep at least four to five hours a night. I wake up feeling fine and I haven't been dosing immediately when I wake up. No fatigue. Although the half life is 12 hours or something, yes? Anyone know the effective duration of action?


I'm not taking any more for a while now. I'll update if there are any noticeable rebounds or anything.


Harm reduction: I'm pretty sure I've achieved a steady-state where my body is adapting as if it were a real medication. You know how sometimes medications suck to start but then side effects fade? Steady-state concentrations of RC's are undoubtedly bad for you. To what extent, not sure.

Just got a new batch of 4-fa and want to do some testing on monday. If i wake up and take it first thing in the morning will it hit me hard or will it hit me less because of my stomach content being more acidic? ( I dont even know if it is more acidic in the morning...8() haha.  I WOULD ASSUME it would hit me harder as one time i took meph first thing in morning and OMG was i rollin. But if anyone can shine some light on this i would very much appreciate it as I cherish my "research sessions"

I did this chemical in the morning the first time I got the Good shit not that this chemical is good I guess purer shit is a better way of putting it. I got smacked super hard for three hours then it just kinda felt like I was slowlybcoming down off a very small methamphetamine buzz.

Did some just now after almost a month of absolutely nothing... Felling good, relaxed, but strangely rather drained of energy than stimulated at all.

A fair warning though: There is a rather bad comedown if you binge on it for a few days then abruptly stop. Really heavy depression/anhedonia and every muscle ached when I walked for a few days.

Try 2-FMA for a more dex-amp utilitarian purpose. 4-FA is for having fun.

Same here, actually I wouldn't say 4FA is a clean stim at all, maybe at very low dosages but all my friends who did more than 200mg over night felt very very tired the next day. Pentedrone is the "safest" stimulating RC imo but its effects are also bit weaker.

More euphoric than regular amp, less so than meph, more empathogenic than amp, less so than meph, longer-lasting than meph, and from my experiences, very mellow comedown - actually more like a plateau reminiscent of acid, as opposed to a "crash" like many empathogenics.

Can you guys describe the color and consistency of the 4-Fa you're getting? I have been getting an almost pink-ish 4-Fa but this new batch I've yet to try is off-white.


Regarding the 4Fa I've tried, the come up is smooth and within 30-40 mins I'm in an empathogenic headspace close to a mild dose of Methylone. This wears off after a few hours giving way to a general stimulation. It's the latter part of the drug that's good for getting things done.


If one is looking to use 4Fa as a study aid, experiment with low doses (~30mg) working your way up. Another suggestion: The serotonergic effects can be at least partially blocked by taking a low dose of an SSRI. When I was on Effexor (SNRI) 4Fa felt speedy and more Adderall like, with almost zero euphoria. (Adderall gives me no euphoria at <40mg.)


After using at 100-150mg/day for a few days in a row, the drug begins to only make me tired and I'm left with a significant depression that doesn't respond to more 4Fa.


Regarding tolerance: Tolerance to the empathogenic effects develops quickly. Delsym/DXM/MXE can be taken in low doses with 4Fa to stop you from developing a tolerance. Another positive is the dissociatives also reset my tolerance for tobacco and almost completely remove cravings. I'm down to 1 cig a day even while on uppers.


I don't know how anyone can snort or take this orally in solution. This drug tastes absolutely terrible. I can't even describe the taste but it makes Methylone taste like dessert. I parachute or take in a capsule.

I got what I think is a good batch of 4-FA, because pure 4-FA does not respond to Mecke, Marquis, nor Simon (obviously), and nor did my sample. It is completely white.

My 4-FA was pure white, fine crystalline powder that attracts static cling to bags and measuring tools.


I only dose 70mg orally or 60mg rectally, with sometimes a single 60mg redose later in the day. I've found it possible to lay motionless in bed "zoning out" to hypnagogic imagery, very strange for a stimulant. Also it is an amazing sex enhancer, far better than any other stim or methylone. I'd take 4-FA in the morning with the intention of getting some errands done during the day, but then I realize I just spent five hours rubbing my knob and looking up the kinkiest, most perverted porn... But I don't orgasm during these sessions, I deny myself the orgasm because I don't want to stop getting kinkier and kinkier... ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


I also notice the head pressure or tinnitus towards the comedown. Strange ringing in the ears that is accompanied with  a sinus pressure and headache. Shows up at about T+5h regardless of how much food or drink I've tried to keep my body filled with.

I considered 4-FA clean because compared to other stims I've tried, the comedown was very mellow and I took rather large dosages. I've never binged out on it, and I don't plan on it. Any stim can feel like shit when you binge on it.

Redosing question (oral)


If you take your main dose and plan to redose one time, is it better to do it while you are still in the first 3 hours of it and the euphoria is still present, or wait until the second half of it and the speedy effects hit?  The point being that I'm interested in extending the euphoria.


I'm wondering if this is one of those substances that you have to redose while you are still "up" to be able to extend the euphoria.. and waiting til you are coming down is too late.


Anyone ?

For me personally, if I want to prolong euphoria on any stim I have to do it pretty soon, before actual comedown. Waiting too long would just make me more speedy and anxious.

Update: It took three days of non-use for me to feel like shit. After three days I was absolutely miserable. I had never understood when depressed people talked about crying spontaneously but I had random urges, completely independent of my environment.


Also, extreme insomnia. I don't have any tolerance to benzos and I needed about 4mg clonazepam to sleep for a few nights. Naturally, these didn't fix my neurogenic misery so they really just wore me down further.


Tempting, but not great for prolonged periods.

got a question for those of you who have tried this compound? in low doses, does it jack your pupils up? im talking like noticeable.


i just ordered some of this stuff as a "work enhancer" but i can't be obviously on something. if so i'll just save it for other times.

I don't think low doses (10-30mg) are very noticeable. Very slight pupil dilation but not much else. Its almost like a better version of caffeine, for work I would recommend 2-FA because its not a euphoric which would be easier to work on.

I had a great day today! I dropped off my girlfriend at work at 9am then drove back home and had about 120 mgs of 4-fa. I played some fuzzed out bass guitar thru my big old amp for about 2 and a half hours straight. Wrote 3/4ths of a song(haven`t done that in a long while) and did some house work before going to pick up my girl from work at 5:30pm. Other than being a little jittery during the 5 block drive to work and back home,I had one of the better days to myself.

I reccomend 2-FMA instead of 2-FA for this.  2-FMA is the smoothest and most calming amp I've ever used.  It's like taking desoxyn with a few kpins.  Not jitters, not even jaw clenching for me.. at 85mg.  The come down is non-existant.  There is no moreish need to redose or binge on it either.  It's not euphoric at all, but it's not cold and hard-wired.  An amazing substance.


About to try out a lower dose (~40mg) of 4-FA).  My initial trial I used 120mg and it floored me.  My brain was tingling and my skin was crawling.  It's very powerful stuff.  Oral dose this stuff for smoother effects.

Does anybody know the bioavailibity of insufllated vs. oral consumption? Duration of effects? I want to try oral consumption but i am afraid i will waste it. When i insufflate it....it kicks in almost instantly peak effects (extreme euphoria) for 2-3 hours followed by HORRIBLE comedown...however no lasting effects the next day i feel fine. THanks guys!

If you can manage to wait 15-20 minutes, oral is the better route.  The whole experience is much smoother and you don't end up with a nasty fucking comedown.


Not even 100mg oral will floor me. 

I prefer to pop my amps instead of snorting, shoot or smoking nowadays.  Although with 3-FA.. .ya, I railed that a lot.  If I ever try it again, I will just orally consume it.

Anyone notice continued use almost diminish all the effects completely? I feel like sometimes taking 4-Fa the day after a 100-200mg dose produces very mild effects, even if taken at the same 100-200mg dose as the day prior. I've taken 100mg 4Fa and felt tired enough that I knocked out 40 mins afterward.


I also had issues with redosing sometimes causing drowsiness. I'm assuming the serotonin activity present in the initial phase of the drug's long duration is responsible for causing the somnolence/sleepy feeling that I get when redosing hours after the initial dose (I usually start with 100-110mg and redose 60-80mg 4hrs+ into it.) I feel this to be very similar to the somewhat sedating effects of SSRIs and 5-HTP/L-Tryptophan.


There are inconsistencies with how this drug affects me making it hard to predict exactly what I will feel on a specific dose depending on my recent interaction with the drug and maybe even my subjective mood. For example:


After a week long amphetamine hiatus, I take 110mg in the morning, feel great throughout the day and evening, possibly redose when I'm coming down (60-80mg) and notice only a subtle but sufficient come up that brings back the energy, productivity and some chattiness (but not the euphoria, which is OK with me.)


I end up sleeping for 8 hours on schedule, waking up feeling better than I did after my week long break, with no cravings or need to dose 4-Fa. But If I do, redosing the same amount finds effects significantly reduced (perhaps the 4-Fa really is just taking VERY long to break down in my system?) I go through the day, get another 8 hours of sleep and wake up feeling demotivated and fatigued, which is normal for me in a drug-free mindset (I've been suffering from major depressive disorder with fatigue for a decade.) This can be mild enough that coffee and a very brief walk in sunlight raises my mood up to optimal levels again.


When in this state, I get no real urge to re-dose because I've never considered 4-Fa to be a definite *bam-wake the fuck up* stimulant like high doses of dexamphetamine (adderall), cocaine or MDPV. With the latter drugs, the corollary effects are apparent and obvious no matter how I'm feeling and depending on the dose. The more I take, the more 'up' I get. I suppose at a deep level, I find 4-Fa to be more of a utilitarian chemical like Adderall or Ritalin, rather than a recreational drug, but with a chance of sedation at odd times into the experience.


But if I do redose, i.e., I need the focus/energy and really have to finish something, I feel more focused and may have more energy, but there's no definite mood lift or euphoria/mania as would be the case with other stimulants, or said effects would be transient at best. This would normally raise concern that perhaps the chemical is causing some lasting damage to serotonin receptors that requires ample time to repair, though the studies on this exact subject comparing 4-Chloro, 4-Iodo and 4-Fluoro in rats showed 4Fa to leave no lasting serotonin changes—they lasted only for hours after administration whereas the first 2 analogues resulted in serotonin receptor changes lasting days to weeks after a single dose. This was only one study and was done in rats, in which amphetamines are metabolized differently than in humans.


My experience can be exclusive to my body and brain chemistry because of several very significant factors:


1) 4 months ago I got off of a 1 year regimen of a very high dose of Effexor XR (took the max dose t.i.d under medical supervision.) I'd like to note that this medication is amazing and drastically improved my life. I had better sleep quality, more energy, more motivation and very low anxiety levels, and it didn't hinder my ability to trip on 2Cs. It did stop empathogens (M1, 4-MEC, MDMA, etc) from working but provided its own anxiolytic and empathogenic effects removing cravings for anything else. 


I only got off because my insurance plan expired and it's very expensive even as generic. *SSRIs/SNRIs have been (literally) life-saving for me and I highly recommend seeing a psychiatrist and following their orders if you suffer from delibitating depression or anxiety. The negative effects of the drugs are nowhere near as bad as those caused by clinical depression in some people. Ignore the psych med stigma. browse [http://insightsynthesis.com/category/depression](http://insightsynthesis.com/category/depression) )*


**Anyway**, to come back on topic, I mention this because from my personal experience, the SSRIs and SNRIs probably have a long lasting impact on brain chemistry and this may taint my 4-Fa experience. SSRIs begin working almost right away for me nowadays, and I still maintain a high tolerance to M1/MDMA. This tells me that my serotonin receptors have been desensitized and/or fine-tuned to work specifically and efficiently with the medication I was on. My brain adapter to the drugs and 4-Fa's serotonin activity may be playing on a completely different stage in my brain vs SSRI/SNRI-naive subjects.


2) I have been taking MXE daily for months, first at higher doses to diminish or eliminate the Effexor withdrawal (worked fantastically) and in the past 2 months not exceeding 30mg a day insufflated. This dose may incapacitate an MXE-naive subject but has no subjective effects on me. Sometimes I go days without it, but I take a small line here and there along with Aspirin, vitamins C/E, green tea extract, fish oil and a multi-vitamin to reduce general oxidative brain damage. The MXE is also used as a maintenance drug that has stopped me from acquiring a tolerance to stimulants, ethanol (careful with this) and tobacco. Maybe even weed.


As dissociatives ketamine and DXM have been shown to "reset" stimulant (and other) tolerances, with co-administration of a small non-recreational dose of these drugs (one Delsym serving a day, for example) and adderall showing users failing to develop a tolerance to the stimulant, I mention the MXE usage because it may impact how my body is responding to my 4Fa usage.


My new batch is clumpy, not 100% white (compared to standard white printer paper under white light), sticks to equipment/containers though not as much as MDPV which is so sticky some users describe as being "wet."


Due to the inconsistencies I mention above, I cannot give an accurate comparison of this batch vs the darker/tannish/pinkish looking batches I had in the past. The taste of this batch is not as strong as the older one, which may mean less impurities (or a diluted product.) But the effects between batches is not too significant in my case and I'm happy with this new stuff as it more closely matches what others in this thread have been using.


Overall, 4-Fa is an amazing substance that I've been cautiously researching to understand and work with more effectively. It doesn't have the manic-come-up and Enron-scale-crash Adderall and Ritalin have on me, lasts 2-3x as long as those drugs and feels somatically and subjectively cleaner. I can definitely see this drug as a non-jittery no-anxiety stimulant and antidepressant. Appetite and sleep are barely affected for the worse. On the other hand, it's still a halogenated amphetamine so please thread carefully. I suggest not exceeding 500mg/day. I personally have not exceeded 300mg/day.

I'm on my last 200mg today, I originally had 5g. I find that my tolerance to this stuff isn't as high as compared to other RC's I've used.  Usually 150mg orally, then through the night a few lines here and there and I'm feeling pretty much the same as when I first took it in the day.  Have felt drowsy a few times, but that's because I have been consistently taking it every day for about two weeks.


also, a little off topic- last night after about 50mg of 4fa, I took 2 10/325 hydrocodone and I felt amazing, my mood was elevated in a way I have never felt before. I am definitely going to experiment more with this combination.  Alcohol mixed with it surprisingly has a cool effect too.

This stuff is great, on its own or in mixes. Not the best chemical ever, but everyone i gave it to rather enjoyed it. I really hope it will stay well under the media radar and will not get banned like so many other great substances before!

I've done 4 fa twice, first time did about 120mg, and I really enjoyed it. Very euphoric for a good couple hours, then the second time took 250mg and what a waste! I felt euphoria maybe 10 minutes? Then I was only speedy, ordered a gram and will be here tomorrow, so def gonna only do 120mg, its been over a month since I've done anything, so im lookin forward to it![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This chemical seriously fascinates me to no fucking end (and i've done pretty much all of them).....I KNOW IT WAS STUPID I ADMIT IT but i have been binging on it for like the last five days (about 300 mg a day) and today when i woke up....NO depression, NO anxiety, NO cravings.....i could easily obtain some more right now but i have no desire i know i will wait at least a week. I can tell it releases alot of serotonin but for some reason it doesn't cause extreme depression, anxiety, and sleep problems like MDMA or even methamphetamine....this chemical is fucking fascinating....


Oh another thing...sometimes when i rail it (80-100mg at a time) it kicks in instantly and i get extreme euphoria for like an hour or so.....other times (same batch same shit) i rail it and i get euphoria for like 5 minutes and then straight to the anxiety sped-out feeling....interesting as hell.


Last thing i promise....i am not saying this chemical is perfect....at the end of the day when i have been railing all day...the comedown is literally worse than anything i have done...it feels like i drank a million cups of coffee plus a migraine plus anxiety plus depression...but the next morning i am fine.

^^Ummm...im just trying to be helpful...and i would advise you NOT to take it for the purpose you describe...it dumps serotonin almost like mdma...so being on trazadone and celexa will diminish the effects and might even hurt you (serotonin syndrome)....to me it is a euphoric drug i use only when i am not working or at school...try 2-fmp or something else that is pure stimulant and not a stimulnat/serotonin releaser....if i was on even 150 mg at work i would NOT be able to focus and it would be obvious i am on something....try harder to get health insurance for adderall or even fucking buy them off the street. THIS drug is like mdma mixed with speed with less of an after effect. I am only trying to help you buddy. If you want to go crazy with it a couple of nights a week or even less go ahead. But don't like order a gram and take it every day as an add moderator....cheers homie.

> — I Eat Pho said:


I haven't experienced any throat pains, however, administering 4-fa has led to some strange oral issues for me. My gums tend to get puffy and swollen after the comedown (similar to if you don't brush teeth for a week). I've also noticed various tongue bumps, spots, and sores. I hypothesize that dumping the 4-fa on the tongue and rinsing down can cause these, as it might kill some of the surface cells on the tongue. I'd venture to guess that the reasons for these sores are similar to yours.


(I did want to add that these only showed up after I had been binging and developed a tolerance, scooping bump after bump into my mouth.)

^The same difference as with any other stim, it comes up way faster, produces higher euphoria but lasts shorter and comedown is noticeable because you go from feeling great to normal quickly.


I seriously wonder though, whether snorting this is -only- painful or whether its actually destructive to the nose. Take coke, if its pure (sure I don't know anybody who did pure) it doesn't hurt at all but its still bad for the nose. 

What if this stuff burns a hole in our noses after few months? What if its just painful but not dangerous at all? ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

As someone who used this daily for about 2 months straight, I feel qualified to issue the following warning:  4-FA should NOT be taken daily.  Not only does it lose its unique euphoric feeling, it can cause serious depression if you're prone to it.  


If you're looking for something for ADHD, fatigue or another medical condition, there are better options (i.e. low doses of 2-FMA, ethylphenidate or 2-FA).  4-FA is a great party/social drug, and the negative effects *do* take a while to show up, but when they do you'll wish you would've heeded my warning, lol.

yeah, i had used about 250mg a day for about two weeks, and the stim qualites still work, but the euphoria just doesn't come back the next day. Food, sleep and water.  waiting between doses is so hard with this stuff- it's just too good.

Btw I have finally tried the brown coloured (also bigger crystals) 4-FA... and luckily it's not oxidized, probably just different production, because it works exactly as well as white ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

@Lady Codone:


Did you take it with an SSRI? I've been using it daily in low doses for depressive lack of focus and motivation, and I'm counting on the SSRI blocking the serotonin-releasing action, thus avoiding serotonin "burnout" in the longer term.


(EDIT: Not *recommending* to take it with an SSRI, as we don't really know how safe that is and I might just be lucky that it didn't kill me. Just asking for clarification because 4-FA-with-SSRI is probably a rather different drug than 4-FA alone.)


How long after stopping does this depression start for you? I hardly notice any crash at all after ~24 hours, but maybe I'm lulled into a false sense of security by the long half-life...


I stopped for 3 days recently (after stocking up blood levels by a recreational dose, though ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) and didn't feel anything particularly horrible, though I gave in eventually, since I didn't want to sit around all day doing nothing (fatigue).


@hgwells: Hmm, I don't find it to cause much compulsion to redose (and I did have that issue with MDPV).

I have a long history of daily overuse of both MDMA and mephedrone(and MDPV and quite a lot of things).  I had a couple grams of 4-fa a couple years ago and was unimpressed with it.  Found it less euphoric than regular amphetamines, mdma, methylone, mephedrone or related.


Got a couple hundred mgs from a friend a couple months ago (my best guess eyeballed, he had no idea of the weight and got it from another friend) and downed it before going to see a midnight showing of Fargo with some very close friends.  It was pretty good, especially considering I was also taking a daily SSRI (celexa, citalopram).  We ended up afterwards at the bar next door and I was having a great time socializing and shooting pool.  Just like I used to do when i had an adderall script.  In fact my buddy was asking me how it was and I described it as like i took a lot of adderall but not so pushy feeling.  Sort of how adderall was when I first started taking it.


This was much better than the results of taking methylone or MDPV with celexa.  Both raised my body temp several degrees F and there was no euphoria, just made me a jittery mess.


I was drinking though, and i didn't notice mdpv or methylone making me a jittery mess if i took them while drinking.


Just about any stim turns me into a jittery mess now though.  Even caffeine or nicotine.  For anyone considering daily use of RC stims, I would caution against it.  I have the medical problems to prove it's a bad idea.


Cheers,

-SimStim

Piracetam is a very useful compound that has been shown to a cause a noticeable positive effect on human brain function including memory and cognition (how fast you can learn) It is currently being researched in many fields here in the U.S  It is a prescription drug in some of the European countries in Russia as well. However it is the most researched of the ractam and nootropic compounds  chemists don't know how they improve memory and improve focus. From what I have learned in affects dopamine re-uptake but unlike other so called smart drugs like focalin, Ritalin, and adderall it does not affect nor adrenalin or serotonin either. So if one of its primary effects is the re uptake of dopamine then it might be worth trying a small amount with 4-fa or other things similar to it, might just find a great potentiator   for amphetamines. Oh and on a side note I have been taking Piracetam 800mg twice a day now for over a month and this stuff really does work, I mean it's not like genius pill in the movie limitless but I can remember so much more and my concentration is much better now to and it is noticeable it;s not like ginseng of something like that.   (by the way there are some big pharma companies trying to change it just so slightly that they can sell as a different drug for ADHD and ALZHEIMER so buy it while you can before big gov takes from us yet again something that is cheap is every where and works. I think one of my friend had just got some 4-fa and i have plenty of Piracetam so ill let you guts know I also use aniractam it is several times the strength of Piracetam but it does have some very mild anxiolyctic  properties to it so it might kind of slow down something like 4-fa but you never know!


Sorry for rambling on so much but when I read that comment about Piracetam and almost certainly aniracetam  working well together which by all means it could enhance the experience with most drugs or natural supplements that act on dopamine i

inhibition. I think will try it out and will post back with the results.  


Sorry about the words overlapping this is like my second post so I am still trying to get the hang of writing using this sites templates.

BananasAndOranges - yes it was powder. Tried to snort 10mg, was just as bloody painful as white powder so had to eat the rest.

LOkay so I been experminting with 4-fa, yesterday got my gram in the mail, when boyfriend got off work we did 100mg,

btw we plugged it, I have tried it every other way so I wanted to try that, well by plugging it I got some mild euphoria, way better than oral. And usually when I redose I don't feel euphoria again, well I plugged it 3 times and everytime I got great euphoria, im slowly coming down now, boyfriend is at work(probably coming down) lol. But I think this is my last expeirment with 4-fa,..thinking about trying butylone or 6apb ..4emc...any recommendations?

I plug both 4-fa and 2-fa regularly and it turned me into a massive raging homo. Oh the humanity.


I`m kidding. Eating 2-fa and 4-fa gives me really bad heartburn and I`d rather skip that if possible. At first I felt silly plugging(this was a few years ago) but now I`m over it. There`s nothing gay about putting drugs in your ass. It`s not like I`m smearing the drugs on some dudes boner first.8)


Chicks plugging drugs= definitely hot.

Alot of people seem to really love this stuff.

I dont know if its my batch or what but when my girl and I did some she got sick as hell and was fainting and everything. no bueno!

I was fine that night.

The other night I took 1/2 of the dose I took that night and I was feeling lightheaded and almost fainted from +12 hours to +48 hours afterwards.

Needless to say, the 2 grams I have left will be going in the trash.

I dont have much of a use for this amp.


edit: the doses the 1st night were apprx 150mg a piece and the recent dosage was about half that

That`s one thing that sucks about the grey market. No regulation. Sometimes my 4-fa looks one way,other times, another way. The last time I had 4-fa it gave me a 2 day headache after each session. Less than cool.

 Haha yeah, I can confirm this. I differs a lot between batches but it can be very painful.

Yeah, I got 5gs from a trusted vendor on a popular vending site. All reviews were flame...


Is 4fa serontogenic (sp?)

I noticed some possible lingering blues and had thought it was just a middle of the road amp.

Anyone know how long 4-fa can be kept without going bad in one way or another? I have found some older stuff and I'm reluctant to try it. I'm thinking though, the effect of it might've lessen, but it can't possibly become highly toxic or something, right?

When truly in doubt, you should probably toss it.


Next time store it double bagged and in a jar or something in the freezer to be sure.


Id say itd probably be safe if its under a year old...but keep in mind you have no idea how long the chemists/vendor had it before they shipped

It's around half a year old an has been stored double bagged and well laying around, in a purse, drawer etc... It's never been exposed to heat or sunlight. Meh I don't know, it feels weird.

I would say that 4-FA is relatively stable, however it depends on just how old yours is and how well you had it packaged.

Doh! Just realised I have a very good vaporizer. I never tried vaporising anything else than weed though. Obviously theres one problem, we don't know melting point of this, do we.


Has anyone succesfully vaporized this?


Oral works well good for me but I'd like to experience faster onset for once (yeaaaah, once...) so this would be the only option. I don't want to ruin and melt it.

Best way would be like anything else, get a vape pipe, like the kind used for smoking meth (call it a chicken bone, glass dick, whatever).  Next best would be light bulb, then foil.  Real meth freaks can blow these pipes with blow torch and glass tubing, otherwise check local headshops, you can easily tell the difference between a regular bowl and one meant for vape (google it if u must).


It's easy, you just add the chem on top for foil, or inside for vape pipe or light bulb, then apply heat from the bottom via lighter, alcohol burner, or when desperate candle/oil lamp.  When it starts to smoke suck it with a straw (or if using vape pipe from stem).  I'm not gonna tell you how to prepare a light bulb, but you should be able to figure it out.  There is a WHOLE technique to each method and there is some practice involved before you get good at it.  If you know any former meth heads ask them and they can teach you a lot.


FYI smoking amphetamines quickly leads down a bad path toward addiction.  Believe me, I know.  Everyone says oh not me, but eventually everyone gets bitten in the ass by it.


Also, you said you don't want to melt it.  It will necessarily melt before it begins to smoke.  This is known as sublimation (or phase transition).  It goes solid>liquid>gas according to the temp and atmospheric pressure.

I would like to share my 4 fa experience. 

Info about me:

19 year old male. 165 lbs. Physically fit. I work out almost everyday and consider myself to be in relatively good shape. 

Setting:

At a house party, then to a dance event the first night. The following morning's experience took place in my room on campus and the surrounding area. Nice spring day.

Last night around 8:30pm i took 160mg of 4 fa orally on an empty stomach and it surprisingly kicked in 30 minutes later. I have done this RC probably about 10 times at varying doses from 50-200mg and this was the fastest it has kicked in. I contribute its speedy uprising to the 2 tsp of baking soda dissolved in water i had consumed 45 minutes prior. I had done some research on a baking soda solution and its effects on making the stomach more basic so as to absorb more of an amphetamine. Anyways, this was one of my better experiences on 4-fa and had intense rushes to my head and tingling throughout my body. I was able to talk to anyone with the upmost ease, savoring the articulation benefits from 4 fa. I had 2 shots and 2 beers over the next hour and i was completely enveloped in a euphoric haze that lasted more than enough time. I spent my night dancing which proved to be an incredibly enjoyable experience. I felt the music flowing through me and had intense empathy for all people. This was just as i remembered it, except for much much better. I was not keeping track of time, but as the euphoria declined i proceeded to rail about 100 mg of DMAA mixed with another 50mg of 4 fa over the next hour. I was optimally stimulated for the rest of the night and believe i had taken the perfect combination. I smoked 3 ciggarettes which i crave especially bad while on 4-fa. There was no chance of sleeping tonight. Atleast at a reasonable hour. I eventually drifted off at 6:30am, slept for 3 hours and rose wide awake at 9:30. I was fine at first but the exhaustion was catching up to me so i proceeded to take a small dose of 4 fa. This binging on 4 fa has led to stellar results in the past but this time i miscalculated my dosage and in my weakened state took way more than what i wanted. I could not say exactly how much i took and why i had such a strong reaction, but 45 minutes later i felt as up as ever, but as i ate my breakfast i descended into a blurred reality and grew incredibly paranoid about everything. I was eating with some friends who were unaware of my state of mind. I struggled to look straight ahead but things began to spin, like it does when i am really drunk. This extreme dizziness scared me and was incredibly distracting from the conversation and found myself completely withdrawn from the situation. I frantically hurried back to my room and sat down on my bed with the lights off and tried to take deep breaths in hopes of returning to reality. I researched the symptoms of an Overdose and i partially fit the description. At this point i was at the peak of my "ride". I continued to take deep breaths and tried to calm down my racing heart which was pounding throughout my head at an extraordinary rate. 

No luck. It was only getting worse and my blurred vision turned to visual distortions. Suggestions said to go outside for a walk in the cold to lower your heart rate and relax you, which i did. This helped a little and although i was still extremely scared, once in the daylight my visuals declined and over the course of my 15 minute walk i somehow was able to turn my anxiety into euphoria. I suppose i would know if i had experienced an overdose, but i only know what they show on tv. I did not have seizures and although i was in a psychosis, i figured if i was truly OD'ing i would not as well as i am currently.

I am writing this in the late afternoon for the most part down off my trip, but still mildly stimulated. I also had a cup of coffee an hour ago which seemed to bring back some of the effects in a beneficial way. (p.s. As i sat on my bed during the peak of my trip i took my resting heart rate and was astonished to observe it at 125 BPM!!!) I will continue to rest for the remainder of the day and will think twice about taking such high doses so close to one another. I went back and weighed what i have left of 4 fa, and estimate my dose must have been well above 200 mg. on an empty stomach and lack of sleep. Please use caution with this chemical. I assume that i did some damage to my brain and wish i could take this back. This drug is truly unique with tremendous capabilities, but know your limits. I consider myself lucky to have come out of this relatively unharmed. 

I would like to say this will be my last time i will ever do 4-fa, but i enjoy it far too much. Maybe after i finish off my stash i will give my brain and body a long awaited rest.

Thanks for the info,


however after discussion in different thread I have decided not to vape it. Not only it will destroy some of the material, the potential for addiction is too high. I already had my problems with snorting amphetamines and smoking/vaping is apparently that worse even. Also lately I tend to have problems with vasoconstriction from relatively small doses, and this would make heart work harder than oral.


BlindGenius - thanks for the report. To me it seems you're quite new to stims/amphetamines in general. You just experienced one of the more-than-you-should doses but I assure you were nowhere near true overdose. I don't think you did permanent brain damage to yourself either. The most important thing it to calm down, I know how hard it can be but you must, you will feel completely normal very soon. 125 resting bpm is high though. I start to feel uncomfortably when my resting goes over 100 (however one time on meph I reached 150, seriously thought was dying). 

At least you know that taking unknown amounts of drug is dangerous. Always weigh everything and make sure you don't feel too bad when redosing. Sleeping just for 3 hours and feeling wasted is obviously not a great time for taking more. 

But it could be much, much worse. Theres so many bluelighters here who could tell you whats real paranoia and psychosis caused by too much amphetamines...

Amen to that.  Come see me once you start hiding on the floor next to your window with a shotgun bc you think people are breaking into the house....believe it or not it CAN even be worse than that.  I have, first hand, seen people do some terrible, violent things who were up too long on MDPV....


I tend to trend more that direction now, myself.  Which is why I rarely ever do stims anymore.  Especially cathinones.  Never felt that from 4fa, but i've never been on a 4fa binge that lasted for weeks and weeks and weeks either.  I wouldn't discount the possibility.

Thanks for the reassurance. Id imagine i did some type of damage to my brain atleast to a certain extent. Maybe not at the same levels of other more powerful stims. However, for the first time i actually experienced a "hangover" from it due to my incredibly high dosage. I went back and figured my dosage was probably around 350mg on a completely empty stomach. This is now the day after and i have felt so unmotivated to do anything, even talk to people. Even swimming, an activity that usually leaves me with energy and happiness, has done nothing for me. I will give it a few days and hope to see myself return to baseline. Would it be worth it to take a supplement to work towards my recovery? Ive been looking up PQQ and acetyl-L Carnitine and those seem to be effective at restoring mitochondrial function.

What's a good smoked dose of 4-FA HCl salt? I just hit 3 key bumps off foil, but don't want to smoke more for fear of OD. I am also on a decent amount of suboxone.


Friendly hint for those who want to try smoking it: Inhale slowly. The first time I tried smoking it I took a big hit, coughed and it hurt my throat A LOT. I almost decided never to smoke it again, and only did so tonight because I wanted a little something to keep me from nodding so hard form the bupe.

Sorry for nitpicking but sublimation is actually a specific process where a substance transitions directly from the solid phase to the gas phase, skipping the liquid.

I gave this chem a try yesterday. I actually wanted to just tip toe in to see how it would go, so I capped and plugged 35mgs. The initial rush was smooth and really nice, and the ways of euphoria were pretty nice, but the nervous energy was more than I was expecting at such a low dose. After 3 hours I started to not feel right, and I was sweating pretty bad. My buddy suggested a drink, so I drank 1.5 shots of vodka, which took the edge off and allowed me to concentrate again. Restlessness lingered into the evening, but my mood stayed consistent. There appears to have been no hangover at this level. 


I didn't really know what to expect in this experience, and while I liked the first few hours, the tweaky hours that followed I did not like. I have never really liked speed, but those who do really like this one.

I didn't notice anything negative from plugging, there was no burning sensation or anything of the sort, but it did onset very fast. I did this without much reservation, as I've plugged other amps, molly, and beans with zero side effects. While some recommend dissolving, I simply capped mine in an emptied vitamin cap. 


Ive found plugging to be the best form of admin on most things. Its easier on my stomach, is more direct to the blood stream (often requiring less for the same effect as oral/insuffilating). A sandwich bag covering your finger keeps things a lot cleaner. For you homo ninnies, stfu, we're doing drugs here.

120 mg 4-FA and 150 mg MDAI is actually a pretty damn good combo. The doses of each are pretty conservative so it doesn't feel too hard on the body, and I was actually able to sleep pretty soon after the positive effects wore off. Just a tip ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

At around 4 hours ago I ingested orally approx. 120mg of 4-FA, 1.5 hrs ago 25mg of ethylphenidate was also ingested. I'm around 120lb. 5'4" with a good tolerance and experience with many stimulants. I'm frankly surprised of the euphoric tingles going through my body. I have a good amount of energy so I will be working on my CAD drawings for a while.(in school for civil engineering) In no way do I recommend this combo for beginners or of stimulant sensitive individuals. Oh, forgot to mention the 50mg booster of 4-FA before taking the ETH(sorry)![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Sorry to hear about your friend, sounds definitely like stimulant overload and amphetamine psychosis. He will recover hopefully. How large was his dose? Butylone would have definitively made a small dose of 4-FA feel like a OD i imagine...

I doubt I will ever take this drug myself, but all knowledge is power, even knowledge that can be used to get high.


Has anyone ever used this drug while on a low maintenance dose of opiates? Any neuro-toxic effects from this combination?


Exactly how long is the half life again, without reading 24 pages of anecdote? If I take it in the morning can I sleep at night?


How would you compare it to similar RCs? What RCs would you compare it to? If this is a 'long acting' drug, then what would a shorter acting one be, just for perspective?

My guess is that halflife is similar to meth, that is 10 hours. But I don't it's exactly known yet as with most RCs.

Half-life has nothing to do with how long the effects subjectively last (well at least not in direct proportion). I really think that h-life will be around 10 hours but the "high" effects last no more than 3-4 hours, with no stim tolerance. However inability to sleep can easily last those 10 hours.

Yes, and everyone should remember that "amphetamine" psychosis can potentially come from any stimulant.  Whether it's cocaine, methylphenidate, 4-mec, etc.  If it's a stimulant, psychosis is a real possibility.


Contributing factors are stress, lack of sleep, poor nutrition, dose, set, setting, and mainly **bingeing**.


Once it happens to you, nearly 100% guaranteed to happen again.


Be careful folks.  Especially playin' with needles, high doses of stimulants, prolonged use, or all three.

I think if your friend had some strong prescription sleep meds and some counseling from a good friend he might of came out ok who knows.  But a trip to the hospital and a life on looney pills, not worth it.  Withdrawal symptoms from psych meds rivals or is even worse than a meth psychosis.

When I finally kicked MDPV in 2010 I was so terrified I couldn't even sleep at night.  My doc wrote me a script for ambien (zolpidem) at night and neurontin (gabapentin) during the day and this made all the difference.  I wasn't afraid to be home alone anymore or sleeping with knives in the bed ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Once you get the psychosis you should never, ever, ever try to take something like ambien to try and come down.  Even phenazepam.  It will only make things MUCH worse!  I speak from experience here.


Even if you have had the psychosis in the past and are feeling fine now, you shouldn't take z-drugs or benzos to try and come down.  Can make the psychosis quickly rear it's ugly head.


I promise not to post anymore about this topic (which is not 4-fa) anymore in this thread!  Just hoping I can help some others to avoid problems.  Otherwise I have been through a whole lot of crazy bad shit for nothing.  Better me than you, right?

I tried 4-fluoroamphetamine today for the first time, and I must say I'm very impressed.  I'm a little disappointed about the potency being as low as it is, but the goods I received are of very high quality so I am getting my fill out of it.  It is a lot smoother than amphetamine salt combo and dextroamphetamine, but so far from my experience not as euphoric as methamphetamine is.  Even at a real low dose, 5mg, methamphetamine can be quite euphoric.  I'll try a large dose to drop at once before work tomorrow.  If it last as long as people say, I should be able to take some 30 minutes before work and be able to still enjoy some reading when I get home for myself.  


This RC has excited me to actually want to look into a few of these stims, particularly the fluorinated aromatic amphetamines.  I want to stay away from beta-ketones and thiophenes but amphetamines I'm a bit more comfortable with if they don't have any obvious nasty metabolites (4-CA for example).

Without an amphetamine tolerance, I find 100 mg orally to be sufficient. Could probably go higher but at that dose I get wonderful euphoria without physical stimulation (which can cause me to get anxious).

it is quite freaking active, orally.  some things just dont work unless you use a certain ROA but this stuff....there is no need to IV it.  i only mention that since that is the highest on the chain of ROAs.  well, IM would be the same but with a slower onset.  im glad many here seem to not have had a bad experience with it.  however, with RCs, you really are playing with fire.  you never know what the fuck it is.  i would feel more comfortable buying street H than 4-fa from a vendor i did not know well.  i guess the moral is know your vendor well....er something.

I noticed 4-FA mixed real well with Etizolam.  Partly it may be because of my benzo tolerance, reducing the number of side-effects I get with each dose, but etizolam itself is already not very sedating with the recommend amount of etizolam for insomnia according to wiki is 1-2mg before bed (for me this would be closer to 3-4mg).  Because IMO the lack of sedating properties yet with anxiolytic and muscle relaxant properties, it complimented the stim high with out decreasing it's effects like what you'd expect with a heavy sedating drug to do to a stimulant.  


I found it also mixes real well with methadone.  I don't like amphetamine salts and methadone, honestly I really hate this combo, as it's either be on amps or done, can't be a synergy.  4-FA mixes smoothly with methadone, adding a lovely body high to the 4-FA and the complementing euphoria's are fantastic.  I wish I had some desoxyn right now in front of me to compared.  I only tried desoxyn 5mg once and that was with 20-25mg of oxymorphone (fantastic experience, one of my favorite drug experiences).  If even that small 5mg could synergize so well with oxymorphone I wonder how meth would work with methadone.  I should look into some of the other fluoroamphetamines and maybe I'll find a great substitute for speedballs with methadone or other opioids.  


Anyway, time for work.  Last day of tax season.  ~120-30mg of 4-fa down the hatch and 15mg smoked and 10mg nasal.  Last night I even did a 1 mg vape of 2c-p, was kinda interesting, worked kidna nice with the 4-fa.  I bet it'll work better with just a low dose methadone day and the 2c-p.


I might indulge in a 2c-p trip tonight, but maybe not.  I much rather have a day where the parents aren't home and I'm free to trip starting around 10 in the morning.  We'll see what happens.  I wont jump into anything I'm not feeling.

honestly the difference isnt That staggering. I have had shit that made me almost end up in er...Bunk impurities. I have had five batches of 4-fa.The only one that compared to mdxx was the sparkling white clumpy one that rolled into balls it was so damn clumpy and shiny. 80mgs of that had me floored for 3 hours....I havent dosed that high with this chemical again though do I dunno. I am sick of the bs regarding different batches. I wonder if the vendor I got the better stuff from is even around.

uhh i wouldnt use it at all just because its a research chemical and not much is known about it


have you tried it before at all? im really interested in the effects, please post an experience and a comparison to say, adderall if youve taken it

If you would have read all of my post you would see that i have tryed it and its like a cleaner version of speed IMO very good and there is alot known about this chemical as it has been banned in the uk since 1977 there have been a good amount of studies  if you just searched around buddy

sorry i just looked on erowid and it said that its not the most reliable, but i guess that it would seem safe if youve done the research

id say it seems 75% safe from what i have researched i have had no bad comedowns or any any bad side effects other then the first time not being able to sleep till 3am or so like 10 hrs after i took the drug but now im going to be ingesting it ever day around 9-10am

so by sleep time i should be well ready to sleep great and i love the nice feeling when i get in the bed on this its like i just sink right on into it such a relaxing mellow almost like clean meth but stronger almost like mdma but alot weaker takes 30mins to kick in lasts 3-4 hrs then a nice nice comfort that never really feels like a comedown just kinda fades into a different feeling till i sleep and then wake up 100% refreshed

you think 4 fa is more like mdma than m1???????????!!!  dude, m1 is just a bk version of mdma.  i dont know how you get any closer.  


the variation between batches is VERY really in my past experience.  just like MXE.  i mean wild variation.  IME again.  


the dif between something like smooth amp and something that makes you roll is pretty severe to me.  


sadly, the only reason i comment on this thread is because of how much this stuff scares me.  fluronated amps are pretty neurotoxic and one can feel it if they admin IV.  a huge headache wales through the skull.  it really tells one something.  i wouldnt touch it ever again.  


ok.  i should really stop posting.  i get i have vicarious PTSD just from witnessing a friend try to off himself on this stuff.  


i should be happy that others are able to enjoy it without psychosis and sleep dep(not hand in hand).  everyone be safe.  no need to sniff this stuff.  just bomb it.  PLEASE.

For me m1 was much less like mdma than 4-mmc, and 4fa far less than either.  I also wouldn't rate 4-fa as high as meth or regular amphetamine.


Apparently it's YMMV for any of these type of chems.  I have only had 4-fa a handful of times (maybe 8 ), while I have had hundreds of experiences with mdma, 4-mmc, and probably several dozen with m1.  Partly that is because 4-fa was not all that interesting in comparison (2 separate batches, 2 years apart, different sources).


If you are gonna try it, do it now while it's cheap and plentiful.  Prob won't be around too long.  Although I thought that about m1 when I first bought it in 2004, and it was legal here all the way up until last year.  4-mmc, which I thought was a much better drug, didn't last anywhere near as long.  4-fa has probably been on the rc scene about as long as m1 was so maybe it's due already.


Possibly some of you can remember the days before the UK mephedrone/m1 explosion, back when m1 was about $120/g and only a few vendors were carrying it.


Cheers again,

I did read the whole thread. The thing is, I don't know organic chemistry at all, so I am in no position to judge anyone as more or less valid. 4-FA does seem very similar to 4-CA structurally, but I don't suppose that means the world.

No, fluorine is not more similar to hydrogen than fluorine. However, 4-FA does not seem to be neurotoxic to serotonin neurons in rats.

What damage? It's a fairly benign stimulant as far as I can tell, I don't see what it could do to you that another couldn't...

Edit: Ooooh, you're talking about the similarity to para-chloroamphetamine.

is bullshit. I can go into the chemical details if you want, but it should be evidence enough that 4-FA doesn't cause long-term 5-HT depletion in rats (a reliable indicator of neurotoxicity) while almost every other serotonin releasing agent under the sun does, obviously including mephedrone, MDMA, MDA, methamphetamine, etc.

That's nice to hear. The consensus seems to be that 4-FA is not neurotoxic, so I shall gleefully embrace it. I do have one question, though - considering that it's serotonergic, is it important to take breaks between using it?


What about using it on a daily basis, at low doses (for concentration purposes)?

I wouldn't say it isn't non-neurotoxic, but as it seems not that much as other compounds with a similar work-mechanism.


I'm seeing people now doin' this stuff in hellish amounts because they read here that it isn't "that bad" for ones health, but no one does exactly know how bad it really is!

Tried this stuff a few times last year and will never touch it again.


I am very experienced with stimulants, and have tried pretty much every RC and illegal stim out there, and this stuff gave me the most unpleasant comedown and after-effects of any of them. 


Doses from 30 mg to 50 mg provided maybe an hour or two of pleasant stimulation followed by several hours of anxiety and tweakiness.


Doses from 100 - 150 mg provided a 3 - 4 hour, super-speedy, quasi-MDMA esque roll which quickly faded into stimulated anxiety that lasts 12+ hours and keeps your pupils dilated for up to 24 hours.  I did a full dose like this twice, and both times I experienced the most hellish, suicidally depressing comedown I have ever had.  Makes the MDMA crash look friendly and fuzzy by comparison.  Felt like I had a serious flu, muscles were fucked, and it seemed as if all the happiness had been drained out of the world.  Also, for 2 days following the dose, I experienced 'brain zaps' when standing up or walking that made me feel dizzy, as if I was about to pass out.  Very worrisome symptoms all around.  


Even Desoxypipradrol and MDPV, which have both fucked my head into complete psychosis in the past due to lack of self control, have an easier comedown than this stuff. 


I'm not trying to dissuade anyone from trying it, because everyone reacts differently to these compounds, but I wanted to share my experience.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has had this reaction from 4-FA.  Be careful!

will be starting 2 week trial in morning 


also found this

NOT MY TRIAL 


4-FA's effects with regular use over 4 months.

For reference, I only parachute or gelcap it. Snorting it is too painful to be worth it, the one time I attempted plugging/enema-ing, it didn't work, and I'm too much of a pussy to shoot it or anything.


I've been doing 4-FA 4-5 times a week every week (except for one 7-day break) since december, and, surprisingly, it has yet to lose it's luster. Trying to do it more than 4 times in a week makes it lose it's euphoria, but taking a two day break always brings it back. The two day breaks aren't too bad, no crushing depression or anhedonia, just boredom and low energy with long, vivid dreams. (The dreams are odd. Not scary, just... odd).


Last month I took a 7 day break to see how it'd feel. Surprisingly, once I got past the first two days, the next 5 were easy. It was like I never took anything at all. Sure, there were cravings, but nothing that wasn't managable.


My tolerance is higher than most, needing 350mg or so to feel the way I used to off of 150mg. Other than that, the regular use has made me lose weight (190 to 150 since starting), destroyed my social anxiety, and has made me a lot more friends as a result.


Only negative side effects I've noticed is loud tinnitus on the two day breaks, (which went away by day 4 of the 7-day break) and my blood pressure being rather low on days I don't have it. (noticed when I went to the doctor for an unrelated problem and I was told my blood pressure was 90/60 (120/80 being average)). I know that sounds low, but high blood pressure is far more deadly and if it was a cause to worry my doctor would have said so.


Reason I'm posting this is because most 4-FA reports on the internet have been about a single use rather than a lot of use overtime.


Disclaimer: There's a chance I could just be extremely lucky here, don't go ahead and do what I did without realizing that it's still an RC and you might have side effects that I didn't. I went in to this knowing the risks, and I was planning to stop as soon as the negative side effects became unbearable. They never did, so I never stopped.

No offense bro, but I don't think it was the 4-FA that caused your friend to almost kill himself. 4-FA doesnt make you psychotic from just one dose(As far as I know). It's probably all the other shit he was doing combined with it. 4-FA alone is a clean drug in my experience, really mellow and relaxed. No thoughts of suicide, as it releases serotonin. Hope your friend is doing well.


And to the guy above who said he's too much of a "pussy" to shoot 4-FA...you're not a pussy for not shooting. Only idiots shoot stuff up. That is a clear way to get addicted to stuff. Always eat your dope. Never snort or shoot it. And don't plug it either...that's just gay.

There's not much known about anything in life...you just have to take some risks some time. Just driving a motor vehicle is a risk (much more so than taking a dose of 4-FA) So think about that before you get scared to try something new.

Wow that's crazy bro. I did about 250 mg's first time I ever tried the stuff and I had an unpleasant comedown (Was hard to sleep or get comfortable) But nothing like what you mentioned. I actually redosed 3 more times that same week (With less each time) and the comedown was not bad at all the last two times. I wonder why you reacted so harshly to the stuff? Most people find the stuff to be easy on the body. I get a lot worse next day effects from 6-apb than I do from 4-FA. I think less than 1% of the people who do this drug will get a harsh reaction like you got. I've never heard of anyone else say this and I've read lots and lots of reports. I did hear of 1 person on Eroiwd who called it the "flu" drug but it's possible they're just allergic to it.

I personally love 4fa 

Normal amphet is wank in the uk atm

So I was browsing my 4fa source and they have started stocking 2fa and 3fa


Can anyone tell me the difference between these? 

I might take a punt and buy all 3 for testing as there all the same price. Which has me further stumped as to what the difference could be?

4 is generally considered to be best, I also tried 3 and it seemed like a pure speed, speedier than 4 and less empathic.

There arent many reports on 2.

So 4-FA isn't supposed to be very neurotoxic? Would 3-FA be even less so? I'm assuming that 3-FA works less on serotonin as it goes more down the stim road?


I'm on a low dosage of SSRI (20mg Lexapro daily) but am always wary of the dreaded serotonin syndrome.

I was under the impression that a stimulant psychosis can happen, albeit rarely, from one use in susceptible people. I've certainly had really bad reactions to amphetamine from a single dose, not to the extent of full-blown psychosis, but still it can happen. Maybe it's less likely for 4-FA, I'm not sure, but care should be taken with any amphetamine stimulant in regards to psychiatric events in certain people.

Anyone here have an idea of how much serotonin 4-FA releases? I've been dosing 30-40 mg of 4-FA for the past 4 days and it's been lovely so far. But I don't want to fall into MDMA-like depression eventually.

I agree about your comparison of 3-FA to 4-FA though.  4-FA produces more of that golden MDMA roll feeling, whereas 3-FA is strait hard-wired mode.

Yeah but exploding into flames is a far worse death than if you were to die from 4-FA (Which I dont think there's ever been a death from the drug yet) As to psychosis from a single dose...well people should know if they are suceptible to that or not. I doubt 4-FA would be the first stimulant they have ever tried.

Compared to 3- and 2- FA, of course, I thought its clear enough. Since both 3- and 2- are more straight speeds, they're not worth taking imo when you can simply take adderall or some else pure stim that has been researched. Whereas 4-FA is a FUN drug thats why its best out of these 3 imo.

^Yes I agree.  I haven't tried 2-FA, but from what I know, it is more akin to classic speed just as 3-FA, but possibly smoother(?) than 3-FA.

This is a ridiculous statement.  When the psychosis comes it is without warning and can come from any stimulant.  You can never be so cocky as to say "it will never happen to me."  Just because it hasn't happened yet definitely doesn't mean it won't.


I did lots of stimulants for a lot of years before I ever had a problem with it.  I always thought "oh not me, i'm careful."  Then it did kick me in ass and I have been both hospitalized and in jail more than once because of it.


I'm lucky not to be dead or in prison and thank God for that everyday.


Keep playing around and it will get you, too.  It probably won't even come the one time you shoot meth, it will come the 200th time you eat something you consider benign like 4-fa.  Yes, one dose of 4-fa is unlikely to cause it, but long-term use of any stim is almost guaranteed to cause it.  


I think MDPV is dirty mother and more likely than any to cause earlier onset, but I have seen people get it from mephedrone, amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate and cocaine for sure.  Definitely if you have obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar (esp with psychotic features), schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, or anything like that, it would be best to stay away from stimulants and psychedelics.


Cheers,

I even have a friend that took a tiny dose of mephedrone, maybe 50mg and was her first time to eat it, and then couple hours later went home and tried to commit suicide by eating a whole bunch of pills.


Luckily she went to the hospital and had stomach pumped and such and is now fine.

Well, the psychosis comes as a consequence of consuming way too much of a stimulant and not getting enough rest. So yea, it can probably happen from any 'real' stimulant, RC or not, but to say that it will happen to anyone who uses stims regularly is a bit of a stretch. Some people just have more self-restraint and won't let themselves do what their impulses tell them to.


Personally, I do 4-FA in small doses - so far the biggest dose I have done is 40mg. I love the drug and even at the lower doses I can feel the entactogenic and dopaminergic effects it produces. The effects do diminish a little with regular use, but not to the extent they would if I were the more common (80-100mg) or even higher doses.

Speaking from personal experience, after I overdosed on a certain substance, I had an acute response to almost any CNS agent, including alcohol. Even drinking too much alcohol could put me in a VERY bad mental place. Similarly, taking uppers, even as innocent as caffeine or ritalin would put me on the edge, especially during comedowns.

Exactly my point.  There is no way to tell if a person here on this board is having similar troubles so you can't tell them it's unlikely to cause a problem and they will be fine.  Of course it's not likely that one dose of 4-fa is likely to cause psychosis, but there is always a potential for problems.


We thought sharing a tiny dose of meph with one of our closest friends would help her mood, not make her want to go home and eat a bottle of pills.  It was her first time to try meph and 50mg is not much.  My sweet spot on meph is about 450-600mg.  After all, meph is an extremely powerful mood lifter we thought.  How could you take that and be depressed?  We didn't even have any idea that she was depressed.


On the flip-side I have seen that same chick do a pretty good amount of MDPV on several occasions after this and she was A-ok.  MDPV has a much worse reputation for causing psychosis.


I am speaking from lots and lots of experience here when I say stims are unpredictable.  Even worse they trick you into thinking you are fine, or SUPER-fine, when really you are hanging on by a thin thread.  I'm just writing about caution.  Take it from someone who started out cautious and ended up with a needle in his arm.  You might start out a casual user, but I don't know any recreational stim users who end that way.


"Know Yourself, Know Your Source, and Know your Substance"


I'm not preaching drug abstinence, or even stimulant abstinence.  I am just trying to help others avoid my mistakes.

What about cocaine and MDMA recreational users? I know a ton that sometimes do them occasionally and never end up with a needle in their arm. I think you are generalizing recreational stimulant use from your own viewpoint.


Personally, I do lower amounts of 4-FA - never done more than 40mg. At this low dose, I experience a nice elevation in mood and productivity. I would say it provides me both recreational and functional benefits. I've been using a similar dose for 6 days straight now. And I haven't felt the need to increase the dosage yet (though I would like to.. but I don't plan to).

I never said all will end up with a needle in their arm, although plenty of cocaine users do.  I don't know anyone who started out young using stims who by the time they are in their 30's haven't had some serious repercussions due to stimulant use.  Be it job loss, trouble with wife/girlfriend, criminal record, etc.


Most of the kids I knew who were out using mdma regularly in their late teens ended up going down the path of MDMA > methamphetamine/cocaine/crack > jail and/or mental breakdown > rehab > SSRI's.  Give or a take a few steps.


I am confident that if you take a look at long term stimulant users over a 10 year period, then you will find the ones who are able to continue to only be occasional, moderate users are the exception and not the norm.  I am basing this not only on my own experience, but on the fact that I have seen it repeated over, and over, and over again with many different stimulants.


I'll never forget the first time I saw someone with bad amphetamine psychosis.  I was 21 and was at a buddy's house with him and his 19 yr old girlfriend.  This chick was hanging blankets over the windows and freaking out bc the "cops are in the parking lot".  She started breaking all the pipes we were smoking out of and saying she'd never do that shit again (meth).  


I said, "that'll never happen to me" and all kinds of excuses about how that kind of thing only happens to people who are careless.  I can tell you though that, that sort of thing creeps up on you slowly and happens before you know it.  Six years after I said that would never happen to me, sure enough, some worse shit happened to me.


I hope you're not the same as me, and I am not telling you what to take or not take.  I very strongly believe that you are in charge of your own body and can do whatever you want to with it.  Hell, I even still occasionally use stimulants, but FAR more cautiously than I have in the past.  


At the same time, I am also trying to point out that stimulant use can be very dangerous and not to be dabbled in lightly.  If I can help prevent even one person from going through the hell I have been through then it will have been worth all this ranting.


Cheers again,

I think the younger you are when you start using harder drugs, the greater the potential that you will become an addict. In a rapidly developing brain, powerful stimulants can really re-wire your pleasure-seeking ways. I know there is a lot of scientific reasoning to support this.


Anyway, I still think a lot depends on each individual and their surroundings (friends and availability of drugs). I know a ton of people who have done e and coke recreationally, numerous times, and never became full-blown addicts, nor even did meth. There is such a thing as recreational/social use. For example, for a number of people, doing harder drugs (like e or coke) *in solitude* is kind of frowned up from a social standpoint, especially in college. Therefore, their use is not that likely to spiral down into full-blown addiction.


Anyway, this has been only my personal experience. It's apparent that you have seen very different things.

I just did about 80 mgs up the nose was planning on another 40. How harmful is drinking liquor with 4fa if you keep hydrated?

Provided you stay hydrated, I would venture to say that taking 4-FA and drinking alcohol is no more harmful than drinking caffeinated drinks with alcohol. At the end of the day, taking an upper will allow you to drink more, way more than you maybe should. That's what you have to watch out for.

I think the same, I tend to drink alcohol when pretty much on any stim, well at least when I start coming down, and with 4-FA it mixes really well.

Love 4-FA, gives me the energy I need and also provides a strong roll type feeling and helps out alot socially.  I've started with dosing it at around 120 mg, but plan to go as high as 200mg (maybe 100 + a 100 booster 4 or 5 hours in) Since the duration is pleasantly long.  Where are your guys sweet spots when dosing this alone?  I also think a methylone combo with this would be heaven!

The duration is NOT long....are some of you seriously sensitive to Stimulants or have you Not had any Amphetamines in your LIFE besides Ecstacy? Some of you I dunno What your getting but never has it lasted longer than 3 hours Noticeably Without redose. So do a lot of you take this because you cant get other substances for focus/socializing. I honestly think of it as reallly nice but its not like FUCKING TIIITTSSS MAN you know? IDK

I disagree. 

I've done MDPV, Meth, Coke, MDMA, pretty much all the mainstream drugs...except for crack. I'm going on 40 years old now and I have never had any problem with psychosis, except the "Fun" psychosis which you pretty much just act like a psycho on purpose when you're all fucked up...cuz it's fun. I've done that taking Pipes and MDMA together before (Which by the way I DONT recommend anyone do that because the combo can kill you. I've done it several times because I find that it increases my roll to an insane level...but I've heard it can be deadly) The point is, you all take this shit way too seriously. It's just a drug. If someone becomes psycho on it, it's only going to be the people who abuse it like idiots. Shooting stuff up? Never in a million years. I would never touch a needle. I hate them and people who use them are disgusting. Ok I'm gonna be hated for saying that here...LOL don't take offense, I actually dated a whore who used to shoot everything she could find. I never once would even think about doing that. 


If one uses stims in a responsible manner, and they aren't psycho already, then I think they will be fine. Maybe it's true that just "One" use can cause psychosis, but I think if that is true, that those people already have some kind of underlying problem or they are doing other drugs too often. There are many different factors involved with causing psychosis...and it's hard to put the blame on a single drug. 


Yeah I've heard all the stories about people going psycho on MDPV. Well for me personally, it never happened. I loved MDPV...I would do it several times per week (But NO more than that...rarely did I do it 2 days in a row...bcuz the stuff kept me up for 2 days straight) Now the drug is banned, so I have virtually no chance of going psycho from MDPV. I can control myself very well. I just think some people are already out of whack if they let stims control them to the point of psychosis. That's my opinion, I'll be hated for saying it...but I really believe this for experience. If you're not mentally sound you should not be using stims, unless its worth the risk of psychosis to you. 


But saying all this, I am not perfect. I do have OCD and other minor mental problems. But still, if you use the way I do (Drink a lot of water, try to eat healthy sometimes...and be strong mentally before you even think of using them) then I think the risk of psychosis is virtually zero from a single dose. This is considering of course that you only EAT the stim, No snorting, shooting or other ridiculous ways like smoking or sticking up your ass) Eating dope is the best way to do it. I knew so many people who got hopelessly addicted to oxycodone all because they were dumb enough to snort or smoke it. I always ate my pills, and I did them for an entire year straight, I quit and had very minimal withdrawls which lasted only 1 day. Far easier to quit than pot. Everyone else had to go to rehab because they would get sick as hell if they didnt have the drug. The difference between them and me, was that they took the wrong route when administering the drug. They snort the drug, which causes the effects to wear off much faster, and then they need to take more. Some were taking 15 pills a day, where I never needed more than 1. So this is a big difference. Eating the drug (For me) actually make the effects much stronger, last longer and have less an urge to redose. I've never tried smoking anything but weed and shrooms (and never will)....except for the time when I was a stupid teenager and smoked a ritalin. lol I vaguely remember doing that, but it didnt even give me a buzz. 


Well saying all that, I'm glad you're ok and not in prison or anything. Sounds like you had quite a trip. I just disagree with you that anyone can get psychosis. I think it's only certain people. I dont think Im one of those people, but hey you never know. You could be right. I may go into uncontrollable psychosis one day. But I seriously doubt it. It hasnt happened yet and I abused drugs far more in the past. I've just always been smart about the way I do it. As I explained above, eating healthy, drinking water, and only EATING the drugs (No snorting, shooting, etc) is the most important factors I think to keep anyone who is using these drugs, to be healthy and not dependent on the drug.


PS- and exploding in a car wouldn't always be a painless death. I've seen people catch on fire before...and it HURTS like a bitch. I've set my hand on fire before (sprayed hair spray on my hand then lit it) and just that Hurt and it was just the hairspray burning on top of my hand.

I am planning on taking some 3FA tonight, followed by a 150mg 4FA.  I intend to let the 3FA subside before taking the 4FA. Would this cause unwanted effects?


In the past I've done mdma with speed still being quite active in my system and I didn't felt any real discomform, and the effects were pleasant. Does anyone have experiences with this?

I would personally take 4- first because its more euphoric, if you take 3- first it is possible you wont have the full euphoria since 3 will be blocking it. Havent tried the combo personally, but did some other similiar combos of stims and found its best to enjoy the more euphoric compound first and follow it with more pure speed.

Just take ONE OR THE OTHER! What kind of extra benefits are you looking for by adding 4fa with 3fa or vice versa? Thats a waste and yea your ptobably asking for lame side effects from both comedowns making one worthless combo....

Didn't bother with it after all. I don't see where you got the idea about me worrying about eventual increased somedowns from though. I'm well aware there is a a price to pay when using stimulant drugs. 

I did say I wasn´t intending to combine them, I was wondering whether letting the 3FA run it´s course before injesting the 4FA would make the 4FA still worthwhile to take afterwards. We´re talking about a 12h timespan, with alteast 3hours after the last 3FA dose. Should have been more clear on that.

Yeah you should have been more clear on that, I thought you're going to do one and just after like 2 hours the other, hence combo.

Some of you I dunno What your getting but never has it lasted longer than 3 hours Noticeably Without redose. So do a lot of you take this because you cant get other substances for focus/socializing. I honestly think of it as reallly nice but its not like FUCKING TIIITTSSS MAN you know? IDK

I fit in the category of people you're alluding to. I have only done MDMA, coke & some ADD meds, and, to me, 4-FA has properties of many of them. I like it a lot!

I've started with dosing it at around 120 mg, but plan to go as high as 200mg (maybe 100 + a 100 booster 4 or 5 hours in) Since the duration is pleasantly long.  Where are your guys sweet spots when dosing this alone?  I also think a methylone combo with this would be heaven!

Believe it or not, the highest dose I have taken is 55 mg. When I started out, taking like 40 mg would give me very noticeable mood elevation. Hell, I would feel just high, in general. When I first took it, I would have at least a good 2+ hours of incredibly energy. I couldn't even sit still.


Now I have upped the dose to 50+ mg (**gasp*!!*), after having taken it almost every single day for like 10 days. I definitely have a tolerance, but I'm not sure I want to have one. I like the feeling this used to give me. Now it feels more like a gentle stimulation.


And yes, to answer, BananasAndOranges again, some people do take 4-FA pretty much for improved focus. 4-FA definitely provides me that, and for quite some time, too. All around, this is a great drug.


I have not done meth or high doses of some amphetamine, so maybe that's why I can appreciate something like 4-FA. Finally, I apparently do have a much higher sensitivity to stimulants, because everyone seems to be taking double the doses I do. I also gave 50 mg's to someone who never does stimulants (doesn't even drink coffee), and they barely felt anything at all.

But still, if you use the way I do (Drink a lot of water, try to eat healthy sometimes...and be strong mentally before you even think of using them) then I think the risk of psychosis is virtually zero from a single dose. This is considering of course that you only EAT the stim, No snorting, shooting or other ridiculous ways like smoking or sticking up your ass) Eating dope is the best way to do it. I knew so many people who got hopelessly addicted to oxycodone all because they were dumb enough to snort or smoke it. I always ate my pills, and I did them for an entire year straight, I quit and had very minimal withdrawls which lasted only 1 day. Far easier to quit than pot. Everyone else had to go to rehab because they would get sick as hell if they didnt have the drug. The difference between them and me, was that they took the wrong route when administering the drug. They snort the drug, which causes the effects to wear off much faster, and then they need to take more. Some were taking 15 pills a day, where I never needed more than 1. So this is a big difference. Eating the drug (For me) actually make the effects much stronger, last longer and have less an urge to redose. I've never tried smoking anything but weed and shrooms (and never will)....except for the time when I was a stupid teenager and smoked a ritalin. lol I vaguely remember doing that, but it didnt even give me a buzz.

Man, you're my kind of drug user. I realized a long time ago that chasing the 'ultimate high' is a worthless pursuit, because it is virtually impossible to attain, and maybe if you do, you will never attain it again. Enjoying the more simpler drugs and RoA is the way to go, imho.

Some excellent posts on this thread. I agree that compulsion is more likely regardless of compoound with insufflation/snorting. I honestly don't know how ANYONE can snort 4-fa, I seriously wounded my nose after only a couple of 10mg lines & I had to cease snorting ANYTHING for months to ease the problem.


I had some addiction issues with mephedrone a few years ago & it was the first time I've felt such compulsion. My use was hardly severe, compared to many here I got through very little of it. The problem was regularity, using at least 3 or 4 times a week, sometimes consequetively, & loss of appetite. I'm not huge anyway & haven't ever been heavier than 54kg in my whole life. But I dropped to 46kg within about 4 months of discovering drone. My mood was almost permanently low, unless I was using, & I became dissilusiosned with life in general & no longer enjoyed even the simplest of pleasures, sunny days, music etc


Eventually I got a friend to take possession of my supply, lock it away & I started seeking stms with less push & ones I could swallow. I didnt like the effect of drone swallowed. 4-fa filled the gap nicely, but although much less so than with drone, I did suffer some less than pleasant mid-week blues if I used for a long sesh or more than once over a weekend.


Nowadays I try to avoid all & any stim use for 3 out of every 4 weeks. I can even have a 100mg of mephedrone on a Fri & then avoid for a month. At these uses I have not seen a mood effect & my weight has stabilised at 53kg again.


So, although bit of a pointless post, I guess I'm saying moderation in all things.


Peace folks,

Ph

I just get a little tired of misleading reviews. People talk about this shit lasting or keeping them up all night and to Me thats a sign of zero stimulant background aside from the obvious ones. If you had ever done meth or crack/coke more than a dozen times or use amps frequently this drug should be done completely after 6 hours crash included. I am not saying anyones a pussy or unqualified to give an opinion on this one its just misleading and I want experienced users of amps to know this is a mellow one. The obe time it wasnt was the first encounter I had with some snowy white stuff. That was pushy and hit harder than I expected but the "MDXX"like empathy was over after an hour then I was just stimulated for a few more than...redose. I am sure everyone gets different stuff but I had someone last week tell me they got geeked out off a small ass dose and it made NO SENSE and half the time I dont trust these chemicals or the users anyway.

Is anyone in the U.S now having a hard time obtaining 4-FA?  I am NOT here to talk about vendors or anything, I promise, so please don't misunderstand this post.  I am simply asking if anyone in the U.S is finding it difficult to get 4-Fa now?  I was able to get it from a trusted vendor for a long time and then suddenly they stopped providing it.  The legality of it hasn't changed so I'm just wondering what is going on.  It's by far my favorite RC and has been for at least 2 years. Any other U.S citizens input would be much obliged.

You don't have to believe me if you don't want. I didn't say I started rolling from 4-FA or anything. But what I did experience was a much greater entactogenic effect than from something like Adderall. As for as how long this drug can keep me up - I cannot say for sure. I do know that me taking this drug and staying up *much later* have coincided, but maybe I assumed the fallacy of 'correlation implies causation' here. I probably shouldn't have done that. But I also didn't say it kept me up the whole night.


Plus, do consider that some people may have done several stims, but never in super high doses, nor on a regular basis, and, thus, their neurotransmitter receptors might not be as deregulated as yours. Sometimes less can go a long way.

I don't think it's hard to obtain 4-FA in U.S. at all. It doesn't have any notoriety and I don't see why any vendor would refuse to ship it to U.S. Maybe you should look for other vendors.

Thank you for clarifying.  The only reason i was needing to know if "would" meant past-tense is because there was a highly reputable vendor that just recently stopped selling it so I just wanted to make sure that wasn't who you were speaking of.  I never in a million years would ask you to source so that last sentence wasn't necessary and I made that very clear in my first post.  I've been lurking here long enough to know the rules. But thank you for responding anyway. Much appreciated.

I actually have found them to be quite similar.  4-FA to me seems a bit more speedier and a bit less empathogenic while Methylone is the opposite (less speedy and a bit more empathogenic) but this may be subjective although I've heard many similar reports from others.  I used to dose 4-fa and then 3-4 hours later take the same dose of methylone and it was always a great time.  They just kind of bled into each other and I never noticed a difference at the time... it just seemed like one long "roll' of the same substance.  It was only when I dosed each by themselves at different times I thought I noticed the difference but again I may have only felt the difference because of what I heard and was making myself believe there was a difference. I'm pretty experienced in all the MDXX's and I really didn't see a HUGE difference between the two.  Both a LOT of fun and both make me have shitty comedowns.

Yeah 4-FA and methylone are very similiar. I think I enjoy 4-FA more because it lasts longer and doesn't make you as tired as Methylone does. I never found methylone to really be comparable to MDMA, but I do find 4-FA to be. But the one bad thing about 4-FA is that it is like a "Tease" if done alone. I always need to at least drink alcohol with it. But I do that with almost any drug so yeah for being somewhat "legal" 4-FA is probably the king of RC's right now. (In my eyes of course, not everyone will agree)

For me it was the opposite.  Methylone was much closer to the feel of MDMA, but less so than mephedrone, which for me felt very much like how it feels when you are eating mdma and smoking meth.  Anyway, I found 4-fa to be more like amphetamine, only gentler and less pushy.  150mg of 4-fa might be comparable to 50-60mg of amphetamine.


I think it's one of those drugs that hits everyone differently, though.  My friend (who is prescribed 90mg of adderall a day) had about 250mg and was awake enough to stay up all night but said he didn't feel high.  I agree with king of beans here that is was kinda like a tease.  You feel like you're about to get there, and then you take more and you still feel like you're almost there.


Cheers,

But what I did experience was a much greater entactogenic effect than from something like Adderall. As for as how long this drug can keep me up - I cannot say for sure. I do know that me taking this drug and staying up *much later* have coincided, but maybe I assumed the fallacy of 'correlation implies causation' here. I probably shouldn't have done that. But I also didn't say it kept me up the whole night.

Um...I really Dont have much of a Tolerance. That little comment on the end is annoying. 4-FA isnt an all day thing. I never bagged on you, I just expressed how it seems most people who use research stims do it  because they Cannot Get Ahold of other certain illegal stimulants. Thats a personal opinion though. Ah Im too lazy too add more but I never found it to last incredibly long time. I have read others claiming all nighters which yes on high doses and redoses later at night

Ehh.. I would say, for some, RC's appeal more than certain other illegal drugs. For example, I don't want to touch street meth, ever. Coke is too expensive, no matter the quality. What does that leave? Only molly. Or .. RC's. And trying out new RC's is quite enjoyable. I look forward to trying other amphetamine analogues.

i appreciate the concern, this vendor is very reputable in the rc market and i have been getting their mxe and 4MEC and its very top notch. i will make sure to post the outcome for sure, ill make a trip report. i just plan on doing a very small bump and seeing what kind of effcts i get from it. i mainly plan on using it orally, but i figure a small bump would give me a better feel for it than bombing it. but substances vary. i tried 4MEC orally. a 250 mg capsule and it wasnt speedy or anything. i just laid on the couch not really wanting to move for a long time, plus i felt ALOT more of the undesirable effects. however, when snorting nice little lines of 4MEC i got exactly what i expected to from it. a nice "background" euphoria that wasnt in my face, but i could get into an in depth conversation without overtalking people. it was like a euphoria with patience, no overwhelm. but from what i understand 4FA is a little better, and lasts longer so im excited to try it.

Thats not how I see it bud. Unless youre an EX ADDICT I think people would have a hell of a lot funner time with crystal or mda and the such. Nothing personal I just dunno why try all these weird ass chemicals. 4-FA is one of those I would take to party on but not just for a study sesh or whatever. Theres a lot more illegal drugs that would knock your socks off. 4-MAR?! 2c-b? I can see people trying these and moving on to rcs but most go to rcs first thinking its safer or just as bad as crystal or something.

I got a few questions:

1. Does tolerance grow quick? I was considering using it this month pretty often is small doses for study purposes and work.

2. It it have a cross tolerance with MDMA, MDA. 4MEC, or Mephedrone?

3. Does it combine well with nootropics like piracetam?

I would suggest oral. Snorting a little the first time I got my hands onto it was a bad experience for me. Burns and the drip is horrible with very little effect.

4-FA has a fun factor, not really enough energy for raves, I found it hard to dance more than like couple seconds.  The euphoria definitely isnt right in your face say with MDxx drugs where your "glowing".  You do get happy and kind of "sloshed/buzzed" and beer def mixes pretty well with it (oh and naked girls for that matter) although there is some ED with this stuff.  First time I tried it, the come down was very easy, took a sleeping pill and slept although i started at noon.  (lasted about 6 hours with 2 hours of some uneasiness roughly).   Only problem for me was doing it too much in a month but i have learned to take month breaks now.  (had a night where i had a severe migrain and was tweaked out in a very uncomfortable way blah). Compared to MDxx's which i shouldnt cuz it stands on its own quite nicely, but it doesnt have "magic" but it does give a head high and music is fun to listen to (even ipod) but you wont find yourself dancing for 4 hours straight feeeling like superman.

Oh 4-mec alone, atleast mine is pretty much inactive besides feeling "lighter" which is pretty lame (@ 220 mg) I did do a 200/100 4-MEC/4-FA and at one point I was thinking "It can't get any better than this" but still has nothing on my best nights rolling off high quality X pills ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i just got my 4FA and 4MEC from my very reliable uk vendor. one thing i do find weird, the first time i ordered 4MEC from this vendor, it was from their chinese warehouse, and was crystal chunks like cylinder quartz chunks everyone describes, and it was pretty good. now whats strange (to me) is i placed the same order 3 weeks later from the 1st and this time it came from their UK warehouse and it was pure white powder this time. no chunks or crystal shards it was really fine powder. and after setting the two side by side(since i had a little left over from my last order) i noticed the older batch with crystals, had a very very light hue to it. almost like that light honeycomb color molly shards have. i know for a fact its a reliable vendor they have the best reviews on sos ranked 9 of 10 with like 20 pages of good reviews. im just wondering if anyone knowledgable can shed some light on this. i actually like the newer (whiter) stuff better. i get the same effects as the last stuff, but it seems alot more noticable to me. 


And the MAIN QUESTION i have on 4FA is, what would you guys recommend a person with no stimulant tolerance and a first time to try orally? after all the reading about how it burns and tastes horrid, im only using oral as a ROA. ive read that anywhere from 75-150 mg is a good oral dose. so im planning on trying 75 mg in a capsule, after i do a small allergy test with it. can anyone give me a recommend a good dose that isnt threshold but also not over the top. i just want to get a good feel for it and see what its all about, and i dont know about just starting off with 100mg. I will absolutely tho make a good trip report on my 4FA experience. thanks alot fot the input/advice on doing 4FA orally.  PeacE !


(ohh! and if i had to describe the consitency of my 4FA it appears to be really "flour(y)' it looks more like baking flour like for a cake, than it does a powder)

With 4-FA I would start with 50mg to get a feel then take more in a few hours if desired. I have two batches of 4-FA on sandy in texture and off white and one that is bright white and floury. Potency seems about the same. Crystal size and color are not a good indicator of quality.

I would start personally with 75, even with no stim tolerance.. with mild tolerance 100mg is good for start

yuk yuk : P eeewww i tasted it and it tastes like what i would imagine the devils butthole to taste like. no weird reactions capped up 75 mgs orally. i thought about both of your suggestions and decided to go ahead and do 75 mgs. i am an experienced mdma and amphetamine user so i am kind of familiar i guess. but if this were to be some completely obscure substance i prolly would have went with the 50 mgs first. i really liked methylone and i took 250 mgs orally my 1st time and it wasnt as good as mdma, but i had really big eye wiggles and talkative. i kind of made an ass out of myself on it, telling how much i was glad to be their friend, and all this other awkward stuff, haha. well its been 20 mins since i dropped the 4fa. ive been waiting for a month or two for this moment (yay!) Lol ill update in a few hours. thanks guys for the advice. 


oh and yea this stuff is super bright like your saying sphongled, and floury. it sticks to the bag really bad, ive never really seen an rc do this, its almost clumpy. the other two rcs that came with it tho were fine, so im guessing its just a characteristic of the 4FA. i know im prolly going to have to cut the bag apart to get the last 100 mgs out

Mine was also sticky and yeah it could be nominated for the worst tasting and most painful stim there is.. you dont want to snort it and you dont want to keep it on tongue. It caused blister on tongue to one fellow bluelighter which was there for days. Which makes you think it cant be exactly healthy for the whole stomach either. Although there are few people out there who kept taking it daily for about month without much trouble.


The first time I received it I liked the high so much I decided to simply ignore the pain and snorted about 400mg during the whole night lol (about 40mg per line). This made my nose totally clogged for almost 14 days though.. 

Best way to consume it imo is to dissolve in 1 litre of beer and just drink it, if the beer is bitter enough it wont ruin the taste much. This also makes the euphoria come up extra slowly which may sound less fun but its actually pleasant with this.

lol. thats interesting, i like just capsuling it and swallowing it, its no harder than taking a vitamin. but i cant find anywhere online, how long does it take to peak? i am at 1 hour right now on the dot and i feel lighter and kinda happy. im wondering if i should take another 75 or just wait till another time and start with 100. if i knew how long it peaked and lasted tho i could decide on taking a lil more. thanks 6A

well i went ahead and took another 75 mg at the 1 hour 15 minute mark. so 150 mg total over an hour or so. hopefully this catches up with the 1st one and comes together really well. i really like where im at right now but its really light, so i figure why not.

ok yeah its been about 3 hours now since the 1st 75 mgs and i can feel it ALOT better than i could half an hour ago. it no longer has the "somethings missing" feeling, its a pretty content buzz at this point. very light bruxism, im not grinding my teeth at this point but i am clenching. music sounds really good, and i feel really positive and open. 4FA to me, orally, feels like its similar to methylone, but less speedy and less intense/euphoria, eye wiggles, and stuff. i mean i do feel really good right now, but on methylone i made an ass out of myself (i felt).  but yea im thinking it may have taken longer to come on all the way bc i put it inside a thick capsule. i was going to do some 4MEC to jumpstart it 20 minutes ago, but then i almost had a wow moment. this stuff is good by itself, but im going to try some 4 here in a bit. the 1st two hours of the buzz just kinda sat in one spot for a bit. could have been that i was just watching tv and not using my brain a whole lot.

125mg oral. THAT is a good dose size if you want to make it worth your while. I'd quit dicking around with the 50-75mg do ses. YOur not going to get what you want out of the experience if you do.

Yeah I just sniffed inside the bag and just the "dust" that floats around got in my nose and even that tiny little bit burned. I can imagine how bad it would hurt to snort this shit. Snorting anything is stupid...especially snorting 4-FA will just make you look like a moron...LOL mix it with water and drink it. That is the only way it should be done.


PS- SIGHILL- Ive never tried MDAI. I hear it's basically bunk from most people. But you say combo with 4-FA makes it good? I liked the 6-apb/4-FA combo...have you ever tried that and if so, how does it compare to the MDAI combo? I think 4-FA is definitely the number 1 legal RC for the USA right now if taking on it's own. But combos with this seem to mimic a MDMA roll better than any other drugs out there..

i ended up doing 50 mg 4MEC intranasally about 3.5 hours into the 4FA experience. it was awesome. i was watching the simpsons and their movements looked like they were wiggling and smudging across the screen instead of walking. it brought out laughter as well which wasnt there before. on just the 4FA i had a pretty good vibe. it was more like a serious kind of high, but once the 4MEC came into play, it made ALL the difference. i had eye wiggles like on a good dose of methylone. i did end up doing ALOT of clenching but not really any grinding. ended up going through .20 gram of 4MEC within 4 hours. each dose of 50 mg seemed to last a good hour and a half of being completely satisfied. time was just sliding by. ive never went through this much 4MEC in a session.  that "mongy headspace" as some people call it, was the ultimate sidekick. it will most definitely be trying that again. i got 5 hours of sleep,  felt slightly drained upon waking up but i feel really, really good right now. absolutely have an afterglow and still some drymouth. id give 4FA a good rating, but id recommend no less than 125 mg oral, and would suggest something safe, to mesh in with it. cannabis went really well with it. i thought.


The only negative effects i really got were i started to get that bad taste in my mouth. i couldnt enjoy my kush or pineberry. they tasted like a black and mild almost lol.. kinda like trying to smoke on welbutrin actually. and id start to get impulses to send someone a message, or launch an idea, but then at the last second feel its a bad idea or something. this part reminded me of those rolls with crappy amp slightly. where you are about to get really into something then just a feeling of doubt and disconnectedness hits you for a flash of a second.

no. if you read more carefully you'll see i said smoking "on" welbutrin. it makes smoke taste worse than dirty socks. ^and for the sake of harm reduction and further confusion, ive never ate dirty socks, it was a figurative comparison ; )

does anyone know if 4FA has a cieling effect? im planning on doing 150 mg oral next time, from what i understand thats about as much as you want to take, some people say anymore is a waste. im wondering is it a waste, because theres really only so high you can get from it, or at higher doses does the euphoria and body buzz increase? im looking forwards to my next experiment. im giving myself a week to ensure theres no tolerance. i plan on doin a trip report as well

My first thought upon reading this is that you might as wel go for mdma instead then. What I like about 4FA is that it feels like the little brother of mdma. I imagine you could get a stronger buzz as you increase your dose (though I have heard that above 200mg overstimulation may occur), but if it's strong euphoria and a full fledged body buzz you're after I wouldn't use 4FA.

i WISH i could get mdxx here. methylone was really cool and since its illegal in the us, im trying to find the next closest thing. yea im looking for the cleanest, most euphoric material i can find. 4FA and 4MEC felt kinda close to a good methylone roll, but cleaner and less speedy.

Nothing can really replace mdma in my opinion. Methylone is fun stuff but it just leaves me wanting real molly instead. Ghb after the peak of 4fa or combined with racemic amphetamine gave me a great rush though, which I really enjoyed. Though dosing that properly can be a bitch.


On a unrelated note, dropped about 10mg 2cb after having had about 150mg 4fa last Thursday, but it hit me as hard as a 25mg dose would. Does 4fa have a potentiating effect on 2cb, and if so, does it have this effect on others phens like 2cd/2ci as well?

On the occassions that I've combined stims like methylone & mdma with a 2c-xx I've found that the psychedelic side of the experience is enhanced. I have not mixed 4-fa with any psyches yet but I read of a research effort many years ago where 2c-d was combined with 4-fa & the 2c-d appeared to lengthen the 4-fa experience & reduce the amount of 4-fa needed for the usual session. I think this research was reported at a rival Drugs Forum to BL.


Anyway, in my own admittedly limited experience, certain of the more gentle stimulants & some of the more easy going psychedelics do seem to synergise very pleasantly, enhancng one another & giving a more grounded, party-minded psychedelic experience.

what do you guys think about 4FA and psilocybe mushrooms? i have a descent amoung of both, and they seem like they would go really well together. i just want to make sure it wouldnt cause a seratonin syndrome or something similar

I had some decent experiences with butylone that I would say were pretty close to methylone.  It's less potent so requires more material, but it's still legal.  For me I would say butylone is closer to the feeling of methylone/MDMA than 4FA was.

People have been mixing mushrooms with mdma for years and I never heard anything other than it was awesome.  Since 4fa is not as strong as mdma by a long way, I wouldn't personally hesitate to try it.  Also a lot of studies were done in clinical trials with psilocybin/amphetamine combo and also lsd with amphetamine or methylphenidate.  The general conclusion was that the stim seemed to increase the confidence of the subject going into it providing a better experience with much less anxiety.  Don't remember the exact wording of the abstract.  Was something I found on Erowid, I believe.  Or possibly something from an article or book about LSD.  Too tired to look, now - ambien.

i could totally see that. if i was feeling that really good 4FA mindset, it would be the perfect setting to take a trip. im going to have to try this at some point for sure and do a good trip report on it. the sweet spot for me with the strain of shrooms i have seems to be 1.7    im thinking the 4FA buzz could maybe potentiate the shrooms, so when i do try it, maybe ill just eat a gram or 1.2 the 1st time. thanks for the advice, sounds good to me :   )

My 4-FA looks a bit tan kinda off white beige and isn't very fine.  As someone said b4 its like functional speed although i dont like street speed, 4-FA is given me some funn times.   To the person asking about dosing and combos,  getting drunk on 4-FA is wonderful, kinda smoothes out the edges, and beer tastes like water on it because your already dehydrated as hell lol.   Oh I did do the tongue thing and it for sure burns.  I've heard you should treat this as an MDxx drug and take up to week or month breaks, but for me, as long as I sleep well, say 2 or 3 days in a row isnt to bad but judge your body.  Peace yall.

others I would say yes, after 5mg of 2ci snorted i got some good visuals on a 4-fa binge.

4-FA is mild with pretty much no bad side effects. I started with 250 mg's about for my first time (I eyeballed it though so could of been more or less) The more you do the more intense the tingles will be. You are going to love this drug! It's the cloest thing to MDMA out there right now. Even more so than Methylone.(Which was banned)


PS- I think I know which site you order from. I also order there. They are the best site online. Too bad the uptight mods here wont let us post about which sites are good and which aren't. But right now they are out of stock of 4-fa! I was so bummed to find this out. So I ordered some 4-MEC which I hear isnt even close to 4-fa. But I hope if I drink beer and listen to music with it, it will be ok. Oh and DONT snort the 4-fa, that's just stupid.


Anyone else tried 4-mec with beer?

What dose would anybody recommend to a first time user who normally has the amphetamine tolerance of the devil, but has been off stims for around a month, (so still a good bit of tolerance) besides one weak mdma experience? also, would I be in for more of a straight speed type experience, or a full out, hugging everyone, crazy mdma type thing? I wanna be able to act relatively normal on it, like amphetamine or meth.

It's more like MDMA to me than speed. But it starts out that way. After about 4 hours it turns into more stimulation. You'd be fine starting with 250 mg's or even 300 if you have a tolerence. I am a small person with little tolerence and I know i could handle 500 mg's of this stuff. But no need for that much. It's active at as little as 100 mg's or less. So start with 250 and go from there. Doesnt take long at all to kick in. But make sure NOT to snort it. It wont do as much that way and it burns badly. Very very very badly. lol


Oh and you can act completely normal on this stuff. No one will even know you're on anything. You'll be feeling awesome, but you'll look totally sober. You wont want to hug anyone. Its not lovey dovey, just an awesome mood lift and euphoria. Music sounds awesome too and you get tingles. It's not the same as MDMA, but you'll love it.

Wow, 250 mg for starts will def. put you in superman town, you feel a strong body high with super ego and you'll want to crush up on hot girls all the time.  For me 200mg would be my max to drop because I feel that gives all the benefits and not to much negs.

Alright, so reading through this thread has given me a lot of mixed reviews about 4-FA. 


How would this chem suit a festival setting? I'm the kind of person that likes to get my dance on but also chill out and cuddlepuddle. 

What would be a recommended starting dose for someone with no amphetamine tolerance? 

And has there been any consensus about duration?

From what I've read, a good starting dose is somewhere between 75-125 mgs if you don't have tolerance though, I'd try 75 and titrate your dose in 25mg increments. I havent tried it, but i have taken a lot of MDMA and other amphetamines, so I can pretty confidently tell you that it wouold be a good festival drug. As far as the duration goes, I'm actually curious myself as to what that may be.

I didnt have a tolerence at all and on my first time i started with 250 mgs which i eyeballed. I think I actually took even more than that. 4-fa is still good in low doses though too.


As for the mod that said no sourcing..I never put a source to anything. What are you talking about? I know already that rule. But can I also ask why you guys have this rule?

Axed, if you like to dance, definitely do not get the 6-apb. It is a lazy drug, not for dancing. 4-FA is like a chilled roll but at least you can go out to a club on it. 6-apb is an around the house drug if you ask me. And make sure you got a bathroom near by at all times, if you do apb, its some nasty stuff!

Tried M1 before when it was being sold under the Ra*ing Dr*gon B*th S*lts

(Pretty much I have to censor this cuz this site is very strict on everything!)

and it was ok, but I liked MDPV salts more, as it lasted longer and was stronger.

dude No. Thats seriously wayyy to much if he has no tolerance. When I had a tolerance i did 120-140 thats perfect. Dont recommend a stupid high dose like that. You must have been ON THE COUCH if you took That much. You wont cuddle puddle on this shit. Maybe for 1 hours but seriously 150 would probably be Too intense for a first timer. This is a harm reduction site homie.

sorry but hes right bean man. I have done a Shit ton of Methylone and it smears 4-FA completely in the dirt in terms of feeling floored. Methylone was really nice. If you bought it under a bath salt your methylone was probably cut up and dirty or NOT Methylone. 250mgs of Real Pure Methylone will have your ass in a cloud eyes shut rolling around for awhile. 4-FA gives you energy like a cocaine rush with its empathy but its nothing more than ampy feelings after that 3 hour mark. MDPV I never did so I cant comment but I can say your wrong about Methylone. 250mgs first time on Methylone or 4-FA and you may need a bed or a couch especially with Methylone. I remember before it got banned all I ever got was cut up dirt. Honestly I remember methylone being almost Identical to good ecstacy except the come up was rather fast and smacky and a lot shorter.

big plus 4-fa vs methylone though is the duration, 2 hours after ingesting methylone you're fiending like a crackhead for your next dose because you go from normal to rolling thru heaven and back to normal in 2 hours ^_^

Man I think Real Methylone lasts longer than 4-FA atleast the fun parts. I always got zooted doing a bomb for atleast 3 hours two hours though of that daaaammmnnn feeling. 4-FA lasts longer maybe but its nothing like a ROLL. Its exactly like if we are comparing drugs, a cocaine comeup and then a rush. But they both are fiendy lol 4-FA doesnt last but 5 hours Max.

at the 4 hour mark of 140 mg oral capsule. the only real noticable comedown effect at this point is everything has that gross taste. kind of like how when a stimulant makes you smoke 100 ciggarettes and they start to taste bad..anyways a good clean experience. i added 4mec at the 2 hour mark just to kickstart it i guess. so far really good and smooth. no complaints. however it is slightly "moreish" like im not at all wanting to redose on the 4fa, but im going through 4mec like one would smoke lots of cannabis on a mushroom or acid trip. its just easy to keep doing, but its not the hardest thing not to do at the same time. they just go really well together and im figuring ill proll go through .25 gram of 4mec before the experience ends. but with 4mec i never ever do more than .10 of qram in a day of using it. usually 3 good lines and i dont think about anymore. but i could actually see myself going through alot of this on 4FA

well i had a really good time today, i did alot more 4mec than i planned, but oh well, it was enjoyable. how does redosing with 4fa work? if you take a good dose (125-150 mg) oral, will taking the same amount a few hours later, actually get you to the peak again, or is it a lost cause? just wondering for future times. 


oh and i ended up going through .40 of 4mec. i redosed 8 times basically every half our from 215 - 915pm. no crash, i have drank about 18 oz of beer just to smooth the transition. will make sure to drink more water after these 2 beers

Hello, I've search around and cannot seem the find the answer I am looking for so here goes. I'm going to a music festival very soon its four days long and on either day two or three i want to dose 100mg of 4-fa. I understand it releases serotonin, and if im correct that amount is far less than even methylone. So I'm wondering if i were to dose on either day two or three and on the fourth day take 150-200mg of mdma, am I looking to experience much of a diminished roll? I have not taken any releasers in over 6 weeks.

Really nice stimulant, and this is coming from someone who generally doesn't enjoy stims.

It's very clean and smooth feeling, and lacks the negative side-effects that I've experienced with most other stimulants. It's also a much more focused stimulation rather than an overload where thoughts are racing and not really following any linear pattern.

I think I will get more as I can see this being useful for focusing on classes/studies if taken in a mild dose orally, but also provides a nice, euphoric recreational high when IV'd.


All the talk about "OMGS IT BURNS WHEN SNIFFED SO IT MUST BURN UR VEINZ" is also really dumb. It doesn't burn when IV'd.

Uhhhhhhh---so because it doesn't burn to slam means its OK? Thats really not too smart but I wont judge. I will say though IV is way worse than sniffing this stuff even if theres no burn...why? Because its a chemical that you bought from a lab that usually isnt looking out for your health and moreso for Money. Thats all I will add be safe.

Any of you guys encountered a lil brownish, gray 4-FA? In form of... Small balls, that if you put it on some paper and your paper suddenly twitches for some reason, half of your 4-FA is already jumping around your whole room? Got 0,5g sample of it.

So today i started with 70mg 4-FA nasally, except an hellish burn i've got ZERO effects from it. Thought ok, perhaps a bit too less since it looked like a minuscule amount and continued with another 100mgs an hour later, also nasally. Again, nothing! Really nothing, i didn't even felt sped-up. 


WTF, i thought 150-170 is a good oral dose but why the hell am i getting no effects from that nasally?!?


I posted this before in an other thread, did some M1 Trials some months ago, even 100mgs oral showed no effects. Wanted to try more but i don't do uppers that often so i thought i give the 4-FA a go this time.


Man, i was in really good mood, even thought about if it's "needed" to do some 4-FA but i wanted a bit of the freaked-out-happiness - but in the end i was just fuckin' pissed ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)

Has anyone tried to IM 4-FA? I can't seem to find any info on it (heck, the info about IM amphetamine is scarce lol... maybe with good reason, hence I ask ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) )


Also after the effects have wore off, i get headrushes up till like 2 days after


especially during the first day after the intake, they're so bad that i get near-fainting... any hints on how to reduce that? (no, i dont take like 400mg lol, last time i took 120mg oral with a 30mg boost nasal when i felt the previous dose coming up)

I would think that the reason why stimulants are not done via IM is vasoconstriction.  Vasoconstriction during IM could lead to very long lasting duration because it would limit the body's uptake of the drug (this is the case with several common medical cocaine derivatives and the reason why they don't cause any "high" when sniffed or applied to the gumbs).  There may also be a greatly increased risk of an abscess at the site of injection due to vasoconstriction.


Just my scientifically reasoned opinion, mind.


I never really have understood why bother with IM?  If you are going to take the risks involved in using needles why only do it half assed?  The only advantage of the needle with drugs is the rush and if you push IM then this is greatly diminished.  


The only advantage I can see is that it takes less skill to get it right when you IM.  You know what they say, though, practice makes perfect.  Also, possibly if you don't care to make the effort to learn the proper technique then you possibly shouldn't be messing about with needles in the first place.  Just some food for thought.

I have done some reading and it seems that apparently IM already carries a significantly higher risk of abscess compared to IV.  Something about carrying non-sterile particulates deep into the muscle tissue where it won't be readily filtered out.  This would definitely be made worse by a decrease in blood flow due to vasoconstriction.


This doesn't *necessarily* mean you *will * get an abscess.  Still, why take the risk?!  If you are determined to use needles just stick it where it will do the most good.  It really isn't that hard to teach yourself to IV.  Believe me, after you miss and have to keep trying over and over again you will be very motivated by pain to get it correct (unless you're a masochist).

Well, I've done IM ketamine a couple times, and it's really easy... you just plunge a needle right into your thigh lol, whereas with a vein you really have to aim and like pierce it right in *shivers*, k I guess i'll stick to oral/nasal then haha

How was that IM ketamine?  This is totally off topic but I've been kicking around the idea of trying methoxetamine IV.  It's already like the perfect balance between heroin and LSD!  I bet it's a hell of a rush.  4-aco-DMT was definitely a hell of a rush when IV.


I'm getting some more next week just haven't decided for sure bc I haven't touched a needle in 2 years.

I'm gonna go ahead and reply to myself here and save us some off topic side trip.  Been reading the MXE IV subthread on the big&dandy.  People there are saying that there is a benefit to IM over IV for dissociatives and that is not blacking out.  With IM you have a couple minutes before you hole and it doesn't happen almost instantaneously as it would with IV.  Still maybe i'll try both and then decide.  I've never given myself an IM shot before.


You may now proceed with the 4-fa discussion ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Has anyone experienced nausea or dizziness days after doing 4-FA?


I did some on St. Patty's day and was very nauseous the next day, which I just chalked up to the large drug combination (DMT, Alcohol, Weed, 4-FA, Salvia, B. Caapi, Nitrous).


I did some 4-FA this past Saturday and have been feeling nauseous and dizzy today. I'm assuming there's no relation but was just curious if anyone else had noticed something like this as well.

Ended up being an excellent concert drug as expected. Ending up taking a booster dose at one point, around 10 milligrams. Did notice some heartburn type feelings (which I hardly ever get), but other then that great. Felt very clear headed, had 2 beers with it, enjoyed myself quite a bit. Had a few very good peakish type moments, similar to what you get with MDMA but also different. 


Nowadays, when I go to Phish shows it is as much for social reasons as it is for the music. I spent quite a bit of the time talking to old friends/tour buddies and didn't have the MDMA lovey dovey silliness nor did I feel the incessant need to talk someones ear off. 


About 4 hours of Euphoria eased into a light stimulation. Was able to fall asleep that night as well with the help of some Dipenhydramine and some beers. Also had .1 mg  clonidine for the hyper-tension.


I do wish there was a way to make this snortable, I haven't tried it but it just seems like it hurts to much to be worth it.

Yeah, snorting isnt advised, i used to snort another 20-50mg after an oral dose to boost the comeup, but i'm gonna stop doing that considering that last time i did that, after the intense burning sensation, which i expected, my nose started bleeding... like pretty bad lol


How bad exactly would it be if you take 4-FA say... once or twice a week? because I understand that it also releases serotonin, like MDMA. Obviously not as much, but still, it makes you wonder. inbetween mdma experiences they advise you to wait at least 3 weeks, so would 4fa fry your brain if you take it more than once a week?

Honestly compared to coke and how much it gets stomped on not to mention what the low level people cut with sometimes... I feel safer IVing (or IMing if you have micron filters) some RC's like 4mmc, M1. etc.. That is as far as impurities go. Obviously you run the risk of using drugs that have nto been studied much, and we do not know long term or even short term effects/damage they do.

Yeah thats my assumption I find it hard to beleive 4fa resembles e at all but lets see how it goes when I do it for the 1st time. I sniffed 50mg a while agobut I never really got to experiment with it.

Tried 4-FA yesterday. We started with 100mg in a capsule, enjoyed it for about an hour and a half but then decided to add 25mg more into the mix. From there on out it was like a mellow roll, lots of tingling in my body (almost like my feet, hands, etc had fallen asleep) and I felt very content with everything. Downside was I had some jaw grinding (but not nearly as bad as 6-APB), and I could feel how dehydrating this chem is. Constantly thirsty, which meant I was constantly drinking water, which meant I was peeing a lot. Could get annoying the next time I take it, cause I'll be at a fest but we'll see how it goes. Overall, I liked it and found it a lot less intense (in a good way) than 6-APB. I'm comparing these two because I bought them at the same time and was figuring out which ones would be appropriate for a music festival, and decided to bring both!

Started researching 4-fa 2.5 weeks ago, started by ordering 1g and liked it enough to order 3g more which just arrived.


Used up the first gram over the course of thursday night to saturday evening, spread out over 6 large doses. No sleep thursday night, approximately 4 hrs on friday and saturday nights. The binge ended with intense tachycardia, dizziness, hyperthermia. All oral doses, havent tried snorting or plugging yet. 


For the next 1.5 weeks i had trouble concentrating and remembering, slept a ton, and felt fuzzy, out of it, almost on auto pilot. 


A friend on saturday took approximately 200mg in two doses while i had around 300mg between two doses. We sat in the car listening to dubstep for three hours straight barely speaking, but texting everyone we knew. Both of us found ourselves chewing on our lips constantly however, and when we tried to chew gum instead, we both ageeed it was too intense.


That being said i feel i pushed this compound far enough to know the limits.


1. My favorite drug. Somewhere right up the middle between MDMA and amphetamine/coke without nearly as many drawbacks. Clear headspace, slight visual enhancement, confidence, fairly strong tactile and auditory enhancement. Slow, smooth, mellow comedown, but sleep impossible within 8-10 hours.


2. Most effective dose 150-250mg, spaced 1-2 hours apart, but start small and be smart.


3. Lower doses are great for study/work/concentration. Feels like adderal under 75mg.


4. Not fiendish, but it is so pleasant i found myself wanting to constantly use it.


5. Contact high is incredible! Normal conversations are awesome, and the mood lift is dedinitely contageous.


6. Tolerance does develop immediately.


7. Take it easy, hydrate well, eat lots beforehand and leave at least a couple days between use and it is virtually a perfect drug.

Yeah, I noticed that if I sleep at normal hours, and don't try to skip a night, I feel normal the day after, as if I didn't take drugs at all! (maybe a little bit fuzzy in my head but barely worth noting)

But if I dare to skip even 1 night, I get INSANE headrushes (to the point where I almost faint), and confusion


Also I have ALOT of problems with grinding my teeth when on amphetamine/MDMA, but on 4-fa I somehow don't have it at all?

Wondering if anyone has noticed potentially dangerous hypertensive effects from 4-FA? I know it stands to reason it could happen since its a stimulant.. but two different people now that I know have experienced severe reactions at doses ~150 mg.  Confusion, stiff neck, *throbbing migraine*, constant vomiting. Very severe too.  To me that sounds like possibly high blood pressure, but of course I dont know for sure. 


What's interesting is that several other people enjoyed that much and more of the same batch. Interestingly, I've never researched if benzos affect blood pressure, but when taking xanax before dosing 4-fa, only typical vasoconstriction symptoms seem present. Certainly nothing like what I'm describing above.


Have other people seen these effects/ is it common?  

Also do benzos help with high blood pressure from stimulant use?

The most annoying effect I get from 4-FA is jaw tension/urge to grind teeth.  It's worse than ANY other stim I've tried and nothing seems to help.  I also get the strange desire to color (like in a coloring book w/ markers) every time I take it :D

Yeah, I find it worse than MDMA jaw tension by a longshot.  Then to make matters worse 4-FA dries my mouth out to the point where my throat gets sore.  Gotta keep drinking water!

^My god yes I can't believe how perpetually thirsty I was. But the jaw grinding was not nearly as bad as 6-APB, so I wasn't too bothered by it. Although my jaw was a little sore when I ate the next day.

Magnesium is your friend. Most notably the Chloride salt. One of the few (if not only) Magnesium salts that is both a) highly bioavailable and b) not a laxative. By far the best cure for jaw tension IME.


Edit: As for mouth dryness, try sucking on some cough drops. Always works well for me.

In my experience, redosing seems to extend the duration of the high but also significantly increases side effects and the comedown. A couple of times I have taken the initial dose at ~10:00AM (150mg) with a redose at 11:00AM or 12:00PM (50mg) and experienced a terrible comedown, being unable to sleep until 6:00AM or so. 


Other times I have taken 200mg at once in the afternoon (perhaps 4:00PM) and have been able to sleep relatively easily (with the help of alcohol) with not nearly as much residual stimulation on the way down.


I should mention that these experiences all occurred at home, so after a certain time I felt like winding down and was very annoyed that I was unable to. If you are going to take it at a festival or something (it seems as though that is the environment you are considering taking it in) where you may not plan on sleeping at all and have a group of close friends with you then I say a redose would certainly be worth it.

There have been concerns raised about the possible side effects of the floluorine in 4-fa (skeletal warping), but it has been speculated that the body would be unable to break the fluorine free and the compound would be excreted chemically unchanged. Would there be a method of urine analysis that could confirm this?

Add to the list of possible side effects:


Diarrhea

Rash 

Nystagmus?


Twice my vision started to shake back and forth rapidly (well after comedown) and spin. It only shook while focusing, if i looked around it stopped. Im not sure if this was purely physchological or physiiological (both times i wasnt near a mirror to see if my eyes were actually moving back and forth or not).

No, this isn't a bad thing. No, this doesn't irreverably bind enzymes. No, this won't result in "free fluorine". No, this does not paralell the heavier haloamphetamines.

Hallelujah! 


Thank you so much! So to round it up, 4-fa is safe to take in small quantities, with a reasonable amount of alcohol. It wont release the fluorine, unless you smoke it (good luck you guys who've tried to smoke it![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

i have experimented with 2fma recently a few times, spaced a little over a week apart and had good results, in comparison to experimenting with 4fa the same distance apart the previous month. 2 months of conclusive studies on both have confirmed what most would say, that 4fa is more euphoric between the two. very true. BUT, people who claim 2fma doesnt have any recreational value and has no euphoria, is either getting crappy stuff, or not taking the right doses. i find 150mg of 4fa oral to be a really good dose. if u want, do a 50mg boost an hour or so in, but not alot later. like with 2fma, its a really clean stimulant without many unwanted side effects at all, unless you redose.  i do prefer 4fa over 2fma, as far as enjoyment goes overall. BUT i would prefer 2fma if i wanted to play a xbox game like call of duty for 12 hours straight without getting bored at all. both are really good rc's. it sucks too, the vendor i was working with, like many others, have recently stopped shipping to usa. not sure why since the fluoroamphetamines aren't scheduled at this time, like many other rcs...right when i was really starting to take a liking to the FA's... kind of a bummer. good stuff tho. if you can order legitimately, id say go for it. just be safe, dont go over 150mg in a day unless you want some slightly gross effects. and always space doses (days) a week apart for best results!

ive found 4-fa just as enjoyable (at home) having inch size lines every 45 mins-hour.

i have used nearly a g within 24 hours with no noticeable side effects, although you could say its somewhat of a waste. however redosing via insufflation does work to an extent.

I've had a few different batches of 4-FA from same source, all of them white crystalline powder. However, some batches have a distinct "fishy" odor, while some are odorless. Any idea what might cause the fishy smell? I've read reports that the fishy odor is related to cathinone (sp) derivatives, so maybe it's cut with something else? The effects, regardless of the odor, seem the same, though. 


Anyone have any idea what would cause such an odor?

My guess would be tertiary amines. I'm not realy into chemistry so please don't ask me what that is, but i do know that these amines are supposed to produce the fishy-smell in street amphetamin-paste.

Thanks for the posts about 4-FA's fishy smell. I'll checkout the "tertiary amines," and see what exactly they are.


I guess a follow-up question to this would be: Has anyone smelled that fishy smell with other RCs? 


I've heard people say that some other RCs smelled like "cat piss" which I supposed is a similar description as "fishy" especially when the fishy smell is not super strong, as in some cases. Though I have to admit, I'm no expert on cat piss smell, but I could see someone describing some of the batches of 4-FA that way.


So does anyone know of other RCs with funky smells? I've only had 4-FA and 2-FMA, so my experience in that department isn't very wide ranging.

i just got 1g of 4-FA which have no odor, a very acidic taste, from a reputable spanish source.

at 60mg I got no stimulation, but got sleepy, increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure & intestinal stimulation.

Very uncomfortable. I wouldn't try more from this batch.

Have someone experienced something similar?


A year ago i got an other 4-FA which was smelly (somehow fishy), and very very more enjoyable, from the same source.

How does 4-fa compare to butylone? Both were described to me as a speedier version of methylone.

trash it. The one time someone sent me a fishy package with what was supposed to be 4-fa I thought I was going to die. I think you got some dirty stuff mate. 4-FA should not smell like fish.

got a bunch of this hanging about and with the good MDMA connect I have now I can't see me using it at all, any ideas how useful this is for studying? I'm pretty good at getting my head down anyway.

**this is the only drug i've had a bad reaction to..**


The 1 time I took the stuff, I had a horrible reaction.. For the most part it was fun, but when I tried to walk that was another story. When iever I'd get up I'd walk a ways and totally faint.. I'm not sure if it was bc I hadn't ate that b4 I took it or what.. I felt like I was about to start seizing or somethng, but if I was just sitting there I was perfectly ok.. 


I can't remeber exact does but I'm guessing it was anywhere from 150 to 250mg's. The people we've since given it away 2 love it. I'd probably be willing to try it 1 more time tho, with a less mg.

I have a similar reaction when I stand up on this stuff-- really dizzy, get tunnel vision. I've never fainted though. I think it's from the vasoconstriction.

^ that's what was kinda weird... When I was just sitting there I almost felt sober( if my memory serves me coRrectly), but I didn't get the tunnel vision or dizziness.. Its kind of bizarre I'd just fall over, I'd probably try it again though, If I had something 2 eat or some1 2 carry me round... Lol.

Of all the rc's I've tried, this is the only 1 this has happened with.

I've done plenty of othr rc's and have nevr had even a close reaction 2 this. Last thing I want is to have 2 get rushed to the er bc I was experimenting w/ some1's lab project gone wrong.

if it's not **100% trusted** tht its high purity 4-FA/4-FMP don't take it.... you could be sent any chemical/cut, unless you have a "testing kit" for the drug (which i don't know if it exists), it's at your own risk

Never felt dizzy/weak or fainted on 4-FA, and I've used it extensively.  Not sure what could be the cause really.  4-FA is not nearly as vasoconstricting as propylhexedrine and some of the other stims I've used.  But everyone's different.

I've read of a similar feeling from heavy use of mephedrone.. I would wager its simply the body's reaction to a combination of sleep deprivation, anorexia, hyperthermia from the serotonin dump, and vascoconstriction. 


Not to mention when I did experience this my heart rate was at times over 150 BPM

^ The serotonin thing crossed my mind too.  I get that feeling during the comeup from MDMA.  It's like a lightheaded feeling combined with "OMG I think I might puke/shit/faint at the same time", but it always passes quickly.

WORD!!! I feel so bad for people who order shit and Dont get the right chemical. I have had vendors trusted as hell give me bunk/fake/cut to fuck rcs and the only reason I stopped experimenting to be honest with everyone is a nasty fucking product I got that was cut up 4-fa or just inactive dirty chemical. I went through a full 20min-30-min sensation that I drank too much caffiene. Its a feeling I can never forget. I got brain shocked a Lot I thought I was a goner. I will NEVER touch 4-FA again. Its a good chemical--a very pleasant one at that but the fact more recently any sample/purchase I have recieved was very different vendor to vendor in comparison to the real deal I had once this shit is just garbage. People will do anything for a fucking buck so when you purchase from these trusted people remember that there just a random nerd online and probably couldn't care less about you or what your Really getting. I have had some vendors not even test their OWN product. The whole rc scene imho has gone to shit in terms of quality product and legitimacy......your better off chancing on buying random e pills from a guy at a club ...

This happens because of your blood pressure. Blood didnt reach your brain fast enough when you stood up and you fell to the ground. The instant you hit the ground bood reached your brain though so you were fine when you stood back up. 


This is also what causes that fuzzy tunnel vision when you stand up then boom you faint.


I usually get similar BP issues when taking 4-FA or other stimulants. My best advice is to get up slowly from any resting position so you dont end up about to fall with nothing to hold onto and injure yourself.

Yes, I have naturally high BP and resting heart rate, and every once in a while I have a few seconds of tunnel vision when standing too quickly.


I have had nothing but good experiences with my RC vendor. Are we allowed to exchange vendor info via PM?

not quite the point i was trying to get accross, just to advance with caution when using rc's eg allergy test, then dose low and build your way up,,, if your source s trustworthy and have been so  in the past, then  it seems you have a good connect, but there are   lots of less trustworthy "sources/vendors" out there,,,


 just preaching what i don't (allways) practice ie, caution

anyone have any experience combining this with 5me (5 methyl ethylone)?


I will be trying 4-fa tonight for the first time. Knowing myself, depending on how things go, I will possibly look to enhance and expand my experience, and 5me is the only chemical I have that I would care to combine with 4-fa.

plugged 50mg to test the waters. Feels about like what I would think 50 oral would.


125mg more about 15 minutes ago. 


Was comming home from a concert and debating on whether to test as my friend bailed. Remembered the nitrous cracker I have in my top drawer and stopped and bought a box of whippits ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). First time in years. 


We will see how this goes, then possibly add more, add 5me, perhaps 2c-e as well. Maybe 2c-c. Fuck even DPT. If this ends up feeling anything like mdma, DPT would feel fucking orgasmic after. hrrrrrm ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). This is what I would call a non problem problem ;-)


Hmmmm decisions decisions. I am going to check around, but someone please point out if any of those are dangerous combinations.

Do not use this (often) to study as it's a seratonin releaser, go for 2-f(m)a instead.


If you ignore me go for around 80mg.

Ok, I have said this multiple times on this forum as well as other forums but for some reason I have yet to get tired of explainng it. So don't get me wrong, I'm not writing this in a "Oh damn, do I have to explain this AGAIN!" Nor am I\a chemist or know much on the subject of chemistry. The only reason I know this is because I've been in the RC game for a whole minue and always wondered the same thing but was too embrassed to ask. It actually took me quite some time to figure this out and I don't know why. It's actually should be kind of common sense. But  I'm noto knocking anyone , because as I said...it took me a whole minute to figure it out too.

  With that being said.....

  First and foremost, different labs use different formulas, different lab equipment, along with different brands of product to make the actual compound. You would think that all formulas would be the same since a research chemical such as 4-Fa should be just that right? Just 4-Fa. I could be incorrect on this one but...You know how some suppliers will claim their chemicals to be 99.8% pure? (which most are no more than 96% I believe) Well you wonder what that other .2% is? Well most of the time it's a compound to bind and make the chemical what it is such as a powder. Some even have a different formula that includes more filler. Basically using a filler in the original making of the product prevents a shitty lab from cutting their material after it has already been cooked up so to speak. Adding the filler also makes the chemical look more consistant than it would if they were to add a cut later on. Some of the time it's also just impurities that makes the batch be less in purity. But then again, a filler is an impurity as well. 

  Another reason to have a different formula is for the effect. The people/labs that are making these "research" chemicals are not ignorant. They know that these chemicals are going to be ingested more than likely and that if their batch produces the better effects, then their lab will be making more money. The more people like to consume their prouct, the more they will sell. So there's a good chance, guys and gals, that the chemical you are ingesting, infact, is not the same chemical that you bought or that you thought you were ingesting. There's a chance the compound was made up the cheapest way possible in other to give one the effect of what you have been told that it should be giving you after taking it. This happened alot with 6-apb when it first came out.  I'm not saying this is the case all the time, half the time nor even most of the time, I'm just saying...and unless you are taking all your rc;s to the lab for testing you really can't tell.

  And believe it or not, this is even the case for a lot of the street drugs. That's why if you go say from Cali and are getting some good cocaine, and then go through the country finding other parts of the states cocaine supply, you will see it can vary potency and even appearance in a lot of places.

Unless you have been taking that dose regularly, it should take any longer than the time it takes to get out of your sysyem (2 to 4 days tops), if you live a pretty clean life style otherwise.

Ya, 4-FA is a lot more like a roll.  2-FMA is more like Adderall, but better imo.

Any opinions on the difference between 2-FA and 4-FA?


I know 3-FA may cause problems with heart valves which is why im not considering trying it.  2-FA is something im interested in trying.

3-FA is way too moreish for me.  It reminds me of coke in many aspects.  I don't like the buzz from it.


2-FA I have yet to try, but a couple people I know say they enjoy it for practical daily applications as all around "utility too" much like 2-FMA.  2-FA, from what I've gathered, is less abusable than 2-FMA, one of the reasons being (iirc), it has a ceiling limit dose, in which once you reach that, you are essentially wasting the compound.

**Took 4-FA last night, can't feel methamphetamine today.**


I've always had the feeling that 4-FA was very strong in all respects. Never was I so surprised until this morning.


Last night:

10p ~100mg 4-FA

12a ~100 4-FA 

3a ~100mg methylone


I kinda just IV them as a.. thing. It's a between tasks thing, like having a snack or checking your news outlet of choice.


I ended up not sleeping and that's when I got the meth hookup.


Today:

9a ~50mg meth ->nothing

10a ~50mg meth -> ok I'm noticing behavioral & perspective change, no overt high

11a ~50mg meth -> nothing


I have a pretty low tolerance to stimulants at the moment. The 4-FA/M1 thing above isn't common and those doses were kind of uncomfortable considering it's a rush then next to nothing.


Anyway, I feel the slow build of peripheral effects from the meth, so I know it's in there (everything above has been micron filtered and with crystalline substances they can actually get trapped if they're just too big, then they wear away by the flowing water of subsequent uses) but **is 4-FA strong arming Tina away from work on my VMAT stuff?** Is this the initial prototype for a full dopamine antagonist? I'm not really serious about the second part but now I'm thinking about the structure and receptor affinities.

Interesting that this has become the consensus. We all know we're unique in our reaction to drugs, but 2-FA has a very stubborn, conservative ceiling for me whereas 2-FMA can get me into full blown Get Rich Quick Tweaker mode. It's a low level mode but still.. impressive.

a few things I noticed about 4-FA: 

1: It's easy to get distracted, probably due to the serotonin activity at higher dosage. Also it feels more fog headed at high dosage. At lower dosage it is easier to stay focused. (45-250mg have been tested) 

2: Due to the long half-life the comedown is barley noticeable, provided you remember to eat and stay hydrated. Getting even a little sleep helps. Taking supplements before the comedown helps (5-htp, magnesium, b-complex, a good multi vitamin, etc.) 3:Euphoria starts to die down about 3-4.5hrs in. Annoying stimulation persists for a good few hours. Not recommended but taking ephedrine helps smooths this out, Low doses of alcohol helps also, buts its important to remember how much you are drinking. 

4:I noticed anti-depressant/anxiolytic type effects up to 2-6 days after.(probably due to the long half life.)

5:It is a false positive on a normal dip stick test for amphetamine, but on a GC/MS, LC/MS (military) test it's a negative. I would guess normal amphetamine metabolites are passed through the urine but the fluorine bond stays put through the human metabolism. 

6:As with normal amphetamine, increasing the PH of your stomach contents potentates 4-FA. 1000mg of calcium carbonate (Tums) doubled if not tripled the euphoria of a 180mg dosage. And obviously an empty stomach helps.

^FT


im not sure which i like better than the other, i like them both. i find 4 FA active orally around 150mg and 2fma around 70-90 for a good dose. 4fa is really smooth and more euphoric, and 2fma is just more steady and solid, but it kinda drops off around the 4 or 5 hour mark and your left with a stimulation that isnt quite as enjoyable. minor comedown. for me, 4fa seems alot easier on the body and it is more euphoric. i like to do a little 4mec with my 4FA but only when its disappearing on me. both are really clean and enjoyable. if i had to pick one or the other tho, i think id do 4fa. im waaay to distracted to stop and do a specific thing, but on 2fma i can focus like a laser beam and play a video game (call of duty) 8 hours with only smoke breaks. i like the fluoro amps alot.

No man, its just very caustic. It did not degrade into anything, as far as I know that fluorine is bound like a mofo to the amp, so just cap it up and swallow with something in your stomach to soften the blow. keep most amps away from mucous membranes or they will burn like a biotch.

I've probably said this before, but since I see this question pop up over and over here it is again:  the main difference between 2-FA/2-FMA and 4-FA is the entactogenic effect.  4-FA has a mellow, eyes-rollling-back-in-the-head effect that the others lack.  It's not quite as stoning as MDMA, but the serotonin component is definitely there.  The 2-FAs are classical stimulants similar to amphetamine or caffeine.  This makes the 2's better for daily/regular use (if you're going to go there).  


On another note, quality 4-FA is getting more scarce (as are most stimulant RC's).  If you got shitty effects, that might be why.

Why is this thread in OD , but other entactogens like 5apb,6apb and methylone are in the PD section?

Doesn t make any sense.

Ever conversation, every intuition just flew so effortlessly and confidently. I'm a rather extroverted, social person to begin with, but with 4-fa I felt like a master of conversation who knew the perfect thing to do/say at all times.

The positives far outweigh the negatives in my opinion, and furthermore the negative effects can be managed and minimized effectively by smart, informed use of this substance (i.e. not bombing unknown quantities) and by taking good care of your body with proper nutrition, hydration, vitamin/mineral supplementation and at least a little sleep. Hope my experiences enhance some of yours.

I'm sure with protracted use it could do some damage but if you're only using occasionally (as I do) it's also a very effective way of keeping your use down - I don't use more than 60mg a night and "roll bawz" same as people bombing 2/3x that amount.

I'm guessing that what a few of us have observed happening to our gums/tongues is happening inside your nose when it "burns like fuck". Obviously you're free to choose your own ROA, but after seeing the bottom of my mouth turn to decayed, tattered tissue, I would never take it any way besides capping and swallowing. I know quite a few people prefer the rush of insufflation, just putting in my 2 cents.

DISCLAIMER: When I went on most of these bike rides under the influence of 4-FA it was around 40-50 degrees Fahrenheit outside so the potential for overheating was minimal; in hotter temperatures I'm not sure this level of cardio activity would be safe with 4-FA, although I have yet to test for myself. Anyone have any insights into the issue of 4-FA and light/moderate cardio activity?

Well I would say its never a good idea to combine potent psychostimulants with cardio, due to increase in bp causing a lot of possible issues with that... Caffeine and some pre-workout stimulants( like jak3d or what have you)  are really the only ones I would combine with any sort of rigorous physical activity|

Iam wondering what your 4-FA looks like?! I have had 2 different types. one beeing white and fluffy and sparkely the other beeing offwhite(with a hint of purple/pinkish) granules/sandcorn type. the fluffy white stuff seemed to be more serotgenic, the other more speedy. Now i heared that the white stuff is no 4-fa (someone i know said this, not meaning anything).

I know that you can never be sure if either of them is 4-fa without testing but i dont have the possibility of gs/ms or NMR...

For those interested in a 4-FA + Methylone combination, my trip report on the combo is here:[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/661853-(Piracetam-3-5g)-(Methylone-200mg)-(4-FA)-300mg)-Magical-Night-then-Afterglow?p=11247452#post11247452](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/661853-(Piracetam-3-5g)-(Methylone-200mg)-(4-FA)-300mg)-Magical-Night-then-Afterglow?p=11247452#post11247452)


A quick synopsis: I thoroughly enjoyed the combo and had a magical experience with it. I pre-loaded with piracetam, dosed 200mg methylone first, then 100mg 4-FA every hour for three hours. I would repeat the order, amount and timing of my doses exactly as I did this time because I got to enjoy the toe-curling, eye-wiggling Methylone rushing onset and euphoria without spoiling it by taking 4-fa first, but when the methylone waned the long-acting stimulation and mood elevation of 4-FA was the perfect thing to set the methylone bliss on coast for 5 hours, which lead into a come-down so gentle it was non-existent and a wonderful afterglow the next day. Highly recommended, *especially* with piracetam before and with methylone! I suspect piracetam was responsible for the gentle nature of my experience and for the lengthened M1 euphoric plateau, and I'll never take m1 without it.

About 2 and half hours ago I plugged 20mg of Adderall XR crushed into a fine powder. I also threw in a little bit of phenazepam in the solution to take the edge off since I'm prone to stimulant anxiety. I actually had even doses phenazepam much earlier in the day shortly after I woke up.


Now about 5 minutes ago I decided I didn't really feel much of anything from the Adderall and dissolved 50mg of 4-FA and plugged it. I googled this combination and tried searching everywhere for info on it but couldn't find anything. I don't see any danger in this combo, both are pretty much classic stimulant amphetamines, mainly acting as dopamine reuptake inhibitors. 4-FA has slight sert affinity but I don't see any risk for serotonin syndrome, or anything for that matter, at these small dosages. Also keep in mind I have been almost alternating taking 4-FA and Adderall the past 2 weeks so I know I've built up a slight tolerance. Not dosing every day but most of the week off and on with days in a row.


The phenazepam is most likely the reason for not really feeling much from the Adderall. I experienced slightly elevated heart rate and other usual peripheral side effects. I felt ever so slightly speedy but it just had a weird edge to it so thats why I decided to redose with some 4-FA. I should add that I did experience a heart palpitation about an hour ago and another one randomly while *thinking* about adding this. Clearly caused from anxiety, its common for me to get 1 or 2 while on or coming down from a stimulant. To me, a heart palpitation is where it feels like my heart beats really hard once or almost skipped a beat and it takes my breath away. Very unnerving feeling. 


I might still not feel much even from that since the dose isn't very big and phenazepam is definitely still in my system. 


My only real worry is I did 4-FA last night also. I dosed around 110-120mg, plugged. I tried taking phenazepam to kill the roll as I had to actually wake up early and it for sure worked eventually because I was able to sleep around 7-8 hours later. Much much earlier than without any benzo. I slept for about 2-1/2 to 3 hours before going to class. Came back from class and slept probably another 3-1/2 hours so I got a good amount of rest. I ate a full meal, took a multivitamin, magnesium pill and calcium pill with vitamin d. I felt perfectly fine when I dosed the adderall, other than a slight feeling of phenazepam though it could have been placebo as my dosage was eyeballed. (50mgs was weighed out accurately, then I divided the pile in two and then again and so on until I had an amount around 2-4mg). Blah blah eyeballing phenazepam is dangerous, I know, but I had taken it the 2 nights before with more accurate dosing and figured I had some tolerance along with it still being in my system... no amnesia yet and no blackouts so I think I have dosed perfectly fine, possibly not that much since I don't know for sure).


Sorry for the long post.

Taking 4-FA on consecutive days or nights greatly reduces the serotogenic effects IME. And i'm sure the phenazepam is entirely responsible for the lack of desired effects you're experiencing. I could be mistaken, but doesn't that stuff have a ridiculous long half-life? Like over 24 hours? Your bedtime dose was probably still in effect when you dosed the Adderall and more phenazepam, and I'm not surprised that it dulled your experience.


I understand taking benzos to ease the come down and allow for sleep, but why take benzos at the same take as amphetamines? Seems like it would cancel out any good amphetamine effects, whereas if you wanted a mellower experience you could just take less amps. Just my 2 cents.

My God, does 4-FA burn the mucus membranes!  But it doesn't seem to have that effect on the stomach.  2-FMA is just the opposite--minimal burning except in the stomach, where it produces SERIOUS acid/gnawing pain.  Weight loss also happens faster on 4-FA than other stimulants I've tried.  Wonder why that is?


I'm seeing a lot of what I consider "high" doses discussed here for 4-FA.  My typical dose is 40-60 mg in a day, tops.

ive been experiencing some moderate lower back pain but more lateral on each side.  i would ignore it if it was much like amphetamine but it is not.  i hope its not my kidneys aye.  my other skeletal muscles dont seem tense at all and ive been drinking plenty of water.


has anyone else noticed this with 4-FA usage?


my blood pressure also seems very low but i dont have a way to measure it.  it is kind of nice actually, because after 3 years of suboxone and plenty more years of other drugs ive had some unpleasant tachycardia and an increased BP, or at least it feels like that anyway though it may just be oversensitivity.

4FA like tore up my nose permanently so watch out! My nose is a different shape after using it for two nights. The good effects are only good for 1-2 doses and then after that it turns into pure stimulation.

it works for studying in lower doses id say.  but it makes me feel rather retarded.  higher doses produce effects very similar to MDMA.


here's a good read on it...

ive never redosed on 4fa, unless it was a boost 30 minutes after i drop my oral dose of 160mg. 160 to me, feels like a light roll. i dont see the purpose of doing less than that for myself.  if you want to be pruductive, get 2FMA. if you want to chill and just hang out, and have fun feeling great, 4FA is the way to go.   -aphex

Yeah i tend to get this with all amps but alot with 4-FA! I do drink alot while on 4-Fa (about 2-4l in 8h) but I still think this pain comes from the kidneys. It just fits the area and I cant get rid of the pain with methods that normaly work for my back pain (technics i learned at Physical therapy).

What kind of pain do you get? I have some kind of pulling, stretching pain that makes it hard to sit down (lying on my back seems best)

Its a dull ache, kind of like a pulled muscle but it feels different.  I couldnt tell you for sure if its kidney pain but I'd imagine it is what it would feel like.  It really seems to suck the water out of me, and like you said, ill walk around with a 2L jug I refill on campus every couple hours almost.


My mouth remains dry and sometimes I find myself have been sucking on my tongue for a half hour to an hour without realizing it.  Then my girlfriend says my breath smells rancid.  I better buy some chewing gum and listerine next time I dose.

N-Acetyl-Cysteine is an excellent anti-oxidant that aids in kidney function, that should solve the problem.

Guess I'll answer my own question: no surprises. There's a mix of the two euphoria, and a dampening of the stimulant/depressant effects.

I've definitely experienced some kidney discomfort after using 4-FA on consecutive days or on an extended binge. The only real remedies are lots of H20, antioxidants and supplements that promote liver/kidney health, such as milk thistle or black walnut hull.


 When using 4-FA, or any substance for that matter, I always take a whole food powder supplement that's chock full of sea greens, antioxidant blends, detox blends, pretty much everything your body could ever need but in a natural, whole food form. I won't post the name here so I don't violate vendor/sourcing rules, but I highly recommend it and can send the link to anyone who PM's me.

Here's my trip report from last month on this combo: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...g)-(4-FA)-300mg)-Magical-Night-then-Afterglow](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/661853-(Piracetam-3-5g)-(Methylone-200mg)-(4-FA)-300mg)-Magical-Night-then-Afterglow)


It should be noted that I added Piracetam to the 4-FA/methylone combo, and I believe the 'racetam to be a large part of why my experience was so great. And to answer your question, yeah I pre/post-loaded exactly as I would if I had been taking MDMA: a potent whole food antioxidant powder, magnesium, Vitamin C, 5-HTP after and piracetam before and at the time of dosing. 


I strongly recommend piracetam with methylone, it definitely smoothed out the whole experience and lengthened the best parts. Piracetam is completely legal in the US and dirt cheap compared to any RC, definitely a must-have for anyone interested in m1.

Thanks bud, appreciate the input...but why piracetam? I'm not very familiar with the drug or any 'racetams . And I see you're quite the advocate for it as a potentiator on several threads.

Honestly I'm pretty ignorant as to the brain science behind piracetam's mechanisms of action in the brain and it's role in potentiation, I've read a few articles & threads that explain it but my knowledge of chemistry is so limited that none of what I read stuck with me.


Subjectively, I've had some success with piracetam as part of a daily regime for about 8 months, I really like the mental clarity & fluidity it provides as well as boosted mental energy. My raving reviews of using piracetam with methylone may have such a rosy tint because the setting and experience surrounding my use of this combo was so amazing, but I really think it played a large role in smoothing the come-up for the methylong, extending the duration and minimizing the after effects/hangover. 


Typically when coming up on a strong stimulant & serotonin releaser I get some slight anxiety or apprehension that fades after 15 minutes, but with piracetam the onset of effects was as smooth as silk and relaxing, not overwhelming at all. As for the hangover, by all rights I should have had at least some brain fatigue or apathy the next day, which I used to get pretty badly with MDMA. I think the piracetam was the main reason that the next morning was so pleasant during this experience.

i only use orally too.  i was using daily for a few weeks, at greater dosages than you specified.


i also noticed light-headed/dizzyness up in the high end...  and once awful blue balls that lasted a day at least.


it definitely lingers a while; i still have, what feels like, vasoconstriction in the hands.

**Would this have cross tolerance with a psychedelic such as 25C-NBOMe? How would tripping the next day feel after a 100-120mg dose of 4-FA?
**

And to jump into the convo above, negative side effects I've noticed, especially when redosing, are vasoconstriction, dehydration, and dizziness upon standing.

Ii agree with you both. thats why i dont really redose, i just do 160mg and thats good enough, i just wanted to see how much more euphoric it became. vasoconstriction absolutely, but i get it in my legs easy, dehydration is with all amps, you gotta stay hydrated, and dissiness could be lack of food? i have experienced this, if i smoke a bowl, and get up too fast. justtake a break u should be alright. i limit my doses to every other week at most. just for my own well being. hope this helps. take care!  -aphex

the dizziness is not lack of food (but this will contribute im sure).  im guessing it has to do with strange effect this has on blood pressure.


it also jacked the hell out of my amphetamine tolerance.  quite unfortunate.  i found it easy to study the more i used this substance, im guessing the 5ht effects diminished more quickly.

I dosed 4-FA like 45 minutes ago and already had 2 heart palpitations. Either somethings actually wrong or I really psyche myself out, which I think is really the case.


I could take 0.25mg of Alprazolam right now to take the edge off and hopefully stop any palpitations, but would rather save it for the comedown and eat 0.75mg at once, followed by another 0.25mg if needed.


And yet again I felt another one. It has to be in my head. I plugged 133mg. Not like I would die from that dose.

heart palpitations are fairly normal, you may just be more aware or focusing way too much on the feeling/idea.  it's when you have one every 10-15 seconds and become dizzy/faint... then you worry.

Yea well that didn't happen but I still had my share of them unfortunately. Took the Alprazolam anyways and that ended that.

Gave this stuff a try at 110mg last evening, dosing at 5:45pm.  It was a great time while I was up but I experienced complete insomnia, zero sleep all night, I haven't eaten anything in the past 24 hours except the bowl of cereal I forced down.  Felt weird, kinda up, kinda down, with some odd stomach feels all day today (the day after).  It is now 24 hours later and I still feel a bit off, still not tired, still not hungry.  My thoughts are clear and accurate but my mood is just off, probably because of lack of food, sleep, stress etc.  I notice some vasoconstriction and lack of pressure in my urine (just trickles out all sad and whatnot).  Pupils were dilated just about all day.  Weird stuff indeed, not sure fluorinated compounds are my ally.

Poor circulation, vasoconstriction and low urine pressure are the main physical side-effects I've experienced, which others have mentioned in the above posts.

Yes and yes to this ^^^^. Proper nutrition will definitely do wonders for minimizing side-effects such as dizziness and vasoconstriction, but even with adequate food intake 4-FA will definitely affect the cardiovascular system. I get terrible circulation when using it, my hands sometimes look like they could belong to a zombie's, and my extremities are always cold even when my core & head are very warm.


And the light euphoria from the 5ht activity fades pretty quickly from extended use, while the dopaminergic and "amphetamine-ish" effects can be felt even during very extended periods of use (1 week or more with no days of non-use). I think this is why some people find redosing/dosing for multiple days or weeks to be desirable and effective, while others get such diminished returns from repeated use that they refrain from using more than once a month: it all depends on individual brain chemistry and preference for effects. Personally, I enjoy the pure stimulation and dopaminergic effects 4-FA provides even after the serotogenic qualities are lost from chronic use, while I have friends who hated dosing even two days in a row because it lost the significant euphoria caused by 5ht activity. As they say, YMMV. 


**Important!**


Differences in potency between different batches of 4-FA seem to vary greatly, more so than with other RC's, and significant variability occurs even between two batches from the same vendor within the same few months. I've read other anecdotal reports that support this claim, and my fairly extensive experience with 4-Fa has definitely found this to be true. Some batches will have me rip-roaring and ready to party at 100mg oral with very significant serotonin action occurring (very dilated pupils, euphoria just below MDMA levels, enhanced sensory enjoyment), whereas others are not noticeable at 100mg and a dose of 120mg oral + 4-mg insufflated (the highest I've personally ever dosed) still lacked any perceptible serotogenic properties.


The moral of the story is, as is so often repeated on BL and just as often ignored: **start your doses low!!** With every new batch, start at 100mg oral and THEN titrate doses up as you see fit. I've never come across a single anecdotal report of oral doses 100mg or below being "too much" for anyone, and I've read this entire thread front-to-back as well as every single report on Erowid and many others on BL and other forums. Never assume that bc you enjoyed 150mg from one batch that this dose will be okay with every new batch.

Sorry if this has been answered but will there be any cross tolerance issues with 25c (low dose 48 hours prior)?


I don't have much stimulant use and nothing recent so I don't think there should be any tolerance issues but unsure.


Good first time dose for someone with no recent stim use? 6'1 Male , weigh around 210lb?


Will allergy test first , but am looking for a moderate to strong experience not light/threshold.

Update** i took 160-170mg of 4FA around 7:15 pm. i felt awesome. chatty, music was grooving, i was unraveling all my worries and enxieties, and had a great time, being open and talking to people and making alot more solid friends over the web. i dont use party drugs to be around people, i like to gain an introspective experience from it. realize why i have anxiety, what it stems from and nip it in the bud. im trying. i felt it solid for 4-5 hours after ingesting, about an hour to fully to come up, but felt good 30 mins in. lots of warm body rushes, and i didnt even hit my cannabis pipe but like 2x over those 4 hours. so far so good...


so i have some 4MEC and i looked it up aloooong time ago and not only do they mesh well together, they intensify each other and actually bring a peak back.i had 3 50mg lines and it wasnt moreish at all, more sedating. i use 4MEC as a bridge to get across that unformforbale but bearable comedown. you know...your lips get all gummed up in the corners and gooey from cotton mouth. it was a great experience but i think the supplier im going throughnow, is more potent than the good one who quit shipping to US in august (you pros know who im talking about) no sourcing i know the rules. i figured if i dropped a hint nobody "out of the know" of the mentioned vendor would have any clue what im talking about.


about every 45 minutes id be catalyzed the whole time, just tranquil, and like clockwork (ALWAYS) at the 45 minute mark im getting line number 2 ready. and i also wanted to add, that vendor i mentioned, that was good but not naming to adhere to the rules. there was no thought whatsoever again as ALWAYS to do another line i dont find 4MEC fiendish (too bad) on 4 FA. it depends tho, ive done it as i was coming down and thats not the way to go. do it at the 4 hour mark while you still feel happy, the 4MEC will prolongue that and put you in a comfortable loungy feeling atmosphere. having 4FA to me, and no 4MEC is like tripping without cannabis to toke, or at the least a beer to drink. its like cigarettes and beer, they just go so well together. 


i was doing awesome on my benzo taper, but i took 3 mg , 3 x exactly an hour apart. i should have been out. and since phenazepam is the more sleepy one, i did 5mg of that (a good dose for me, noticable but not over the top.about 4 hours ago, and it should be at peak plasma level now. so i took one last dose of etizolam to boost that p-zam into gear 30 minutes ago and im finally cracking yawns. either my dose is waaaaay to high, or both 4FA and 2FMA need a benzo and maybe some vicodin for the comedown. 4fa in excess has a more significant drop when you do a big dose, which might explain the more of a comedown than expected. i was baffled 10mg etizolam didnt knock me out, taking 3 mg an hour apart for 3 hours. then i dosed again with the pzam. i gotta getback on my  taper so this was my last stimulant kick for a while, which is cool. i didnt get too far off track, ill pop some valerian root if i need to and drink a beer but i think the pzamand zolam will work eventually. i now valium is good for sleep but the 200 hour half life would start me at day 1 on my benzo taper and ive been doing it 1x a week for 4 weeks now and have been lowering the valium for a month or two, then the klonopin for a week or two. i figured i was safe using eti's bc ive got longer half lived benzos built all in small amounts (1.75mg kpin) (15 valium) 1x a week and valerian root the days inbetween if necessary. i almost took a valium to help with sleep but im not ruining my taper ive been working so hard on.


last question.... amp veterans. if 2fma get you a good dose around 90mg ( i have a slight tolerance from the ecstasy days) does that sound high for recreation, not study guide?

          and with 4FA, is 170mg too much? i may have overdid thus im typing this with no sleep, 13.5mg of etizolam, and 5 mg of p-zam. or does that sound about right to you guys? i did 100mg the second time i tried it (80 first) and both were a tease.im just curious if im in the right ballpark. i think i am. thanks guys -aphex

very solid point, especially getting quantity but a gram of 4fa is like 8 doses. ive already wasted a few doses titrating up. its safer, i agree, but it can make you waste what coulda been a badass night.i think ill bump it down to 150 next time, maybe 140. give it till the end of the month or so. i treat 4fa like i would mdma and i lost that magic, im holding onto my 4fa magic as long as i can!

I meant the nbome.


I allergy tested small amount , less then threshold and this morning proceeded to take 150 via oral roa in gel cap.


Was pretty sleep deprived past 3 days after getting minor flu thur night and sleeping way to late into the day Friday messed up my sleep and was up till 5-6 a.m. Fri/sat night when I needed to b up by 10 so figured today wouldn't be a bad day to try the 4-fa I've had lying around in hopes of not napping mid day & getting back to a normal sleep pattern , and more importantly for recreation of it.


Not gonna do a trip report but it was enjoyable at this dose.


Very calm stimulation. Social enhancer (was more talkative but not in an annoying way like someone on a bunch of meth bomb e pills or large doses of cocaine) , euphoria was present , a bit mild but enjoyable. Being the first nice day after months of cold winter in MI this could of accounted for some euphoria. Had a sense of well being/contentness throughout the day. Have slight social anxiety and it felt decreased & felt more confident I guess you'd say. All this was very mild though , the best I could compare as I'm limited in stim use (though have abused cocaine plenty) , is MDMA/cocaine LIGHT. like very light in a good way , where I'm not visibly fucked or making an ass of myself/being obnixious or feeling super compulsive like cocaine use effects me.


I had no desire to redose.


Setting was just regular old Sunday no festives. Taken at Noon , most intense part lasted couple of hours followed by slight stimulation until around 7.5hr in where I was able to sleep. Was only a 2 hr nap as I was exhausted , am at 12 hours in am baseline and should be able to sleep soon.. Mood pleasant throughout day , even considering being slightly annoyed / angry with the g/f and being low on sleep + slight hunger throughout day. All things liable to leave me cranky. Was in public a lot throughout day , shopping (well mainly window shopping) & riding around enjoying the long over due return of sun and over 50 degree weather.


So all in all thoroughly enjoyable. A bit light IMO for party setting , maybe 200mg range would be a bit more satisfying for that , or in combination with a low dose phen (if this is even safe)


How about mixing this with non phen pyschedelics? Like Mushrooms , or your 4-sub tryptamines (thinking 4-ho-mipt+4-fa might gel )

Update


Didn't fall asleep until about 2:30 a.m. , so about 14 hours after ingesting 150mg. This was likely due to my 2 hour nap at about 7 hours in.


Feel fine the next day. Not drained and depressed as I would usually the day after stim use. Had very vivid dreams , pleasant ones where I was dissapointed to wake up and realize it was a dream. I smoked maybe .5g of marijuana in a few seperate tokes between 10-14 hr mark. Weed and stims usually leave me a nervous wreck but not last night. Mixed well. I bring this up. Because marijuana use usually surpresses my dreams but like I said I had super vivid dreams , so I'm not sure if this was 4-fa's doing or what.

I don't have first hand experience with mixing 4-fa with any psychedelics, but based on fairly extensive experience with 4-FA my gut says that the odds that the stimulation creates an anxiety-ridden trip outweigh the odds that the mild euphoria of 4-fa creates a "better" trip, whatever that may mean for any individual.


IME mdma + a psychedelic (i've only tried this combo with lsd) results in a very relaxed, calm, anxiety-free trip because the euphoric relaxation of mdma prevents any negative or repetitive trains of thought from originating. 4-FA, however, is both more stimulating and less euphoric than mdma, and I think the combo would be more similar to amphetamine + a psych, especially after the T+2:00 of 4-FA where the euphoria fades but the stimulation persists.


I know I've read a snippet or two about this combo somewhere on the interwebs, i'll track some down for you when I get a chance.

Also, has anyone else had experiences with significant variance in potency among different batches of 4-FA over the past several months? By significant, I guess I'm talking about differences of at least 20mg between doses that create the same or similar effects. For example, I've had batches where 100mg oral produces significant euphoria, dilated pupils, and experiences that are "magical" in my memories, but recently I've had batches where 160mg produces mild mood lift but no euphoria and much weaker stimulation than 160mg of earlier batches would cause.


I'm not sure if this is due to shifts in my body chemistry resulting from fairly frequent use (at least once most weeks, some periods of 2-3 weeks abstinence) or if the product is qualitatively different, so any input is mucho appreciado y bueno ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^ I've noticed a difference in the "quality" of the 4-FA high as well.  All batches seem to contain legitimate product, but some cause more jittery stimulation than others.  Could it be that some batches contain more levo isomers instead of pure dextro, or does that only apply to street speed?

Is anyone nice enough to recommend an oral dose? I do gel-caps on empty stomach.


Intend to use a reagent to test first. (Edit: damn, none of my reagent's seem to cover it!)


Otherwise, I'll read the thread.


Thanks.

start off at 100mg and maybe after about 45-60 min add up to 50mg more! First off do a allergie test with maybe a mg! I find that after about 4h there is a comedown from the serotogenic activity that lasts for about 30 min.. Do not add more in this phase! I find that after the 30min. the more dopamergenic side starts to kick in. This findings have been confirmed by all other friends that have taken 4-fa. but ofc it can be different for you.

Personally I really didn't like redosing, I found it greatly added to the negative side effects like vasoconstriction. I'd stand up and feel like I was about to pass out for a few seconds, tingling in the ends of my fingers. Not very pleasant ):

i highly doubt there was amphetamine in the batch because amphetamine is not a precursor to 4-FA synthesis by any means.


that approach would produce awful returns and is financially unfavored to say the least.

Wouldn`t it be probable that 4-FA would test positive for amphetamines due to the fact that 4-FA is a type of amphetamine itself? I think that would be the reason for the EZ test reaction rather than their being straight amphetamine mixed in Morkin`s batch. I thought people have reported taking drug tests and testing positive for amphetamines after they consumed 4-FA?


As for oral dose, I would start off at 100mgs and see how that felt. If I needed more,next time I would try 125mg up to 150mg. I don`t think I ever went above 150mgs.

im sure it would easily be flagged as an amphetamine.


my point was that there is no reason for d/l amphetamine to contaminate a batch, as it would not be used for synthesis of 4-FA.


one would need to start with a specific fluorinated precursor.

It depends if you drink and eat enough. Because 4-fa lasts way longer than m1 it is important to watch your foodintake. If you do not do so you will have some one the comedown, but nothing as bad as m1! For me that is ofc. (its rly bad with m1 with me...)

As long as you're smart with your dosing, no, at least not IME. Initial doses in the 0-150mg range and boosters under 60mg shouldn't be too straining, especially if you refrain from redosing altogether. Redosing/binge dosing will absolutely produce tachycardia, vasoconstriction, and all the other usual culprits of stimulant abuse. As a sidenote, I've never had an issue with methylone causing a rapid heartbeat in doses up to 220mg.

No effect from the 30mgs.

Did 100mgs the next day, same ROA. Slight energy and mood lift.

150mgs 4 hours later. Slight energy. Made me a bit more extroverted.

Several parts of your dosing pattern pop out at me as problematic and likely limited the positive effects you felt from the experience. First, while 30mg is too low of a dose to create noticeable for most, it still likely created some tolerance leading up to your 100mg dose the next day, so you didn't experience the full power of a 100mg dose. 


Second, redosing 150mg four hours after taking 100mg is guaranteed to result mostly in increased stimulation, insomnia, and general negative side effects, while producing very little of the euphoric effects sought after in 4-fa. It is generally recommended to begin with your largest dose and redose no later than 1.5 hours after your first dose with 1/3 to 1/2 of your initial dose. 


So you should have either taken 100mg initially and between 35-50mg around 45 min to 1 hr later, or you could have started with 150mg and done a booster of 50-75mg. Regardless, I encourage you to leave this substance alone for at least a couple weeks, let your body fully return to baseline, and give 4-fa another shot following the dosing scheme I laid out here. Doing this should allow you to enjoy all that this wonderful molecule has to offer

Would 4-FA have a cross-tolerance with MDMA or the NBOMes?

I can't comment on any cross-tolerance with the NBOMes, but there is likely at least some degree of cross-tolerance between 4-fa and mdma due to significant serotonin release induced by both substances, obviously much more with mdma but 4-fa still have clear serotogenic qualities. 


IME with 4-fa and methylone, if you use 4-fa once or twice in the week leading up to a methylone experience then no real cross-tolerance is apparent, and even using 4-fa a few hours before the methylone doesn't diminish the latter's effects.


On the other hand, daily or semi-daily 4-fa use or using it for a week or more without a break would surely diminish the effects from an MDMA experience due to serotonin depletion.

yes and crosstolerance with adderall for myself.  about 12-16 hours after using 4-FA, i felt absolutely no effects from adderall.


i read somewhere in here a man used methamphetamine a day or two later with no effects either.


perhaps this would make a good "meth suboxone"... suboxamine...

^What? Don't believe that man, just don't man, 4-FA is supposed to last 2 to 4 hours. The euphoric part at least. Residual stimulation can easily last 8 hours, that does make sense, but that's no longer rolling. Unless you combine your 4-FA with alcohol or tiny dose of other stim which could make FA seem to last longer in its fun effects.

Yeah I miss spoke, I gotta start staying away from the internet while on benzos lol. I ment that 90mgs produced euphoria that was comparable to mephedrone that lasted 4-5 hours with a pleasant lingering stimulation that lasted a good 3-4 hours. I should mention that while I am well versed with most RC and conventional stims I seem to be naturally sensitive to all of them

Okay this sounds realistic. Although I have to say that euphoria from pure mephedrone is better than any other stim I've tried as that shit was always pure hapiness and contentment. But not for long, only for 1-2 hours. After that I felt quite shitty no matter what on 4-MMC. And you don't stop redosing until you feel yourre dying. So the overall enjoyment of whole night is better with 4-FA IMO because one stays very rational while on it (not just me, also 5+ friends who experiment with me). As I said in previous post it is possible to overdo it with 4-FA but then again what drug it isn't possible with. Overall it's much worthy and safer than other RC stims Im sure. 

And for job/studing enhancement 4-FA can work wonders too. But you need to keep the dose really low, about 10 times lower than your euphoric party dose, else you will be distracted and the stimulation is useless. If you keep doses low and expect similar results as from caffeine MINUS the jittery, sweating etc. of caffeine, you're golden. If you expect much higher productivity and whatnot, you can end up in trouble, it doesnt work like that.


Btw 4-FA also works as a great aphrodisiac and social confidence boost to me

Have done this now twice since my first experiment (15O mg). Tried 18O about 2 weeks ago and 1OO yesterday.


Yet to mix with a psychedelic & may just pass on that idea all together. I don't find this super stimulating at all , as in I fell asleep fine 8 hours after taking 1OO MG yesterday. I don't think I'd enjoy mixing it with a psychedelic that adds much stimulation but something like 4-aco-DMt might gel together nicely with it given its quite sedating.


I think my sweet spot is around 15O with this one. 18O was not overwhelming by any means but erection was very hard to achieve and needed the help of cialis (likely not a safe combo but was in the heat of the moment and didn't want to let down). At 15O I had only slight problems. At 1OO no trouble at all but the overall effects at the lower dosage were a bit underwhelming. The 18O seemed quite a bit more pronounced then the 15O as far as euphoria is concerned. Very talkative & great mood.


Given I have basically zero stim tolerance I'm a lil stumped why I'm able to sleep 8-1O hours after ingestion but I'm not complaining. 


Out of the 3 rc stimulants I've tried this is by far my favorite. I've tried 4-mec & pentedrone as well. 4-mec was pretty mild and underwhelming and pentedrone led to compulsive redosing similar to cocaine with only half the euphoria & I hated the comedown. With 4-fa  there was a slight desire to redose after the MDMA - like effects wore off but never gave in. Comedown seemed Nom existent as in there were no negative effects/feelings related to it. No strung out feeling.

I`ve had this happen as well. I spent a 4 day weekend plugging 4-fa and around the following weekend(4-5 days later) I ate 60mgs of instant release adderall. Now normally if I ate 60mgs of addy I would be tweaked out massively. This time I didnt feel it at all. I almost took a nap,then went to bed 4 hours later. My girlfriend took 25 mgs and stayed up all night long.

     Total suck. I was looking forward to playing guitar all night long but nope, didn`t feel a thing.

After doing lots of MDMA years ago & also lots of 6APB, 5APB, methylone, MDAI & MDAT, after that up until recently, I think the poor result from the 4-FA is due to being sapped of serotonin. I wonder how long I'll have to wait to feel the euphoria - if any.

I'd still be cautious with each new batch if I were you, 150mg of potent 4-fa is pushing the limits and 180 is definitely dangerous. The past couple months I've been dosing similarly to you because I believe I've been receiving less potent batches unfortunately, but with earlier batches 160mg made me vomit 2 hours after dosing from being so insanely stimulated, something that has only happened to me once before in the midst of an amphetamine binge. 


I've said it before but I'll restate it now, 100mg should always be the starter dose for a new batch, you should always get good effects from this dose but it should never be problematic regardless of potency.

^ 150mgs via oral gel-cap on empty stomach.


Head tingled pleasantly for hours, felt stimmed, good mood, nice warm sweats. 5 hours long.

No nausea, no bad feelings except slight jaw tension eased by chewing gum. Eyes dilated, no euphoria.

quite the mixed reactions.  i always had intense euphoria lasting 2-3 hours followed by mild stimulation for another 2-3.  that was 100mg during the beginning.


tolerance grew and multiple doses per day was the norm.  probably 150 to 200mg per dose, it did increase from there but i wont get into that.


definitely start at 100mg i would suggest at first.  without tolerance that would do just fine.

IMO 100mgs is a little to high for someones first time. My sweet spot is 90mgs and thats with tolerance. I took about 110mgs my first time and I had a great time but it was a little too intense. While my experience is not typical as Im sensitive to all stims I still think 50-75mgs is a good place to start testing the waters.

Id say its a matter of dosage. But taking an average dose of lets say 125mg id say the tolerance is minimal. Maybe a little bit less seretogenic activity due to depleation but not more...

Yeah, they both would be pretty average doses, maybe only 100mg the first time and then 125 the next weekend. 


Also does 4-FA have any cross-tolerance with MXE or the NBOMes?

IME there is no perceptible tolerance between just two doses spaced out by a week, especially if they're your first trials with this substance. As long as you don't binge or go overboard with it then you shouldn't encounter any tolerance issues.

Oral using gelcap on empty stomach:

150mgs - stimulation

60mgs 1 hour later - depression spiraling into rage


No euphoria whatsoever. Clearly, cross-tolerance & over-use are taking a toll.

At the very beginning of my 4-FA trials, I found 4-FA to be a fantastic substance for a club/dance setting or even a more down-tempo show/concert where people are "grooving" as opposed to "raging". Nice empathic qualities boost socialization, music appreciation greatly enhanced, energy and dancing both elevated for many hours, but never once have a I felt overwhelmed or out of my element on this substance.


Since first discovering 4-fa 6 months ago, however, I've used it at least once or twice a week almost continously, with a few breaks in there of 1-2 weeks, and almost all of the empathic or mdma-esque qualities have long since vanished. Now, 4-fa provides elevated energy levels, better interpersonal skills, and, interestingly enough, still provides enhanced music appreciation IME even though the other serotogenic qualities are not produced anymore.


I ran out of 4-fa this past weekend, don't have another en route and given that shipping times from my most trusted vendor are averaging at least 2 weeks lately ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

i miss this substance myself.  looking forward to the summer (after this never ending semester ends) to get back to work.


im very interested in trying 2-FMA.  this substance (4-FA) was originally bought as a study aid.  didnt really help at all, in fact i felt so good and comfortable that i felt i didnt need to study... oops.  from what i hear 2-FMA is much more study-oriented.  perhaps i should stock up for the fall semester.

So experimented once again with this one last night .


125mg with a 25 mg redose about 1-1.5 hours later.


It makes me super sexual , like coke. I don't have tons of stim experience but both Cathinone's I've tried (pent & 4-mec) did not have this effect in the slightest. Likely because both were super fiendish and left me in a bad state of anxiety. 


This is the first time (3 prior experiences) that I felt the urge to redose. I capped another 25-3O mg about 3 hours in , and took it with me out to meet a lady friend. Never ended up taking it though.


Went & seen a movie , which is something I could never do on a euphoria based stim , I can't even manage to pay attention or feel comfortable watching a flick at home if I was on say .5 gram cocaine and I'd be a wreck in public off a binge type dose (which is how it always ends up & I've halted use last 6 months).


I love how you can be fairly high off 4-fa and completely hide the fact your on anything , without any effort in doing so. Lady friend was unaware of anything until after the movie when we get back to my place and I was having a little trouble functioning in bed , but I ended up pulling through and performing. 


I almost entirely swore off all stims because the ones I tried all led to compulsive dosing and comedowns from hell. 

Coke- oh god. 1/4 ounce 2 day binges

MDMA (if that's even classified as I never feel stimulated on pure molly) - no terrible comedown but compulsive the minute I decide to switch roa from oral to insuff

4-mec - can get away with 1 line and stop but that does so little for you , by the time I've done enough to get a ok buzz I'm finishing it off shortly after , comedown not terrible but still a bit unpleasant 

Pent - coke like binging and comedown from hell.


But with 4-fa like I've said before , not much desire to redose and smoothest stim comedown I've ever experienced by a long shot.


I dosed late last night , and while the comedown was not a bit unpleasant , it was nearing 4 a.m. And I wanted sleep ASAP so I dose a few mg etizolam and fell asleep easily. Good 5.5 hours uninterrupted.


Felt a bit blah in the morning , lethargic but have found 2-3 grams of kratom the morning after stim use usually picks me up real nicely.


Anyways ill quit rambling , just happy I found a stim that I leaves me satisfied without the fiendish desire to redose , bad comedown and am able to limit use 1.5-2 weeks apart.


I think in a week or so ill give it a try at 3O-5O MG one morning and see how it compares to my usual multiple red bulls or cups of coffee. 


Oh & almost talked myself into insuff 1O-15 mg even though its highly advised against. Curiosity almost got the better of me , but something in me feels like using the roa leads to compulsive dosing with other stims & the burn sounds so unpleasant so I decided not to.

I appreciate the discreet quality 4-fa possesses too, but just as a word of caution, be mindful of pupil dilation, your eyes wil betray you to people familiar with this tell-tale sign of drug use even if you aren't exhibiting any other outward signs. On quite a few occasions I've gone to use the restroom at a social event and been shocked to discover my eyes were wide velvety black orbs with barely a trace of my real eye color, but because I was usually in a dimly lit bar/nightclub I was almost never called out on it, and when I was it was by a close friend with whom I didn't mind disclosing my lovely chemically-induced state.

Smooth comedown: definitely. Smoothest comedown of all stims: quite probably. But lack of desire/compulsion to redose? This is questionable. From what I can gather from my personal experiences, those of friends I've shared 4-fa with, and the fair amount of first-hand accounts available on the interwebs, the degree of "fiending" or compulsions to redose with 4-fa depends entirely on the individual user. Many reports in this thread express similar sentiments to yours, but other researchers find binge-dosing or dosing for many days consecutively difficult to avoid, myself included. It seems that the more experience a person has with 4-fa, the more likely they are to characterize it as habit-forming or compulsive.

I'll spare you the week of waiting and tell you now, low dose 4-fa kicks the shit out of energy drinks/coffee in every way, at least IME. Very useful for a particularly long/demanding day or early morning obligations, but be careful that you don't make a habit of it. The low side-effects profile of 4-fa makes this low dose daily use tempting, at least for me. While I haven't honestly encountered many negative effects from taking one or two 60-80mg morning doses on 4-5 days in a given week, I learned the hard way that this pattern of use makes it pretty damn difficult to muster up much motivation/drive/energy when you go back to sober mornings.

To you and any other curious souls reading this- don't do it. Just don't. For me, nasal dosing brings out the worst in this relatively gentle substance, such as over-stimulation, circulatory problems, jaw-clenching, and the crashing-->redosing cycle. If you still insist on shoving this stuff up your nose, I recommend doing it in private because it will make you cry like a little kid who fell off their bike and skinned their knee, guaranteed.

Well I went against caution and went the nasal route.


The day after my post I dropped 125mg. I proceed to sniff another 15O-175 ranging from 1O-2Omg lines.

This was over a 7 hour period. I'm sure regardless this size dose is cautioned against but it was not like I dropped 3OOmg in one go.


I find the desire to redose / compulsion much greater with nasal , which I knew would be the case.


Yesterday I did 325 nasally over 6 hours. 2O-4Omg bumps roughly every half hour and then left. Returned 3 hours later and polished off my last 5Omg. So 375mg over 9ish hours.


Not happy about this. Comedown was surprisingly still easy though and not once while out for the 3 hours did I have a strong urge to get back home to my final 5Omg. It's like I can get up and leave it without much fiending but when it's there in front of me I'm very compulsive with redosing.


When I get more , and there's no doubt I will , ill take precautions so I only have X amount in my possession , X being the amount I plan to take. Although technically ill have access if I wanted to get more , I don't feel like its the type of stim ill be calling a cab to come get me and drive me to a location where I have it being held waking someone at 3 a.m to get my stash. I've done this with coke before.


I have mixed feeling about nasal vs oral to be honest , I like certain things about each route and dislike certain things. That being said anyone considering it should likely just listen to the general opinion and stick with oral.


Should also add , prior to last week the days after were just a little lethargic but no real depression like I've experienced with coke , e pills likely cut with meth and to a very lessor extent pure MDMA .. And while I can't say for sure 4-fa was the cause but 2 days after last weeks 2 consecutive days using I had some pretty soul crushing depression. It only lasted that day and the prior 4 days were a bit to much drug use. Day 1 - 4-HO-mipt , pretty intense experience day 2/3 4-fa , with etizolam , dosing to the memory loss near blackout point (didn't forget anything so to say but everything was fuzzy for next day or two) and on day 4 the day before the depression I did 15mg 4-HO-det , which I barely tripped from. I usually limit myself to 1-2 drug experiences a week , I'm not really sure what got into me but whatever. The day of the depression though I experienced sleep paralysis at about 5 a.m. (2nd time ever) which spooked me the fuck out and set the day off bad and it rained non stop. So I can't blame the 4-fa as there's so many other factors involved but figured I'd mention it as since I've quit drinking & using cocaine I'm rarely depressed so was unusual.

Does anyone know the best way to store 4-FA?  How long will it keep its potency?


Thanks.

As a Salt it should be fairly stable if kept in cold, dry and dark contiditions. I would recomend a brwonglas Vial filled with argon gas as a replacement for the "air" inside! But evan without the argon you should be ok, if kept dry, dark and cool! (Winepreserver has a high argongas part inside! you can get it off the internet)

Thanks.  Any suggestion on what is a 'cool, dry' place is?  Right now it's in a kitchen cabinet which is fine for the winter and fall ... but now that the weather is getting nicer, and the summer is around the corner, I'm thinking it may not be the best place.

Is there a difference (and if so, what?) between 4-FA and 4-FA HCL? Not too much into chemistry ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

4-fa alone can only be presumed to be the freebase, whereas the hcl is the hydrochloric salt.

Salts form when a base (NH3 is one) accepts the H+ from the acid so the acid is left with simply Cl- ion, which is electrostatically attracted to the positive -NH3+ ion which formed in 4-fa. Most freebases have lower melting points, and solubility. The salts will be more soluble, since it can dissociate into it's ions in water (the NH3+ & Cl-) and have a higher melting point, this tends to mean they can't be smoked. The salts are also more likely to be solid whereas some freebase drugs can be oily liquids.


Hopefully this is simple & accurate enough ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This is easily the best RC amphetamine out there...and alot better adderral. It's like a mix of a smooth stimulant and a light roll without much of comedown. I know people are always looking for the most euphoric stimulant out there but if you hate annoying stim. side-effects like me then 4-FA may be the best rounded stim. on the RC market right now.

Did you try doing it sublingual yet?

It burns like hell, but keeping it under the tongue for a while before swallowing with lots of water gives a nice "push" imo.

Downside is, that it's likely to destroy the outer tissue under the tongue. The day after, it will peel off.

But hey, it regenerates fast and 4-FA definitely isn't a drug for everyday use. And it sure isn't for snorting. Jesus, how can you do this to your sinuses?

Two friends & I did 150mg in capsules last night and had a great time. We went swinging and I skateboarded down a big hill which was excellent, got into some deep conversations which was thoroughly enjoyable as well. Peak was about 90 minutes then the comedown happened very gradually, felt pretty clean overall. I always have an urge to redose but this was much less fiendish than other substances and I didn't end up redosing. Went to sleep at 2am (7 hours after ingestion).

The body high isn't as intense as MDMA or methylone, not even close actually. But it's still very pleasant and the minimal side effects are a plus.

Has anyone tired a moderate dose of 4-fa combined with a moderate dose of MDMA? I am one of those people who enjoys MDMA but feels it lacks energy and push, I was hoping some 4-fa would add that.

4-FA is very euphoric and only slightly to moderately stimmy so IMO not too good to combine with MDMA, also a waste of 4-FA which works great by itself.

**Weird adderall cross-tolerance?**


So I did 150mg 4-fa on Friday which I posted here about. On Monday I took adderall for work, a 30mg XR and a 10mg IR at the same time, which is my usual dose I take sometimes for a 9 hour shift. I didn't feel the adderall at all. I've had times where I take adderall 2 days in a row and even though I don't get the same boost the second day, I still notice certain side effects. This time there was absolutely nothing; I even ate a fat burrito during lunch, something that is usually impossible. Any ideas about this? Is this related to the 4-fa or no? I didn't take anything else over the weekend. Would not expect this type of thing to be possible 3 days after dosing.

So I recently obtained a gram of this stuff and was thinking of test driving a low dose tomorrow (~40mg?) to see how I react to it and using approx. 140-150mg on thursdaynight at a party. Would this be a good idea or should I just stick to using it on thursday?

So I took a test dose of ~40mg today (sketchy scales, will be getting new one this week) and must say I am quite pleased with the results. About an hour after ingesting it I felt a subtle but definite urge to go 'do' stuff. 

Slightly high feeling, pleasurable and energetic. I read somewhere someone described 4-FA as a smooth, velvety stimulant and I quite agree.

True. Replacing them with 4-FA too often doesn't seem like a good idea to me but I feel it can be useful on certain days. Looking forward to upping the dose on thursday ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This is by far my favorite stim but apparently I just don't possess the willpower to leave it laying around. Even with every day use I can achieve a nice roll, although once tolerence set in I had to increase my dose by 50%(100mg to 150mgs) but it still felt great without too many negative side effects. Is it safe to say I'm due for some massive serotonin depletion? As much as I love this one I guess Im going to have to call it quits since responsible use does not seem to be an option.

I'm assuming you switch to nasal dosing in the pm for shorter duration to allow for sleep, and I'm wondering roughly how long after insufflating a dose is sleep achievable with and without sleep aids (benzos, mary jane, etc.)?

Naah don't think so. Commercial energy drinks are safer for everyday use as the effects are very well known. I don't know where you live but over here you have exact content written on the can. Most energy drinks are stimulating thanks to caffeine and taurine only and these 2 substances are known to be safe on heart in usual doses. 

While taking potentially euphoric stim, even in non-euphoric doses every day is way to hell IMO. 


Have an important exam and haven't sleep at all? Sure, take 20-40mg 4-FA it will help nicely. But I wouldn't do it more frequently than once per 1-2 weeks.


I've already read at least 2 reports that everyday taking of 4-FA leads to high blood pressure, much much faster than high doses of caffeine.

I took 125mg yesterday I felt a little euphoria for 45 min the majority of it was stimulation.  how much should I take this weekend?  200mg a safe dose? 

also has anyone taken phenibut or some kind of benzo on it? some of you are talking about lying down in a euphoric state nodded off how do I achieve that?

Had my first proper experience with this substance last thursday after a small testing dose half a week before that. 100mg with a 40mg redose 2 hours later.. Loved it! Talkative, energetic, horny as fuck lol. Definitely a keeper. I'm thinking of using it again in about two weeks at a rave, and then using MDMA exactly one week later. Since both play around with serotonine but 4-FA to a lesse extent, any hints on how much this will influence the MDMA experience? People on here who have used these two compounds in this fashion?

That doesn't say anything about how dangerous it is in the long run.  I really bet 4-FA is better for you than all those phenethylamine analogs.    They have analogs of meth where the alpha methyl is instead at the beta position, and that is in weight training products and energy drinks.

I've used 4-fa a week before an MDMA experience and although the mdma was a fun experience it was also clear that the my body was not fully mended from the 4-fa. Basically I was in a great mood but not euphoric, I was more appreciative of others but I wasn't overcome with empathy for all people, music sounded great but not magical. 


The way I see it, 4-fa is a intriguing, very fun and potentially rewarding substance, but it is definitely not worth dampening the magic of a roll. If i'm going to commit a flood of neurotransmitters to an ecstasy experience I don't want it to be lackluster.

125 to 200 is a HUGE jump from a harm reduction standpoint in my opinion. If it doesn't hospitalize you it will definitely leave you hella overstimulated for at least 12 hours.


 Last year after using 4-fa several times in a month my standard dose of 120mg ceased to deliver the (mild) empathic and entactogenic effects I had come to enjoy so much. I upped it to 130 the next time with minimal change in effects, and so I got impatient and leapt up to 240mg (160mg + 80mg at T+00:45), a decision which caused me to violently vomit from being so overstimulated and dehydrated. 


This was one of two times in 7ish years of extensive drug use that I genuinely feared for my life, and the other time was after going on a cocaine & mdma binge with coke was mixed with ketamine (a detail my "buddy" forgot to tell me until after the fact). Point being, 4-FA is relatively benign at reasonable doses but push it too far and it will push back.


In your case, I'd recommend upping your dose by 25mg until you find what you're looking for, but I wouldn't be surprised if 150 proves to be enough, for me 120mg is just a little too weak for my tastes but 140 is perfect.

The dose makes the poison.  If we're comparing 3 Monster Energy drinks in a day vs. 30-40 mg of 4-FA, the 4-FA would probably be less taxing on the body.  Caffeine overdose is a real thing and can be fatal.

Tried this for the first time last night 130mg altogether and I must say the euphoria is amazing.

I really enjoyed 4-fa

I have used somewhere on the order of 25 grams of 4-fa in the last 3-4 months.  I was using it daily for two weeks but it is an intoxicant, and it caused me to make poor choices at work and during a very important phone interview.  I now only use it on weekends.  Without a proper scale, it is hard for me to judge doses, but I would guess 300-500mg sipped over 8 hours(could be more, the rate at which I have consumed the weighted bags indicates more).


When I do my weekly Friday night into Saturday binge, I get a "rebound" blood pressure issue(the longer the binge the worse the effects)  When I stand up I nearly faint.  This can go on for 6 or more hours, and I have learned to use pilot's g-lock techniques to stay conscious.  Prior to that I had to walk around with my torso lowered to keep my blood flowing where it needs to.  Once I am up and acclimated, I am good until I bend over for something or sit etc. During the week, I use nothing other than caffeine and nicotine.


One more noted effect, I will get sleep paralysis bouts the second or third night after a binge.  The first time scared the hell out of me, but fortunately I recalled seeing a documentary on it which calmed me down(took an hour) after what initially seemed to be one hellacious ghost/demonic encounter which is really hard for an atheist to come to grips with.  With a little googling I had found that amp's and MDMA etc can induce sleep paralysis after a comedown.  


I am concerned to say the least, and often google to see how many people offer similar experiences... there are only a few mentionings of fainting.


One more thing, it tears my stomach up something terrible.  I get nausea the next day and a very unsettled feeling in my stomach.  I have a strong constitution and nearly never vomit, 4-fa doesn't take me that far, but it is far from comfortable the next day.

I was  just reading back through the thread, and this is the only time I saw this particularity mentioned. It does happen to me, the worst with amphetamine, but my throat already feels a bit scratchy (@30 hrs. in) from the 4-FA.


I think this occurs from not eating, but it's bizarre - it can occur in less then 15-20 hrs. Drinking fluids doesn't seem to prevent this irritation from occurring. All anorexic stimulants seem to have this effect on me. I found some people on message boards for ADD describing a similar occurrence, but couldn't find more information.


And if you eat something it can start to hurt a bit, but it is all raw, so if you keep eating it can become astoundingly painful! This irritation often leaves as fast as it comes, when it is at it's worse, I find it helpful to chew food far better than normal, and eat slowly, if it gets too bad, just drink cold water and wait a bit..


EDIT: Let me just emphasize, holy shit, how much it hurts. I chewed a handful of roasted peanuts and bam it rubbed my throat, and after that every swallow was shooting pain until I sipped on some milk. I think the thickened secretions from the milk helps to coat your throat, and helps with the pain. I think I need to eat something less abrasive slowly, the soarness goes away as fast as it comes. Anyone know exactly why this occurs?


I think this "fainting" is really orthostatic hypotension, at least it is for me, but it happens from standing too quickly, not the opposite. It has to do with the systems meant to release pressors to rapidly change blood pressure, and them either lagging or getting out of sync (due to the profound vascoconstricting effects of these drugs


The maneuvers you are doing do similar things to these pressors, mainly making sure that blood doesn't all the suddenly leave your head and you pass out. I don't know which variables are responsible, but I've binged for a good day and a half and I don't have it right now. The other day I took 60mg and felt it pretty strongly almost immediately with little euphoria. 


I dunno what that means.


I get it too... some times, but only very mildly. I won't ever come close to fainting, but if I stand up quickly on stimulants I can get a little light headed and dizzy. I have never experienced sleep paralysis, ever - with or without drugs.

Hey there, I have a question about a dosing low just to give an evening an extra boost. First off, I have extensive experience with d-amp and racemic amph, and I've taking 4-FA on quite a few occasions. However, I always used to dose at around 120-150mg to get the real experience from it. Tonight I was contemplating taking 2 50mg caps with me. It's not my intention to tweak out as the situation doesn't call for that in my opinion, but I would like to feel a bit of the energy and feeling of wellbeing without it dominating my state of mind. Would you guys say 50mg would be a good dose for this, or should I be thinking about 65-70mg?


Edit: In case anyone is interested in low doses of 4-FA, I'll post a small update. Dropped the first 50mg which resulted in some energy and talkativeness and just a general happy state of being, without any physical or mental discomfort during and after. Another 1.5h in I dropped the second  dose and it pretty much prolonged it while not intensifying it noticeably. Overall a very pleasant and mild experience. I've heard it being used as a substitute for mdma in combination with methylone. This is something I haven't done yet seeing as mdma has not been hard to get, nor do I really have much interest in because I might as well take the real thing then. Each time I drop 4FA I am pleasantly surprised by how gentle and pleasant 4FA is compared to regular amphetamine and mdma. Up untill now every dose up to 180mg has been very enjoyable. I only use mdma once every 2 months and have done it a lot more in the past so unfortunately it has kind of lost it's magic for me, nor do I feel the need to roll hard nowadays. I highly appreciate 4FA's sane state of happiness. For smaller events I'll definitely start bringing it along more. 


I have no comedown whatsoever from higher doses, but some friends argue they suffer more from it than they do on mdma. I find it hard to imagine.

For me, 4-fa is a bitch regarding the hangover. The first day after a binge isn't too bad, probably because of its long halflife. The real comedown kicks in on day 2-4. Anyone else experienced this?

I usually stick to 40-60mg for scenarios such as the casual night you describe. At 80mg and above it is usually apparent to my close friends who know me well that I'm not just sipping beer, and it's always better to underdose and have a calmer night than overdose and wind up with dilated pupils in a casual social setting. Also, oral dosing only, I know that's what you did but for anyone wondering, insufflating this stuff is WAY too speedy for mild experiences.

My use of 4FA is pretty much in line with the amounts you described, and dizziness/vertigo has definitely been a problem for me during periods of extended use. Also, the sleep paralysis you mention has only happened to me a few times in the past several months but is as terrible as you describe and definitely connected to 4FA overuse. Not since I was a child have I felt such pure, blinding fear as when I slipped into the paralysis.

Sleep paralysis is most likely from you lying as still as possible trying to sleep for extended periods of time. When you do exactly that (which is a method for entering lucid dreams), you body WILL go into sleep paralysis.


Definitely scary. I've experienced it multiples times sober before... My only recommendation to avoiding it is to never lay completely still for a very long time, hoping to fall asleep. It usually ends in sleep paralysis. I know it isn't always avoidable, but just a suggestion. 


From sleep paralysis it is very possible to induce a lucid dream, but it takes some practice. Google it if your curious.

Hey everyone, bit of a dumb question but I'm going to be taking 4FA for the first time this weekend (hink I'll start around 125mg) and I was wondering if I should go for snorting or oral? For some reason I haven't been able to find info on which is more potent. Also does 4FA burn like a bitch if snorted?

I disagree, in this instance it appears to be serotonin depletion related.  MDMA will cause this too, and it doesn't happen the first night you sleep, but usually the second.  Also, when I am trying to sleep and I am having a bout I can have upwards of 10 SP episodes.  Anecdotal reports state that taking melatonin will supplement for your serotonin/melatonin deficiency.

After bingeing for several days I'm starting to get a strange tingling sensation on the top of my head, since this always happens right when the effects start to manifest I assume it has something to do with serotonin being released. Has anyone else experienced this?

Any and all stims can do this.  For me it is a pleasant scalp tingling,  it remind me of the meditative state I get into when I get a "sensual" haircut.  Some of those lovely ladies...


It happens when it kicks in, to me it feels more related to adrenaline.   I have gotten it on 

MDMA, speed/adderall/etc, pseudo-ephedrine,   Mildly with nicotine/caffiene.

Well generally speaking any stimulant binge will result in a pretty nasty comedown. Also, since this does release serotonin, I could see it causing problems for a few days.

Really? I usually get pretty tired after about the 7-8th hour after taking it, which I always thought was weird no other stim does that to me. Idk benzos and opiates are the only thing that can really help stim comedowns. Never experienced any type of next day hangover with 4-fa either, though I never really do it more than 2 days in a row usually.

I have only ever stayed up single nights on 4-fa, and yes, somehow, even when high as shit you can still sleep.  BUT, if you stay at recreational doses it may cause your blood pressure to drop like crazy when you rebound, and after the second night's sleep is when SP will most likely hit if it will.


I am serious when I say me, a grown man was scared shitless.  I felt like I was 7  and alone in the dark.  If someone else had been there, I can't imagine how things would have turned out, as I would have been saying some seriously fucked up shit.  Luckily I figured out what it was.

I've done it twice, I pick up the pills from a smartshop in amsterdam. I can only find it in one smartshop that I go to, so it's pretty rare. The first time I did it was in the morning on a day when nothing was really happening. I took 2 pills after breakfast and I came up in about an hour, I had a great day. After the 3-ish hour peak when I was chilling to music and stuff in my room (although it does have that speed-y feel where you want to do stuff, so I was playing music while doing laundry and cleaning and stuff), I had a great mood for the rest of the day, no noticeable buzz but just a highly elevated mood.

There wasn't much of a nasty comedown.


The second time I did 2 pills again, and I was with my friend who also took 2 pills. It felt more euphoric than the last time but the comedown was a little nasty. It lasted well into the next day, I felt pretty moody and depressed and had some mild mood swings, and had trouble sleeping for the next 2 nights. It was almost worth it, since I had such a great experience when peaking with my friend, but the next 2 days were annoying.


Considering possibly doing it again, depending what my scenario is.

people who have experience with quality speed - which one would you prefer - i dont want to take full dose of 4-fa to feel its seretogenic effects, just need some stimulation and mood lift and i have option either do 4-fa or speed. which one is easier on the body, has gentier come down and couses less jitterness? from what i gather 4-fa seems like a winner but i would really aprreciate more advice. cheers.

In lower end doses and If you know the additives in the speed I'd always take the good speed.  4-fa is great to  but for me I'd say a more sociable experience  but way more taxing and longer lasting then speed

I´m going on a party tomorrow and thinking about taking around 100mg 4-fa there. Im not urging for a hard buzz but more for a gentle stimulation, that puts me in a good mood and keeps me going through the night. If I drop it at midnight, i should be good for the next 7 or 8 hours, right?

Is the risk of overheating/hyperthermia greater than of mdma or speed?

My alternative substance would be amphetamine or meth, but i think the 4-fa puts a little more empathy and mellowness into the buzz.


@gaktattak:

how bad is this low-blood-pressure-thing compared to amphetamine or mdma? I often have this on the next day, that i wake up, feeling relativly fine, but when i get up, i start to feel really dizzy and nauseus.

100mg of 4-fa should work for about 3-5 hours at most. 8 hours is meth territory. It is a fantastic party drug in my experience, meth is just too strong and not so empathic. Overheating seems comparable to mdma to me, not really any worse.

I am up and running for 8h with 100mg. 4h with a lot of happy feelings then about 30mins of low time where I don't feel to pumped or happy just to get back to 3-4h of energy and residual stimulation. Not in a bad way but in a good way.

To be honest, it can be debilitating for me, but I am an atypical user.  I generally IV, and only IV on Friday nights, and do basically 2 shots at 200mg/ish.  It now makes me vomit.  


I will feel light headed Monday morning from my Friday-Saturday dosing.  The most severe effects were from large oral dosing over 8 hours or more.


As far as speed and MDMA, I used crystal for months, but I never let myself get nearly as high as I do on 4fa, as I need my sleep.  For me to get as high on crystal as I do on 4-fa, I would imagine it would take 2-3 days before I could sleep.  I NEVER had this sensation on any other drug.


For me, the greatest similarity is that I go on marathon porn binges.  


It could be due to quantity, or the product I happen to have.  My product, from the same manufacturer, one bag is white to clear in the spoon, one bag has a brown tinge in solution.  I have no explanation for the variation, or what is actually in there.  Unfortunately this is all pretty uncharted territory.


I do have my fears after reading about phen-fen.

Does anyone ever get weird memory blanks on 4-FA? I've noticed when I've been taking it for a few hours & redosing regularly, I'll start doing/saying weird stuff without having any awareness of it. What happens a lot is I'll just be talking to someone online, open my eyes and see that I've written out a completely meaningless and incomprehensible sentence without having any memory of it. Happens when I'm talking to people face to face as well ofc. Obviously this isn't really the best side effect ever so I was wondering if anyone had any similar experience/any ideas as to what that is exactly...? ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

So I've recently taken to snorting small (tiny, really) doses of 4-FA and find it FAR more addictive via this ROA.  The euphoria is much greater, but the burn makes it not worth it in the end.  I burned through 2 grams by snorting before I even knew what happened.  Nose bleeds are surprisingly less severe than with mephedrone, but the pain is unreal.  I stayed up for 48 hours snorting whereas I can sleep normally on oral doses.  


Just a PSA for the curious.

^Yeah I agree about snorting being much more addictive...managed to snort every half hour for two days a few weeks ago, even with my nose bleeding at the same time. My eyes were just crying automatically the whole time, not a pretty sight ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I've heard some people actually find the oral effects just as nice though so I'm hoping one day I'll learn to enjoy them more or something...

@Pagey I found snorting too harsh but enjoyable, oral to be too slow onset and gradual to really get a kick so I started plugging it. Still get a great breathless rush, the high seems to last a fair while and had limited urge to redose, maybe once after 3-4 hours. So yeah you should put it up your bum, and probably post pics just so we can check your technique.

^I'd say 50mg is too low for amazing sex, that's threshold value for any real euphoria, with doses under 40mg being mostly productive high with almost no euphoria and sex improvement. 

You should go for for 90-120mg (with no tolerance) orally.

IME 80-100mgs is perfect for making love. I still get very aroused on doses above 100mgs but it can literally take hours to achieve an orgasm. This is by far my favorite drug for marathon love making.

If I were to take 100mg, would my partner suspect me of 'being on sutin' ?

I've noticed when I've been taking it for a few hours & redosing regularly, I'll start doing/saying weird stuff without having any awareness of it. What happens a lot is I'll just be talking to someone online, open my eyes and see that I've written out a completely meaningless and incomprehensible sentence without having any memory of it. Happens when I'm talking to people face to face as well ofc. Obviously this isn't really the best side effect ever so I was wondering if anyone had any similar experience/any ideas as to what that is exactly...? ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Yes, 4-FA causes word recall problems for me and I find myself forgetting what I wanted to say/do.  I imagine there's some amount of neurotoxicity as with MDMA, but it feels FAR less severe.  (I've used 4-FA very frequently--almost daily--for almost 2 years now.  Bad, I know.  But I haven't noticed any serious mental/physical problems yet).  Taking a break of 2-4 days restores my memory to tip-top shape.

What? I bet more than half of all bluelighters either had or still have to hide the full extent of their drug use from their partners. Some partners are just not tolerant to drugs, and I know if I had to choose between admitting my drug use and losing my beloved partner OR continue hiding it from her (because it currently does not interfere with my quality of life and am no addict), surely the latter.


To answer velmwend's question. 4-FA is probably one of the best drugs to take if you want to feel high and yet look normal. It's possible to not look physically tweaked on 100+mg, problem could be dilated pupils though.

I can pass for sober on 80mgs other than being abnormally talkative. 100mgs and up leaves me with dilated pupils and terrible cotton mouth which are usually a dead give away. I always bought a big bag of jolly ranchers when I received my 4-FA, they were the only thing that helped with my dry mouth

I have a friend on 10mg/day celexa.  We took 4-fa this last weekend, which i thought would be safe since he has supposedly taken mda while on celexa without incident.  My gal and I ate about 140mg, and just to be safe my buddy started off with only 75mg.  He quickly got quite a bit higher than us, and his high gradually progressed to something resembling serotonin syndrome - he became very feverish and sweaty, spaced out, his heart rate was definitely faster than it should have been for that dosage, and he vomited several times throughout the evening.  His reaction was idiosyncratic, to say the least, and we have now concluded that this is **not a safe combination!**  If he had taken as much as us, we probably would have spent the evening in a hospital.  

Just want to get the word out so this doesn't happen to anyone else.  We thought it would be fine since 4-fa seems like a milder serotonin releaser than something like mda (which didn't cause this kind of reaction for him), but for whatever reason, it did not combine safely with celexa for him.

Or a few days of him not even awake, just surviving on oxygen,fluids,and plenty of other stuff being pumped into him...

Even if you have taken anything that releases serotonin and you are on Celexia, or **ESPECIALLY AN MAOI** Before and had no problems, **NO MATTER HOW LOW THE DOSE IS **,   **DON'T DO IT!**

I was going to make a new thread about this, but thought I'd better ask here and see if anyone has covered this yet: Has anyone discovered a way to buffer the caustic effects of 4FA on sensitive tissues? I've heard reports of ulcers after long-term oral use, and have seen it cause damage (unknown whether this damage is temporary or not at this point..) to the rectum and seminal vesicles of those plugging it for over a week. 


A friend of mine is coming across a rather large amount, and we're going to be flooded with it for quite awhile, and in the interest of harm reduction I was hoping to figure out how to offset the caustic effects of 4FA with some kind of buffer - similar to how baking soda can buffer acidic substances. 


I've noticed that vaping the 4FA is the only ROA that hasn't caused noticeable irritation after prolonged use.. any thoughts?

Rectal use of 4fa and 4fma both were irritating. I think the best bet is to parachute them orally no chemical burn.


In order to do what you are proposing, you must find the pH of a 4FA soltuion, and then balance it to neutral human levels (whatever the ph blood range). I happen to think that this not a pH imbalance, and is merely the caustic properties of the chemical. If you find it is a pH differential, just measure and neutralize! 


But really, I recommend it orally, not as quick come, a bit smoother, and it lasts longer.

I've also heard that stomach ulcers have resulted from long-term oral use - and this was after consuming 13g in a year apparently. I could see us exceeding that amount, and in less time. 

I've never actually eaten it :D - just haven't ever preferred my stimulants that way - and with frequent use, tolerance goes up fast, and more effective efficient means of ingestion are sought after. 


I'm interested to know more about whether 4FA burns due to pH, or due to the caustic properties of the chemical. It's not a fluoride burn is it? As I understand it, the F is covalently bonded to the phenyl group. It does not come off, meaning that the drug is most likely excreted unchanged. Therefor no fluoride is absorbed by the body. Can it still burn like fluoride though? I'm sadly lacking in my chemistry knowledge.


Apparently Calcium Gluconate is the antidote to Fluoride burns, if one survives them :S

The fluoride is bound intensely to the molecule. It is probably not responsible for the burning sensation.


Caustic and Ph balance are interrelated. , Caustic means high pH number, meaning strong base. Low pH numbers mean acidity  .


Best way to find out is dissolve 4-fa in water, and get a few narrow band pH strips, and see if it is particularly caustic or acidic.


Honestly, I think that his stomach ulcers may have resulted elsewhere, or the 4-fa potentiated them.


I doubt 4-fa dissolved in water and swallowed has any too negative effects on the stomach and it's lining. But if you find out if it is acidic or caustic, that could be a reason, and neutralizing it would make it safer to ingest.

Thank you! After speaking with one of my friends, it seems that the bleeding he experienced from the plugging has stopped, and perhaps resulted from damage created while 'cleaning' the area for proper administration. After taking several days off from plugging or using 4FA (except for a very low dose plug yesterday), he still reports sharp pains down there occasionally, and are the same pains which would arise after plugging (albeit much more intensely) - but it is unknown whether the pain is related to the drug, or is related to damage created during cleaning which is aggravated by the drug. Pain does not necessarily equal tissue damage; perhaps agonism of nerve receptor sites by the drug. 

I should also mention that he wasn't plugging large amounts - perhaps 30 mg at a time, several times a day for a week at a time, with several days off inbetween, over a period of several weeks. 


He also apparently tried IV once, and being inexperienced in this, ended up getting it under the skin rather than in the vein. He used maybe 20 mg for this, and while it stung for several hours at the site of administration, he eventually felt quite a buzz and a slight rush at first - despite having been using 4FA for almost a week in a row already, and reporting diminished effects. 

He doesn't plan on trying IV again though, due to the difficulty of administration and feeling uncomfortable with that ROA, as well as the dubious nature of this chemical in relation to it's effects on tissues.


We'll definitely look into pH testing as soon as possible ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

4-fa can be much different depending on dose and roa. When you eat it, its not as stimulating and gives more of a body high that's ever so slightly comparable to mdma but not nearly as in your face, and requires a bit of something else to go with it to get the natural flow of conversation to start off. these are on oral dose 120-140mgs, I usually keep redosing for a bit though with lower doses to keep the slightly euphoric easy going feeling, I would not consider it a functional stim at those doses with going the oral route.. Snorting it though, be prepaired to burn your nose, with this route you can take much lower doses 50mgs or so up to near 100mgs and feel a empty yet undeniable drive or stimulation, I guess this is where the comparisons to adderal come from, I hate adderal, that's why I was so surprised when I got the effects I did when I ate 4-fa. Snorting you can go as high as oral but it will be much shorter and will be all stimulation with some nice body feelings here and there and can be somewhat compulsive, but that seems to go with most things while putting them up your nose as apposed to other routes. All in all to me, 4-fa has its uses and can surprise you and be quite a euphoric tool, but Its not something I would rant and rave about. Weed does make the experience much better though.


I should also add its pretty easy going as a stim is concerned reguardless of roa compared to some other stims, of course if you've been using all throughout the day a benzo is a good thing to have to fall back on, but either way there is very little in the way of comedown.

I always noticed that mixing it half half with baking soda reduced much of the burn.


Also pre-wetting the inside of your nose with a water dropper reduces the burn...


But really it's a waste to insuffilate. it's best to eat 4fa it has the best effects this way and best bioavail.

Just wanted to thank you for this lil dose of reality, regardless of how a substance enhances (or hinders) you sexually, hiding the fact that you're on drugs from someone who allows you to be so close to them is questionable IMO. Ask this question: would this person still consent to having sex with me if they knew what I'd taken?

Small dose experience with daily 18 mg Concerta and 100 mg Sertraline.


4 hours after breakfast, 50 mg 4-FA oral. Smooth, nice effects, feels stronger than when taking without Concerta that day. Not dissimilar from 36 mg Concerta but more euphoric, slightly less jittery, not overwhelming. Good because this was just for a pick-me-up and productivity booster. Worked well for that. Could go higher but that would probably be a bit too euphoric for work.


Still concerned about possible serotonergic effects with the Sertraline so wouldn't do this too often at all. After-effects: a bit anxious but not too bad. Some feelings of tension along the spine. Will pop 0.5 mg etizolam before the next meeting. I keep feeling like some cannabis will make me feel just fine right now, so that's on the agenda for later :D

200mgs 4-FA gelcap on a hungry stomach.

1 hour in (6pm), pupil-dilation, stimmy energy (warm, sweaty). Reversed my anti-social mood to one of being almost excited to socialise.

Next few hours I am chatty (not always a positive thing, as occasionally I end up just blithering), no longer tired. Jaw tension - chew gum. Decide to spice the night with 20mgs of 2C-C - but to no obvious effect at all.

Next few hours no longer as interested in people. Would dance if the music was attuned to my taste, but isn't. Go home with girlfriend. Despite the drop in energy, have long, lovely sex. I eat at 5am then go to sleep with a benzo at 6am.

Tired next day but not low - only 5 hours of good sleep had, 2 hours dozing until the afternoon. No aches except for around my neck - not so bad.


At that dose I was expecting euphoria. I also expected something from the 2C-C.

100 mg 4-FA in gel cap a couple hours after a light meal produced some mild euphoria but nothing too crazy, strong urge to talk shit with random people (more interested in talking than dancing) at club.  


Took 2 hours to reach peak, which lasted about 1.5-2 hours, then got very tired and somewhat impatient with people + felt effects from alcohol.  


Dry mouth was the most severe of any substance consumed and nothing could quench it - I must have drunk 2 L of water at the club.  


Went home and to bed, slept poorly, felt tired but not ill or unhappy the next day.  I think this would be a good festival drug as long as I had an endless supply of water and/or hard candies!

4-FA has been a favorite of mine for a while.


Snorting burns pretty badly but no crazy sores or bloody crystalline shit the next day like ethylphenidate. Comes on fairly intensely when snorted and has a very twitchy "too much Adderall" kinda feel. Not a whole lot of euphoria when snorted as well.


I've found 125mg in a gel cap to be ideal. Really smooth almost sneaky come up that takes between 30 minutes and an hour. You'll be sitting around talking almost forgetting that you've taken it and then you'll suddenly realize, "Holy shit...I feel amazing."


Lacks a lot of the things I dislike in some stims. You're not too amped up, no crazy blabbermouth, no uncomfortable overly stimulated body buzz, no or at least minimal teeth grinding, pretty much zero come down aside from it taking a little bit longer to fall asleep than usual. There's no fiending urge to redose. Pupils are usually quite dilated so people in the know will definitely see you're on something. Aside from being a little cloudy the next day I'm usually feeling pretty good. 


Not a super long peak but more than enough for a night out. Probably 2-3 maybe 4 hours max. Very, very, very sexual and no erectile issues at all which is a very nice fringe benefit. Prepare for some of the best sex of your life.


Combined a 125mg cap with a small line of M1 about an hour after eating the cap and there weren't really any fireworks but it gave it a nice kick. No negative side effects as a result of mixing as far as I could tell. Strangely enough I actually woke up the next day feeling fucking fantastic.

Theese 2 substances are lika day and night when it comes to snorting. Snorting coke is bliss, no pain at all, instead strong numbing (when clean coke, that is) while 4-FA is POWDERED PAIN. Not recommended at all for snorting, it works great orally.

quick question:

is 2 days enough time for tolerance after a 4fa oral dose to diminish?


long story: a friend and me have used 4fa today orally (120mg me, 100+50 redose at t+2h him). we would like to use it again on NYE party but might look for alternatives should tolerance persist too much. in which case, we are open to suggestions. we dont want to get too mashed up, nothing too obvious to sober people, but still in a nice euphoric, energetic kind of place for at least 4 hours. so far the best alternative might be 2fma with mdma comboed after the first couple of hours. personally i think the 4fa might work as well, though at slightly higher doses... however, i also believe that with increased dose to cover for tolerance the sideeffects might also be more present.

4-fa is a good working man's stim. But for pure euphoria I find 4-mec superior.  I have been doing 4-mec for months now everyday and love the pure bliss it gives me. You can not work on 4-mec the euphoria is to powerful.  I do like 4-fa just to take while I'm working but when I get home I find myself in a hurry to get to 4-mec it has a huge impulsive urge to redose if I don't watch myself I could easily do a gram + in a day like I have before. Even though I like my stims I'm far more addicted to my opiates.

I know I'm in the minority on this, but I find insufflating 4-FA very worthwhile.  It burns - a lot - but if you can handle 2 minutes of sharp pain and eye watering, it goes away quickly.  I only purchase 4-FA once in a while and tend to go through a fair amount in one sitting and I enjoy eating bombs every 4 hours or so and snorting much much smaller lines intermittently.  You do get more mileage from oral dosing as the duration is much better but I find insufflating to provide more rushy/speedy effects that I enjoy.  I much prefer combining oral and nasal dosing than either on its own.
