**Lysergic acid morpholide** (also known as **N-Morpholinyllysergamide** , and **LSM-775** ) is a novel synthetic research [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) chemical class that produces a generally similar albeit significantly less psychoactive array of [LSD-like](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD#Subjective_effects) [psychedelic effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic#Subjective_effects) when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is a close structural homolog of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) known mainly for its obscurity, low relative potency, and a few comments that have been made on the "dream-like" sedation it produces as well as potential [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and other potentially uncomfortable physical effects.

LSM-775 was first investigated in animal models in 1957, where it was observed to be "qualitatively similar to LSD" albeit with a significantly lower potency and "half the duration". It was later briefly described as one of the many analogs of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"), in which he mentions conflicting reports, with one stating that "75 micrograms is an effective dose, comparable to a similar dose of LSD, and the other stating that "between 350 and 700 micrograms was needed" while producing "fewer signs of cardiovascular stimulation and peripheral toxicity." Since then, it has been observed that the latter observation is a more accurate description of LSM-775's potency in humans, meaning it possesses about 1/10th the potency of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of LSM-775, and it has very little history of human usage. It has recently appeared on the market alongside [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) psychedelic [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) such as [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) , [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) and [PARGY-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PARGY-LAD) as a legal, grey-market alternative to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , and commercially distributed through online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors (although it is considered to be one of the least popular and available in the series). Despite its low observed potency relative to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , it is still highly advised to approach this unstudied [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Hallucinogens) if one chooses to use it.

## Chemistry

LSM-775, or lysergic acid morpholide, is a synthetic alkaloid of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) family. LSM-775 is a structural analog of lysergic acid, with a morpholinyl functional group bound to R N of the chemical structure. This core polycyclic structure is an ergoline derivative, and has overlapping [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) and [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) groups embedded within it (although it is principally classed as a tryptamine).

## Pharmacology

LSM-775 likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from LSM-775's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain an object of scientific elucidation.

*N* -Morpholinyllysergamide (LSM-775) is a derivative of ergine. It is less potent than LSD but is reported to have some LSD-like effects at doses ranging from 75 to 700 micrograms and a shorter duration. There are fewer signs of cardiovascular stimulation and peripheral toxicity with LSM-775 compared to LSD.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of LSM-775 can be characterized as prominent in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. Like LSD, it can behave as a fast-moving, sharp and location specific or generalized tingling sensation, although this feeling is not necessarily pleasant and often manifests in a neutral way. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different, unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most, it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This component can occur with the development of spontaneous bodily sensations.
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** 
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This component is generally mild in comparison to traditional [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** or **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)**
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)**
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is considerably less intense when compared with that of substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is an effect whose likelihood is largely extrapolated from the seizures that have been reported from the use of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . They are thought to mainly be a risk in those who are genetically predisposed to them, particularly while accompanied by physically taxing conditions such as states of dehydration, fatigue or undernourishment. The extent to which this differs from the seizure risk posed by [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) is totally unknown; however, it should be noted that there are no documented cases of seizures occurring with this compound to date. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )*
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**

- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is potentially present throughout this trip can be likely described as more similar in appearance to that of [MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MET) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be tentatively be described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, structured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it may almost consistently result in states of [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) or [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of LSM-775 can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) and [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , LSM-775 is likely able to be described as generally more [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) and fast-paced in terms of the specific style of thought stream(s) produced and contains a large number of potential effects. However, relative to other lysergamides, it has been noted as being more sedating and "dream-like", in a manner that has drawn comparisons to [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) . The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**

- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- It should be noted that these effects are the rarest and least reproducible those that can occur during a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience. They are considered unique in that that simply taking more of the substance does not necessarily increase the chance they will occur, and are said to rely more on contextual factors such as the user's [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) rather than the substance or dose itself. Their fullest manifestations are sometimes called "peak", "transcendent" or "transformative" experiences; however, they can still occur on a conceptual or cognitive level that can leave a lasting positive impact on the user.

## Combinations

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - When used in conjunction with cannabis, both the visual and cognitive effects of LSM-775 can be intensified and extended with extreme efficiency. This should be used with caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics. Many users sometimes report a dramatically more intense visual trip when combining it with [THC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/THC) concentrates such as hashish as opposed to cannabis flower. However, this can also amplify the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) producing aspects of both substances significantly, so extreme caution with this combination is advised.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When used in combination with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of LSM-775 have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone present, and more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) and [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - When used in conjunction with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of MDMA are amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of LSM-775 are also intensified with an overwhelming euphoric pleasure manifested through uniquely pleasurable body highs and headspaces, and uniquely colorful and awe-inspiring visuals. It is often recommended to wait at least three to four hours after ingesting LSM-775 to take MDMA so as to avoid coming down from the latter while peaking on the former. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable (and likely neurotoxic) [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] , and it is best to start with lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively affect a trip if taken in in moderate to dosages. This combination is however reasonably safe in low doses and when used responsibly, this can often take the edge off a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, albeit more stressful on the body.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a LSM-775 trip. They are very efficient at stopping [bad trips](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to the very high addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational LSM-775 do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because LSM-775 is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried LSM-775 suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

While no formal studies have been conducted, LSM-775 is likely not habit-forming and it is reasonable to speculate that the desire to use it can actually decrease with repeated administratinon. As with most psychedelics, it likely possesses what is considered an intrinsic, self-regulating aspect to it.

Tolerance to the effects of LSM-775 is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). LSM-775 likely presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , meaning that after the consumption of LSM-775 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of LSM-775. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .

LSM-775 is a lysergamide psychedelic with a limited history of use. It’s generally described as being less psychedelic than LSD, but it has more dream-like effects.

The drug isn’t as potent as LSD, with a common dose being around 10x that of LSD.

Nausea is a common negative effect and it can be strong enough to significantly reduce the drug’s potential pleasantness.

## Experience Reports

[Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_LSM775.shtml)

---

---

## Effects

#### Positive

- OEVs and CEVs
- Dream-like states
- Music enhancement
- Pleasant bodily sensations
- Mood lift

#### Negative

- Hypotension or Hypertension
- Dizziness
- Drowsiness
- Tachycardia
- Nausea (common)
- Vomiting
- Anxiety (possibly less than other psychedelics)

Dream-like states and sedation are produced more often with LSM-775 than with LSD, leading some users to compare it to LSA. Its sedation may be strong enough to cause light-sleep during the core experience.

The open-eye effects are sometimes similar to those of LSD, though it’s often considered weaker as a psychedelic. In some respects, given its perceptual effects and the dream-like experiences that can arise, it has dissociative features.

Nausea is quite common, often contributing to a negative body load at common doses. The body load is strong enough that a lot of users don’t continue using LSM-755.

---

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

LSM-775 is a lysergamide, placing it in the same group as LSD, LSA, and [AL-LAD](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/al-lad/) . It differs from LSD in that a morpholine moiety has replaced LSD’s diethylamine.

#### Pharmacology

5-HT2A agonism is presumably present. There may be other serotonin agonist and non-serotonin activities.

---

## History

#### 1957

A paper was published on LSM’s activity in animals and some of its pharmacology was explored. Based on this report, it was considered less potent than LSD, but capable of generating some of the same behavioral effects.

#### 1997

Alexander Shulgin gave a small description of LSM-775 in TiHKAL. It was described as LSD-like and either being similar in potency or only operating at much higher doses (350 – 700 μg).

#### 2013 – 2015

Sales in the research chemical (RC) market began around 2012 or 2013, leading to some experience reports.

#### 2016

It remains available from some vendors in the RC industry, but sales appear to be relatively low. Given the way its effects stack up against other psychedelics, including RC lysergamides, one would expect its use to be minimal.

---

## Legal Status

#### United States

Uncontrolled

---

## Safety

While little is known about the drug, current evidence indicates a common dose will be similar in psychological and physical safety to LSD. Not enough information exists to say exactly how safe it is, particularly at higher doses.

Due to this lack of information, it’s best to use the drug at the lowest possible dose, as infrequently as possible, and without combinations.

LSM-775, also known as N-morpholinyllysergamide or as lysergic acid morpholide, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

## Use and effects

LSM-775 is less potent than LSD but is reported to have some LSD-like effects at doses ranging from 75 to 700 μg and a shorter duration. It may only produce weak or threshold psychedelic effects in humans. There are claimed to be fewer signs of cardiovascular stimulation and peripheral toxicity with LSM-775 compared to LSD.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

LSM-775 is a potent full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and a potent partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It does not produce the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. However, LSM-775 can robustly increase head twitches if it is coadministered with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635. These findings indicate that serotonin 5-HT1A receptor activation suppresses the psychedelic-like effects of LSM-775.

## History

LSM-775 was first described in the scientific literature by Albert Hofmann and colleagues by 1955.
