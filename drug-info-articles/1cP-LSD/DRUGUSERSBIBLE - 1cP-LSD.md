## Subjective Experience

1cP-LSD emerged some years after my first experiments with the other lysergamides.
It appears to have been developed (again by Lizard Labs) in anticipation of the
prohibition of 1P-LSD in Germany, and it appeared on the markets circa 2019. Like
1P-LSD it is widely considered to constitute a prodrug of LSD.

As a newly developed research chemical, third party experience reports were scarce
at time of testing. However, what was available generally suggested a shorter
duration than 1p/LSD, with possibly a calmer onset and greater head clarity. They
were largely positive in nature. I also found regular suggestions that 1cP was slightly
stronger than its sister compounds.

The following paragraph as found in a Reddit post includes these themes and others:

```
"However, do feel that 1cP-LSD has an extra quality that 1P-LSD or ALD-52
is perhaps lacking. It feels more rounded, more vibrant, more intelligent. My
thoughts remain clear and I remained in command of them, easily directing
them to navigate different areas of my consciousness. The visual profile of
the trips were energetic, electric and inextricably connected to my thoughts
and fantasy within my mind.” ~ crypto1471
```
My expectations, as framed by this research, were of a very similar but shorter ride
than 1P/LSD, perhaps with greater intensity in some aspects.

Regarding dose, given the alleged relative strength, I elect to target the middle of the
common range (according to TripSit) with my first encounter. This does seem on the
low side in the context of my usual forays with 1P, but for a first experience with a
new compound it is certainly a common sense approach.

```
T+0:00 I cut a 100ug blotter into quarters and remove one of them, leaving
75 ug or so. I swill this down the hatch with a glass of water. [11:30am]
```
```
T+0:45 Having napped for about 20 minutes I awake to the beginnings of the
onset of the experience. The familiar lysergamidic headspace is emerging, with
clarity if I bring focus into play, and my vision now includes the characteristic
sheen.
```
```
T+1:00 I feel relatively at ease whilst I attempt to distinguish this from the
equivalent dose under 1P. If pushed I might suggest a more mellow
introduction. I am not enveloped by any sense of warmth at present, either
mentally or indeed physically, as I turn up the heating.
```
```
T+2:00 I feel subjectively that I am tripping reasonably solidly for a 75ug
dose of 1P, and may still be on the incline. There are suggestions of CEVs but
nothing substantive thus far, although the OEV sheen is somewhat heavier
than it was earlier.
```
```
Mentally I can drift in and out of the psychedelic aura, becoming lost when
within and quite analytical when out. Overall I do feel quite comfortable.
```
```
I feel it is probably a good time to venture outside, perhaps seeking nature.
Despite a chill in the air there is warmth in the sun when it occasionally breaks
through.
```
```
T+3:00 I walked for half an hour, during which I never quite connected with
nature and I felt largely functional, with the psychedelia pushed into the
background. However, on landing home I am partially immersed into a
drifting world of thoughts and colours. Indeed, closing my eyes the CEVs
become apparent in the form of the structured incandescently drifting of
geometric colours.
```

```
The OEV sheen is stronger than ever as the walls begin to exhibit movement:
not fully breathing but floating on delicate waves of motion. As I look through
the window, the outside world appears to be moving independently to the
interior. Items at different depths of vision move gently against each other as
though they are separate and superimposed.
```
```
I decide that this may well be stronger than a normal ride on this dose of other
lysergamides.
```
```
Another 25ug would have taken me significantly further.
```
```
All the usual physical and tactile enhancements appear to be available,
depending upon my chosen focus. This no longer feels like a trivial dose, and
possibly serves as a good introduction to the new chemical.
```
```
I sense that I am peaking. This is a very pleasing state of mind. I lie on a bed
again and slide away.
```
```
T+4:00 I awake to shake myself from slumber. The OEVs and CEVs are still
very much in play. I sense that I am commencing the comedown, certainly to
the extent that full functionality seems to be available.
```
```
I test my mental acuity with a game of bullet chess against a 2650 ranking bot
on chess.com. I make a go of it but the end-game goes pear shaped. Not the
worst performance, but the thought occurs that the development of a
dose/performance curve would be interesting, and I wonder what the optimal
dose might be.
```
```
T+5:00 I am descending pretty quickly at this point. The visuals have to all
intents and purposes subsided, and the headspace has lost its edge. However
over the next hour I still manage to cry over a two-minute movie-clip on
YouTube (of a film I’ve never seen), eat a bland meal which I convince myself
tastes sumptuous (courtesy of black pepper and some sort of creamy yoghurt
cucumber and mint dip), and burst out of the front door startling the lady
living opposite as she drives away. Finally I enjoy watching a quirky
articulation of Bayesian thinking on my PC.
```
```
T+6:00 I have now reached the dying embers and the afterglow.
```
At 10pm I retired to bed riding 0.5mg of etizolam. I awoke in the morning feeling
mentally fatigued but otherwise half-decent.

Despite the limited dose this was a good experience. I felt that it was slightly stronger
than 1P, with subtle but noticeable differences throughout, and there did seem to be
more clarity in parts; perhaps greater control. This of course is all entirely subjective.
However, I will certainly enjoy testing the remaining 3.25 blotters in my stash.
