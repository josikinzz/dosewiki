## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpropanes. These are organic compounds containing a phenylpropane moiety.

### Background

Ephedrine was first described in western literature in 1888, as a naturally occurring component of the ephedra plant, along with
pseudoephedrine
.
5
Ephedrine acts as both a direct and indirect sympathomimetic. It is an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist; however, it also causes the indirect release of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons, inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles.
4
,
8
Ephedrine is used for its vasoconstrictive, positive chronotropic, and positive inotropic effects.
8
Ephedrine and
phenylephrine
are still used to treat hypotension, but their use in other indications has decreased due to the development of more selective adrenergic agonists.
6
,
7
,
9
Ephedrine was granted a type 7 FDA Approval on 29 April 2016.
9

### Indication

Ephedrine intravenous injections are indicated to treat hypotension under anesthesia,
8
,
13
ephedrine injections by multiple routes are indicated to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma,
12
ephedrine nasal spray is and OTC medication used as a decongestant.
11

### Pharmacodynamics

Ephedrine increases blood pressure by stimulating heart rate and cardiac output and variably increasing peripheral resistance.
9
It causes bronchodilation due to the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the lungs. By stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in bladder smooth muscle cells, ephedrine also increases the resistance to the outflow of urine.
8
,
9
The therapeutic window of ephedrine is wide, as patients can be given doses of 5mg up to 50mg.
11
Patients should be counselled regarding the pressor effects of sympathomimetic amines and the risk of tachyphylaxis.
4
Also, the use of ephedrine for hypotension prophylaxis is associated with a higher risk of hypertension, compared to when ephedrine is used to treat hypotension.

### Absorption

Oral ephedrine reaches an average C
max
of 79.5ng/mL, with a T
max
of 1.81h, and a bioavailability of 88%.
2

### Metabolism

Ephedrine is largely unmetabolized in the body.
1
Ephedrine can be N-demethylated to norephedrine, or demethylated and deaminized to benzoic acid conjugates and 1,2-hydroxypropylbenzene.

### Toxicity

Patients experiencing an overdose of ephedrine will present with rapidly increasing blood pressure.
8
,
13
Manage overdose with blood pressure monitoring, and possibly the administration of parenteral antihypertensives.
8
,
13
The LD
50
in mice after oral administration is 785mg/kg, after intraperitoneal administration if 248mg/kg, and after subcutaneous administration is 425mg/kg.

### Mechanism of action

Ephedrine is a direct and indirect sympathomimetic amine.
4
As a direct effect, ephedrine activates alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. As an indirect effect, it inhibits norepinephrine reuptake and increases the release of norepinephrine from vesicles in nerve cells.
4
These actions combined lead to larger quantities of norepinephrine present in the synapse for more extended periods of time, increasing stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.
4
Ephedrine acts as an agonist of alpha-1, beta-1 and beta-2-adrenergic receptors. The stimulation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors causes the constriction of veins and a rise in blood pressure, the stimulation of beta-1-adrenergic receptors increases cardiac chronotropy and inotropy, and the stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors causes vasodilation and bronchodilation.

### General Function

Electrogenic antiporter that exchanges one cationic monoamine with two intravesicular protons across the membrane of secretory and synaptic vesicles. Uses the electrochemical proton gradient established by the V-type proton-pump ATPase to accumulate high concentrations of monoamines inside the vesicles prior to their release via exocytosis. Transports a variety of catecholamines such as dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline, histamine, and indolamines such as serotonin (PubMed:23363473, PubMed:37914936, PubMed:38081299, PubMed:38517752, PubMed:8643547). Regulates the transvesicular monoaminergic gradient that determines the quantal size. Mediates somatodendritic dopamine release in hippocampal neurons, likely as part of a regulated secretory pathway that integrates retrograde synaptic signals (By similarity). Acts as a primary transporter for striatal dopamine loading ensuring impulse-dependent release of dopamine at the synaptic cleft (By similarity). Responsible for histamine and serotonin storage and subsequent corelease from mast cell granules (PubMed:8860238)

## Subjective Experience

Ephedra sinica has been used in China as a herbal medicine for thousands of years.
Independent use by indigenous peoples in various parts of the world has also been
documented.

Wikipedia describes its history as follows:

\`\`\`
"Ephedra sinica (also known as Chinese ephedra or Ma Huang) is a plant
species native to Mongolia, Russia (Buryatiya, Chita, Primorye), and
northeastern China. Ephedra is a medicinal preparation from the plant
Ephedra sinica. Several additional species belonging to the genus ephedra
have traditionally been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, and are a
possible candidate for the Soma plant of Indo-Iranian religion. It has been
used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years"
\`\`\`
With respect to its psychoactivity, the same article states that:

\`\`\`
"Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in ephedra (at concentrations of
0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. The
stimulant and thermogenic effects of Ephedra sinica and other ephedra
species are due to the presence of the alkaloids ephedrine and
pseudoephedrine. These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate,
constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial
tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an
increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat"
\`\`\`
In terms of its use as a recreational stimulant, ephedra sinica is traditionally
consumed as a tea. Regarding dose, there are few guidelines, although the following
blog-comment seems to represent a fair

Ephedrine Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
Ephedrine is a common central nervous system stimulant present in the herb Ephedra sinica. It is sold in herbal supplements, in diet aids, and as a pure chemical. It is generally found in capsule or tablet form and is usually taken orally. The chart below shows oral dosages for ephedrine in milligrams (mg). 
 
 
- Oral Ephedrine Dosages Threshold5 - 10 mg Light10 - 20 mg Common15 - 30 mg Strong30 - 50 mg Heavy50 + mg | Oral Ephedrine Dosages | Threshold | 5 - 10 mg | Light | 10 - 20 mg | Common | 15 - 30 mg | Strong | 30 - 50 mg | Heavy | 50 + mg
**Oral Ephedrine Dosages**
- Threshold: 5 - 10 mg
- Light: 10 - 20 mg
- Common: 15 - 30 mg
- Strong: 30 - 50 mg
- Heavy: 50 + mg
**Onset : 20 - 90 minutes (depending on form and stomach contents) Duration : 2 - 5 hours Normal After Effects : 2 - 4 hours**
 
 There have been deaths associated with higher dose use of Ephedrine. Overdose can lead to dangerously increased pulse rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Overdoses are treated like those of other stimulant overdoses.
 
**Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. Know your Body - Know your Mind - Know your Substance - Know your Source. Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources and should not be construed as recommendations. Individuals can respond differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another. Start low with new substances. Have trusted companion/guide/sitter/friend present and/or available.**

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Ephedrine**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: ID Required by Anti-Meth LawRegulated by DEA and FDA
- SCHEDULE: Special Control
 
Ephedrine is approved by the FDA as a drug for human consumption, but because it is a precursor for several scheduled drugs (methamphetamine & methcathinone), it is highly regulated. Possession of ephedrine is legal, but sales of large quantities are monitored and many states heavily regulate the forms and methods in which it is sold. 
 
 The FDA banned the sale of ephedrine in over-the-counter dietary supplements in early 2004. See [FDA's February 2004 Announcement](http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2004/NEW01021.html) . Although the ban was temporarily in question when a federal judge ruled it invalid, the US Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the FDA; as of August 2006, a ban is in place on the sale of any product containing ephedra-alkaloids and ephedrine that has not been specifically approved by the FDA. 
 
 As of 2006, retailers in the United States are required to collect the signatures of every person purchasing pseudoephedrine-containing products in log books and view a photo ID for every purchase of any product for which the entire box contains more than 60 mg of pseudoephedrine. The "Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005" provides for criminal penalties for non compliance and limits the maximum amount an individual can buy to 9 grams of pseudoephedrine per any 30 day period: 
This makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally purchase at retail more than 9 grams during a 30 day period (of which no more than 7.5 grams can be imported by private or commercial carrier or the Postal Service). -- CME 2005
 In 2010, a new "Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act" was passed that the DEA has told mail order retailers now requires them to only ship to the address on the Driver's License of the person ordering the product. However, we've not been able to find that requirement in the law or regulations. See [FDA Law Blog: New Combat Meth Act Increases Retailer Self Certification](http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2010/11/new-combat-meth-act-increases-retailer-self-certification.html) (Nov 2010). Mail order companies are interpreting the rule, perhaps directed to do so by the DEA, that they may only ship ephedrine to the address listed on the driver's license. The DEA's briefing states: "Prior to shipping the product, you must also determine that the name and address on the identification correspond to the name and address provided by the purchaser as part of the sales transaction." Unfortunately, that sentence is ambiguous. It is possible to read that as a requirement for positive identification of the buyer, but can also be read as requiring the product be shipped to the address on the ID, which is the interpretation of the main vendors. 
 
 In addition to monthly maximum purchase quotas per individual, US federal law disallows selling more than 3.6 grams total ephedrine/pseudoephedrine to a person in a single day. In some states, it is illegal to /buy/ as the consumer more than that amount. Some localities call law enforcement if someone attempts to buy more than this amount. There are instances where buying two small boxes of Sudafed 24-hour resulted in arrest and prosecution. Sudafed 24 hour time release contain 240mg per tablet with 10 tablets per box, thus 2.4grams of pseudoephedrine per box. Two boxes exceeds the 3.6 gram per day limit. 
These statutory requirements include the following: (1) the retailer must adhere to specific daily purchaser limits on retail sales (i.e., a regulated retailer may not sell to any purchaser amounts that exceed a daily amount of 3.6 grams of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine) regardless of the number of transactions; (2) the retailer may not sell the non-liquid form of the product unless the product is packaged in a blister pack; and, (3) the retailer must submit regular reports of sales activity to the government.

 Possession of ephedrine and ephedra products remains legal, with the caveat described above that buying too much in a short period can result in criminal penalties.

Oregon #
 
In August, 2005, Oregon governor Kulongoski signed a new law intended to reduce [methamphetamine](https://erowid.org/chemicals/meth/) production in home 'labs' by moving ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine into Oregon Schedule III and making simple possession of more than 300 tablets of pseudoephedrine a crime. See [Oregon House Bill 2485](http://www.leg.state.or.us/05reg/measures/hb2400.dir/hb2485.en.html) .
 
Texas #
 
In 2005, Texas ammended the Health and Safety Code to require strict controls on the storage and sale of products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norpseudoephidrine (see [Title 10, Chapter 486](http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/HS/content/pdf/hs.006.00.000486.00.pdf) ). In 2006 some state requirements were superceded by more stringent federal controls. The state of Texas currenlty requires that purchasers prove that they are 16 or older with a photo ID, and their names and amount of purchase are recorded. Texas limits the amount that can be purchased in a single day (3.6 g of the base product) or month (9 g). Pharmacies are responsible for tracking and reporting how much is sold to individuals. See [Texas State Board of Pharmacy Announcement](http://www.tsbp.state.tx.us/pseudoephedrine.htm) for more information. (thanks JT)

INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Canada #
 
Health Canada has issued repeated warnings advising the general public to be aware of the dangers of misbranded products or products that contain higher than the recommended amounts of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Health Canada has restricted the sales of ephedrine/pseudoephedrine in approved products to only allow breathing health uses and has disallowed products sold for weight loss or in energy boosting products. See [Health Canada Reminds Canadians not to use Ephedra/Ephedrine products](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2008/2008_41_e.html) , March 11 2008. (Last updated May 27, 2008) See [Canadian Drug Law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/law_canada.shtml) .
 
Croatia #
 
Both Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are on a list of precursors for illegal drugs and are controlled in Croatia. Ephedrine HCl is only available to pharmacies where 'liquid nasal drops' for colds are produced in house. By law, the ephedrine is stored in a special locked place inside drug stores to prevent theft during burglaries. Pseudophed is available in cold medications. See [http://www.poslovniforum.hr/zakoni/zszod03.asp](http://www.poslovniforum.hr/zakoni/zszod03.asp) . (thanks C)
 
Finland #
 
It has been reported that in Finland ephedrine is a prescription medication. Posessing it without a prescription is illegal as is ordering it from outside Finland through postal services without a prescription (whether it's plant material or synthetic does not matter). (from [Sir Robin](http://nisti.net/dihkal/efedriini.html) )
 
Germany #
 
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are controlled chemicals included in the Grundstoffüberwachungsgesetz (GÜG), a law which lists precursors used in the manufacture of certain illegal drugs. (thanks C) This means they are no longer available over-the-counter, but only through a pharmacy. (thanks PM)

Indonesia #
 
We have been told that ephedrine is sold over-the-counter at pharmacies in 25 mg packets of 20 pills. (unconfirmed) (thanks j, B) (last updated Feb 12, 2013)
 
Netherlands #
 
Ephedrine and Ephedra-alkaloid containing extracts have been added to the list of substances which may only be prescribed by doctors in the Netherlands. Over-the-counter sales are illegal as of Apr 6, 2004.

(thanks DEB and Uil)
 
Sweden #
 
Not controlled in Sweden. Use of ephedrine-containing products can be considered 'cheating' in athletic competitions, as normal throughout the modern world. (unconfirmed) (thanks SJ)
 
United Kingdom #
 
Ephedrine is Prescription Only (Schedule VI) in the UK, making it legal to possess and use. A prescription is required (it is not sold over-the-counter) but is freely sold online as a diet aid by companies based in the UK. (unconfirmed) (thanks G) (last updated Mar 2007)

**Ephedrine** is a naturally occurring central nervous system [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) obtained from the plant Ephedra equisetina. Commonly used as a stimulant, concentration aid, decongestant, and [appetite suppressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppressant) . It is often used to prevent low blood pressure during spinal anesthesia.

Ephedrine is closely related in structure to [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , and [pseudoephedrine](/w/index.php?title=Pseudoephedrine&action=edit&redlink=1) although its CNS actions are much less potent and also longer-acting than those of the [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) . Its peripheral stimulant actions are similar to but less powerful than those of [epinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Epinephrine) (adrenaline), a [hormone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hormone) produced in the body by the adrenal glands.

## History and culture

Ephedrine in its natural form, known as má huáng in traditional Chinese medicine, has been documented in China since the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as an anti-asthmatic and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) . In 1885, the chemical synthesis of ephedrine was first accomplished by Japanese organic chemist Nagai Nagayoshi based on his research on traditional Japanese and Chinese herbal medicines. The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, when Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. Ephedrine exports from China to the West grew from 4 to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928. Ephedrine became a highly popular and effective treatment for asthma, particularly because, unlike [adrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) (until then the standard therapy), it can be given by mouth. Ephedrine as a treatment for asthma reached its zenith in the late 1950s, since when there has been a gradual and inevitable decline in its therapeutic use. From mainstream medicine, ephedrine moved into the twilight zone of street drugs and nutritional supplements. Ephedra and ephedrine products are now banned or heavily regulated in many countries, as they are a major source for the production of the addictive compound [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , and have been associated with severe adverse events such as heart attacks and strokes.

## Chemistry

Ephedrine is a [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) and a structural [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) analogue. It differs from [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) only by the presence of a hydroxyl group (—OH).

Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine and substituted amphetamine. It is similar in molecular structure to phenylpropanolamine, methamphetamine, and epinephrine (adrenaline). Chemically, it is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). It works mainly by increasing the activity of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on adrenergic receptors. It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt.

Ephedrine exhibits optical isomerism and has two chiral centres, giving rise to four stereoisomers. By convention, the pair of enantiomers with the stereochemistry (1R,2S) and (1S,2R) is designated ephedrine, while the pair of enantiomers with the stereochemistry (1R,2R) and (1S,2S) is called pseudoephedrine. Ephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and a structural methamphetamine analogue. It differs from methamphetamine only by the presence of a hydroxyl group (—OH).

## Pharmacology

Ephedrine primary mechanism of action is through increasing catecholamine activity at alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenergic) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . It also acts as a NDRA ( [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) ).

Ephedrine, a sympathomimetic amine, acts on part of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The principal mechanism of action relies on its indirect stimulation of the adrenergic receptor system by increasing the activity of norepinephrine at the postsynaptic α and β receptors. The presence of direct interactions with α receptors is unlikely, but still controversial. L-ephedrine, and particularly its stereoisomer norpseudoephedrine (which is also present in Catha edulis) has indirect sympathomimetic effects and due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, it is a CNS stimulant similar to amphetamines, but less pronounced, as it releases noradrenaline and dopamine in the substantia nigra.

The presence of an N-methyl group decreases binding affinities at α receptors, compared with norephedrine. Ephedrine, though, binds better than N-methylephedrine, which has an additional methyl group at the nitrogen atom. Also the steric orientation of the hydroxyl group is important for receptor binding and functional activity.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

In comparison to other stimulants, ephedrine has particularly strong effects on the cardiovascular system, and its use has been associated with heart attacks, strokes, and arrythmia .

### Lethal dosage

A 28-year-old white female with a history of two prior suicide attempts was found dead in her home by her common law husband. Autopsy findings were unremarkable except for partially dissolved ephedrine tablets in the stomach contents. Significant toxicological finding included ephedrine concentrations in the blood of 11 mg/L, liver of 24 mg/kg, kidney of 14 mg/kg, and brain of 8.9 mg/kg.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of ephedrine can be considered moderately addictive and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users.

Tolerance to the effects of ephedrine are quickly built after repeated and frequent usage. Ephedrinepresents cross-tolerance with other [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopaminergic) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , meaning that after the consumption of ephedrine, most other [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) compounds will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

## Effects
Stimulates circulation, increases drive and performance, and suppresses appetite.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Even at low doses: Palpitations, restlessness, sleep problems, urinary urgency or retention and dry mouth. Also possible are feelings of anxiety, increased blood pressure (vasoconstriction), loss of appetite, dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias and even heart attacks.
In case of overdose: confusion and paranoia. The tannins of ephedra herb can cause stomach complaints in larger quantities.

### Long-term Risks
Continuous use: Impaired memory and concentration, irritability, nervousness, aggressive behaviour, cardiac arrhythmia, chronic high blood pressure, bad teeth, liver/kidney damage and psychological disorders. Regular ephedrine use can lead to the development of tolerance and dependence, especially with psychological symptoms.

## Safer Use
- Take a low dose of ephedrine, as the active ingredient content can vary greatly, especially in herbs!
- Drink enough water (3 - 5 dl per hour) and no alcohol!
- People with circulatory problems/diseases, thyroid disorders and liver or kidney damage should not consume ephedrine!
- Ephedrine is not an effective means of losing weight without medical supervision.

Ephedrine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and sympathomimetic agent that is often used to prevent low blood pressure during anesthesia. It has also been used for asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity but is not the preferred treatment. It is of unclear benefit in nasal congestion. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle, vein, or just under the skin. Onset with intravenous use is fast, while injection into a muscle can take 20 minutes, and by mouth can take an hour for effect. When given by injection, it lasts about an hour, and when taken by mouth, it can last up to four hours.
Common side effects include trouble sleeping, anxiety, headache, hallucinations, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, loss of appetite, and urinary retention. Serious side effects include stroke and heart attack. While probably safe in pregnancy, its use in this population is poorly studied. Use during breastfeeding is not recommended. Ephedrine works by inducing the release of norepinephrine and hence indirectly activating the α- and β-adrenergic receptors. Chemically, ephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and is the (1R,2S)-enantiomer of β-hydroxy-N-methylamphetamine.
Ephedrine was first isolated in 1885 and came into commercial use in 1926. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It can normally be found in plants of the Ephedra genus. Over-the-counter dietary supplements containing ephedrine are illegal in the United States, with the exception of those used in traditional Chinese medicine, where its presence is noted by má huáng.

## Medical uses

Ephedrine is a non-catecholamine sympathomimetic with cardiovascular effects similar to those of adrenaline (epinephrine): increased blood pressure, heart rate, and contractility. Like pseudoephedrine, it is a bronchodilator, with pseudoephedrine having considerably less effect.
Ephedrine may decrease motion sickness, but it has mainly been used to decrease the sedating effects of other medications used for motion sickness.
Ephedrine is also found to have quick and long-lasting responsiveness in congenital myasthenic syndrome in early childhood and also even in adults with a novel COLQ mutation.
Ephedrine is administered by intravenous boluses. Redosing usually requires increased doses to offset the development of tachyphylaxis, which is attributed to the depletion of catecholamine stores.

### Weight loss

Ephedrine promotes modest short-term weight loss, specifically fat loss, but its long-term effects are unknown. In mice, ephedrine is known to stimulate thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue, but because adult humans have only small amounts of brown fat, thermogenesis is assumed to take place mostly in the skeletal muscle. Ephedrine also decreases gastric emptying. Methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline have a synergistic effect with ephedrine for weight loss. This led to the creation and marketing of compound products. One of them, known as the ECA stack, contains ephedrine with caffeine and aspirin. It is a popular supplement taken by bodybuilders seeking to cut body fat before a competition.
A 2021 systematic review found that ephedrine taken in doses from 60 mg to 150mg, with or without caffeine, for 4 to 24 weeks led to a 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) weight loss greater than placebo, raised heart rate, and reduced LDL and raised HDL, with no statistically significant difference in blood pressure.

### Available forms

Ephedrine is available as a prescription-only pharmaceutical drug in the form of an intravenous solution, under brand names including Akovaz, Corphedra, Emerphed, and Rezipres as well as in generic forms, in the United States. It is also available over-the-counter in the form of 12.5 and 25 mg oral tablets for use as a bronchodilator and as a 0.5% concentration nasal spray for use as a decongestant. The drug is additionally available in combination with guaifenesin in the form of oral tablets and liquids. Ephedrine is provided as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt in pharmaceutical formulations.

## Contraindications

Ephedrine should not be used in conjunction with certain antidepressants, namely norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), as this increases the risk of symptoms due to excessive serum levels of norepinephrine.
Bupropion is an example of an antidepressant with an amphetamine-like structure similar to ephedrine, and it is an NDRI. Its action bears more resemblance to amphetamine than to fluoxetine in that its primary mode of therapeutic action involves norepinephrine and to a lesser degree dopamine, but it also releases some serotonin from presynaptic clefts. It should not be used with ephedrine, as it may increase the likelihood of side effects.
Ephedrine should be used with caution in patients with inadequate fluid replacement, impaired adrenal function, hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, during delivery if maternal blood pressure is >130/80 mmHg, and during lactation.
Contraindications for the use of ephedrine include: closed-angle glaucoma, phaeochromocytoma, asymmetric septal hypertrophy (idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), concomitant or recent (previous 14 days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy, general anesthesia with halogenated hydrocarbons (particularly halothane), tachyarrhythmias or ventricular fibrillation, or hypersensitivity to ephedrine or other stimulants.
Ephedrine should not be used at any time during pregnancy unless specifically indicated by a qualified physician and only when other options are unavailable.

## Side effects

Ephedrine is a potentially dangerous natural compound; as of 2004 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had received over 18,000 reports of adverse effects in people using it.
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are more common with systemic administration (e.g. injection or oral administration) compared to topical administration (e.g. nasal instillations). ADRs associated with ephedrine therapy include 

Cardiovascular: tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, vasoconstriction with hypertension
Dermatological: flushing, sweating, acne vulgaris
Gastrointestinal: nausea
Genitourinary: decreased urination due to vasoconstriction of renal arteries, difficulty urinating is not uncommon, as alpha-agonists such as ephedrine constrict the internal urethral sphincter, mimicking the effects of sympathetic nervous system stimulation
Nervous system: restlessness, confusion, insomnia, mild euphoria, mania/hallucinations (rare except in previously existing psychiatric conditions), delusions, formication (may be possible, but lacks documented evidence) paranoia, hostility, panic, agitation
Respiratory: dyspnea, pulmonary edema
Miscellaneous: dizziness, headache, tremor, hyperglycemic reactions, dry mouth

## Overdose

Overdose of ephedrine may result in sympathomimetic symptoms like tachycardia and hypertension.

## Interactions

Ephedrine with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine and tranylcypromine can result in hypertensive crisis.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Ephedrine, a sympathomimetic amine, acts on part of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The principal mechanism of action relies on its indirect stimulation of the adrenergic receptor system by increasing activation of α- and β-adrenergic receptors via induction of norepinephrine release. The presence of direct interactions with α-adrenergic receptors is unlikely but still controversial. L-ephedrine, and particularly its stereoisomer norpseudoephedrine (which is also present in Catha edulis) has indirect sympathomimetic effects and due to its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, it is a CNS stimulant similar to amphetamines, but less pronounced, as it releases norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

The oral bioavailability of ephedrine is 88%. The onset of action of ephedrine orally is 15 to 60 minutes, via intramuscular injection is 10 to 20 minutes, and via intravenous infusion is within seconds.

#### Distribution

Its plasma protein binding is approximately 24 to 29%, with 5 to 10% bound to albumin.

#### Metabolism

Ephedrine is largely not metabolized. Norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine) is an active metabolite of ephedrine formed via N-demethylation. About 8 to 20% of an oral dose of ephedrine is demethylated into norephedrine, about 4 to 13% is oxidatively deaminated into benzoic acid, and a small fraction is converted into 1,2-dihydroxy-1-phenylpropane.

#### Elimination

Ephedrine is eliminated mainly in urine, with 60% (range 53–79%) excreted unchanged.
The elimination half-life of ephedrine is 6 hours. Its duration of action orally is 2 to 4 hours and via intravenous or intramuscular injection is 60 minutes.
The elimination of ephedrine is dependent on urinary pH.

## Chemistry

Ephedrine, or (−)-(1R,2S)-ephedrine, also known as (1R,2S)-β-hydroxy-N-methyl-α-methyl-β-phenethylamine or as (1R,2S)-β-hydroxy-N-methylamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is similar in chemical structure to phenylpropanolamine, methamphetamine, and epinephrine (adrenaline). It differs from methamphetamine only by the presence of a hydroxyl group (–OH). Chemically, ephedrine is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt.
It has an experimental log P of 1.13, while its predicted log P values range from 0.9 to 1.32. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to ephedrine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of pseudoephedrine is 0.89, of phenylpropanolamine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7).
Ephedrine hydrochloride has a melting point of 187−188 °C.
The racemic form of ephedrine is racephedrine ((±)-ephedrine; dl-ephedrine; (1RS,2SR)-ephedrine). A stereoisomer of ephedrine is pseudoephedrine. Derivatives of ephedrine include methylephedrine (N-methylephedrine), etafedrine (N-ethylephedrine), cinnamedrine (N-cinnamylephedrine), and oxilofrine (4-hydroxyephedrine). Analogues of ephedrine include phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) and metaraminol (3-hydroxynorephedrine).
The presence of an N-methyl group decreases binding affinities at α-adrenergic receptors, compared with norephedrine. Ephedrine, though, binds better than N-methylephedrine, which has an additional methyl group at the nitrogen atom. Also, the steric orientation of the hydroxyl group is important for receptor binding and functional activity.

### Nomenclature

Ephedrine exhibits optical isomerism and has two chiral centres, giving rise to four stereoisomers. By convention, the pair of enantiomers with the stereochemistry (1R,2S) and (1S,2R) is designated ephedrine, while the pair of enantiomers with the stereochemistry (1R,2R) and (1S,2S) is called pseudoephedrine.
The isomer which is marketed is (−)-(1R,2S)-ephedrine.
In the outdated D/L system (+)-ephedrine is also referred to as D-ephedrine and (−)-ephedrine as L-ephedrine (in which case, in the Fischer projection, the phenyl ring is drawn at the bottom).
Often, the D/L system (with small caps) and the d/l system (with lower-case) are confused. The result is that the levorotary l-ephedrine is wrongly named L-ephedrine and the dextrorotary d-pseudoephedrine (the diastereomer) wrongly D-pseudoephedrine.
The IUPAC names of the two enantiomers are (1R,2S)- respectively (1S,2R)-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. A synonym is erythro-ephedrine.

### Detection in body fluids

Ephedrine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor possible abuse by athletes, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with ephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish ephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma ephedrine concentrations are typically in the 20–200 μg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 300–3000 μg/L in abusers or poisoned patients, and 3–20 mg/L in cases of acute fatal overdosage. The current World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) limit for ephedrine in an athlete's urine is 10 μg/mL.

## History

### Asia

Ephedrine in its natural form, known as máhuáng (麻黄) in traditional Chinese medicine, has been documented in China since the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as an antiasthmatic and stimulant. In traditional Chinese medicine, máhuáng has been used as a treatment for asthma and bronchitis for centuries.
In 1885, the chemical synthesis of ephedrine was first accomplished by Japanese organic chemist Nagai Nagayoshi based on his research on traditional Japanese and Chinese herbal medicines.
The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, when Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. Ephedrine exports from China to the West grew from 4 to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928.

### Western medicine

Ephedrine was first introduced for medical use in the United States in 1926.
It was introduced in 1948 in Vicks Vatronol nose drops (now discontinued) which contained ephedrine sulfate as the active ingredient for rapid nasal decongestion.

## Society and culture

### Names

Ephedrine is the generic name of the drug and its BANTooltip British Approved Name. Its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française is ephédrine while its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana is efedrina. In the case of the hydrochloride salt, its generic name is ephedrine hydrochloride and this is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. In the case of the sulfate salt, its generic name is ephedrine sulfate or ephedrine sulphate and the former is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name while the latter is its BANMTooltip British Approved Name. A synonym of ephedrine sulfate is isofedrol. These names all refer to the (1R,2R)-enantiomer of ephedrine. The racemic form of ephedrine is known as racephedrine and this is its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while the hydrochloride salt of the racemic form is racephedrine hydrochloride and this is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name.

### Recreational use

As a phenethylamine, ephedrine has a similar chemical structure to amphetamines and is a methamphetamine analog having the methamphetamine structure with a hydroxyl group at the β position. Because of ephedrine's structural similarity to methamphetamine, it can be used to create methamphetamine using chemical reduction in which ephedrine's hydroxyl group is removed; this has made ephedrine a highly sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.
The most popular method for reducing ephedrine to methamphetamine is similar to the Birch reduction, in that it uses anhydrous ammonia and lithium metal in the reaction. The second-most popular method uses red phosphorus and iodine in the reaction with ephedrine. Moreover, ephedrine can be synthesized into methcathinone via simple oxidation. As such, ephedrine is listed as a table-I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

### Use in exercise and sports

Ephedrine has been used as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports. It can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility as well as act as a psychostimulant. Ephedrine is often used in combination with caffeine for performance-enhancing purposes.

### Other uses

In chemical synthesis, ephedrine is used in bulk quantities as a chiral auxiliary group.

In saquinavir synthesis, the half-acid is resolved as its salt with l-ephedrine.

### Legal status

#### Canada

In January 2002, Health Canada issued a voluntary recall of all ephedrine products containing more than 8 mg per dose, all combinations of ephedrine with other stimulants such as caffeine, and all ephedrine products marketed for weight-loss or bodybuilding indications, citing a serious risk to health. Ephedrine is still sold as an oral nasal decongestant in 8 mg pills as a natural health product (NHP), with a limit of 0.4 g (400 mg) per package, the limit established by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as it is considered as Class A Precursor.
NHPs containing ephedrine or pseudoephdrine as their sole active ingredients are restricted to being behind-the-counter at pharmacies, requiring customers to request them from the pharmacist. Combination NHPs containing other ingredients can be in a regular pharmacy self-selection area for purchase, but are still restricted to pharmacies and a pharmacist must be available to answer questions from a customer if necessary.

#### United States

In 1997, the FDA proposed a regulation on ephedra (the herb from which ephedrine is obtained), which limited an ephedra dose to 8 mg (of active ephedrine) with no more than 24 mg per day. This proposed rule was withdrawn, in part, in 2000 because of "concerns regarding the agency's basis for proposing a certain dietary ingredient level and a duration of use limit for these products." In 2004, the FDA created a ban on ephedrine alkaloids marketed for reasons other than asthma, colds, allergies, other disease, or traditional Asian use. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah ruled the FDA did not have proper evidence that low dosages of ephedrine alkaloids are actually unsafe, but on August 17, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver upheld the FDA's final rule declaring all dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated, and therefore illegal for marketing in the United States. Furthermore, ephedrine is banned by the NCAA, MLB, NFL, and PGA. Ephedrine is, however, still legal in many applications outside of dietary supplements. Purchasing is currently limited and monitored, with specifics varying from state to state.
The House passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 as an amendment to the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on March 6, 2006, the act amended the US Code (21 USC 830) concerning the sale of products containing ephedrine and the closely related drug pseudoephedrine. Both substances are used as precursors in the illicit production of methamphetamine, and to discourage that use the federal statute included the following requirements for merchants who sell these products:

A retrievable record of all purchases identifying the name and address of each party to be kept for two years
Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers
Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information
Reports to the Attorney General of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products
Non-liquid dose form of regulated product may only be sold in unit-dose blister packs
Regulated products are to be sold behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict access
Daily sales of regulated products not to exceed 3.6 g to a single purchaser, without regard to the number of transactions
Monthly sales to a single purchaser not to exceed 9 g of pseudoephedrine base in regulated products
The law gives similar regulations to mail-order purchases, except the monthly sales limit is 7.5 g.
As a pure herb or tea, má huáng, containing ephedrine, is still sold legally in the US. The law restricts/prohibits its being sold as a dietary supplement (pill) or as an ingredient/additive to other products, like diet pills.

#### Australia

Ephedrine and all Ephedra species that contain it are considered Schedule 4 substances under the Poisons Standard. A Schedule 4 drug is considered a Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription under the Poisons Standard.

#### South Africa

In South Africa, ephedrine was moved to schedule 6 on 27 May 2008, which makes pure ephedrine tablets prescription only. Pills containing ephedrine up to 30 mg per tablet in combination with other medications are still available OTC, schedule 1 and 2, for sinus, head colds, and influenza.

#### Germany

Ephedrine was freely available in pharmacies in Germany until 2001. Afterward, access was restricted since it was mostly bought for unindicated uses. Similarly, ephedra can only be bought with a prescription. Since April 2006, all products, including plant parts, that contain ephedrine are only available with a prescription.

## Production

### Agricultural

Ephedrine is obtained from the plant Ephedra sinica and other members of the genus Ephedra, from which the name of the substance is derived. Raw materials for the manufacture of ephedrine and traditional Chinese medicines are produced in China on a large scale. As of 2007, companies produced for export US\$13 million worth of ephedrine from 30,000 tons of ephedra annually, or about ten times the amount used in traditional Chinese medicine.

### Synthetic

Most of the l-ephedrine produced today for official medical use is made synthetically as the extraction and isolation process from E. sinica is tedious and no longer cost-effective.

### Biosynthetic

Ephedrine was long thought to come from modifying the amino acid L-phenylalanine. L-Phenylalanine would be decarboxylated and subsequently attacked with ω-aminoacetophenone. Methylation of this product would then produce ephedrine. This pathway has since been disproven. A new pathway proposed suggests that phenylalanine first forms cinnamoyl-CoA via the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and acyl CoA ligase. The cinnamoyl-CoA is then reacted with a hydratase to attach the alcohol functional group. The product is then reacted with a retro-aldolase, forming benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde reacts with pyruvic acid to attach a 2-carbon unit. This product then undergoes transamination and methylation to form ephedrine and its stereoisomer, pseudoephedrine.
