Original Post:


Well I've taken 5-MeO-DiPT all ways but snorting now(and of course I've not plugged it thats just gross).....I've come to the conclusion that IV is the best route for 5-MeO-Dipt. As many of you may have read in the trip reports section some time ago I tried IV 4 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT and had nothing but good things to say about the experience. Well last night I tried intramuscular 4 mg. At first it was not fun at all, but later it started feeling really good. I've come to the conclusion that the reason 5-MeO-DiPT may not feel as good as it has the potential to is the transitions are agrivating. The coming up stages do not feel *good*. IV is the fastest way to reach the peak, and there is less transition time and you will have optimal results. Also the 4 mg dose may be a tad low for you psyconaughts out there, but 4 mg IV/IM route the peak is really mellow and the effects are most greatly felt to the body. Its just a general all around mellow and feel-good trip at 4 mg. Its not "I'm blown away!" its "I feel good." more like a body trip.

Also, the solution I had was around 8 months old and the risk of bacteria was present. So what I did was, noting that the melting point of 5-MeO-DiPT is 180 degress celcious I heated the water and evaporated it in a spoon. I then washed with Isoproply to steralize the solution, evaporated, then put 40 units of distilled water in the solution, filtered, and injected into my shoulder. This method seems to be effective.

**5-MEO-DIPT and the bad rap**


Why are there so many posts saying that foxy sucks?  what's the deal...

I have taken it 3 times...

the first was kinda of painful

the 2nd and 3rd were with MDMA and were beautiful....

Yeah it doesn't leave you feeling like you have moe insite as to what is going on around you but it is pretty damn fun... 
![smile.gif](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.bluelight.ru%2Fubb%2Fsmile.gif&hash=d2aff6df92796d41f35289a3ba366d24)

anyhow, why do you all dislike it so much?

I love it at low doses. At high doses, I don't like what it does to my mindframe or the body load.

It a nice "every once in a while" drug. It's just not a super intense thing.

Interestingly, I have found that women are much more likely to enjoy Foxy than men.  It seems the sense of eroticism the drug can produce is more prevalent with the ladies.  

I wonder if other's can attest to this observation as well?

I personally like foxy, but hate the stomache/digestive/throwing up feelings with higher doses... <12 is Fun and a really nice semi-trip id say, but i like the visuals i get with >16 ...its just tough to deal with excess saliva and craps and that shitty intestinal feeling for an hour before having fun...

And Ironicly my GF hates it cuz it gave her a bad trip at the 15-25 mark, and she didnt like me throwing up... But i still think its a "nice chemical."

FWIW In my extensive field research on this chem, I love it and all the guys I've given it to have loved it generally under the 10mg range - a couple took double that and had just as much or more enjoyment though.  

The 1 girl that had taken it with me and a group of guys one nite didn't like it at all - she said it made her feel disconnected from everything.  This is probably a case of setting however since she had never taken the drug before and we were at the Fillmore which was packed to the gills that evening.

I have found that high doses can be enjoyable or very troubling, none the less all interesting...

The best time was when we combined MDMA and Foxy in this order...

initally we took 20mg foxy and 120mg pure MDMA and half a pink elephant (supposedly 75mg MDMA + what ever)

T+1 - At this point we have started to feel the combo take action.  We suffer from no nausia at all.  So we took the other half of the pink elephant and 10mg more foxy.

T+1.5 - we were blasted into a wonderfully blissfull place.  This is what E is supposed to be like.  Visuals are very marked but mellow.  Thoughts are clear.  The sensation of touch is fantastic.

T+3 - Nothing could be better except swimming...  so we jump in and it's nothing less than a full spritual orgasmic experiance.

T+5 - it's now four in the morning and are still continuing to go up!  There has been nosign of ever coming down at this point.

T+7 - still on the way up after haveing some great conversations with friends about the implications of having roommates.  We retreat to the bed room

T+13 - after paying in the bedroom for 6 hours we disided that we have to stop for a breather...  We eat some breakfast, replenish our fluids, and go back to the bedroom.

T+17 - We are still just as high as we where 10 hours ago.  Starting to come down at this point.  Given up on sex because it has become almost rediculous.  Being at orgasm for 9+ hours does cause some phisical discomfort after a while.  So, we stop take some prozac and 5htp...

T+20 - We are completely down now and feel completely normal except for the soarness down below...

T+23 - Off to bed sleep comes easily for my wife. Takes me about an hour or 2 more.  B's teeth grinding kept me up.

Felt completely refreshed the next day just a little sore and hazy...

So I would have to say if taken in the right combinations Foxy and MDMA completely potentiate eachother...Be careful boys and girls...

**5-meo-dipt, complete waste of time**


Being completely bored of most substances out there My wife and I purchased a gram of Foxy... A mistake to say the lease.... 

This substance is really hit or miss with it's way to high body load. 

the first does we took was 20mg... Come up was similar to LSD. At the peak we found it to be a slightly visual drug... everything got a ripply quality to it... colors were very intence... Paranoia dominated the first 2 hours... The DEA was dring around next to our camp site at 4:00am in the moring getting ready to raid us...(all in our head but there were 4 black SUVs driving around the dead end out camp site was in at 4:00am...) 

Paranoia passed.... Extream bodyload much like shrooms but way worse... 

come down was ok... felt fine the next day... 

2nd exp. 

Puerto Viarta, Mexico... 

30mg - room bacame very long and equalibrium was so off that we felt as if we were walking on the walls... 

Super dupper extream paranoia...we wanted to leave the resort we were at because we thought that is was some kind of crule joke that the place sucked so bad... Yadda Yadda realised it was the drugs and had some sex on the beach.... 

3rd time... Now this was a shining experience... 200mg MDMA(powder) 2 Pink elephants and 35mg Foxy.... 

This was absolutly amzing... felt the best we had ever felt... lasted 18 hours... partied from 10pm to 4pm the next day... got to bed a 6pm.... flet like absolute crap the next day but thats because we took no vitaimins or post load.... 

4th time sucked ass.... 10 hits liquid(estimated quantity), 25mg foxy, 200mg MDMA(powder) 

Took the acid...viles top fell off in my mouth and the rest of the vile pured in... "Uh oh, I think that was alot of acid" 5 minutes later I could see through walls cloths floors, people.... Couldn't feel my body, and couldn't really see reality... 2 hours passed and I have gotten used to the trip...extream body load... lots of pain.... 

Take some MDMA and foxy to mello it out and it does for a bit...2 hours later my skin started to peal from my body... I look at my body and see my tendons tear from my ligaments, I realize that the drugs have shifted my gentic make up and is causing my body to liquify I melt into the earth and I am now dead. 

I am still on earth but a now twisted and demented version everything got a yellow glow to it... the the tree sticking out of the ground looked like human limbs sticking out of the ground with huge wounds in them seathing blood out... birds were normal except for the crows with turned into deamon like creatures with blood and tidbits of flesh hanging out of their mouths... 

At first I wansn't that scared but then I noticed the I coundn't feel my heart... so now the scariness has set in and I'm ready for the trip to stop.... So we go to the pool and go for a swim. It seems like everyone is taking at me...and no things about about me that I want no one to know... everyone knows experiences and my name... I ignore them and finally they go away.... 

I pull all my mental resources and pull myself out of the dismal pit I'm in... through meditation I am able to reconstruct my flesh back on to my body (this was so bizarr and interesting) 

Finally after 6 hours at the pool I feel pretty normal again... And never want to experiance anything like that again.... 

5th foxy - 

started the night great 300mg 5-HTP + a good multi-vit 3 hours in advance.... 

250mg MDMA and that was supposed to be it...but we felt so great that we wanted more... so we took 15mg foxt thinking that maybe it was the dosage that was too high in our prior experiance.... well forget about it.... The body load intolerable... went from feeling great to felling like complete crap within two hours... all the empathy became disdane and disorder... we couldn't move with out felling like shit... my wife and I felt like we were on completely different chanels and very distant.... Finally it wore of and everything was fine.... 

so my point is that Foxy really sucks and has really nothing good to offer anyone... 

i have give it to 10 of our friends and they have the same reactions... one time is great but most every other time is the worst time the have ever had in their lives.... 

Foxy is not foxy it sould be called Hell death.... 

oh yeah the one thing that we have noticed from foxy is that if you have and acne problem it will completely clear it.

So if you want clear skin take Foxy and got through hell and then the next day you will be nice and oxy clean.... woo hoo.... 

Still deciding weather or not to dump the rest of that foxy shit down the toilet....

While some people love it and some hate it.

I've found that under 15mg it is a great drug especially when mixed with pot.

Over that and the effects change for the worse and the body load gets worse too.

I would try one last time at about 12mg with some bud.  It's like a totally different drug!

5-meo-dipt will be the next drug I try with my tripping companion, so I enjoyed reading your post even though I am sorry you had negative experiences.  She wants to keep the dosage low and just go for the subtle mood enhancement, so hopefully that will work for us.

you start the doses at 20mg and you come to a conclusion of "complete waste of time"...

well, shit, of coure you didn't enjoy it...you skipped right past the recommened range for a pleasurable experience; I'm not saying you can't have good experiences at other higher doses, but most people who like, seem to take much smaller amounts.

personally I've taken anywhere from about 6mg to 18mg or so...and I much prefer it in the 8-10mg range.  

however, I do agree that larger doses do appear to create a decent dose of paranoia....but I think 4 black SUVs driving around my campsite at 4am would give me an unhealthy dose of paranoia regardless of any drugs.

Trying to find the volume/dosage.

It probably would be easier to check myself, but I've got another three weeks or so before I can afford to get my analytical balance.  Just trying to get everything in order before then.

Um... the question you are asking pretty much demonstrates you haven't the slightest clue.

The amount of a chemical dissolved in a liquid depends on (get this) how much was dissolved in there in the first place! 

Take two glasses of water. Dissolve 1 tablespoon of sugar in one, dissolve 2 tablespoons of sugar in the other.

What is the density of sugar? Well, in one glass, it's 1T/glass, in the other, it's 2T/glass.

Now, replace "sugar" with "5-meo-dipt", "glasses" with "milliliter", and "tablespoon" with "milligram". All that discussion works just the same.

Ergo, the "density" of 5-meo-dipt in "mg/ml" is simply not a well-defined concept.

well... 

the litre is, technically, not a fundamental SI unit. 

like "year" and even "newton", it's defined in terms of other units; 1 L = 1000 cm³. therefore, 1 mL = 0.001 L = 1 cm³. it is convenient that 1 mL of water has a mass of approximately 1 g at STP, but that has nothing to do with the definition of the kilogram and is just a planned coincidence.

so.. density = mass / volume and it's usually described in g/cm³. density **is a characteristic property**, meaning that 5-MeO-DMT has only one density. (different forms of the same compound, e.g. different crystal structures and/or enantiomers, may have different densities). 

remember that a powder must be packed solid, as densely as possible, to get the correct density. you are unlikely to be able to measure the solid by volume because the volumes will be quite small; even a 5 mL graduated cylinder wouldn't be precise enough.

the only real error in your question, if you interpret mL as cm³ (though it's not proper to discuss solids in mL, it's more bad form than a fundamental misunderstanding of what a millilitre is), is wanting to know the density down to mg/mL is a statement of precision (to 0.001 g/mL) rather than of accuracy.

but density depends on the compound, on temperature and on pressure, so it's somewhat difficult to work with... it's not really practical.

last thing about density: if you wanted to be an evil chembitch and say that mg/mL must still refer to a liquid, then you could just state the density of liquid 5-MeO-DMT at a certain temperature. unless it decomposes below its melting point at 101.3 kPa, which it probably does; so you'd have to specify the density of the liquid at a certain temperature and a certain high pressure. =P

oh, yeah. that thing about dissolving stuff in water: that's concentration. yes, a solution of 1 teaspoon of sugar in a glass of water will have a different density than a solution of 2 teaspoons, but there's actually no way you can calculate that relationship just by knowing volumes; the mass of a solution is equal to the mass of the solute and solvent but the volume is not. too bad. the stuff you gave is concentration (non-molar, anyway)

now the hard part -- i couldn't find it anywhere. the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics doesn't list it (the closest one is tryptamine) and i couldn't estimate it cause the program crashed. =P

AND THE LAST THING:

you don't really need to know the density.

you need to prepare a 'stock solution' with a known concentration. find the mass of everything and dissolve it in a known amount of solvent. 

using a volumetric flask. bottom of the meniscus at eye level. 

or just wait for your balance =P

Thanks for your info Roches...  Most of it I already knew, but since the gelcaps I've got list their size in mg/ml I just copied that on over.  The only thing I didn't realize was that a ml and a cubic centimeter came out to be the same, although I should have, that'll make life easier in the future.

I was trying to avoid the solvent issue if at all possible, but that may be the easiest, if not the most practicle, way of doing things in the end.  Either that or shell out $7,500 for a powder mixer and tablet press, which, for personal use, is just a wee bit much for my taste.

I think I learned the sugar/glasses concentration in, oh, I dunno, 6th grade science.  The only concentration I'd have to deal with this is that fact that the 5-MeO-DiPT is 99.5% pure (give or take), but I'm not going to be that anal about it.

Its called a scale... and with foxy you should have a good one due to the very low dose.

Just pop the $300 for a decent scale aculab makes a nice one that is accurate to the mg.

Do you have the model number of it?  The cheapest one I found that is accurate to a mg is a $675 Ohaus.

oh, the point of it wasn't really directed towards you.

or anyone.

i needed to waste time. i needed not to study.

yet to still do something that felt vaguely like studying.

i'm sure you knew practically all of it.

but still, you better make sure those gelcaps are packed *hard* if you're going to depend on density to measure the dose.

if you're *highly* determined you might as well do the same concept as the solvent with a known amount of excipient; mix all the dipt with lactose or something, so that 1 cap = 1 dose, and fill the caps. kind of like dissolving it, only you're mixing it with a solid. (big ups homeopathy for that one.)

that way, the mass per cap will depend on the volume of powder containing a fraction of a known mass of DIPT, rather than on the density of DIPT, which is a property measured for very closely packed powdered or crystalline DIPT, not for the loosely packed stuff you have.

from what i know this stuff is really dose-sensitive, so you'll need to be careful.

i still say wait for the scale. =P

That was really the plan to start with.  Although I'm skipping lactose and gelcaps and probably going with DiPac, maybe microcrystaline cellulose, or something similar, and vegicaps so I can be nice and vegan friendly for a few friends who are planning on joining me.

I just don't want to have to hand weigh 300 extremely small doses

Well.. a couple things

first the Acculab PP2060D is a nice portable scale acurate to 1mg up to 50grams. About $300

Second...do you realize how small 15mgs is? a baby asprin around 300mg.

Third...I really don't like the sound of 300 doses.  I hope it doesn't mean what I think it does.

I'm not selling to the general public, or as anything other than 5-MeO-DiPT if that's your concern.

My first encounter with it was with a purple alien I had bought thinking I was getting MDMA.  I know how fucked it was for me to get it not knowing what to expect, I wouldn't do that to anyone else.

Also, I'm doing 5mg a cap, so I can vary the dosage, so the 300 doses really only comes out to me 1.5 grams...

**5-Meo-Dipt**


The first time I did this stuff was just a week ago or so.  I ended up doing close to 100mg and felt absolutely nothing.  I was comlpetely disappointed.  Um....just now I did maybe 50mg and I am feeling every bit of it.  Reminds me of this thread: [http://www.bluelight.ru/cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=38&t=001144&p=](http://www.bluelight.ru/cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=38&t=001144&p=)

specifically Sovietcontins post

So far it's really fun.  I mean real fun.  I think I love this stuff.

I'm not too sure about "loving" Foxy, but it definitely is an enjoyable experience.  It sort of felt like MDMA + LSD + Vicidon + some kind of crazy upper to give me shitloads of energy.  My body would keep on having "spasms" of pure energy, it was interesting.  Then other times I would be laying back, feeling sooo good I couldn't even think.  Seconds, please.

Yes, yes "Spams" of energy.  I ended up laying down cause I was feeling a little overwhelmed.  I think I could have had a good time on a thrid of this dose.  Anyway I layed down and yeah, my body kept having these uh spasms of energy or some shit.  I fell asleep.  I woke up about a half hour later fully alert saying something about going to church.  I didnt know where I was or what time it was or nothin.  Overall this was really fun.  I think next time I'll try 15mg or so.

kidz, please don't play with 100mg of foxy in one sitting. if what you had was real foxy, then 100mg would have landed you either in the hospital or the loony-bin. the dosage for foxy is between 6-18mg. i get totally rocked on around 13mg of foxy everytime for the next 6hours. fun stuff.

What I have is definately real foxy.  I should clarify.  I didnt do 100mg at once.  I started out with 25mg insufflated.  Got nothing but a horrible drip.  About an hour later I took a few oral doses that equaled about 50mg.  Still nothing.  I then smoked the rest which was about 25mg.

Tonight was completely different.  I took a single oral dose of about 50mg and I was rocked.  At one point it was so intense that I had to lay down.  I woke up awhile later which I thought was weird.

Anyway, the duration of this drug seems very short which is fine with me.  3 hours after I dosed I am now feeling fine and waiting for the Domino's guy.

I've noticed that Foxy is strange in that you can remain VERY clear headed while things around you seem alien.

I've gotten to 60mgs before.

I don't think 100mgs would neccessarily drive people out of control, although I doubt it would be a good experience.

Foxy did nothing more than subtle below 10mgs for me.  15mg was a more reasonable dose.  30mgs would be my suggested stopping point if you haven't used it a lot.

Ford, another posibility with your batch could be that it was handled improperly.  It oxidases quickly and easy, reducing the potency and increasing the negative side effects.  But who knows?  I'm convinced something was wrong with your batch, though.

**first case of 5-MeO-DIPT (foxy) in pills?**


Looks like EcstasyData.org has just received their first positive test for 5-MeO-DIPT in an "ecstasy" pill. I've seen several posts on the possibility of of research chemicals appearing in pills and the topic of them becoming more popular with the more "mainstream" drug using population, but this is the fist proof I've seen of this actually occuring. Has anyone else seen any official testing results for research chemicals in "ecstasy"?

Here's the link to the pill I'm talking about..

Dancesafe is a better place to go for this, as they've been logging GC/MS results for longer.  Check out the [advanced search engine](https://www.dancesafe.org/labtesting/advanced-search.php).

Unless you're counting DXM, this isn't happening a lot.  There were BZP/TMFPP containing pills going around for awhile, and there has been mention of 5-meo-dipt and 2c-t-7 being sold as ecstasy.

In response to a slight bit of misinformation by CrystalMethBunny (no personal attack or offense meant) ecstasydata.org has pill results logged all the way back to 1995 whilst dancesafe has recorded pill from 1999 onward.  Dancesafe assisted in startup of ecstasydata.org as well as erowid and the MAPS project.  Ecstasydata.org is a compilation of the results from Dancesafe's lab, plus DDL and other sources as well.  Ecstasydata.org tends to post pill testing results for new pills more quickly than DanceSafe, but DS also offers a wealth of information on drugs in general and current media and news happenings, whereas ecstasydata.org is strictly a data resource of pill information for harm reduction workers (like myself), medical professionals and any other intersted party. 

The current dancesafe pill reports do indeed show the same pill that tested positive by the GC/MS test as 5-MeO-DIPT.  This leads to an potentially perplexing situation.  Someone who takes multiple pills of a 5-MeO-DIPT pill could be in for a potentially uncomfortable experience due to its sharp dose/response curve.  Does this indicate a new genre of misrepresented pills using research chems as ingredients?  Possibly, but IMO as long as other cheaper, more readily available adulterants (DXM, Aspirin, Sominex etc....)  these would probably account for a smaller percentage of misrepresented pills.  

To all that read this post, this is yet another reinforcement to the adage, buy a test kit or have someone test you pills for you.  No drug is 100% safe, but harm reduction is exactly that.

1 gram of 5-MeO-DIPT USD $233.00. Common dose of 10-15 mg = 66.6-100 doses per gram.  Cost per dose of USD $2.33-$3.50.

5 grams DXM USD $37.50. Common dose in misrepresented pills (extrapolated): 200-300mg = 16.66 - 25 doses per 5 grams.  Cost per dose of USD $1.50 - $2.25

By my math this shows DXM to be potentially twice as cost effective for an unscrupulous individual to make misrepresented pills.  Using The minimum common dosages for each substance the substance cost per lot of 1000 pills of 5-MeO:  USD 2,330.00.  1000 Pills of DXM: USD $1,500.  This equals an additional profit: USD $ 833.00 for this misrepresenting producer/pusher/what may have you to use DXM instead of 5-MeO-DIPT.

I've seen those aliens around.

There are white ones, and purple ones around.

Pill reports, actually shows the contents of this pill.  The purple ones have "grape kool-aid' in it.  (no kidding)

and hence, the pills smell like grape, (I hear that a lot of people take them, because they think they are vitamins)

Acording to Dance safe the contents of that pill are 5-MeO-DiPT (100.0%) and it mass is 256mg. Does that suggest that there is 256mg of 5-meo-dipt in it? Or does that 100% exclude any fillers?

No, that's weight with binders.  256 mg. is how much the entire pill weighs.  There could be anywhere from 1-200 mg., possibly more.  I'm not really sure what percentage of binders you need to make a pill stay together.

The last two parties I've gone to actually, were in toilet free warehouses.  Kinda nice actually... sure you had to go through the parking lot, across the railroad tracks, and into the nearby gas station if you wanted to use the bathroom, but I never had to step over a 15 year old doing it.

Oh, and don't complain about prices.  I know *you* have a basement full of monkeys with advanced degrees in chemistry, but most of us don't.

These have been around for quite a while.  I took one several months ago, was stupid and didn't test (it was purchased from a trusted friend), and ended up thinking I was going to die of a heart attack for several hours.

Turned me off of 5-MeO-DiPT, to say the least.

I heard there were only 7 mg in these pills, if that's true, I couldn't imagine taking the higher doses I hear people talking about.

It probably would have been a lot of fun if I knew what I was getting.

no you wouldnt of, Foxy sucks. Dont waste your time, unless your planning on getting laid while tripping on it, or are just out there to try psychedelics for experiance comparisons.

**Is Foxy (5-meo-dipt) an MAOI??**


I read a post on here saying that all tryptamines are MAOIs to some degree.  And I know you shouldn't do MAOIs with E.  But when i was researching mixing Foxy with E (a few months ago), no one mentioned a problem with Foxy being an MAOI.

So now I am worried again.  Is Foxy an MAOI?  If so, is it weak enough to mix with E safely?

for the MAO-I effects of Foxy to start to even become chemicaly noticeable you would have to ingest 300-400mg, dont worry about mixing foxy with E. If that kinda candy flip floats your boat then have fun.

Yes, it is an MAOI, as are all tryptamines. Anything that is metabolized by MAO is an MAOI in that it ties up MAO while the enzyme is breaking it down. Most tryptamines are not very strong MAOIs because they break down quickly... for example, DMT or 5-MeO-DIPT. Some tryptamines are strong MAOIs because they have a high bonding affinity for MAO and are very difficult to break down, and they keep the MAO enzymes occupied for a long time, letting other chemicals sit around unmetabolized - the strong MAOI tryptamines include harmine and yohimbine.

You do not need to worry about mixing 5-MeO-DIPT with MDMA... at least, you dont have to worry about MAO being a problem.

So DMT is actually a very mild MAOI? Despite oral dmt doses requiring a separate MAOI?

Another interesting thing is that even though yohimbine is an MAOI, DMT is **not** made orally active by it.

There are 2 kinds of MAO enzymes, A and B. There's lots of info about this on Erowid, they've got an entire section on MAOIs and how they work. Worth reading.

The reason DMT needs another MAOI to work orally is because the MAO enzyme breaks DMT down very quickly. Theoretically, you could take a large enough dose to tie up all your MAO and have enough DMT left over to make you trip, but so far nobody's figured out how much that takes. Over a gram, at least. When you take harmine, the MAO is more attracted to that than the DMT. Its also very hard to break down, so while the MAO is busy working on the harmine, the DMT can do its thing.

**Freebase 5-meo-dipt?**


Simply pouring the 5-meo-dipt into household ammonia yeiled crystals which i assumed was some sort of freebase. I filtered them out and washed them with water and smoked via tweak pipe. I found the onset almost immediate, which was suprising. I found my self fiending for more after the first hit, which is unusual for tryptamines. I ended up smoking a total of 40mg over the course of a few hours. It seems like there is less body load but more of rush. Is there a better freebase procedure? I still think dipt is kind of a drag. It feels like im one of those toads being pressed against those glass plates. Maybe your body hurts for a reason? Man.

**5-meo-dipt = poison?**


I've gone through a fair amount of foxy and find that the body load becomes more annoying with continued use. Not only does it feel like poison to my body, the thoughts I have from the dipt are usually paranoid or unproductive. Yes there are good parts, but it definately lasts longer than 6 hours, especially with higher dosages, which can be annoying. Low doses, in my opinion, are similar to smoking high quality marijuana because they both seem to be sensory stimulants and they both make you hungry. Actually, I think foxy gives you the "munchies" more than marijuana. Could it possibly be more harmfull than other tryptamines, especially since its so complex and synthetic. Isn't it newer than other tryptamines?

10 times? I'm talking more about after you've gone through almost 1/2g, but over time. I've never taken more than 40mg at one time. Does anybody else feel strong body pain and discomfort? I believe it may be a result of the oversensitivity that foxy often causes. I've seen one person vomit from about 35mg, but myself have felt little stomach discomfort. I like smoking the freebase or snorting as opposed to injesting. The physical aspects are just a bit unnerving. I want to know if there is a specific reason, and if so if its due to high toxicity (comparatively).

My average dose was around 17-20mg. And I took it at most 3 times within 7 days, but not usually. I still have quite a bit (about 580mg) and am getting perhaps a little burnt out on it. I know, I don't respect. What sets it apart from other common tryptamines is that Shulgin invented it, and its the most like LSD. I wonder what the consequences are. I'm sure there have people who have taken 1000mg+ over time. Aren't there?

Oh i forgot to mention mixing other drugs with foxy. I have mixed it often with GHB and always marijuana followed by 60mg mirtazapine (remeron)and 500mg Depakote(valproic acid) which I take nightly. Due to those medications I always get a full nights sleep even though I probably shouldnt. Sometimes a re-dose of GHB was necessary to achieve initial sleep. I have taken it with a "clean" head, generally in the morning. It doesnt really give you energy but more wakes you up, and it is often difficult to direct this energy.  I have also mixed it with adderal/dexedrine with not very positive results. I would not like 5-meo-dipt without anti-anxiety agents, but maybe I just like drugs.  Unlike AMT, you can't snort 5-meo-dipt before class, its just too weird and dissociative.

At first I disagreed with Shulgin because he said that 5-meo-dipt was not very visual, but that becomes more apparent the more you take it. This doesnt mean that I didn't get visuals, but never crystaline like you explained (though it did seem electric). The first few times I took it I found it very visual but not hallucinogenic. The visuals for me (now) are warm orange and red colors that appear, like the onset of Mushrooms, but never patterns just wavy. It was never as visual as the first time, where I snorted 12-15mg. But I definately now see how Shulgin could call it visual inactive. Each time I do it now its more introspective and opening. It had such a characteristic feel. Now that I know it, I can feel symptoms from snorting as little as 3mg. Its definately up and down like LSD with alot of little peaks.

Your posts are very informative, and stragely similar to my views and experiences with foxy.  I would guess that i have done it about 15 times, never more than two times a week.  In the beginning i found it to be much more visual than it is now for me, although i do get the trippy hallucinations just like acid.

It is extremely introspective and educational, at least it was the last time i did it.  See my trip report! [click here to read my most recent foxy trip report!](http://www.bluelight.ru/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic&f=30&t=000622)

the willest visuals I have gotten have been from 40mg foxy 200mg mdma

basically everthing that ended in a point would become elongated untill that point looked as if it streched to infinity.

example.  I was in a hotel room looking at the point the walls made in the corner of the room.  I strangly felt as if I were walking on the wall down a path made up of my room.  That led to the end of the universe.  The floor was mable(yeah I was in mexico) and became a pink/grey sky that was to the left of me as I stood on the wall to the right of me.  I turned around to look out a windows and the wall flowed into the glass like a waterfall.  The the building that were outside slid into place as if they were liquid chrome poured over a large cylindrical object.

Needless to say, all very disorienting...

Now to say foxy isn't visually active I cannot, nor can a friend of mine.  Here is her account

I gave 10mg foxy and 90mg mdma to her and she found herself in 3 different places at the same time.  Although she was on the floor rolling around like a freak, she too was in the kitchen talking to me all while swinging in the hammock outside smoke a cigarette(she's not a smoker).  Needless to say it was pretty funny...  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I need to try that combo. When I did E with DMT it made it less visual? Foxy is not really a social drug, you feel alone even if your with people. Everyone looks like their angry or staring at you. Outcast style. I wonder if E would cure that problem.

WOW! someone, who has all my same outlooks on foxy! im amazed.

hydrA, that is funny you should say to add a hit of E.  My best experience was having a mild dose of foxy (10 mgs) and then a few hours later in the afternoon dropping a rather strong pill of MDA, they were gold stars.  I reccomend the combo, it seemed to take away some of the scaryness, and added a bit more loveness.

I don't think 5-MeO-DIPT is likely to be dangerously toxic. I've heard quite a few reports of people taking MASSIVE doses (like, over 50mg!!! Thats 5-10 times an effective dose) and there havent been any serious problems. This drug seems to cause lots of uncomfortable side effects, even in low doses... diarrhea, nausea, etc. It can of course produce the psychological unpleasantness any psychedelic can cause. However, there doesn't seem to be any evidence that it can be physically dangerous in any doses anybody's going to take intentionally. Of course, there's no way to tell yet if it might be any risks from long term frequent use... but I'm not too worried. I suspect this stuff will have a safety profile comparable to psilocybin or LSD.

It is an experimental drug though, so there may be some nasty surprises waiting for people using it. Be aware of that risk and act accordingly.

Extream dehydration...

that's what I have noticed from the foxy/mdma-mda combo...

it sneaks up on you quickly...be aware of what you body needs and take of it...

scary experience - 30mg foxy and too many mg of MDMA...unknown amount...  300 - 700 mg over the night.

I was sitting with my leg pressed up against a surface that was rough.  Kind of like the peblized surface that is sometimes around pools...

anyhow...  I stood up and looked down an my leg looked like all the blood vessals in it had colapsed...  example when you wake up and you have a red marks on your face from you pillow...  just alot deaper... I would say where ever there was a pebble my skin was pressed in about 2 millimeters...  and engordged with blood...  it wasn't very atractive...  normally these kind of indintations would go away with in minutes...  but these lasted for a good 2 hours...

I speculate contriction of the capilaries is what cased this lengthy recovery period.

isn't that was cased gangreen in several DOB overdose vicims???

so just be very careful what ever you do...

I know of 100+ people who have taken 10mg foxy / 90 -100mg MDMA capuses.  These people included those hard heads who had dosed since the 80s.  They all loved them better than any roll they had taken ever...  There were no bad incedences with them and they found that felt not as down the next day as some people do from mdxx.

moderation is the key...

trust me you won't need to take any more then that...

I've heard of people cutting MDMA with Foxy (in capsules) to make the mdma stretch further, like maybe 70mg MDMA and 15mg of Foxy? I'm thinking of smoking some 5-meo-dipt freebase (20mg) with mdma(45mg), or snorting. Both substances give you a "rush" when smoked so it should be interesting.

**detailed/graphic descriptions of sex on 5-meo-dipt...**


i did try a few searches for this but didn't really find what i was looking for

anyways...i don't have any experience with any psychedelic drugs (except 1 lousy acid trip). my boyfriend has some foxy, and he comes home from school in less than 2 wks, but he wants to sell it b4 he comes home. i REALLY want to experience foxy with him, but i don't have much experience/knowledge of the experience (yes i have checked out erowid and bl's trip report forum and this forum), so, i'm having a hard time convincing him its worth taking foxy with me.

i told him that from what i've heard, sex on foxy is MORE than AMAZING, and he seems really intrigued by the potential experience of this. so...what i'm looking for is your most detailed description of sex on foxy. how foxy makes you feel (sexually related) as well as how it feels to fuck while on foxy. we've yet to have sex on ANY drug (he doesn't approve at all of my meth usage, and he has this *policy* against fucking on E), and i've heard that sex on foxy is a very worthwhile experience. 

so...be descriptive and help me convince him he HAS to try this with me. i'm gonna have him read this thread, provided i get good responses   ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)   thanks

I've had quite a number of entheogenic experiences with quite a number of various psychedelic substances.  In my 10 years of tripping, I've probably had nearly 50% of them with my girlfriend.  And well sex has always happened at some point (if not during most of it  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  ) during the trip.

5-MeO-DiPT, besides being a psychedelic of poor quality (IMHO) in every way, shape, and form has earned the notoriety of being the only psychedelic I was unable to have sex on, or do really anything for that matter.  It had nothing to do with not being able to 'rise to the occasion', it was just that the body-load was so horrendous and severe, all I could do was lay there in that very unpleasant state and ride it out.  And I only took 11 mg, which may have been a little more than I needed, but it wasn't that much.

Only after the comedown, when the body load had eased up somewhat, was sex possible.  And to be honest, it was not any better than sex had been on any other material.  I find babywoodrose seeds, 2C-I, and even LSD to be far superior.  I'd say 4-AcO-DET had the most tactile/erotic enhancement of all the ones I've tried but I don't like the trip at all with that material either.

I'll be the first to admit that my experience (with having sex on it, not the fact that I found it to suck in general) with 5-MeO-DiPT doesn't obviously doesn't reflect the norm, but I just thought I'd share it with you.  Remember everyone can react differently.

and for those of you with good experiences of foxy+sex...get to replying would ya!!!

oh, and...i know everyone reacts differently with drugs. but...is it common for guys to have probs with rising to the occassion while on foxy? (he's never had a problem with gettin hard while on coke or E or while drunk) is it likely to take forever for him to orgasm?(not that i'd mind...)

i appreciate everyone's help. i'm still checkin out erowid and the bl archives for info, since i'm not really into psychedelics, and have never tried foxy. yup--i'm always a well-informed drug user b4 i fuck up my mind and body   ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

ok ive never written a romance novel or anything of the sorts, but Ill give it a whirl. Me and my wife enjoy enthogenic sexual realtions greatly and partake in them  whenever the occasion arises. I have recently come across some 5-meo-dipt recently and first tried it on myself to gauge a proper dosage. Started with 10 mg. Nice tryptamine like buzz, mild visuals, slightly enhanced tactile sensations, but not what i expected. Also i might add the body load was rather intense. on my 2nd try i dosed 10 again and my wife also dosed 10 mg. But this time we also took 4 mg of loperamide on the advice of a friend.

Wow. All i can say. With the body load lifted off tzctile sensation increases greatly. Much more enjoyable triptamine body buzz. But no change in visuals. After a futile attempt at watching and understanding the movie "Novacaine" we commenced to some hot and heavy  foreplay. While the tactle sensations were incredible, I dont think it is the sensations alone that lend foxy its aphrodisiac properties. I noticed a strong senergy between the endorphins released during sexual stimulation and the foxy. After what seemed like forevor with foreplay we went to the bed room and got totally naked. Again...strongest tactile sensations occuring during sexual stimulation. In fact incredible sensations, like waves of orgasmic euphoria washing over your body...and that was just with foreplay. Now on the note of actual intercourse, every little detail is noticed. i.e. the texure of the sexual organs, the speed, the angle, all has a noticible difference on the sexual experience. While all different, all are extreemely pleasurable. And unlike while under MDMA, there wasnt a sense of over stimulation, just and incredible rush of pleasure. I partook with glee while my wife orgasmed many times, and as we switched to every position imaginable... When i finally allowed myself to come ( at least i think i willed it...no entirely sure) I was drowining in what is the most profoundly intense endorphin rush i have ever experienced. I also dont think i have ever came so much in my life also. All in all, one of the best , if not the best, enthogenic lovemaking experiences of my life. i give it 2 thumbs up. BTW after the first episdode we went several more times. And both awoke very very sore the next day. But was well worth it

I think if your man is hard on those other drugs, he'll have no problem being hard on foxy. So I wouldn't worry there.

As for my experienced with foxy -- well, I've only tried it once, and I didnn't find it to be sexual at all. Overall I found it to be a very weak psychedelic and I did not get many effects from it. The most noticeable effects I had were sound distortion and some time slow down and pupil dilation. Overall it was a disappointing eperience.

If you want a sexual drug, I suggest meth (which I know you'd like anyways  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ), GHB, alcohol  or even other psychedelics like acid. Sex on psychedelics, while not usually the best/hottest sex I've had, IS very interesting and enjoyable. Emphasis on interesting -- there really isn't anything like it.

Starlight i cant stress enough how much the absence of the body load is, and also how dose sensitive the substance also is. for some poeple there is a big difference between 8 mg and 12 mg. I would start low your first time mabey 6-8 mg range and increase at a later date if you felt you needed the extra boost. Also the loperamide is also a must. ( most commonly found in ammodium ad) It is used to nullify the horrendous body load that weighs you down so much. If you have any questions ask away i would be more than glad to help.

While I'm not saying it doesn't work, or rather it didn't work for you, lot's of people have used loperamide with 5-meO-DiPT and saw no reduction in body load.  Personally I never got the intestinal problems with it in the first place.  Just felt like shit from it.

I completely dislike 5-meo-dipt.....but...yeah there is a but...

10 - 15mg 5-meo-dipt + 90 - 100mg MDMA can be alot of fun...

take'm both at the same time.  Personally, I have found the body load gone.   My wife still doesn't like it although she came and came again for about 6 hours.

Sex on acid is better.

At 6 mg I did achieve a nice mild entheogenic state in the begining but by the third hour point the strong body load hit me as before and I felt very uncomfortable.  Ended up having to take a valium which is something I normally never do.  With so many other substances available that give me a much easier and pleasant state to work with, 5-MeO-DiPT is bottom of the list.  Individual reactions do vary.

Yes shulgin is getting a little self optomistic when he says: 

"It has a lot of things going for it. It is short-lived, a virtue in many people's minds. It may vie with 2C-B as a potential aphrodisiac. It is reasonably easy to synthesize. It is of a pretty high potency. The physical side-effects are minimal"

Yea he forgot to say it sucks.

YMMV!

I like foxy. For me: no body load, lovely skin feel, mild CEVs, nice speedyness. I find it very useful for offsetting the soporific effects of bud. It takes 24 mg to work for me.

I made love on it once and it was wonderful. I was truly wrapped up in my partner, the touching was exquisite, the orgasm earth-shattering. This with my bed partner of 25 years!

I tried this crap once and absolutely hated it.  I felt like I had the flu for four hours.  My stomach was so upset for a good 3 hours and I couldn't even vomit for ages.  When I finally threw up, it wasn't like any other "drug puke" that I've ever had before.  I felt like I poisoned my body horribly and my body just needed to get rid of the poisons.  The body load was so horrible I wanted to rip myself apart...also, my girlfriend that took it with me got horribly depressed by the end of the trip.  Definately NOT something I ever want to do again, unless maybe I was given it for free when I already had a good amount of MDMA in me.

I did 12mg of foxy once. I took 1mg of xanax during the comeup and this eased the body load. I was going to endure the body load, but it was very unpleasant. I have to say this was one of the most disappointing psychadelics I have tried. The euphoria and sound distortion were the only positive things I can think of. And on the comedown it played with my head quite a bit.  For me this drug wasn't sexual at all.

Hrmm once again, confusion has set in because of an overgeneralization, one not only by Shuglin, but also by the members of this board. He said it had great potential for enthogenic sexual relations...not that it was a godsend aphrodisiac. While sex on it for me was good, I was definately not in the mood until i was properly stimulated. Other than that i didnt really want to have sex ntil that point and time...Just my 2 cents.

I have had one good experience from 25mg...

In fact my first experience, after it was all said an done.  The great part was the end, when you have to say, "finally it's over..."  and you realize it wasn't worth the trouble.

A great paranoia aspect and a truely disconnected from most everything around you always makes the day...

I would say the best way to describe it is all potentially bad parts of acid + the need to take a big ass dump.

Sounds good eh???

So far one or two people have said they liked it, and it was a good sexdrug.  The rest havea ll said it sucks.  Final conclusion....5-MeO-DiPT is overrated garbage.

Foxy is not crap, though it is overrated.  I find the tactile aspects very pleasant, as long as the dose is not too high.  It is definitely not a deep psychedelic though, but this lack of head trip has a positive aspect in that the substance can be used in a more recreational context.  Then again, why not just take 2C-I?

There is this [link](http://www.bluelight.ru/cgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=41&t=001231) in SLR that might help you too.  

I personally think foxy is great.  I am lucky enough to not be bothered by the stomach calamities others have.  I have done doses ranging from ~10mgs to ~30mgs, and have always had a pleasant, enjoyable experience.

I think foxy is a good tool in a role-playing scenario.  Its easier to get into the character while under the psychadelic influence, and the tactile sensations are tremendously enhanced.  

I would rate foxy higher than lsd on my subjective list of favorite substances.

IMO, foxy is great for sex.  While it does not make me want to have sex in particular, if the situation arises, it is intense and insane.

Think about fucking Denise Richards and is seems like it is happening, the visualazions along with the increased sense of touch are out of this world.  Plus I find that you can control your point of release with ridiculous precesion...I think I'll come....... NOW!

Your reload time is greatly diminished too.

But then again, I get close to the same results with acid, 2CB etc, just with those, its too easy to go off on a tangent and forget why you are there  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

> Here's how you ended up hearing about sex and foxy: Alexander Shulgin is a nutcase. He mentioned foxy having a sexual aspect. People who read his material take foxy and have the sex thing in their heads and my guess is that for 90% of people it's nothing more than a placebo effect.

**Opinions on different ways to take 5-meo-dipt?**


Some friends and I may take foxy this weekend.  One has done it once, and is reluctant to do it again because of the digestive problems, but that was at 16mg.  The other two have never tried it, but one has a pretty sensitive stomach.  So, I was reading on Erowid looking for alternatives to taking foxy orally.

I saw some had tried sublinually for five minutes.  It was not clear whether they gave up after five minutes or whether five minutes was enough time for sublingual ingestion, though it appears that it was the former.  Anyone have any experiences with this method?

I also saw a couple people who insufflated it, which sounds the most promising to me.  One reported that it was unpleasant, but that faded after about 15 minutes, and there was less (or no) nausea for most of the trip.  That sounded promising.  I think my friends might be able to stand a little nasal burning and bad taste for 15 minutes (before the foxy hits) rather than the nausea during the experience (especially if we go out).  However, I thought I read that with some drugs, all insufflating it does is provide a different path to the stomach (i.e., it does not go to the lungs but instead drips to the throat and into the stomach, so you really shouldn't experience less nausea plus you have the sinus problems.  Does anyone who has tried this have opinions?

Finally, there is always smoking it.  Other than pot, I've only smoked dmt, only a couple times, so I'm very inexperienced with this.  If anyone has experience with smoking foxy and things you get the benefits and avoid the nausea, I'd like to hear about it, along with any recommendations for changing dosage.

If I haven't thought of anything else that you might recommend (not plugging, though), feel free to add it.

Thanks,

~psychoblast~

Snorting could be an alternative. I did this a few times, with around 8-10mg, and it is effective and not too bad..some burning and dripping but not unbearable...effects were almost identical to oral ingestion...but body load was present as well...

To smoke it, you would probably need to freebase the powder first.

what i experienced with insufflation as route of ingestion is that after an initial 10 mg oral dose accompanied with slight stomach squench and bits of mindfuck, 7 hours later 5 mg went up my nose it brought my trip up further then i were i was from my oral intake adventure. although the dose was only half and my body should have become tollerant to 5-meo-dipt it didn t turn out that way.

it felt way better warmer colors warmer everything cool hallucinations. you get the point. its no waste just watch your dosage because in your nose it smells like something died.

the other to routes smokin/sublingual don t appeal to me that much.

Insufflating it is not any easier on the body for me. But it is pretty horrible. While the burn for me is not as bad as for most people, the drip is horrible. You can't wash it down even if you drink a lot and there is a very unpleasant aftertaste that lingers for about an hour or so. I say yuo should take it orally unless you want to IV it or experiment with freebasing it. Insufflating it is something I can't recomment, it really has the worst taste of anything I have ever tried in my life, drugs or not. 

Also I have noticed that there are a lot of posts on 5-meo-dipt recently, something tells me that this tryptamine will not be legal for very long.

Since snorting is not that different (in come up time, body load, intensity etc) from a pill, its not worth the unpleasant drip. Loperamide or pepto-bismol usually prevents any problems. You are more likely to vomit from snorting than orally (some people gag from the taste/burn).

The freebase is easy to make with ammonia. Simply pour ammonia in a vial, add the meodipt; they   become larger fluffier crystals. Pour it through a filter (fine metal works the best) and you are left with the freebase. Smoke it off foil/lightbulb, but avoid burning with a direct flame. The smoke tastes nasty, not unlike its actual taste. An immediate buzz is felt, but still comes on somewhat slowly. You reach the peak in about 45 minutes, and comedown rather fast, but transient effects can be felt for 4-6 hours later (dose dependent). 

Also the IM or IV method seems interesting. I have never personally done it, but I've seriously considered it. If I were to actually stick a needle in myself for foxy, it would be intravenously.

So far the best way i found to take this so-so substance (i take it because i have it) is orally. Maybe IV is better, but im wary of unnecessary needles.

i sniffed foxy once, probably about 25 mgs and it was the worst drug experiance of my life. i felt like complete shit for the first 2 hours, i couldnt do anything except curl up in a ball and wait it out....... if you think the body load is less harsh when sniffing it, then your dead fucking wrong. the body load when sniffing was a million times worse, not only was it the worst burn i ever felt in my life, but as soon as the burning stoped the stomach problems hit me like a ton of fucking bricks. not to mention the fact that you start tripping complete balls real fast, combined wit h the stomach thing it is NOT fun. it was the strangest thing, it felt like my asshole and my stomach were one thing, like as if i could shit out my mouth and puke out my asshole, it was like as if i was doing both at the same time, it was a complete nightmare. after about 2 hours all the bad effects whent away tho, and i felt REAL nice for about 8 hours. definetly not worth it tho

For a lot of drugs, nasal administration allows the drug to be absorbed into the blood stream through the mucous membrane, bypassing the stomach.  Some drugs will not pass through the membrane, or don't pass through it well, and those go to the stomach.  I would think that 5-meo-dipt would be absorbed just fine nasally, but I am not sure.

Keep in mind that most of the nausea is produced in the brain and not the stomach, so using another route is only going to effect the stomach problems to a certain degree.  And because other methods of administration are often more effective, it may be worse because the experience as a whole may be more powerful.

Though you've said you are against it, I've heard some pretty good reports about rectal administration of 5-meo-dipt.  Some people report it reduces the nausea very much.

There's no nausea, it doesn't sting at all back there  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)  and you need only 50-75% of your normal oral dose to get the same effects.  Snorting is not worth it, for the nausea is worse than with oral 5-MeO-DIPT and the drip is abominable.  Smoking works well, but be prepared for that disgusting taste and the resulting few minutes of transient nausea.  Trust me, just stick it up the bum, you won't regret it!

I know that you're mainly looking for alternative methods but I have found that if you keep the amount smaller (8mg-10mg) the stomach problems tend to be lesser also.  The first time I took 5-meo-dipt my stomach was so upset and my skin itched so much I almost never tried it again (it was about 15mg), but now that I have tried again at slightly smaller doses it is one of my favorites.

Personally, I would rather chance an upset stomache rather than have to worry about the drain for the next hour or so.

for those of you who are thinking about freebasing foxy, keep in mind that the freebase form of this chemical is extremely unstable.  don't convert any more than you plan on taking at once.  i've lost over a quarter of a gram that way when i tried to store some of the freebased chem for later.  btw, i love foxy very much.  please be careful with it so me and everyone else never have to resort to illegal means to aquire it.  peace.

**5-MeO-DiPT via IM?**


"A couple of people I know" are going to be trying 5-MeO-DiPT for the first time soon.  One of those people will be using a gelcap, and taking it orally.  The dose is not decided yet, but they will be ingesting somewhere between 6 - 12 mg.  

The other friend is concerned about nausea.  He/She doesn't want to rail it for fear that the drip will make them nauseuous, and IV is out of the question as well.  

Is it possible to inject it IM?  Will this help to alleviate the nausea and upset stomach?  What would be the risks involved?  This is that persons favorite way to enjoy K, so they're curious about the 5-MeO-DiPT using this method as well.  

I don't really think it's a good idea, and I told them that, but I'm asking a wider, more experienced crowd for a more informed opinion.

Thanks,

Mike

*bump*

Somebody has to have at least an opinion on this.  I see via Erowid that DPT can be done via IM if it is dissolved into solution, so this leads me to believe that it's possible as well for 5-MeO-DiPT.

Other trips reported here about 5-MeO-DiPT via IV state that it eliminates (or at least greatly reduces) the nausea and body load.  Would it be safe to say the same would be true via IM??

Just to clear the air, the nausea doesn't come from the physical drug's corrosiveness on the stomach lining like you may think, rather it's receptors in the stomach being activated and giving a nauseas feeling.

Murple, Ive always thought of you as the ambasedor of R.C.s to the public. But to see you go against Injection as a method of adminstration of R.Cs is almost an act of betrayl. I would much rather Inject a Research Chem, of KNOWN purity then Street drugs such as Smack or Coke, of Unkown purity.

**Concern over 5-Meo-Dipt**


About three weeks ago I obtained some 5-MeO-Dipt and promptly took 6mg in a gel cap.  It was okay at home.  The next night we took another 8mg at a club.  That was intense and fun.  After about four hours it started to wear off and we decided to take another 8mg.  Big mistake.  This literally terrified me.  I totally underestimated this substance.  I was hoping it would be similar to Molly...Wrong!  A few days later I tried 4mg and was again humbled and freightened.  I have simply decided this substance is not for me.  But it's been about 14 days and I'm still not "right".  I haven't forgotten my name or anything, but I have mild panic attacks and just don't feel like myself.  Anyone who is considering RC PLEASE done not under estimate these things.  I'm an MDMA man, but this was something altogether different...

It takes a big person to admit that they got their ass kicked by a drug. Right on man. I wept like a little bitch when i over-did it on 5MEO-DMT.

Let this be a lesson to everybody who thinks ordering RCs, especially if you havent done a lot of reading, is a good idea.

> I was hoping it would be similar to Molly...Wrong! 

Ugh... I really wish idiots would stop trying to compare 5-MeO-DIPT to MDMA. They've got very little in common. I don't know if this rumor got started by dumb ravers that can't tell MDMA from airplane glue, or if some people are deliberately spreading this idea to create a market for it, but whatever the origin, it's a pretty stupid thing to be saying. 5-MeO-DIPT is a tryptamine psychedelic, if its going to be compared to anything, it should be LSD or psilocybin. Telling people its similar to MDMA is dangerous misinformation. It got Bytor into a bad situation, and I'm sure it's caused similar nasty surprises for other people.

5-MeO-DIPT is an LSD-like psychedelic, and even if it is often relatively mild, it is still a tryptamine psychedelic that needs to be treated with the respect that class of drugs deserves. It can certainly cause bad trips, especially if the person taking it is expecting something like MDMA. Also, it is a highly experimental drug and carries all the risks that any experimental drug use involves. If you are telling someone about 5-MeO-DIPT, please do not spread bullshit about it being like MDMA, do not forget to mention that it is an experimental substance with unknown risks. And for fuck's sake, don't use that horrible retarded name "foxy"...

Bytor - I wouldn't worry. So far, no serious problems have shown up with 5-MeO-DIPT, other than idiots spreading misinformation about it and trying to sell it as ecstasy. I doubt you've done any damage to yourself. The effects you are feeling are most likely just a little bit of mental shell-shock from having several bad experiences with it in a short period. Anxiety and other emotional trauma often happens after bad experiences with any psychedelic. It generally passes quickly, usually as soon as you stop worrying about whether or not you've caused any permanent damage.

I the first world war this effect to the nervous system was called shell shock. Our stupid euphemisms of our language had changed the name of this condition to battle fatigue. Then during the war in Korea this same condition was called Operational Exhaustion. Then during the Vietnam war the name of this condition was once again changed to Post traumatic stress disorder. Just some food for thought.

bytor- if the anxiety persists, see a doctor.  They will be able to help you.  Trust them, tell them what happened, you won't get in trouble for talking to a doctor.  They may be able to give you something for the anxiety.

But as murple said, usually this sort of thing passes after a week or two or three.

Yeh dipt is definately not mdma...its more like a "body buzz"...and gettin whipped on 5meodmt atlas....i know how it feels...i tried...did a tad bit 2 much, which isnt hard to do since very dose sensitiv...in this one dream this is what happened

I smoked a lil much..20mg's maybe...as soon as i hit it, i saw this cloud of smoke come out of my 7 friends bodies who took lil hits before me.and so did i...and the smoke from everyone came into the bowl, while i hit it, and i saw it go threw my body...i looked up, and like five faces were comin out of all my friends faces....i said a couple things real quick like "oh god" , "yooo", "what the hell is happening"...i started to travel upstairs , went in the bathroom..while my body was shaking....got my clothes off, stumbling...turned on the shower, while starting to freak out a little bit...got in the shower, laid down, kept on laying this way, then that way...under the water....and then finally i was like...ok, its calming down, this shower feellls good to though...and i got out after 5-10 minutes...got my clothes back on..walked downstairs while still seeing a lil shit....and told everyone what just happened..like 100 times...."THE CRAZY DREAMS THAT I HAVE".....

but on a second note...if your goin to attempt to research those 3 main chemicals, be careful, dont do to much...all my friends and i still see trails of shit at times.....esp at nite....def not good stuff to do, if you dont want to see trails the rest of your life..cuz who knows if there gonna stay or go...thats my comment...i hope some of you take up on the advice...and as far as the drug acid is concerend....DONT TAKE ACID...all its going to do is mess you up, and promote terrorist actions.....also who do you think is going to win, the sober people....or the country where a # of people have done lots of acid, and are fucked in the head....respect

Well, I don't mind calling it "foxy."  A tryptamine by any other name...

As for foxy, I had been told before using it that it was similar to ecstasy.  Of course, I took too much trying to get it to feel that way and had a somewhat lengthy trip, though it turned out to be pleasant in its own way.  Then I started criticizing everyone who compared foxy to mdma.  Then I did some more with a friend.  Afterwards, he was explaining it to other people and he said the closest he could compare it to was ecstasy. What the hell?!! I thought.  And I realized there must be a reason people keep comparing it to ecstasy even though it is so different.  And so I thought about this.

I concluded there are really two types of trips:

1. Mental and sensory trips.

2. Purely sensory trips.

Mental trips are when you starting thinking in strange, alien ways.  You can't really shut your mind off.  Your brain is thinking differently and that is the main component of the trip.  Mental trips pretty much always include a sensory trip, meaning you are getting weird sensory input simultaneous with your weird way of thinking.  I don't know if there is any drug out there that provides a purely mental trip...  Maybe something like salvia.

The purely sensory trips are different.  You get altered/enhanced sensory input but your thinking processes are not altered so much as they are suppressed.  You get stupid rather than introspective.  Ecstasy and foxy do this.  You will be forgetful, kind of like when you are stoned.

People compare foxy to ecstasy because, if you are asked to describe foxy, you try to think of any other sensory trip that does not have a mental trip component or much philosophical introspection and you will probably think of ecstasy.  Here's an example:  On acid or shrooms, I look at the stars and see a bunch of geometric patterns in the twinkling lights, so it almost seems I understand the path of the stars and they are all in sync or maybe it seems like the whole universe is a ceiling of twinkling lights ten feet above my head or I could see the stars in some completely different weird way that I can't begin to describe when sober.  On foxy or ecstasy, I look at the stars and see a bunch of pretty lights I have trouble focusing on and that's about it.

But, though foxy and ecstasy are similar in that they are purely sensory trips, ecstasy gives you a built in "buffer" by providing you with a super-positive mental attitude for the trip.  Foxy does not do this. With foxy, you have to bring your own puny mortal mental attitude, positive or negative, to the experience.  Unlike ecstasy, foxy will not make you so happy you overlook the nausea, the chills/heat, the little muscle aches, etc.  Is foxy overall an enjoyable trip?  I think so.  But you have to bring your own positive mental attitude.  And don't expect it to be euphoric like rolling because foxy, unlike ecstasy, does not come with built-in euphoria.

i took a 30mg pill of foxy about 2 years ago (i know its a big dose, but not much info was around about the drug at the time and those were the pills that were going around) anyway, after that experience of thinking that my head was a giant blueberry and was going to explode for 4 hours, i experienced severe anxiety/panic attacks for about 3 months. it was weird because the drug wasn't that strong, i mean visually or body wise, but it was the strongest feeling of uneasiness and paranoia i've ever experienced. those feelings persisted for about 3 months, like i said. i had never had any previous problems with anxiety or panic attacks. it was really strange, and really shitty. i have actually heard of this happening with a lot of people. it's like that nervous speedy feeling where you just want to pace while you're on the drug never really goes away. it's like 2 years later now, and i don't know if it's really gone or if i just dealt with it psychologically. i know that the panic attacks happened about 15 times a week for the first few months, then slowly decreased as i learned how to cope with them. now i have a weak one maybe every 5 months. i don't really know if this helps, but i have heard of a lot of people having anxiety problems after large or excessively consecutive doses of this drug. can't know for sure as it is still a research chemical, and long term effects aren't well known... good luck and i hope you feel better -- 

also, i would reccommend to people with pre-existing anxiety or panic disorders to *not* take this drug, just because i've known so many people personally who have been affected in that manner.

Thanks for posting about what is happening to you.  People need to be aware of this sort of information.

Maybe time will help your symptoms.  You didn't mention your plans one way or the other, but I would encourage you to take at least a three month break from anything stronger than alcohol or pot.  Good luck!

Actually, I attribute the comparisons between 5-MeO-DIPT to MDMA to something much simpler than vague similarities... hype. One or two early reports made comparisons to ecstasy (without coming out and saying "its like ecstasy!" - just some generalized comparisons). That, combined with the name foxy, has led to a hype phenomenon. People say its like ecstasy because other people have said its like ecstasy, coloring their expectations. A similar phenomenon has occured with AMT (although for different reasons, in this case a misunderstanding of chemistry). Neither drug has much in common with MDMA, yet both are frequently compared to ecstasy. Behold the power of hype.

1st time I took foxy it felt more like half a pill of E then LSD, its felt simular to MDMA, but all the other times I took it, it just felt shitty.  It may be that the first time I look it I didn't mean to, I had a bottle in my pocket with about 500 mgs and like 100mgs leaked out onto my leg cause the bottle wasn't closed tight enough. Then I didn't notice cause the jar was wet when i put it in there cause i washed it off.  Either way, now whenever I take foxy it sucks, like eating a pound of dog shit with some LSA mixed in with it.

**Experienced 5meoDipt Nauts- Help w/this**


I recently got ahold of this wonderful psychedelic and had the best trip of my life this weekend. Cruised around Miami's south beach enjoying al the colorful neon signs and beautiful buildings. Great CEVs and imaginary worlds to be immersed in. The only thing that kinda scared me was that the whole time after the comeUP, I could barely feel my legs. When I walked, I walked as if out of instinct. I just walked forward without having to think about it, but if I tried to actually feel my legs, I was practically numb from the waist down. But it wasnt the kind of numbness u get from coke, K, or poor blood circ. It was more like mind over matter... Is this mental dissapearance of ur legs while walking normal? or may it be just some kind of dangerous effect from possible serotonin syndrome?

Its probably either in your imagination or the result of some mild effect on your blood vessels (similar to what causes a cold feeling in your fingers on mushrooms). It's probably nothing to worry about. Of course, this IS an experimental drug, so it is concievable that this is a sign of permanent nerve damage and that you're about to die. Now that's probably not likely, but the point is that with experimental drugs, you can't really rule out anything. These aren't drugs that you should take casually. Low doses and infrequent use are strongly recommended.

If the only thing that scared you was numbness, you really should stop and think what you're doing. You are using your body as a guinea pig... you're being a lab rat to take some experimental drug which has never been formally studied and which little is known about. The potential dangers are unknown, and if you have any problems, no doctor in the world is going to know how to treat you. You should have a good healthy respect and fear of the risk you're taking simply by using this drug. I'm not saying don't use it... I'm just saying use it with your eyes open. Know what you're messing with, and proceed with the caution and respect that experimental drugs deserve.

As an aside, if this is the best psychedelic you've had, you really need to try some better drugs. It's pretty far down on my list since it has some serious flaws - too many physical side effects and not enough good psychedelic effects.

i agree...  this can be a very very fun psychadelic... its not much of a mind trip or exploration of your brain...  usually just eye candy...  which isnt bad at all in my opinion...   im sure it was just your head letting you know it had control over your legs...  it was good to know that you were walking on instinct, i usually have to think about it and i dont feel like im walking normal when i actually am...  a good hearty dose of foxy rates second to a good hearty dose of LSD for me...   but then again i have much more exploring of psychadelics to do... im looking forward to experimenting with different cacti...  and looking forward to trying AMT...   and i do agree with the above post...  proceed with caution...  and if you can safely write down your experiences (without getting in any sort of trouble)... do so...  oh and i also agree that you should moderate your use of this chemical until more is discovered about it

Not much of a mind trip? My friend you are seriously mistaken. I have never been as out oif reality as 5MeoDipt has put me

And bout the walking, I get that to, this stuff makes me incredibly restless and I must be doing something at all times on it, whether  it be walking, running, or twidling my fingers  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for the support!

I'd have to say though, "5" gives me probably just as good as a mind trip as acid does. Just as strong, but more controllable in my opinion. You can put a straighter face on "5", whereas on 'cid you can look like you're GONE into space.

5-meo-dipt is worthless compared to lsd

you dont even know what its doing to you first off

that substance is a vile, nasty trip...poison to your body.  the mental high sucked.  It definetly has zero depth compared with lsd.  

Im sorry, I'm wrong, you cant even BEGIN to compare the two...

ive taken doses between 10mg and 25mg, and ill tell you foxy isnt anything special

Another friend of mine mentioned the same thing about not being able to feel her legs... funny, never happened to me.

As for foxy/5-meo-dipt, it seems some people love the drug (like me) and others don't.  

I think it just may effect different people differently.  Add to that how dose dependant it is, and you are going to have a huge variety of experiences.

and IMHO, foxy can easily/sometimes be more fun than LSD.  (though I would take LSD 9 times out of 10 over 5-meo-dipt) especially when mixed with pot.  Why do you ask? well LSD can lead you away to hell if you let it, and foxy is much less inclined to do so.  It is also much more controlable which is a plus if you are out in public (aka clubbing  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  )

Now, if only the side effects didn't increase exponentialy above 10-15mgs.

Exponentialy? Its more like y = X^X^X^X (Where Y is intensity and X is dose  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) )

I have never had a more intense trip than on a non-accidental overdose (Yes overdose, as in to much) of 5Meo-DiPT. It literaly took me two months to recover back to some baseline that made sense

Yeah, 5-meo-dipt dosing sucks. I have taken 15mg and had a decent trip with some visuals and psychedelic effects. And I have had one of the most powerful, out-of-this-world experiences with 25mg. I know some people who have had experiences like that with ~15mg. People's reactions vary GREATLY to 5-meo-dipt and it is also extremely dose dependent. START LOW!!! Also, I have experienced something similar to what you described. It's kind of like I can't really feel the top layers of my body. For example I wouldn't be able to feel it if I rubbed my hand up and down an arm lightly, but if I press on my arm, then I can feel it. So weird.

> My opinion exactly.  The benefit of foxy is that it gives me a nice body high, interesting audio effects, and mild visuals with minimal mind fuck.  These effects, combined with its controllability, make it a good party drug.  Unlike with acid, the lack of mindfuck actually enables you to hold intelligible conversations with non-tripping people.  If you are taking a dose that gives you unpleasant side effects, chances are that the dose is too high.  Foxy is not supposed to be an intense, acid-like psychedelic, and if you try to have an acid-like trip off it, chances are you will take a dose that is WAY more than optimal.  I get threshold effects at about 10 mg, and my preferred dosage is 15-20 mg.  Anything above 20 mg is simply TOO MUCH for me, even though I could have an intense trip off a higher dose.  When I accidentally took 25-30 mg of foxy, the body high was so intense that I could hardly feel certain parts of my body.  It was certainly NOT worth the insane visuals I got.  If I wanted visuals like that, I'd just take 5 hits of acid and not have to deal with the body load.

Every time i've done LSD i've done foxy 15 times. Like most drugs its very opinionated. One person loves it the next hates it. As for the numbness, I find it gives the same physical disconnected feeling that come with mush and 2-CB but not like a painkiller like K. However the numbness is felt in my hands mostly which i enjoy. But hey, thats just me.

80mgs?  I gpt my ass kicked on taking 8mgs and then, liking it, took another 8mgs about four hours later.  What was 80mgs like?  I can't imagine.  It took me almost 2 months to feel normal (baseline) again.  But I feel that 5-Meo-Dipt effects people diffrently.

I also have a feeling there are batches of 5-MeO-DiPT that are either cut or poorly made.  That would account for why some people take up to 100 mg of that one, or 300 mg of AMT.

**5-Meo-Dipt "Foxy" - Unpredictable!**


I started experimenting with Foxy about 2 months ago.  I have tripped on it about 8-10 times, so I would say I am fairly experienced.  I usually do anywere from 20-30 mgs.

But the past 2 times I did Foxy, something weird happened.  It had always taken efect really quick on me...around 30 minutes.  I always felt it before everyone else I was tripping with.  However, all the sudden it started taking 2-3 hours.  The first time that happened, I ended up taking a second dose because I thought I had accidently taken an empty capsule the frist time and when both kicked in I was so rocked.  It wasn't a good experience.  So the next time this happened I just waited.  It took over 2 hours to take effect...while all of my friends were tripping, I was still totally sober.

Has this happend to anyone else??  There dosn't seem to be any logical explanation for it.  I am going to a rave this weekend and I plan to trip, but I don't know if I should take the foxy 2 hours before the rave so I'm not waiting around sober or if it will be normal again.  I love Foxy, but I hate how unpredictable it is!!

This is just conjecture, but if you have done 5-meo-dipt ten times in two months the problem you are having could very well be due to a tolerance buildup.  Try giving it a break for a couple of weeks and see if that makes a difference.

It could just be breaking down with age, if you're storing it improperly. Is it cold, dark and dry? If not, its probably degrading.

I have foxy near 2 years old that still has (seemingly) near full potency.

I agree with the tolerance idea.  I've seen a post on here claiming foxy has no tolerance, but I have had a different experience taking it 2 nights in a row, with only about half effect the second night.

Actually I did it back to back weekends not long ago and it came on pretty quick--less than 30 minutes--the first weekend.  5-6 days later, when I did the same amount, it took about an hour to get to that point.  But each time I do foxy, it is a little different in so many ways.  Of these above 2 occasions, the first time I was rather active the whole time, while the second time I was immobile the 2nd half of the trip, just wanted to lay still and relax.  Both good, just different.

And I only do 8mg, so it is easy to be off 1mg or so between doses and I figure that may have some effect.  All in all, hard to conclude anything from my experiences, except that I think there is some tolerance issue.

Oh, and it sounds like you are doing too much.  I mean, jeez, would you roll every weekend for 8 weeks?  Because that is too much.  Foxy is different, but there is no reason to think it is safer than e.  I'd take a break if I were you.

I thought of all those reasons too, but I never eat at least 6 hours before taking it.  And I do store it in a dark, dry place.  I guess it must be a tolerence thing, but then my friends have all done it the same amount as me and I'm the only one this happens to.  I  know I have been doing it a lot, I took last weekend off...when I used to roll I did that a lot more though!!

What out for a change of diet as well, foxy is not as well documented as many other drugs, and a change in diet may decrease absorption rates.  Just an assumption.

**5-MeO-DiPT body load in relation to ethnic background**


Alright, when I first started taking 5-MeO-DiPT at medium doses (before I learned how nice IV is) I had an enormous body load...Actually most of the people who took simular doses reacted the same, except for the people who's family history lead back to Ireland...Could there be a connection? I'm nordic in background and most of the other's who suffered along with me are decended from mainland Europe...Has anyone else experianced anything close to this or is it just coninsidence?

I'm from Sweden as well. Only taken it once, at a pretty low dose (around 10mg), and I had no mentionable body load. Minor restlessnes, and slight nausea during the comeup, but nothing more.

I'm mostly Irish, English and German.  

Sometimes I experience a body load from 5-MeO-DiPT.  Sometimes I don't.

I also know someone who has a 100% Irish background and he experienced a significant body load from 10mgs and vomitted.

Well, somewhere around 10% of white people have a deficiency in some enzyme (CY-P450, I'm pretty sure) which affects people's reactions to various drugs. I remember reading this 10% figure in some book dealing with MDMA (PIHKAL perhaps, or Nick Saunders' book) which claimed that this deficiency made MDMA hit these people harder than usual. Apparantly this same enzyme deficiency also makes codeine less effective (they have a hard time metabolizing it into morphine, so it tends to make them nauseous more than narcotized). It also affects how DXM works (not surprising, since DXM is an opioid and this enzyme seems to play a big role in opioid metabolism). Grapefruit juice also acts to inhibit this enzyme.

Its an enzyme that affects MANY drugs, and different levels of this and related enzymes (theres a whole bunch of them, I think they're referred to collectively as cytochrome somethingorother) can have a drastic impact on how many drugs work, from MDMA to opioids to various heart medications. Its certainly possible that this enzyme plays a role either in 5-MeO-DIPT's metabolism or perhaps somewhere in the chain of physiological reactions started by the drug. We know surprisingly little about how psychedelics in general work, and practically nothing about the pharmacodynamics of 5-MeO-DIPT specifically.

As far as I know though, this particular enzyme deficiency isn't limited to Irish or other Keltic peoples... rather, the 10% figure is I believe something common to all white Europeans. Also the deficiency also occurs in non-whites, its just that its more common in people with white ancestry. I don't know if its a dominant or recessive trait and how it would affect people of mixed ancestry. I also don't know how accurate that 10% number is... the book was a book dealing with psychedelics, not genetics or enzymatic metabolism. I'm pretty sure that CY-P450 deficiency is something that occurs more frequently with whites than other groups but I'm not sure if 10% is really an accurate statistic. 

Also, I'm not sure on the racial scope... Assuming the 10% figure is correct, does this apply to just white Europeans, or does it apply to Aryan people as a whole? And by this, I am using Aryan in its proper sense and not the misuse of the term by the Nazis... the proper definition of Aryan refers to people descended from a group of people who probably originated somewhere around the Black Sea or the Caucasus Mountains. These people then spread out in several directions in different migratory waves. We can tell where their descendants ended up because they all speak related languages, known collectively as Indo-European. The term Aryan properly includes most white Europeans (Kelts, Germans, Slavs, Latins, Greeks) but also includes many of the people of India, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and some of the people of the central Asian steppes. Is the enzyme deficiency as common with them? Dunno. Then, there's also white Europeans who pre-dated the Aryans... for example, the Basques, and probably the Etruscans and Minoans... and there are also later arrivals such as the Finns and Estonians, who are actually related to the Asiatic people of Siberia, and more distantly (based on some linguistic evidence) to the Koreans and Japanese. And of course, theres been so much interbreeding over the centuries, there's probably no people anywhere in the world who are genetically like the original Aryans. So, what does all this mean for the genetics of this enzyme deficiency? Hell if I know. Did it originate with the Aryans, and if so, does it occur as often in non-white descendants of the Aryans such as the people of India? Maybe it was something picked up through intermarriage with the pre-Aryan peoples of Europe, and is therefore found in all white Europeans whether of Aryan or pre-Aryan origins... or maybe it was a genetic mutation that occured in the Aryans who migrated to Europe and so doesn't affect Basques, Finns, etc. You'd want to ask a geneticist if you really care about all this crap.

Its also possible that there is some other unknown enzyme or receptor condition or god only knows what that has nothing to do with CY-P450 but plays a role in the pharmacology of 5-MeO-DIPT. If so this could be something found in Irish or other Keltic people. It wouldn't be that unusual. In addition to the CY-P450 deficiency common with whites, many Native Americans are deficient in the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase which turns alcohols into aldehydes. This makes these people unusually sensitive to alcohol and prone to alcoholism - though of course the genocidal conditions on Indian Reservations probably contributes more to the epidemic of alcoholism than any genetic factors! There are other various odd reactions to drugs and foods that tend to be found mosty in specific races, so it would not be completely unreasonable to speculate that people of Irish descent may have some kind of enzyme or neuroreceptor mutation that makes them react to 5-MeO-DIPT differently.

Personally, I have lots of Irish ancestry, but I've also got ancestors from Germany, Holland, England and Indonesia, so that makes it hard to draw any conclusions from my experiences. I found low doses (4-8mg) to be a mild and somewhat interesting semi-psychedelic sensory enhancer that could perhaps have some recreational value for some people... if future research shows it to be a safe drug, and I came across some, I would consider taking it again at a dose around 5mg just for fun. I found that doses above 8mg did begin to create fully psychedelic experiences, but I found it pretty unusable in that capacity because along with the increase in psychedelic qualities came an increase in body load - mostly, intestinal upset. It seems to have an effect opposite of opioids in that it seems to speed up intestinal movements, causing gas and often severe diarrhea that can last hours. This didnt happen every time I did it, but it happened often enough and was unpleasant enough that I would never take this substance again at a dose above 8mg. In fact, I dont think I'd want to even go past 5mg. My idea of a good psychedelic experience does not involve spending 3 or 4 hours stuck on a toilet shitting out every last bit of liquid in my intestines.

Anyway, until we know everything about how 5-MeO-DIPT works and what chemicals in the body it reacts with, and can do tests on different pure-blooded representatives of different ethnic groups to determine their levels of those chemicals, this is something that we can only speculate about based on anecdotal evidence... and since there's probably not that many people using 5-MeO-DIPT who happen to be pure-blooded Irish, I don't think speculation is even possible. We don't have enough anecdotal evidence about human reaction to this drug in general to even think about how some populations may react differently from the norm. We don't know what the norm is, and probably won't for many many many years - if ever.

I wd say retarded or suicidal ppl. 

Is there a point in doing it ? 

Well maybe committing suicide through massive dehydration brought about by non stop haemorrhagic diarrheia maybe ? Aside of that not much.

Meilikhios, wtf are you tallking about???

IV 5-Meo_Dipt is, by far, the best way to do it.  Smoking the freebase is a close secoond, imo.  When you IV it, the onset is pretty quick but it's a comfortable rush.  The duration is short but the quality of the high is much better than snorting or oral doses.  Body load is minimal.  Visuals are intense.    

And I agree, 5 to 20mg is agood place to start.

I'm surprised that the IV route for 5-MeO-DiPT doesn't increase side effects and uncomfortable sensations as i would have expected. 

According to certain ppl here not only are side effects not increased but they even seem to be removed; this route also seems to unveil the psychedelic effects of this otherwise rightly looked down upon tryptamine.

All this is frankly **very** unexpected and damn surprising.

I wd like to ask the ppl who report good results from the IV route, do you guys typically get diarrhea, unpleasant body buzz and crappy psychedelic effects when you take it orally ? 

Or do you also enjoy that way ?

"working on serotonine" doesn't mean anything : it's a sentence so vague that it is completely meaningless. The pharmacology of 5-MeO-DiPT has nothing to do with that of  MDMA. The former is a 5HT2A agonist, the latter a serotonine/dopamine releaser/reuptake inhibitor. 


Extra loading with 5htp is useless with 5-MeO-DiPT. 


And stop calling it the fox !!!

**so mr. wizard...**


thanks for the specifics of it.  I wasn't aware that the "fox" (yes, the fox.. i don't know wtf all of you have against that name ~ is it 'cause you have no one to get 'foxy' with?) was an SSRI.   since it is an SSRI, i will not be post loading with 5htp.   i will continue taking the supplement the day after tho.   


and yes, i knew that 'working on serotonin' was a vague statement, i'm obviously not as informed as others about the exact pharmocology of **5-meo-Dipt**.  


appreciate the knowledge.  


peace, love and chicken grease,

If your going to postload after foxy take 10mg of Xanax just as you are coming down. Hopefully you will awake the next morning not remembering a thing about the awful experience you just put your mind and body through.

Haha, what makes you say that? The first time I did foxy was the most magical and wonderful, and the visuals/feelings were almost identical to my first shroom experience. I loved foxy, but I just had a recent bad party experience with it that left me drained for two days with body ache and dehydration.


Foxy has its ups and downs, but if you like it, take it!

It's not really my ideal psychedelic. The body load is painful and I don't think I've ever spewed so much off any drug. The visuals were unimpressive and the audio effects are just..er plain weird sums it up best. At lower doses it can be a mild, sorta 'fun' experience however when you go into high dosages to get some good visuals the mindfuck just takes over. Random words like Russia and dingo suddenly have a connection..and as far as being introspective? Ha.. at high dosages you can't even think so I don't see this being a very introspective chemical.


However..it does have two ups. It is cheap (well..that might soon change) and the sexual side to it is alright..nothing mindblowing though. But comparing it to shrooms? Common man..shrooms deserve a lot more respect than that. 


As far postloading..nope don't take anything.

To reply to the above, I've tried snorting 5meodipt before and didnt really notice any lessening of the effects.  I insufflated about 10mg.  If it makes you sick to swallow it, i think insufflation is a viable solution to that problem, but other than that there are really no good effects to be gained from it, so just swallow if if you can stomach it and save yourself having to taste that shit in the back of your throat.

Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of alpha-

methyltryptamine and 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine into Schedule 

I


AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Department of Justice.


ACTION: Final rule.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY: The Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 

Administration (DEA) is issuing this final rule to temporarily place 

alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine 

(5-MeO-DIPT) into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) 

pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of the CSA. This final 

action is based on a finding by the DEA Deputy Administrator that the 

placement of AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT into Schedule I of the CSA is necessary 

to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this 

rule, the criminal sanctions and regulatory controls of Schedule I 

substances under the CSA will be applicable to the manufacture, 

distribution, and possession of AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT.


EFFECTIVE DATE: April; 4. 2003.


FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Frank Sapienza, Chief, Drug and 

Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, 

Washington, DC 20537, (202) 307-7183.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Under What Authority Are AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT Being Temporarily 

Scheduled?


    The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-473), which 

was signed into law on October 12, 1984, amended section 201 of the CSA 

(21 U.S.C. 811) to give the Attorney General the authority to 

temporarily place a substance into Schedule I of the CSA for one year 

without regard to the requirements of 21 U.S.C. 811(b) if he finds that 

such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public 

safety. The Attorney General may extend the temporary scheduling up to 

6 months. A substance may be temporarily scheduled under the emergency 

provisions of the CSA if that substance is not listed in any other 

schedule under section 202 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 812) or if there is no 

exemption or approval in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 for the substance. 

The Attorney General has delegated his authority under 21 U.S.C. 811 to 

the Administrator of DEA (28 CFR 0.100). The Administrator has 

redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to 28 

CFR 0.104.

    A notice of intent to temporarily place AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT into 

Schedule I of the CSA was published in the Federal Register on January 

28, 2003 (68 FR 4127). The Deputy Administrator transmitted notice of 

his intention to temporarily place AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT into Schedule I 

of the CSA to the Assistant Secretary for Health of the Department of 

Health and Human Services (HHS). In response to this notification, the 

Food and Drug Administration has advised DEA that there are no 

exceptions or approvals in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 of the Food, Drug 

and Cosmetic Act for AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT and HHS has no objection to 

DEA's intention to temporarily place alpha-methyltryptamine and 5-

methoxy-N,N-diisopropytryptamine into Schedule I of the CSA.


What Factors Were Considered in the Determination To Temporarily 

Schedule AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT?


    As set forth under 21 U.S.C. 811(h), the Deputy Administrator has 

considered the available data and the following three factors under the 

CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(c)) that are required for a determination to 

temporarily schedule a substance:

    4. Its history and current pattern of abuse;

    5. The scope, duration, and significance of abuse; and

    6. What, if any, risk there is to the public health.

    Additionally, DEA has considered the three criteria for placing a 

substance into Schedule I of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 812). The data 

available and reviewed for AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT indicate that they have a 

high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in 

treatment in the United States and are not safe for use under medical 

supervision.


What Are AMT and 5-MeO DIPT?


    Alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT) and 5-methosy-N, N-

diisopropytryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT) are tryptamine (indoleethylamine) 

derivatives and share several similarities with the Schedule I 

tryptamine hallucinogens, alpha-ethyltryptamine (AET) and N, N-

demethyltryptamine (DMT), respectively. Several other tryptamines also 

produce hallucinogenic/stimulant effects and are controlled as Schedule 

I substances under the CSA (bufotenine, diethyltryptamine, psilocybin 

and psilocyn). Although tryptamine itself appears to lack consistent 

hallucinogenic/stimulant effects, substitutions on the indole ring and 

the ethylamine side-chain of this molecule result in pharmacologically 

active substances (McKenna and Towers, J. Psychoactive Drugs, 16:347-

358, 1984).

    The chemical structures of AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT possess the critical 

features necessary for hallucinogenic/stimulant activity. Thus, both 

AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT are likely to have a pharmacological profile 

substantially similar to other Schedule I tryptamine derivatives such 

as DMT and AET. In drug discrimination studies, both AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT 

substitute for 1-(2,5-dimethosy-4-methylphenyl)-aminopropane (DOM), a 

phenethylamine-based hallucinogen in Schedule I of the CSA. The 

potencies of DOM-like discriminative stimulus effects of these and 

several other similar tryptamine derivatives correlate well with their 

hallucinogenic potencies in humans (Glennon et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 

86: 453-459, 1983).

    AMT shares other pharmacological properties with Schedule I 

hallucinogens such as AET, AMT increases systolic and diastolic 

arterial blood pressures. The behavioral effects of orally administered 

AMT (20 mg) in humans are slow in onset, occurring after 3 to 4 hours, 

and gradually subsiding after 12 to 24 hours, but may last up to 2 days 

in some subjects. The majority of the subjects report nervous tension, 

irritability, restlessness, inability to sleep, blurry vision, 

mydriasis and equate the effects of a 20 mg dose to those of 50 

micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (Hollister et al., J. 

Nervous Ment. Dis., 131:428-434, 1960; Murphree et al., Clin. 

Pharmacol. Ther., 2: 722-726, 1961). AMT also produces hallucinations 

and dextroamphetamine-like mood elevating effects.

    5-MeO-DIPT also produces pharmacological effects similar to those 

of other Schedule I hallucinogens such as DMT. The synthesis and 

preliminary human psychopharmacology study on 5-MeO-DIPT was first 

published in 1981 (Shulgin and Carter, Comm. Physhopharmacol. 4: 363-

369, 1981), 5-MeO-DIPT is an orally active hallucinogen. Following oral 

administration of 6-10 mg. 5-MeO-DIPT produces subjective effects with 

an onset at about 20-30 minutes, a peak at about 1-1.5 hours and a 

duration of about 3-6 hours. Subjects who have been administered 5-MeO-

DIPT are talkative and disinhibited. 5-MeO-DIPT causes mydriasis. High 

doses of 5-MeO-DIPT produce nausea, jaw clenching, muscle tension and 

overt hallucinations with both auditory and visual distortions.


Why Are AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT Being Controlled?


    The continued trafficking and abuse of AMT and 5-;MeO-DIPT pose an 

imminent hazard to public safety. The popularity and use of 

hallucinogenic/stimulant substances at raves (all-night dance parties) 

and other social venues have been a major problem in Europe since the 

1990s. In the past several years, this activity has spread to the 

United States. The Schedule I controlled substance 3,4-

methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or Ecstasy) and its analogues are 

the most frequently abused drugs at these raves. Their abuse has been 

associated with both acute and long-term public health and safety 

problems. Raves have also become venues for the trafficking and abuse 

of new, non-controlled substances distributed as legal substitutes for, 

or in addition to, MDMA. 5-MeO-DIPT and AMT belong to such a group of 

substances.

    Data gathered from published studies, supplemented by reports on 

Internet websites indicate that these are often administered orally at 

doses ranging from 15-40 mg for AMT ant 6-20 mg for 5-MeO-DIPT . Other 

routes of administration include smoking and snorting. Data from law-

enforcement officials indicate that 5-MeO-DIPT is often sold as 

``Foxy'' or ``Foxy Methoxy'', while MAT has been sold as ``Spirals'' at 

lease in one case. Both substances have been commonly


[[Page 16429]]


encountered in tablet and capsule forms.

    According to forensic laboratory data, the first encounter of AMT 

and 5-MeO-DIPT occurred in 1999. Since then, law enforcement officials 

in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, 

Iowa, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and 

the District of Columbia have encountered these substances. According 

to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), the abuse by teens 

and young adults of AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT is an emerging problem. There 

have been reports of abuse of AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT at clubs and raves in 

Arizona, California, Florida and New York. Many tryptamine-based 

substances are illicitly available from United States and foreign 

chemical companies and from individuals through the Internet. A gram of 

AMT or 5-MeO-DIPT as bulk powdered costs less than $150 from illicit 

sources on the Internet. DEA is not aware of any legitimate medical or 

scientific use of AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT. There is recent evidence 

suggesting the attempted clandestine production of AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT 

in Nevada, Virginia and Washington, DC.

    AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT share substantial chemical and pharmacological 

similarities with other Schedule I tryptamine-based hallucinogens in 

Schedule I of the CSA (AET and DMT). This makes it likely that these 

drugs cause similar health hazards. Tryptamine, the parent molecule of 

AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT, is known to produce convulsions and death in 

animals (Tedeschi et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 126:223-232, 1959). 

AMT and 5-MeO-DIPT, similar to other tryptamine- or phenethylamine-

based hallucinogens, through the alteration of sensory perception and 

judgement can pose serious health risks to the user and the general 

public. further, there have been several self-reports on Internet Web 

sites describing the reported abuse of these substances in combination 

with other controlled drugs, namely MDMA, marijuana, gamma 

hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-

propylthiophenethylamine (2C-T-7). This practice of drug abuse 

involving combinations poses additional health risks to the users and 

the general public. Available information indicates that AMT and 5-MeO-

DIPT lack any approved therapeutic use in the United States. The safety 

of these substances for use in humans has not been studied.


What Is the Effect of This Final Rule?

That's the big problem, one doesn't want to be a jerk and not let anyone in on the good stuff, but at the same time putting the info up on a public board is asking for a "craze" and subsequent criminalization.


I've worried a bit about the increased popularity of certain tea making method, for example...

Don't sell any of your favorite chems in clubs or raves.


Once something becomes a "club drug" it becomes illegal.

Though when I see "Foxy/AMT" mentioned several times, I begin to wonder if this is just propaganda?


I remember when I was in high school, some kids smoked pot.  AMT IN School?  Really sad.

I disagree. Creating some "code of silence" with regard to research chemicals seems counteractive to what this board stands for. If people ask questions, you should answer them, in the name of education and harm reduction. Keeping your favorite RC "secret" and "underground" is just bogus for two reasons. The first one being that it simply won't happen. Word of mouth spreads outside this board, outside the internet, and any slightly depraved, enterprising lady/fellow can stumble across some wonderful unscheduled substance and try to pass it off at a club. And secondly, keeping things like this "secret" is exactly what the gov't wants, IMHO. It wants people to be isolated, to feel uninformed, to be "scared" of things they don't know (i.e. drugs), and part of what this board is about, I think, is ending that in some way. So be prudent, of course, but please don't stop the discussion.

Hope this isnt too off topic, but how come AMT and FOXY, with no known fatalities,  are Emergency S-1'd, while many popular pharmacuticals have to kill a dozen or so people before doctors will stop encouraging people to take them?  


I know money vs kids abusing drugs yada yada yada....shit just makes me really mad.  Seriously, Foxy and AMT really didnt hurt anybody, right?  (Except for that body load or teeth clenching =)

Where they name 'foxy' came from:

Schedule I drugs have "no known medical use" and are "highly addictive," while Schedule II drugs do have medical uses.


Methylamphetamine (Desoxyn) is perscribed for ADD, but very rarely.


Morphine (MSContin, Kadian, etc) is a good painkiller, so obviously its schedule II.


what i dont get is heroin being schedule I.  its more potent and longer lasting than morphine, and was in fact considered a "non-addictive alternative to morphine" back when it was first created.

Yeah, they give that to people who become tolerant to adderal or ritalin within a week.  I was prescribed Desoxyn for 3 years, twice a day.  Imagine tweaking hardcore almost every day for 3 years.  I cant believe that shit is legal, I quit it as soon as I realized that being able to focus better wasn't worth becoming a full-time tweaker.

**question on 5-MeO-DiPT**


Does anyone know how long 5-MeO-DiPT stays in your system?  I can't imagine anyone would test for it.  But the question was posed and I had no answer and am too curious to let it go.


Thanks,

It's not tested for, and not similar enough to anything else to register as another drug, so you should be ok.

**Sweet and Sour**


Shulgin's opinion or not, 5-MeO-DiPT being a sex drug is nothing more than hype.  I've had mindblowing sex on nearly every psychedelic I've taken.  The only one that gave me problems in fact was 5-MeO-DiPT because of the intense body-load.  I couldn't have sex with 5-MeO-DiPT until it was almost over, and it wasn't any better than sex on other materials.

There is no question that the sexual nature of this compound has been hyped, but this does not mean that it is nonexistent. 


Personally, I have not found myself particularly horny on this compound.  My partner, on the other hand, often becomes incredibly so, like a switch was turned on.  We aren't always on the same page when this happens, but when she has been able to pull me into her turned on state, I've experienced the negative body load transform into very powerful sexual energy.


Different people, different reactions.  I'm not saying that this is a magical sex drug, but this is what often happens to her (and she doesn't read internet drug boards.)

Yeah, it may be there but it is also there with all of the others too.  Nothing special I see about this one that makes it stand out from the rest beyond a placebo effect generated by the hype this drug gets.


**>My partner, on the other hand, often becomes incredibly so,

Has she used other psychedelics?  And if so, does this only happen with 5-MeO-DiPT.

She has used at least a dozen others and I would have to say that it has happened on other substances, but not all.

"Shulgin's opinion or not, 5-MeO-DiPT being a sex drug is nothing more than hype"


actually he never states that foxy is a sex drug in the article.  Like you he finds the body load too much and he basically states that foxy is worthless.  The lady writting the article is the one who is hyping it up as a sex drug.  I found the writing intresting because its the first time i've ever heard of 5meodipt being used as a stimulant for sex.  The journalist goes to all these underground sex clubs where they eat this stuff and have orgies,.

i would check out the article,.you won't learn anything new about foxy in terms of pharmacology or anything, but its an intresting read

If you ask Sasha what his two favorite drugs in *Tihkal* are, he'll tell you LSD and 5-MeO-DiPT.  If queried as to why he would say 5-MeO-DiPT, he'll reply, "Oh, for the low dose sexual enhancement, of course."

--

> Like you he finds the body load too much and he

--

He states that at low doses Foxy greatly enhances his orgasm intensity without the mental effects of other psychedelics.  I guess it's up to you as to whether or not you consider that worthless.  I certainly do not.  If I want an LSD trip, I'll take LSD.  If I want a night of nice, freaky sex with my girlfriend without a whole lot of distractions, I'll take 5-MeO-DiPT.  That said, the sexual enhancement on around 500 micrograms of LSD is stunning, if you (and your partner) can manage to hold it all together.

I have good sex without the use of drugs, but the judicious use of drugs can make good sex absolutely mind-blowing.  One can also have mind-blowing sex without drugs.  It's all a matter of what flavor one prefers at the moment.

Sex enhancer or not, Playboy should not be galanting around hyping 5-meo-dipt as the new sexdrug. It is irresponsible, the last thing we need is a bunch of weirdos dosing up on foxy as a sexual enhancement. If that were to happen you can bet we will start hearing more aboiut it in the news.

5-MeO-DiPT is not at all the only drug Shulgin states as having a sensual effect.  Infact, it sounds like most psychedelic drugs make the guy horny.  And I'm inclined to believe he's crazy and psychedelic drugs is just his thing.


As well, I've known dozens of people who have tried 5-MeO-DiPT not ever knowing about the whole "foxy" thing.  None of them at all mentioned feeling sexual or sensual at any dose.


So as far as I'm concerned, it's not going to make you horny unless you already have sex on your mind or you believe it's going to have an aphrodesiac effect.

--

(with 7 mg, orally) "In one hour I was in a marvelous, sexy place. Everything was shaded with eroticism. Sex was explosive, and in another three hours I was completely ready for the outside, public world. As a short term aphrodisiac, this leaves 2C-B in the dust."

--

([http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal37.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal37.shtml))

--

(with 12 mg, orally) "Had prepared for this experience during the day, and was looking forward to the time with my partner. Flowers, candles, fluffy pillows, arranged for food, etc. Large pillar type candles and the glow was nice and warm. Warm was comfort and comfort was good. Warm led into a wonderful sexual turn on, where my entire body was alive and alert. This was one hour into the trip. This wonderful sexual turn on was the feeling of a bud about to unfold into a full-blown beautiful flower, which happened during love making. The flower continued to fill out fuller and fuller for a couple of hours, and then just remained a full-blown beautiful wonderful flower, and I fell asleep with this feeling."

--

(ibid.)

--

"Here is a rather fast-acting psychedelic-like drug, with suggestions of LSD action but with essential differences. It has a lot of things going for it. It is short-lived, a virtue in many people's minds. It may vie with 2C-B as a potential aphrodisiac. It is reasonably easy to synthesize. It is of a pretty high potency. The physical side-effects are minimal. These are the positive points.


"But there are points that are neutral or actually negative, and they must be considered. A fair number of people who have explored 5-MeO-DIPT have said that there are some uncomfortable aspects with the experience. Not only are there few if any visual enhancements, but the altered state they entered was one that they simply couldn't use. They couldn't make intuitive leaps. That they were wasting their time

--

(ibid.)

--

"5-MeO-DIPT is a mixed bag. But it is a bag that I predict will demand a great deal of interest sometime in the future, especially if the erotic enhancement at a low dose proves to be a consistent property."

--

(ibid.)

--

From Playboy:

--

"At low doses it greatly enhances my orgasm intensity but has no psychedelic effect.  But Ann didn't care for it.  At the normal doses, it wasn't that memorable or constructive.  So it's not in my medicine cabinet."

--

(p. 68)

--

At low doses, for many, many peope, Foxy functions as a short-term sensual enhancer without pronounced psychedelic mental effects.  For mental exploration, Foxy at these doses is practically worthless.  Back when it was legal, I took it quite rarely (and now, of course, I don't take it at all).  However, it has explosive potential for sex at doses that don't interfere with normal mental functioning, and I found these effects to be great.  I thought it was a far better recreational sex drug than cocaine or methamphetamine, with just the slightest hints of psychedelic activity (once, while walking through San Francisco on 10 milligrams, after having taken a few puffs of cannabis, I was having what felt like orgasms without the mess everytime I breathed in and out, and was falling in love with every person I set eyes on).  All this said, some people get very unwelcome side effects from Foxy, and they are entitled to their experiences and opinions.

--

> Infact, it sounds like most psychedelic drugs make

> the guy horny.

--

Yeah, but most of them also have mental effects that make them undesirable for use as *specific* sexual enhancement drugs.

--

>  And I'm inclined to believe he's crazy

--

Not me.

--

> and psychedelic drugs is just his thing.

--

...and yours is?

--

> As well, I've known dozens of people who have

--

Sensory enhancement is a quite frequently reported property of 5-MeO-DiPT, though obviously not universal.

--

> So as far as I'm concerned, it's not going to make

> you horny

--

I don't know that it makes you horny.  I do think that it provides wonderful sensual enhancement/stimulation at low doses that can be put to wonderful uses for a night of freaky fucking.

Don't forget guys that not all the entries in PIHKAL and TIHKAL are his and Ann's.  People tend to think they wrote them all.  Some are from people in his inner circle, and some (especially in TIHKAL) are from classic literature and journals.

Not me.  I think the 7 mg. report is Sasha's, but I think the 12 mg. report is from someone else.  Could be wrong though.

Well, I know the person who wrote the two highest dose reports for alpha,O-DMS in *Tihkal*.

**Me No Make No Poopy**


^^^^^^


Not everyone gets that.  As much as I talk bad about 5-MeO-DiPT, it thankfully spared me of that all three times I took it.  The dosages I took were 6 mg, 8 mg, and 11 mg.


I have also given it to two others at 6 mg, and 8 mg and neither had any problems.  So either not everyone gets intestinal disorders from 5-MeO-DiPT, or it only occurs in dosages above 12 mg.

"He states that at low doses Foxy greatly enhances his orgasm intensity without the mental effects of other psychedelics. I guess it's up to you as to whether or not you consider that worthless"


your right about the low dose enhancment,but if you read the article he says that it still has no psychedelic value and at normal doses its not constructive at all and he "keeps it out of his medicine bag"

**Even Shulgin can be wrong**


I'd have to strongly disagree with Dr. Shulgin there.   The only time I really enjoyed 5-MeO-DiPT was when I took 6 mg with my best friend and we had an evening of non-stop insightful and deep conversations.  5-MeO-DiPT can be psychedelic in small doses.  It just depends on the setting.  It was for me.


My only problem was after 3 hr, this nervous energy kicked in, the body-load.  It just isn't worth it.  I'd rather eat a gram of mushrooms and feel good the whole time.  The effect would be similiar.

^^^^ i guess when you come down to it,its all subjective,right?

I mean mushrooms can make some feel pretty nasty too, nausea is pretty common for me on the comeup,.not too much unlike amt,.just less intense.

I've never gotten nausea from mushrooms, yet I do tend to get sick on many other things.  Many psychedelics (especially PEAs) tend to make me puke.  But those mushrooms!  They are the perfect psychedelic for me in terms of how I feel on them.  They feel so good and 'natural.'  My body doesn't feel like it's on a drug.   I love them.  Yeah, it amazes me how differently we all react differently sometimes.

**5-Meo-Dipt Research**


Does anyone know if any "offical" studies or research has recently be done on 5-meo-dipt due to it surfacing in society, mainly as a mdma substitue in the club scene ect.  What, if anything, is really know about this substance.

I didn't really like it.  Too wild for me.

Well, the US gov't "knows" that its "bad" because it was found in "ecstasy" tablets and it was associated with the "rave" scene8).


Sorry, I have no real input. I despise 5-MeO-DiPT, I could give a rats ass about any studies pertaining to it.

**Uh Oh, I did it Again**


Assembled some of the non-redundant threads on 5-MeO-DiPT and have made a new Big and Dandy thread.  It is interesting to see it go from an almost common street drug in 2001 to it's recent scheduling.  Too bad Bluelight was purged in 2001.  It would be neat so see the threads on 5-MeO-DiPT from 1999 and early 2000, before it got popular.

Down to my last few milligrams... ashame I won't be seeing any much more of this great recreational hallucinogen. I've done it more than any other entheogen excluding marijuana; and it's seen me through into maturaty as a full-fledged psychonot.

^^^ What he said.  But I ran out long ago.


My preferred dosage was 20mg, and I've had some great times (none unpleasant, and only one or two with GI problems).  I have a few friends who have taken insane dosages of 35-40mg, and they describe an interesting effect.  They can feel each thought as a bubble coming to the surface, and when they think it, they feel the bubble pop.

I must really be a soft-head with tryptamines.  I found that just a mere 8 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT was all I needed to reach a full +3.


6 mg produced a fairly enjoyable and mellow trip that was nice for deep discussions with a close friend.  But the space that resulted from ingesting 5-MeO-DiPT was still never that special.  There was nothing with 5-MeO-DiPT that another tryptamine could not do better.


I never felt a need/desire to take more 8 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT, and the shitty body-load and largely useless headspace the drug produced when I took it kept me from ever trying that material more than a few times.  The last time I tried it was in April of 2001 and I have no desire to use it again.


I can't imagine that people would want/need to take 30 mg or 40 mg of that drug.  That would be sheer torture in my eyes!


The most 5-MeO-DiPT I ever took was 11 mg, and that trip was terrible!  It was my first try.  The body-load was so horrendous, I basically spent the entire time just waiting/wishing for it to end.  The only part I found interesting was the auditory distortions it produced.  They were very intense and somewhat un-nerving.


I think it was because I was not expecting them.  I rather enjoyed the auditory distortions DiPT produced, though I will point out that the auditory distortions produced by DiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT are not the same, but I really don't know how to explain the differences.


I've shared 5-MeO-DiPT with three other people, and only one of them really enjoyed the experience.  At 8 mg, she found it to be very MDMA-like and positive, which I will never understand.  But it shows that our bodies are all different, and each will react differently to molecules that affect perception.


If anyone is interested, all of my 5-MeO-DiPT experiences are documented at erowid.

**5-meo-Dipt**


I want to ask the people that have taken 5meodipt. How did you like it? All the reports that  i have read on here and erowid say its incredibaly psychedelic. I have taken it twice, the first time i took 6mg. Within a hour i felt kinda spaced out w/ a warm sensation in my chest, and i had very mild cevs. and the 1st two hours everything lookd wierd , like kinda perceptual , like i get on mush.i took and extra 4mg booster dose 2 1/2hrs after and it didnt seem to change the trip much. It felt just like wierd headspace w/ minor visuals. I was cleareheaded  no mindfuck. The next day i took 10mg , only to have a less psychedelic night than b4, i assume bc of tolerance. 


Also i had taken AMT 20mg on friday, 45mg on sat. I took the 5meo monday night. I didnt really think that they have a cross tolerance but theyre both tyrptamines so idk. HOw crazy does it get? ive got the impression now that its pretty mild.  I had absolutly no ill effects like people have described. What are the 12-16mg trips like?


Again, the night that i took 6mg w/ a 4mg booster my friend was with me he is also jus as expierenced as me w/ psychedelics, esp. chems. he took 6mg  and reported the same feelings i did, and we both decided to take a booster dose i took 4mg and he took 3mg. This totaly changed his trip.w/in 5 mins his legs were shaking/trembling violently, he said that it felt like some exorcist shit, he said his muscles were spazming in ways tha they shouldnt, and it felt like he was brake a bone or something.it lasted for about 15mins, Idk  what happened i assume its just a fluke accident. i put my 4mg booster on my tounge and let it soak in for 20 mins and he just straight up swallowed the powder, idk if that had ne thing to do with it,

Hi


I have used it a few times. Twice in important amounts... it is active even at a 1-2mg dose but i don't want to get into those experiences here...


First time: 20-25mg (unsure). Context: 75mg MDMA taken, this is measured and ingested durig the peak. +/-10mg accracy scale but as I was off my head I'd forgotten about that and I had the intention to take around 2mg Foxy, not 20+...![:o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png) uncomfortable muscular tension, odd headspace, nice auditory distortions... serious GI upset... my wife had serious body load... it generally wasn't that much fun, until we had sex much later, still up at T+10. That was truly amazing, but it also felt a bit like death. All the blood circulation seemd down there, and our bodie seemed sort of dead except for 'down there' - we seemed to have become outr genitals![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) ... next day very nice though... the relief was so peaceful nd the forest walk was very rewarding. Only, my wife kept saying, what happened to the E buzz after we dropped the foxy?


never again that dose.


the other time I took around 8 mgs with a friend along with a few beers at a festival.... even had lots of food before.... because of the gastric upset I was going to fast this time... but... too hungry suddenly... and this time there was no problem at all.... we had a good time... some cool visuals seeing streetlights reflected in the river, which had a new kind of depth... it looke dmore like a not-river ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ... anyway, it didn't give either of us the energy wanted to stay keen on the party... a bit up and down... like it was MDEA or some such thing... haven't been bothered to take it since... only way might be between 3 and 5mgs in a home setting for cuddles and stuff, I guess.

I have now read this entire thread, and as an experienced and admittedly enthusiastic user, I shall now add an additional perspective.


I have used 5-MeO-DiPT numerous times, and I sought it out specifically on the strength of reports by "researchers of erotic consciousness" (eroto-nauts?) who found it to be a powerful ally in this realm. My interest in the drug was motivated by a search for tools for sexual exploration. In this I haven't been disappointed. 


I don't believe in the placebo theory of this drug's aphrodisiacal properties, nor that it is hype originating in a few high-profile accounts of erotic enhancement. I have read very cogent descriptions by cautious and responsible researchers that corelate very closely with my own experience, and support an alternative to the placebo/hype theory, which may be summarized as follows:


Positive experiences with the drug often seem to take place with "highly sexual people" who find powerful eroticism intrinsically meaningful and useful, and not a waste of time or psychologically disturbing in some way. I have also read reports of experiences that began negatively, but turned positive when sex was (even reluctantly) pursued. In this respect the drug is analogous to Viagra, which does not motivate sex, but *can* facilitate it. A bit subtle.


Persons who expect a drug to "cause" sexual experiences but who do not provide the kindling spark of expressing sexual intent as a manifestation of themselves, will probably be disappointed with sexual "amplifiers" like 5-MeO-DiPT.


Learning to enjoy a drug is always a matter of mastering one's own nervous system. Think of the first time you drank coffee. There is probably no drug that does not have side effects, and the very qualities that make 5-MeO-DiPT valuable for amplifying sexual chemistry, make it a candidate for amplifying the unwanted chemistries of other body processes, such as, famously, intestinal peristalsis.


The book has not been written on how optimally to take this drug, but such things as fasting, taking the drug in the morning, taking it in conjunction with sexual pursuits, and of course, making sure that the drug is pure, titrating the dose upward attentively, patiently, carefully, conservatively, etc., etc., all increase the likelihood of a positive experience.


Finally, the difference between 5 mg and 20 mg has been repeatedly mentioned in this thread, but it cannot be stressed enough. Everyone knows that is not the same experience to drive a car at 30 mph as to drive it at 130 mph.  Our built-in limitations of information processing make a slow Sunday drive in the country relaxing and pleasurable, whereas a race through heavy traffic downtown is extremely stressful as well as more dangerous. Same car.


My conclusion is that this drug is very valuable for a very specific purpose, but that it is more resistant than most to being asked to do things it wasn't made for.


Hope this connects.

Are you suggesting that only people who are very sexual, not afraid of the nature of sex, their bodies, their lover's body, and have no hang-ups about sex are going to find 5-MeO-DiPT a "sexual aid?"


Cause no offense, but that is a bunch of crap.  I don't mean to brag, or sound vein, but I am a very highly sexual person.  I am completely comfortable with all aspects of myself and my sexuality.  I do not have any hang-ups about sex or any sexual acts, unless they involve live electrical wires!  ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


On other psychedelics; when I take them with my girlfriend they usually lead to hours-long marithon sex.  I find sex under psychedelics both rewarding and pleasurable to the senses, as well as spiritual rewarding.  I think sex is a sacred act, and since I only have sex with someone I love, making love while tripping can be a very cosmic event for me.  Of the over two-dozen psychedelics I've tried, I have made love on nearly all of them.  I find psychedelics in general to be great sexual enhancers.


5-MeO-DiPT however was terrible.  Though I only took dosages between 6mg and 11mg, I found the body-load to be more than I can handle.  Sex was out of the question.  Never before has a psychedelic made engaging in sexual activity impossible like 5-MeO-DiPT did.


So perhaps your theory may be true for some.  But again, I consider myself a very sexual person and I have no "hang ups" about it.  I am completely free with my body, and I feel completely at one with my lover.  Sex has always been a part of the psychedelic experience for me, because I usually trip with my girlfriend.


But again, the bodyload of 5-MeO-DiPT makes sex impossible for me, and the effects of the molecule in general not to be very rewarding.  And this is not because I have don't view eroticism as, "intrinsically meaningful and useful, and not a waste of time or psychologically disturbing in some way."  In fact I do find the gifts of the flesh to be both rewarding and meaningful.  Making love is very meaningful and spiritual for me.  And making love is something I associate with the psychedelic experience because I have sex most of the times I trip.  But 5-MeO-DiPT just doesn't work for me.  I'd best describe it as a "bodyload, with minor psychedelic side-effects."


I think any theory that is so "cut and dry" and "black and white" like this; a theory that is thought to apply to everyone a flawed theory at best.  Psychedelics by nature are variable in the way the affect people.  You can't come up with a specific "one size fits all" reason why some find 5-MeO-DiPT to be a treasure, and others find it garbage.  It isn't so simple.

Thank you, m-g-seed, for your thoughtful reply, and no offense taken. Theories need to be revised in light of new data, and mine was certainly simplistic.


I was aware of the implications in my theory, that 1) all sex-positive people will respond positively to 5-MeO-DiPT, and 2) persons who do not respond positively to 5-MeO-DiPT are uptight about sex. I decided to put the theory out there in its most sweeping and general form, and I am grateful for the opportunity to fine-tune it and to separate that which is "true for me" from "that which is universally true", the latter being perhaps almost meaningless in the context of highly individual brain chemistries.


It is nevertheless hard for me to let go of the idea that there is some specific action of the chemical and some corresponding faculty of the human brain that people who try the drug find either meaningful or not meaningful. This is to suggest that whether the drug is "good" or not is a matter ultimately of choice (*taste?*) rather than due to either 1) significantly differing responses at the biochemical level, or 2) suggestibility/succeptibility to placebo/hype. 


I am handicapped, as are most of us, by not equipped to judge how the molecule might behave differently in different individuals at the neurobiological level, so, I have to start with the simplifying premise that the drug does the same thing to everybody. I just say, milk is milk, even though I know that some people are lactose intolerant, and some people have had traumatizing experiences with a cow, and so forth. So let's just say that the experience under discussion is "that body of subjective experiences that >= 50% of people report who have taken this drug at a given well-defined dosage", i.e., that we are talking about more or less the same experience. And just for discussion's sake, let's say that in talking about this "effect" of the drug, we are correcting for purely external psychological variables such as "hype". Let's say, in short, that we can talk about the drug as a single, quantifiable, describable entity, at least to the extent that any experience is such. 


The diplomatic thing to say is that those who have had positive experiences have accessed some subjectively useful quality in the drug, and that those who find it to be "garbage" do not find this property useful. But surely there is room for discussion beyond "either you like it or you don't", otherwise why bother with this forum?


Would those people who have found the drug to be "crap", "worthless", etc., mind if those of us who are still interested in the drug tried to get a line on understanding it better? This is not to discount the value of negative feedback or to attempt to silence the drug's critics (especially those who might think it is patently harmful). Do those of us who enjoy this chemical have *nothing* important to say, nothing to learn about each other, nothing in common (beyond, again, some ultimately meaningless biochemical or enzymatic similarity?)


[Insert blanket disclaimer of my own extremely limited expertise and plea for tolerance and civility here...]


Having sprayed myself with a bit more flame-retardant, let me say again that I am curious about what the drug's salient property is ***for those who find it useful***. Is, for example, that which has been called "body-load" (a very imprecise term anyway which lumps together all dysphoric somatic phenomena) the very attibute that positive-responders have found not only manageable, but controllable, amenable to shaping, and conducive to some desired psychic space?


It has been suggested that 5-MeO-DiPT lacks empathogenic qualities per se. I would like to **hypothesize** that this limits its value as a "sex aid" if one's primary criterion for judging such an aid is its ability to facilitate interpersonal emotional exchanges with one's partner, (recognizing that for some, maybe even most, emotional intimacy is the sine qua non of sex). But what about 5-MeO-DiPT as a tool for exploring one's own body's responses? I hope no one will be offended if I broach the topic of masturbation and treat it as something differentiable from sex as an interpersonal activity.


My question is, has anyone else used this drug expressly (even if not exclusively) for the purpose of exploring intense and lucid masturbation?  I am only asking, if appropriate, whether anyone has found it useful in this context.


[My lawyer tells me that I should forestall any perception, unintended suggestion, or implication that I think that people who don't like 5-MeO-DiPT are uptight about masturbation.]


Again, is it naive and simplistic to try to further define the essence of what this drug accesses in persons who like it and use it? I hope not.

I have tried 5-MeO-DIPT once, not too long ago, at about 13mg. I was interested in seeing for myself whether it had any overt aphrodisiac effects, vs. the boredom that many people say it has.


I think one trip was not enough to tell. But if I had to give a report, I would say that it was, as intojoy says, not *mentally* or emotionally aphrodisiac, and not something that makes you very horny by itself. Rather, it had some direct effects on the physical experience of pleasure. The body high was sexual, rather than the mental high.


Yup, I masturbated on it, and man, that was over QUICK. I was about 10 times more sensitive than usual, and it felt like my penis was literally on fire. It was just very, very intensely pleasurable, almost to the point of being too intense. With a partner, and patience and self-control, I can see it being interesting. However, for me it seemed a bit more of a novelty drug, like DIPT can seem to some people, rather than a broadly useful and diverse chemical ally (which is what I look for in my favorite chemicals).

I just tried 5-MeO-DiPT at 7mgs for the first time, and I had a really positive experience.  The onset didn't seem to hit me as quick as it does some people, but then again I was hiking down the road in the snow, not really worrying about what was going on in my head.  


I was on my way to my friend's house when I noticed the first effects.  I would characterize them as an enhancement of the senses.  I didn't feel much stimulation at this point, but textures and color were extremely defined with a luminous glow.  


At about the hour mark, I found myself a little nauseous, especially when my adrenaline was pumping from walking up hills.  There was some uncomfort in this part of the experience, but it wasn't extreme.  


At about the two hour mark, I was really starting to have a good time.  The substance was showing more of a hallucinogenic effect, though mild, in the beginning, but now it was revealing something very euphoric, socially enhancing, and emotionally opening.  


I felt very good for a few good hours after that.  At many points, I even had a body buzz similar to mushrooms.   To be honest, I think I liked it better than MDMA, though I can say that they are very different substances.  However, there were no negatives to speak of the next day.  This was a huge plus.  


Overall, I feel like I really got something from this substance even though it wasn't really deep by any means.  It was just something I needed at the time.  ..A really fun, enjoyable experience.  I think this substance has some potential for therapy and psychedelic insight, but it is definitely not a psychedelic that you stare in awe of the visuals/visions and revelations on.  To be honest, I don't think I even had any visuals.  ..Maybe some mild tracers.  I was having too much fun to even pay attention.


As a question, has anyone noticed the side effect of appetite increase with 5-MeO-DiPT?  Three friends of mine have, and now I have tried this compound, and all of us felt quite hungry a few hours into the trip.

Wow did that user hit the nail on the head in 2002! He's a prophet.


Foxy, seems great to some but horrible to others. I guess that is natural anyway. I have a small sample of it but am hesitant to try it yet. I've had it for a while, and haven't tripped in a few weeks. I really don't feel like puking or having the shits. Is this pretty much guaranteed with this chemical? When I've had 2c-e, that made me feel like shit when others felt no nausea at all.


Any news on this chemical? What are your thoughts on it? I may take 5mg, just for a feel of it. I'll report back when I do ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

5-MeO-DiPT did not make me puke, or have 'the shits.'  But the drug had a horrendous bodyload, and a very 'dirty' feeling to it.  Horrible actually.


My dosages were 6mg, 8mg, and 11mg.  Even at 6mg, it was bad.  Strong drug though, 8mg had me at a full +3 and I actually wigged out a bit.  But it lacks the insights and psychedelic effects I seek.  Never again.  Totally a waste of my time.  


If you had no other psychedelic to take, then perhaps I could see it being useful.  But there are much better ones out there.  Unless you just have to try everything once (I can understand), this is one most would be fine to skip.

I know it's a real old post. But i just need to say that this is so true. I've tried 5-meo-dipt from dealers and i've tried it when i bought some from a chinese chemfactory. The diffrence was huge! I was blown away by the chinese stuff probably because it was nothing but pure foxy.


Of course somewhere down the dealer-line it had been cut but it just shows that you should take it easy everytime you get a new batch. Overdosing on foxy is NOT something i would wish on my worst enemy.

foxy was my first "psychedelic" (I sort of hesitate to call it that). I acquired some back in highschool, I guess around 2001. I actually had one really glowing experience on it--I was under the influence when my best friend called me practically crying and told me that he had made out with and fingered the girl that I had a crush on. Being on 5-meo-dipt really helped me work through the situation on a personal level, and on a relationship level (with my friend). Otherwise I probably would have just done something stupid.


Anyway, I never had many body problems, it always seemed like a very casual thing to me. To give an example, I would sometimes take 10mg before school on days when I knew we weren't going to be doing anything in class just to spice things up a bit. In comparison, I felt like I never could (and never did) do that with pot.

I'll reiterate, this is an old thread but I'll toss in my $.02.  I used foxy quite a bit before it was scheduled.


For me, 5-meo-dipt was a very physical drug.  Dancing was pretty magical and focused.  Communication was fairly easy on lower doses, but there was no need to share.  I think I had the best sex, ever (at this point) of my life when my partner and myself had taken 5-meo-dipt.


BUT, the first experience with 5-meo-dipt was a 20mg dose w/ a friend and we were waiting to be blown away, a la 2c-t-2.  It wasn't so, 5-meo-dipt isn't something to take and chill and wait for the insights to flow and the walls to melt.


Attempted foxyhuasca once with paganum harmala seeds.  It was a mellower experience and I got extreme visual trails on everything, eg, glance to the left and all objects in field of vision would have trails.  


After all my 5-meo-dipt experiences I would say, for me, it worked best under 10mg as a dance or sex enhancer, or maybe hiking or swimming too.

i recently tried 12 mg 5-meo-dipt hcl orally with no effect. could this be because of my snri (venlafaxine) use? i actually don't think so, because other tryptamines i've tried recently (dipt, 4-ho-mipt, hbwr seeds, met, dpt) have worked fine.

What dose would you reccomend for a first time experience?  I am very experienced with much more powerful substances, so I know I'll be able to handle it.  I want to experience it's full effects and want to have a good, fun, and relatively strong trip.  I don't want to do a HUGE dose, I just want to do a dose so I can get a REAL GOOD feel for this chemical.  I believe it will be in HCl form.


Any suggestions?  I was thinking somewhere around 12mg orally?  Can anyone help?

I tried ~11mg first time and found it very pleasant. Try to leave open a physical activity or two because it can get a little stimulating. You may want to move about.

Put your 5-meo-dipt in a spoon, and put a few drops of household ammonia on it.  It should freebase instantaneously into a nice small chunk.  Then vaporize it.

I need to learn all these things...


Can you do the ammonia thing with most tryptamines? And does it evaporate cleanly without residue or are you still going to be smoking some ammonia?

I don't think it works for all tryptamines, but I know it works for 5-meo-dipt.  And yes, I would definitely wait till the ammonia evaporates before smoking

I wonder if there's a way to freebase phenethylamines... smoked 2C-E could be interesting *shrugs*


But why on earth would you want to smoke 5-MeO-DiPT? I coudn't imagine that being very pleasant...

I wouldn't smoke 5-MeO-DiPT, personally.  But if you're set on it, go ahead... but be sure to report to us about it, as I've never heard of such a method of administration for it.


The way to convert any alkaloid salt to freebase (tryptamine or phenethylamine) is to dissolve the salt in distilled water (so chlorine and others from tap water don't break it down), and slowly add a base to it.  Ammonia must be a base although I wasn't aware it was.  Sodium hydroxide (lye) is the most often used base for this.  When you add it (drop by drop so you don't overreact it) to a solution of salts (which are formed when an acid attaches to the freebase molecule) it causes the substance to revert back to freebase.


Likewise, you can convert a freebase to a salt by dropping some acid (like hydrochloric, which will form the HCL salt) into water with the freebase floating in it.


But be careful with phenethylamines... many if not all of them are caustic oils in their freebase form.

Say someone got a gram of this stuff (5-meo-dipt hcl)...


I am very experienced with a VAST amount a research chemicals, but I never had the chance to try this one until yesterday. I took 15mg to get a feel for it, a safe low/medium dose.. I noticed like almost threshold effects. Like, i had a tryptamine body bake (giggly and "the feeling"), no visuals, some stimulation, no insight, quite boring actually (I did it alone so erotic was not on my mind). It was not what I wanted.


I want to trip, not just have "general tryptamine stimulation". How much should I increase the dose next time so that the effects will be much more pronounced/prominent, possibly leading to at least a +2.5 on the Shulgin scale? 25mg? 30mg? Less? Should I try intranasal administration? What dose should I start at if I did that?


Also, what about IV administration? I've heard of it being done at 4-5 mg with nothing but good feedback. I know how to IV and I have sterile syringes and I know what I'm doing. What would be the IV dose of this substance, approximately? 3-6mg? Someone please help me.

Orally I find 20mg of the pure compound to be physically very uncomfortable already. As you say, there is little if any insight and yes, it is quite boring too.


Only place it shines is the realm of the erotic (tactile enhancement, delayed orgasm etc) and in Nature (I found the grass and the trees and the flowers to be outstanding even though everyhting looked quite normal). It's not trippy visuals but there is a bit of concept confusion (is the reflection the object or is it not? etc.) and it seems that the substance allowed me to feel the plants differently. They seemed more alive even though they looked the same except for some mild colour enhancement and contour sharpness.


Def. not ma favourite tryptamine. Didn't like what it does physically, and actually it made me feel kinda stupid, like my mind had been totally flabbergasted and impaired by the compound. This remained for a few days and then lifted.

Do your reading.


This chemical has a pretty severe dose/response curve, like most 5-MeOs do.


Just because 15mg felt like threshold doesn't mean shooting for 25mg next is a good idea. Ramp up slowly with this one because there are more than 2 or 3 reports of people losing their minds on it.

No, baking soda is the most often used to convert a salt to a base. Its simple and makes such a smooth smoking mixture (with DPT at least). YMMV with 5-meo-DiPT (yuck smoking it??!?!?).


Using Lye you threaten overshooting the mark and having unreacted lye in the solution (which could make for a very harsh if not dangerous smoke).

In my experiences many years ago, this is how I found the dosage range


10mg = nice body buzz, feels like a good mdma pill

20mg = definitely have the tryptamine mindfuck, good body buzz, some audio distortion

30mg = total mind fuck, cannot understand any spoken words...basically isolated from interacting with anyone else


I never really got visuals from 5-meo-dipt, although I rarely ever get visuals get tryptamines period.  Even large doses of 4ho-dmt or LSD produce only mental effects, not visual.  YMMV.  


As for smoking it, I did that a few times just to try it out, it tasted god awful but it seemed to eliminate most of the stomach discomfort related to the 5ht receptors in the gut that the 5-meo's love to latch onto

If you've got a gram, why not boost it to 20mg and see how you handle that... Seriously, don't take blind jumps with dose on this one... Everyone 5-MeO I've ever done has a pretty steep dose/response curve... and since we're talking about a tryptamine here, its not going to be as forgiving if you overshoot the dose.

I read back and saw some mentions of rectal administration for this substance, but nothing concete was ever really said.  Anyone who has tried it, how much would you say the dosage was reduced, and was it worth doing?  I found 5-MeO-DiPT to be decent, years ago... a little rough, but pleasant.  I'm wondering if rectal administration makes it gentler like it does for so many others.  And I'm also curious as to how much it reduces the required dosage.

Be careful on dosage.  I took 11mg my first time thinking I was a hardhead and it floored me, and I wished I hadn't taken that much.  With this one, more is less.  many find 6-8mg plenty effective including me.

With rectal dosing I found you need 2/3 to 3/4 the oral dose. I usually took 15mg orally, so 11.25mg worked well rectally. I dissolved that in 5.0ml of dH2O and put it into my rectal cavity with a needleless syringe. Comeup was very rapid, usually within 15 minutes.

Nausea is practically eliminated via this route I found, due to the lack of 5-HT receptor activation in the gut.

Then you probably want to try something else.  5-MeO-DiPT isn't that kind of material.  There is little sensory effect until you get to very high dosages...at which point the body-load becomes very uncomfortable.  The effects you describe (body-high, boredom, etc) is about how I'd describe it as well.

I tried 8mg rectally yesterday and had a surpringly enjoyable experience... really nice.  It had a sort of pushy euphoria that reminded me more of MDMA than anything else but methylone.  Nice stuff... no real side effects with rectal dosage either.  It definitely made me hot though... it felt much more like a stimulant than almost any other psychedelic I've tried.


If I had more, I'd do it again from time to time.  It was quite euphoric, really.  Enjoyable all around, although useless aside from recreation.


Also, it made my hearing shift down as DiPT does, except much less dramatically and still in-tune.  But it was more significant than I expected... familiar music sounded totally unfamiliar because it was all being heard in a different key.  And oddly, but mind was still imagining music in the proper key, but when I'd go to sing it, it would come out shifted down!  Hard to wrap my head around that.

I noted significant auditory distortion with 11mg (orally) of this material, but none with 6mg or 8mg.  5-MeO-DiPT and DiPT are the only two psychedelics (I've tried) that do this.

A friend and I each ate 5mg of foxy at 9pm the other evening. Neither of us had done any RC before, though we had done other stuff at various times in our lives, so we wanted to play it safe. To say the experience was underwhelming would be an understatement. 


We peaked after an hour where we found ourselves at a dinner party with heaps of strangers and it became rather difficult to maintain a conversation and we were both aware our pupils were dilated and we were jittery and couldn't sit or stand still. We made a lame excuse and left and ended up walking several km around town. I made a brief stop at a hotel to take a dump, only to realize that I only *felt* like I had to take a dump. Very uncomfortable. My friend tried to talk me into taking another 5mg with him, but I declined, so he smoked a joint instead. 


We then headed to a casino bar and watched a band, and at the baccarat table just behind us a very serious looking Chinese gangster-dude sat down and laid over half a million dollars cash on the table and proceeded to loose it all. We both agreed that was one of those crazy things that you only witness when you're tripping.


We never experienced any CEV or audio enhancements or distortions, no insightful observations, no paranoia though, and my concentration level was not too sharp at times. I felt like I'd just drank 20 cups of coffee - and couldn't stop twitching before I finally got to sleep about 4:30am. The next day I still had some twitches which went away by the afternoon but no other effects.


The trip was rather boring for both of us, and a little uncomfortable for me. We both felt like we were on the edge of experiencing something interesting, but 5mg just didn't get us over that edge. I'll give it a shot at maybe 10mg next time, but I'm in no hurry to do it again.

Don't risk it Ody. People have, certainly, but people have also had significant physical problems from high doses with this material. I wouldn't exceed 24mg, and even that is risky.

God, I wouldn't want to exceed 15mg... when I did my heart felt funny, because it was beating so fast.  It was mostly very uncomfortable.  And this was during a time when I was tripping 2-4 times a week and had a huge tolerance to everything.

Is 200 mg of foxy over ones life time really that bad? Is there any evidence to support such a claim that that amount is bad like this guy said? [http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=27587](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=27587) It sounds like a cop wrote it.

^^ Sounds like someone had a bad reaction to a very high dose of 5-MeO-DiPT.  It would certainly be a giant leap to say that such a reaction to a (very high) dose of a drug means that 200mg of that drug over one's lifetime would have detrimental effects.

Start low... dosing too high produces a very uncomfortable sensation of racing heart.  Music is good to listen to on it as well.  Marijuana would probably help.


I have enjoyed 5-MeO-DiPT on several occasions... it's a bit finicky though.  For what it's worth I enjoyed it rectally the most because there was no body load.

**Freebase 5-MEO-Dipt**


I was just wondering if anybody has done this + smoked it? If so, what were the effects like? I saw a report on erowid from someone who had done this, said he experienced an out of body experience after two minutes and was far superior to 5-Meo-DMT without the "fear element".


Any help would be great ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

I tried to turn my 5-MeO-DiPT HCl into freebase using the method below, but it did not work and I wasted like 20mg.  I probably fucked something up -- I'm sure it would work if you did it right.  I have IV'ed 5-MeO-DiPT before at around 10mg (this would probably be similar to smoking)...it was better than oral (no annoying side effects), but not mindblowing (i think i was rolling at the time though).


I don't think 5-MeO-DiPT could EVER be compared to 5-MeO-DMT in intensity or in effects.  They are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT drugs with completely different effects.  5-MeO-DiPT has never given me a true mindfuck, just mild effects...while 5-MeO-DMT scares the shit out of me and it effectively & completely obliterates my ego.


> ***Put your 5-meo-dipt in a spoon, and put a few drops of household ammonia on it. It should freebase instantaneously into a nice small chunk. Then vaporize it.  I don't think it works for all tryptamines, but I know it works for 5-meo-dipt. And yes, I would definitely wait till the ammonia evaporates before smoking

When you add it (drop by drop so you don't overreact it) to a solution of salts (which are formed when an acid attaches to the freebase molecule) it causes the substance to revert back to freebase.

if you use the simple routine above, you'll have ammonium chloride in your 5-MeO-DiPT freebase, which is surely not optimal for smoking.


you can also smoke 5-MeO-DiPT as hydrochloride, btw. - only a small amount of it will degrade, so don't use your best pipe for it.

You may still get a significant bodyload when plugging 5-meo-DiPT because not all of the nausea/GI discomfort is from the chemical absorbing into the body (but some is from this), but rather from the molecule's affinity with 5HT3 in addition to HT2a (the psychedelic serotonin receptor we know and love).


5-MeO-MiPT is a much better drug comparatively. Have you read about this one? Maybe a friend of yours has some you can have for free? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

check out shulgin's writing on it (in TIHKAL, you should buy this book dude if you don't have it! the essays in it that aren't available online are really entertaining).


Then check out the big and dandy thread on it (and come to the understanding that our experience's with these chemicals sometimes slightly diverge from grand master shulgin's ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)).

Yes, I find 5-MeO-MiPT to be an entirely different drug from 5-MeO-DiPT... but more useful.  It's very healing for me, energetically healing.  5-MeO-DiPT is pointless recreation for me, and not great recreation at that.

but you would agree there are a few similarities, yes? I find the tactile enhancement of both of them to be quite similar (5-meo-MiPT being superior though).

Has anyone experienced a dose of 5-MeO-DiPT that has gone further than this, auditorily? In other words, sufficient distortion that things sound out of tune? Is there vocoding or wobbliness in sounds? Any closed-ear audials (i.e. sounds heard in silence)?

This is very interesting indeed, and something I'd love to test at some point in a controlled experiment. Can you say whether you've had this experience on DiPT as well? I don't know enough about the neural underpinnings of auditory perception and singing; but this sounds like the alteration may be at a level of representation accessible to both perception and motor production. This observation of yours could be very significant in working out how (at a neural level) 5-MeO-DiPT (and DiPT, if it applies to DiPT as well) does what it does to auditory perception.

I have not experienced anything at all like DiPT's audio effects from 5-MeO-DiPT.  I find the two drugs almost completely dissimilar.  5-MeO-DiPT produced the lightest of "level 1" effects (by your definition) of DiPT's audio distortion at the most.  It was just a down-shifting of pitch a step or two.  It never reached any sort of dischordance at all... everything stayed in relative pitch.


And yes, I have had the experience on DiPT (every time in fact) of imagining music in the key I am used to hearing it in but when I go to sing (I am a very good singer... I hit whatever note I mean to without any sort of thought or self-correction), it comes out in the different pitch, but it feels correct.  And when singing along to music that sounds shifted down, music that I am used to singing or humming to in the regular key, it would come out effortlessly in the key shifted down key, even though I'd be imagining it the same way.


It was a bit of a mindfuck to me at the time, especially considering DiPT is quite the mental psychedelic as well.  Actually the mental effects seemed to directly stem from the fact that everything seemed simultaneously normal and wildly altered.

Ah, okay... and I'm getting the impression that, even if much higher doses of 5-MeO-DiPT could take one further auditorily, the stimulation etc could make that undesirable?

This is so very interesting. And indeed quite a mindfuck to think about, even not having experienced it (not having ever sung while on DiPT (I've no idea why I haven't!)). I thought I understood what you were describing, but the implications are quite confusing, and I'm having a hard time understanding what it means...


Let's say the piece is in C, and you have a 1 semitone pitch drop. So, objectively it's in C, and you perceive it as being in B. If the relationship between your motor representation of the piece and the sounds you objectively produced with your vocal cords were unchanged, and you were activating the motor representations in the (objectively) normal key of C (regardless of the fact that you were hearing a piece in B), then that would result in you singing objectively (and subjectively) in tune with the piece: objectively in C, subjectively in B. 


But this, although it would account for your experience behaviourally; I don't think it works as an explanation, because I don't think it would be an easy matter at all to sing what you think will come out in C when you're hearing something in B. I've never tried to do that (on or off DiPT), and maybe an accomplished singer would find it easier (or harder? I don't know), but I can't imagine it being an effortless experience, even if the sensory feedback of your 'C' were 'B'.


Unless... okay, need to break this down further. 1) Sound in the world (recorded piece) --> 2) vibrations in ear --> 3) coded for frequency in auditory cortex --> 4) selection of motor response (i.e. frequency to sing) --> 5) activation of motor response (vocal cords adjusted appropriately) --> 6) Sound in the world (singing).


So what we know is that (sticking with the piece being in C, for the sake of argument), 1 and 6 were in C (because, for your singing to sound in tune to you, it'd have to be objectively in the same key). Unless physiological changes are proposed, so were 2 and 5. By your report of the pitch shift, we know 3 is in B. You believe you were selecting the motor response for the pitch the piece was normally in (so your representation of that pitch needs to go into the process as well, feeding into 4), so 4 is in C. And there's an additional offshoot to the process, as 5 will produce motor-feedback (efferent copy) to allow you to monitor performance directly (rather than through sensory feedback alone). I'd be interested to know whether you can disambiguate further the efference from the motor command: in other words, when you say it felt correct (despite sounding in B), do you mean that you were selecting the normal (in C) notes to sing, or that it felt like you were singing in C when you actually produced the note (despite sounding in B)? Or both?


Leaving aside having a piece whose key is known to you and with which you are familiar, what would your experience be on being played a single note and asked to sing it? If the result were similar to when the piece is known, you should select the note objectively a semitone above the perceived note, and they'd be objectively and subjectively in tune. Having ruled out the representation of the song itself, that would place the alteration at the level of the selection of motor command, and possibly with the efferent copy too.


Oh, but that wouldn't work, to the extent that you have absolute pitch (and I'm guessing, even if you don't have perfect pitch, you have fairly good perception of absolute pitchclass). So even a single note could be as familiar as a song, in that respect. This would be easier to disambiguate on a reasonable singer with good relative pitch production and appalling absolute pitch perception, maybe.


Yep, I'm confuzzled and fascinated by the question of how 5-MeO-DiPT and DiPT affect singing and perception of self singing.


ETA: Another thought on this: it would be interesting to know how far into a DiPT or 5-MeO-DiPT experience this effect is found... immediately, or only after a while, or initially but not forever. I wonder this, out of analogy with the extensively studied phenomenon of adaptation to spatial misalignment...


When one's vision is distorted by prism-goggles, such that everything visually appears shifted to the left of where it really is (equivalent: pitch is shifted down); it's really weird to start with: you can try to point straight ahead (equivalent: trying to sing a C, say), and you will objectively point straight ahead (you really are singing a C)  and it will feel as if you are pointing straight ahead (it feels like you're singing in the normal key of C), but you will see your arm pointing to the left (you'll hear a B)...


 After a while, though, your perception alters, with the end result being that - when you try to point straight ahead (try to sing a C) - you will actually point to the right of straight ahead (objectively sing a C-sharp) - but it will feel as if you are pointing straight ahead (it'll feel as if you're singing a C) and you will see your arm pointing straight ahead (you'll hear a C). In other words, as far as you're concerned, the experience is normal again. 


I'm not sure which, if either, of these stages of prism-exposure (initial direct effects and adaptation) your experience is equivalent to; but it would be very interesting to know whether the experience changes after enough time singing while on DiPT, or if it starts off one way, and turns into the other.


(... of course, this isn't quite equivalent to your singing along experience; rather, the 'pointing straight ahead' task is equivalent to someone with good absolute pitch production trying to sing a C, without any reference point; whereas singing along to a song (or a heard note) is equivalent to pointing to a visual target, since your action is guided by a (shifted) target.)


ETA: (Sorry, this post's getting awful long...) Also, I left out the complexities of which modality shifts (vision or arm/motor; hearing or singing) in adaptation, since it practically makes little difference (you need relatively subtle techniques to see which has happened) and there's no consensus on what determines it, even in prism adaptation.

Some people talk shit about it and yes I did have the worst trip ever on an overdose of it but i've come to a conclusion... with 5-MeO-DiPT the 8-12mg dosage range is key and for rave events it trumps even MDMA especially if your with a girl and you two have chemistry then WOW is all I can say talk about euphoria and empathy!!! Basically used in the right dosage in the right setting with the right person it can be one of the best substances peroid!!! However taking a high dose like over 25mg to try and trip well yes you trip in a very LSD like way but the sensory distortions become too much and lead to freakouts easy cause the same sensory enhancement that it has is amplified many times over in high doses which can be really unpleasant. 


The right dose though with a girl you have feelings for there is nothing better and also its great for dancing and glowsticking too!!!

**Foxy?**


I haven't run into this substance yet and i've been seaching for quite some time now. I've heard that its like a tryptamine version of 2c-b, which greatly interests me. I've been told that it is pretty difficult to make so therefore other things are made in place of it. Any thoughts or experiences?

Thinking of trying this substance with my girl for the first time today.

I am thinking of a 10mg oral dose. I have heard from someone experienced with this compound that insufflation is the best ROA, because oral causes too many GI problems. Can anyone confirm this? I know there GI problems in some users. But would insufflation lead to less negative side effects (with the stomach)? And if so, how does the dosage correspond between oral and insufflated? If I want a 10mg oral dose, how much should be insufflated?


Should I just go oral? Also, is it better to fast prior to consume or eat a little something. If so when should last food intake be prior to dosing?


Thanks for answering some ?'s ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I will post my thoughts of foxy after trial.

I wouldn't recommend insufflation, as this is a pretty stimulating compound which has caused some deaths.  I'd stick to oral... it works quickly and efficiently that way.


It's best to have an empty stomach.  I don't necessarily think it's ever good to completely fast because it's good to have nutrition in your body to trip, rather than being starved of food for longer than necessary.  But an empty stomach is essential for the most complete absorption of any drug.

5-MeO-DiPT is more euphoric and erotic than 5-MeO-MiPT to me. luckily, foxy gives me no bad side effects that lots of people are complaining about.

Hello!  I've been coming here for a while now and this is my first, maybe of many, posts!


Love to BlueLight, there's nothing else like it and this site is incredibly valuable.


This stuff is great in my mind and I really miss it.  I got no negative effects really from 5-meo-dipt.


On oral doses of 20 Mg's there was usually a point where the body buzz would get so intense that I would have to lay down for ten minutes or so. Oral effects for me were:

Strong and pleasant body buzz, clear head, some audio pitch-lowering, unique but mild visuals and alot of fun! No side effects for me at this MoA.


I smoked it quite a bit more than I ate it in the 6-8 Mg range.  This was my favorite way to use it, often on week nights because it came on and left so quickly. It would usually leave me with a slight headache but nothing that would keep me from doing it several times a week! 

Smoked the 5-meo-dipt gave me a simply beatufil trypamine buzz with no other real effects but I never pushed the dose.


As far as the sexual effects of this drug I can only comment on the smoked route as I didn't have a partner while I was eating it. 

I don't know about you guys but I found this stuff to have a very powerful and unique sexual effect. Almost immediately after smoking a hit I would get a monsterous boner! There was some tactile enhancement, sex was really great but not especially better than some others. One thing though is that it would make me cum HARD. HARD!!!! I would also continue with the 'spasm' part of the orgasm long after the juice had run out. It was almost disturbing! 

I like sex better on 2-c's and E (can't come on E but the boner works just fine) but the 'gasm from this stuff is the strongest I've ever encountered. 

Also, I can see how it might get a great sexual reputation beyond just my reaction simply based on the fact that you even CAN cum on it. I can't get it up on mushrooms and can't nut on LSD or MDMA.


I noticed another poster mentioning visuals at the "angles of objects". I got this effect from it. Anywhere corners would meet they would have angular fractal explosions coming out of them with a look that reminded me of LSD. I also got LSD-like strange attractor-fractal eyballs with this stuff but they were always very small compared to other tryps that give me this effect.


Wish I could get some more! Very light and recreational, not deep at all. Great material for anything sensual. Hot tubbing, playing music, fucking, walking (except for the couch lockey peak).

Cheers!

Ive had a unpleasent experience every time ive done this substance. The first time It was so auditorly hallucinationed that I couldn't really enjoy it. It was pretty cool i guess to hear a robot symphony. other than that I really didn't like it. This coming from someone who enjoys tripping in almost every other aspect. My second and final experience with foxy was about the same. robot voices very little visuals.. Maybe if it were more visual for me I might enjoy it. IDK my second experience I also had an insane bodyload and cramping afterwords. 

Dosing 

first time= 30mg

second= roughly 40ish give or take.

I think you are talking about DiPT and not 5-MeO-DiPT (foxy).

what's the short-term tolerance like? how much should one wait in between trips to have the effect back? what about redosing after the comedown - how would that work out?


what about long-term tolerance? is it like acid/shrooms/mescaline where you don't get the tolerance given you wait, or like MDMA or DXM where the magic is gone forever?

this RC seems like it would be fun at a rave in lower doses (little to no nausea and body load, plus it doesnt last too long) How is the cross tolerance with MDMA? Could you mix it with MDMA or would that be a no-no?

this was a popular combo back when foxy was popular.


Be sure to take a lower dose of each than you normally would as they will potentiate each other.

Ah...the Foxy Flip. Good times.


I recommend doing the foxy first, because it tends to last longer (6-8 hour plateau?) than mdma. Foxy has no inherent euphoric push, so if you were on foxy and were depressed because you are coming down off your roll, I would expect the feeling would be magnified. So I like to come down on the foxy at or before my come down from mdma. But if you are going to be re-dosing mdma to extend the roll, this may be less of an issue.


I recommend having ghb on hand to smooth out any rough edges -- foxy can make you anxious and jittery.


Foxy can be unsettling for many people if there is too much stimulation. Doing it with mdma would likely lessen this issue, so a rave or club might be okay (I've enjoyed it in such places), but I'd recommend having a quiet / calm place you can go to if you do not like it.


Foxy messes with your sense of time. Expect lots of deja vu. Don't drive on a foxy flip because your sense of speed may be shot to hell.


A number of times on my foxy flips, I went through a difficult stage where I felt like I was going insane, once I kept saying that time had fractured, just very frightening experience, then to roll kicked in and it all became heavenly. For a while I had a theory that you have to pass through this hellish stage to get to the heavenly stage. Like the foxy and mdma have to do battle before they can make peace. But I'm not sure it happens every time or to every person, it's just something I noticed for myself. I think it also depends on the dose of each that you do.


Both of these substances amp me up, so I am really giving myself a work out dancing, screwing, whatever, to the point that I fear I may have a heart attack. Never bothered to measure my pulse, just felt I was really pushing it. But that could just be anxiety.


Foxy itself I think is generally bad for any bright, noisy, crowded type of environment. I've enjoyed it most either at home, at small parties where I felt comfortable, or in loungy places. It has no euphoric push, so you better be in a good mood or you might really not like the experience (some ghb is good for giving it a soft euphoric push, xanax would probably also work well).


Those are just some thoughts from reading the last few posts.

just picked up a good amount of the foxy. Enough for several trials. I was wondering about some of your thoughts concerning how I should go about my experiments with the material.


In what ways did you come to know foxy?

What were you expectations for the material?

When in your experiments did you become able to navigate the 5-meo-dipt space with special focus and/or confidence.

Anyone have problems with early trials and  decided to abandon? 


Any recent thoughts on the material would be nice to have. I started reading through some of the older posts... but I'm looking for some fresh ideas. Thanks.


So far, I have had 2 trials with the material. About 3 years ago I was able to acquire a dose, which i had taken with my girlfriend at the time. It was a 20 mg capsule which we divided in half. I took what looked like the bigger half... probably between 10 and 12 mg I would say leaving her with 8-10 mg. It was not very good for me, and it was somewhat strange for her. It was her first rc experience.... and probably last and she wasn't particularly fond of hallucinogens at this point. They scared her a bit. 

We came on and it was a very strange come up for at least 2 hours... we could not find a balance despite our efforts to find one. We went for a walk, but got weirded out and decided to walk back no sooner than 10 minutes after we had set out.  When we got back the come-up got stranger. it was probably 45 minutes after initial dosing at this point. I was having terribly strange stomach feelings. Very unpleasant body effects. I spent some time on the shitter, but it was very tough for me to actually complete the process.I spent time on and off the toilet for the next few hours. I got pretty fucked up bodily effects from it, and her bodily effects were not too bad. She didn't complain too much, but it weirded her out that I had such a strange reaction to the chem. I think she had expected me to handle much better than I did. I was fine, I just couldn't help but sit on the toilet due to the weird feeling in my stomach.


Afterwards I think we took a shower together.... I can't remember that may have been another trip. Then we laid in bed and kissed and made wonderful jokes with each other. We laughed and listened to all sorts of types of music. Music sounded great... I could hear the raw intensity of each artist's expression and I was very pleased. 


I couldn't get hard though. That was a negative. We wanted to make love, and it was near impossible for me to get hard. This doesn't usually happen on any other drug. Usually if I try it isn't too hard at all. This time I really wanted to get it up for her, but I had to be the disappointment this time. ah well. It may have been the fact that my body still felt pretty terrible.


Kissing and touching was fun though. 


So then I got my recent supply, and had a rainy day off from work, and I decided to do an experiment early in the morning. I did about 8 mg... although it may have been a bit more. the scale said 8, but sometimes it can be a mg or 2 off. I should have double checked. oh well.  I figured it was low enough where it wouldn't matter all too much. I think i got it about right.


I had a similar trip to the first one. My stomach was fucked up. I had a bunch of chinese food the night before... and I think a bowl of cereal that morning. So that may have been the problem. I believe my first dose was on a somewhat empty stomach. I spent much more time on the toilet this time I am sure. But I was alone, so i didn't have much to do besides go back on the toilet in hopes of moving something out. Never really happen... maybe a couple squirts, but that's it... no substance... but still that lingering feeling.


The first hour wasn't bad. The come-up was smooth, despite the nausea. It wasn't very alarming... the negative body effect had a gradual increase as did the decent mental, psychedelic effects. The mental effects were light, but noticeable... I am excited to try higher doses to grasp a better understanding of the mental effects this material produces. I had a jam session with my brother. I did some guitar and vocals while my brother played the conga. It was a pretty incredible experience. I haven't jammed with him in a few years. He just stopped playing, and I was kind of off doing my own thing. It was awesome to drive him. I had a nice psychedelic push and a special edge and character to my vocal display. The guitar playing was pretty dope too. My brother got the conga going real good as he helped bring out his intensity with the changes of rhythm and tempo. It was awesome. We smoked a little weed. I was hoping it would make my negative body effects go away, but it didn't...  It may have made them worse, giving me a tension in my chest and the feeling that I should lay down. My brother went back to bed, and I stayed up. 


The next 4 hours were me attempting to read some camus, sitting on the toilet, and laying around and bed, I listened to a small amount of music using my headphones.... but It was uncomfortable and I was too lazy to set up the speakers... I would just strum the guitar every time I wanted some sound.


The visual effects were minor, but noticeable. Slight morphing and shifting of objects. It happened especially in the floor tiles while I sat on the toilet... Bathrooms always get my tripped out when I'm using psychedelics. They somehow increase the effects in all areas just a bit. maybe it is just my imagination.


more to come in the next few months. My plan is to use the material over the next few months... maybe the next year. I'll probably do a dose every 3 - 4 weeks or so. I'm not so sure about how fast I'm getting work up the doses. I'll probably hit up a high dose in the winter. Sometime in September I think I'm going to go for my next experiment with the material. I'm thinking about using between 12-15mg. I haven't fully decided whether I should stay lower or go higher... I'm pretty sure I could ride out the higher dose trips... I just like gradual building and strengthening my comfort level with the material. The high doses are better when you are somewhat acquainted with the material, I believe.


I'll stop now... I'll be back to post more when I know more.... or when I have found some sort of interesting information. Peace.

I've heard good things about DiPT... Never sampled myself though. Here is the link to the big and dandy DiPT thread.

i recently sampled some foxy....

dose was ~9mg (1mg variation), orally. it happened at night, in a club setting. there were no substances consumed for up to a week prior to the experience.


t-0: eaten in a gelcap, on top of a very light dinner eaten a couple of hours earlier. started dancing waiting for the comeup


t+30: alertness regarding the trip start, some jitteryness, pupil dilation apparent. half a beer was consumed, but no interaction apparent


t+1:20: trip is generally estabished, though it is hard to tell visual distortions because of the general darkness of the setting. there is a definite lift in mood, increased confidence, and dancing feels great, like there is no care in the world. music is undistorted, but something is different about it... hard to explain, it is like i should be paying more attention to it, but it is not the increased enjoyment i get from other substances (like mdai, or 2cs)


t+2:30: side effects become a bit of a bother. gi effects not so evident, no sickness, just great thirst that i cannot satisfy with water. drinking anything feels uncomfortable (like drinking on a full stomach). smells are a lot more apparent: anything unpleasant make the nose cringe. there is also some time dilation, songs feel longer and sometimes i lose interest midway. there is stimulation, but the general need to move on to other more interesting things is also there. still, the positive outweighs the negative


t+3h: convesations are not this substances strong point. there is a lack of openness and loss of words. the ideas are there, but the words do not seem to find themselves easily. nothing insightful shared with others. getting a bit worried about the trip going bad, i leave the club setting and head for home


t+4h: at home, watching some images on the computer, it seems there are some visuals to be experienced... not patterning, but breathing of models, text sways on the page. the stimulation persists, as does the boredom after doing the same activity for more than a few minutes.


t+4:30: sleep is attempted without problems.


next day: no hangover, general mood is ok (not lifted) memory of previous night is intact.


general opinion: interesting substance, though my experience with rcs is not that vast. i say interesting because the setting for the trial might not have been the best, and so the results though overall positive were a bit unspectacular. will be trying it in the future, but in a more private setting. dose-wise might go wither way, a bit higher or lower next time

I've taken this substance twice now. Both times oral and I'll most likely try it IM in a week or two. I was pretty skeptical about this substance, given the fact that most reviews border on the negative side.


1st time: 15 mg, oral & sublingually. horrible taste, but manageable.


t+40min: felt a pressure in my stomach. tried to barf, but couldn't get any air out without solids. went to the toilet. puked very naturally. body high went away and the puking wasn't bad, I actually enjoyed it. The problem was that I've eaten some lentil curry 2 hours earlier. bad idea.

t+40-t+3h: mild visuals, but present, very nice euphoria, mild auditive distortions, definitely psychedelic mindset, but all in mild proportions.. basically, it was very 'refreshing' and euphoric at the same time. had great time with the lady friend. nice. nothing serious. very good evening.


2st time: 25mg, oral & sublingually

t+20: same pressure felt, even though I have eaten only 2 baked potatoes 1 hour earlier. tried to puke to get the pressure out of my stomach, but managed to barf a few times and only puked enough to feel better, not much. body high returned to 'strong enough to feel good' for another 20 mins and then it subsided.

t+40-t+4h40mins: wow. the visuals are quite strong. strong and weird. everything is pulsating, very strong ripples, fractals dancing everywhere, ALLOT of traces and 'smoke'. external geometrical patterns that I'm used to have while closing my eyes are appearing quite randomly in my OE field. very nice stuff, but a little creepy because the pulsating microlight is quite strong. extremely nice body feeling, warmth, erotic, waves of womb-ness feeling... very nice. intense psychedelic mindspace. can't be too analytical like on 2C-E..the coldness and detachment isn't there.. I'm totally emotionally immersed in my thoughts. auditive distortions are clearly present. my gf actually had a few hard moments, until she got used to them.

t+4h40min-t+6h40: effects are starting to weaken. the body sensation was too strong(in a good way) to have sex, even though we could have. now its ok. sex is fucking great. erection lasts longer than usual ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Gonna be sampling this before too long hopefully.  Anyone ever vape this stuff?  I'd assume it would be possible, but not sure as to how effective..  Also, since i'll be starting with low doses, this could be a good way to top up (potentially).  I'd like to avoid insufflation, and I'm a bit anxious about the purported GI disturbances, which is why I was considering vaporization.

I tried this stuff yesterday(14 mg orally), and didn't like it much(although I am a fan of MeO-tryptamines).

I think it is deeper and more "sexual" than 5-MeO-MiPT, but bodyload spoils all fun.


It is kinda strange that it was popular during pre-WebTryp era.

I personally like it. But yeah, most people I know get a lot of gastric problems from 5-meo-dipt. I luckily don´t.

^ I can see why people like it.


IME, 5-MeO-DiPT is "amplified" version of 5-MeO-MiPT. They key problem is that negative side effects are "amplified" much more, comparing to positive effects, thus making 5-MeO-DiPT less balanced chemical(in term of effects).


The muscle tension is what renders all experience bad. But I am definitely going to give 5-MeO-DiPT another try. Maybe I'll take 25 mg the next time.

25 mg ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) Taking larger doses will  amplify the side effects too (stating the obvious)


I don´t know....when I take it, I take either 10 or 12 mg. I don´t think taking 25 mg will make it more enjoyable. But well, I guess it´s worth a try ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I never get muscle tension really.

This is true. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Well, 25 mg is an overkill probably, but I am not going to dose lower than 20 mg. It is high dose too, but 14 mg was underwhelming in terms of mental effects, and I would like to test the potential of 5-MeO-DiPT for mindfuck.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Is 5-MeO-DiPT thought-provoking, mind-altering psychedelic at 10-12 mg? Or is it more of entactogenic/aphrodisiac/mood-improving type of drug?

at the 10-12 mg level, that I take it, I think it would classify more as entactogenic/aphrodisiac/mood-improving, but still with a touch of tryptamine trippyness, of cause.


I don´t think I ever took more than 12 mg in one go. But I have friends who did, and as I understand it, the sexual stimulating feeling can become almost too overwhelming at high doses.


on a side note, it works fine to insufflate it, and it doesn´t burn at all. it´s quite pleasant on the nose actually.

I´ve been doing it a lot at festivals when tolerance becomes an issue.

I find that when redosing it several times, together with other psychedelics, it kind of changes character, and looses the stimulating/entactogenic/aphrodisiac side. And becomes more like a "regular" psychedelic. But still not too deep, I´d say. it´s definitely on the recreational/hedonistic side.


Actually, Allium, I don´t think you should be so quick to write 5-meo-dipt off.

I recently did a proper trial with 5-meo-dipt. Im not quite sure how much I ingested, but likely somewhere in the 20mg range. It must also be noted that other compounds were taken in the same timeframe, and prior to ingestion of 5-meo-dipt. MDMA and 2C-D were dosed earlier in the evening. As the effects from the mdma subsided slightly, more 2C-D was added, and the first dose of 5-meo-dipt taken. I didn't really feel the effects of 5-meo-dipt until the mdma had mostly worn off. I decided to take more 5-meo-dipt and 2C-D about an hour after my first dose. By now Im tripping nicely. This drug feels very euphoric to me, it has a very strong body high which I find to be extremely pleasant, and sometimes erotic in nature. It is somewhat visual as well displaying the typical range of 5-meo-trypt visual effects. My thinking feels quite analytical and controlled, and watching a documetary on tv, it feels like cognition and learning is enhanced(possible nootropic effect of 2c-d?). Due to time constraints, I decide to cancel the trip with 1mg flunitrazepam, which brings me back to baseline in 20-30min. 


Edit: Also to be noted; I suffered no gastric distress or any other unpleasant body effects from 5-meo-dipt. All doses were insufflated. Though, I would not recommend this roa due to the horrible taste and drip of this chem, similar in nature to 5-meo-mipt.

Ate about 12mg recently, after waking up from a nap. I was having wild dreams, and within minutes of waking up I weighed some foxy and ate the capsule. I waited a half hour or so, then jumped in the shower. After getting out, I became very stimulated, then began experiencing some gastric problems. I was reluctant to go sit on the toilet. I made a sandwich, and after only a few bites I had gone to the toilet. Fairly normal toilet experience. Time seemed to slow down. After getting off the stimulation continued and I was starting to get anxiety. I tried to chill out. I smoked a hit of weed.... After the hit, my mind was set on leaving the apartment. 


I walked about the city for a few hours. The mind-space was pretty good. It was really nice for me to get outside. I felt better and better the further I walked from my place. My thoughts were a bit crazed, and in some ways I felt like I was still in the dreamscape I was in before waking up. I had a lot of thoughts going on about various life situations. The thought patterns reminded me of mushroom experiences from the past. 


The experience wasn't visual at all really. I felt wonderful. The euphoria was good. I felt a bit goofy, and felt that all things shared this goofy feeling. Walking felt great. The coldness outside felt good. The wind felt good. When I returned home my hands were frozen. I didn't really notice while I was out and about.


A cartridge of nitrous felt grand.


I got to bed some 8-9 hours after dosing. Talked to the roommate and the lady friend for a while during the latter half of the trip. Socializing was fun. My subtle goofyness carried through.Getting to sleep wasn't very difficult.


I enjoyed foxy at this level. Moreso than my other experiences. 20mg was too much, and I found it to be too much of a sensory overload. The audio effects were strange, the visual effects were fairly interesting, and the stimulating effect made it feel awkward to sit and relax. The effects lasted 8-10 hours. 6mg was too small. It was mostly just stimulation with a slight goofyness for 5-6 hours or so. 

 10-14mg seems as though it'd be the most enjoyable level for me.

It's illegal in the US. I hate this stuff, gave me and 4 of my friends HPPD for several months. Each time I took it (by accident, my rolls had MDMA + Foxy, so only the MDXX showed up on the tests) I never feel right for the next 5 days, like I've poisoned my brain almost. Stuff doesn't seem right to take, IMO at least. I've heard only good from others, maybe its just the foxy flip that made it so terrible.

What would a good starter dose be for 5-MeO-DiPT? I'm pretty sensitive to tryptamines, so I was thinking maybe ... 10mg? I don't want to underdose, as I had an unpleasant underdose experience with 5-MeO-MiPT that consisted of nothing more than being uncomfortabe for three or four hours.


Speaking of which, is the body load on this stuff really that bad? People told me to look out for the body load on drugs like 2C-E, mescaline and 2C-T-2, but honestly, mushrooms made me way more uncomfortable and nauseous than either of those. Is this stuff worse?


How stable is foxy, chemically speaking? I don't trip very often, so I'm sure this sample will last me some years, but I'm unsure if I need to make room in my freezer for it.

6-8mg is good starter dose. I haven't eaten less than 6. 12mg was fairly strong for me though. I've done up to 20mg. It can be pretty strong stuff. I am interested in playing with it some more. I had strange hallucinations at 20mg. 12mg had a mindset that reminded me of mushrooms. 


Not super sure on the stability. I've had mine in a couple bag store in a cool dark place for a couple years know. I ate it a few months ago. It seemed just as potent as when I got it.


The first few times I ate this stuff I got a strange body load with it. I found that it was mostly psychosomatic, and I learned to ignore it for the most part. 


I've had varied experiences. None of them completely incredible. But I have felt very euphoric during the peak. I especially like walking. I could walk for hours at the peak. Usually 2 hours in I start feeling really good. I got a nice body buzz going. I am stimulated. I would like to eat this at a club in the future. 


I'd say eat 6mg. It should be similar in strength to 1g mushrooms. 12mg probably have similar strength to 2g shrooms. Very loose observation though, based on subjective experiences as well as inferences made from others experiences. 


My advice... try not to get turned off by the body load. Go for a walk or something, you'll probably feel better than just sitting around. Stay around 6 or 8 if you don't want anything to mental. Don't look for visual / auditory hallucinations. They aren't very great. Visual can be kinda cool. I prefer focusing on the sense of touch with this chemical. 


 I can't speak much for dancing, because I haven't eaten this stuff at the club yet. 

I tend to get anxious just sitting around. I went out in the freezing cold once for a walk after eating this stuff. When I got home my hands were frozen. I felt so nice while I was outside. I didn't realize it until I walked into the warm house.


Good luck.

i was sold foxy as E and took it at a edm show. Best time ever, even more fun than mdma in my opinion. Put me in such a trance to the music, felt connected to everyone, cool flashing visuals, no mind fuck, laughed my ass OFF for a good hour on the way home. only downside was trying to sleep and getting creepy electric visuals in the dark ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

10mg of this material had me in a foxy place for a few hours. Felt some alerts 30 minutes in, but the fox really came to be around 2 hours in. Time moved fast. Laughs were had. Moves were busted. The dose was slightly psychedelic, allowing my mind to rattle off endlessly giving me time to explore the words and attitude I chose. I laid around, I danced around, I did some yoga. I had some stomach discomfort, but I attribute that to the amount of junk food I ate the past few days. Yuck! It was difficult for me to relieve my bowels. And an instant that foxy feeling faded some 6 hours after consuming the material. I was left with a pleasant stimulation. I enjoyed watching  the television as I began to quiet my mind. I focus on the people in the box for a while, then I lay down and continue to listen, finally I drift from their voices, then on the verge of falling asleep I get up turn the television off and go to bed. I went to bed maybe 8 or 9 hours after eating the foxy. I slept fine. 


This stuff got me really excited. I've eaten it a few times. A few experiences were neutral, then the other times I found to be enjoyable. This was certainly enjoyable. 


One minor weird thing though. While I was peaking, I got talking and then laughing about one particular thing. I laughed very hard. My head hurt while I was laughing though. Hmm may have been the weed I was toking. 


I probably won't eat this for a while, but I am excited to eat it again. The stuff is pretty good. I'm curious to how toxic it is. What is up with these 5-MEO compounds. They all seem to give me some weird sensations one way or the other - usually stomach related. My head hurt a bit on 5-meo-amt, and on a combo of 5-meo-dmt and mushrooms my head hurt the flash. 5-meo-dipt hurt my head in a similar way. I had to really focus on letting my body and mind sit still to make it go away. Then it seemed like all the energy was circulating through my body most speedily. Weird!

The GI issues may be a result of 5-HT3 agonism, I'm not sure.

The energized feeling may possibly come from monoamine reuptake inhibition or non-selective serotonin agonism.


What is also interesting:


> Many drugs are used or abused in social contexts without understanding the ramifications of their use. In this study, we examined the effects of a newly popular drug, 5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MEO-DIPT; 'foxy' or 'foxy-methoxy'). Two experiments were performed. In the first, 5-MEO-DIPT (0, 10, or 20 mg/kg) was administered to rats four times on a single day and animals were examined 3 days later. The animals that received 5-MEO-DIPT demonstrated hypothermia during the period of drug administration and delayed mild hyperthermic rebound for at least 48 h. Corticosterone levels in plasma were elevated in a dose-dependent manner compared to saline-treated animals with minor changes in 5-HT turnover and no changes in monoamine levels. In experiment 2, rats were examined in behavioral tasks following either 0 or 20 mg/kg of 5-MEO-DIPT. The animals treated with 5-MEO-DIPT showed hypoactivity and an attenuated response to (+)-methamphetamine-induced stimulation (1 mg/kg). In a test of path integration (Cincinnati water maze), 5-MEO-DIPT-treated animals displayed deficits in performance compared to the saline-treated animals. No differences were noted in the ability of the animals to perform in the Morris water maze or on tests of novel object or place recognition. The data demonstrate that 5-MEO-DIPT alters the ability of an animal to perform certain cognitive tasks, while leaving others intact and disrupts the endocrine system. 5-MEO-DIPT may have the potential to induce untoward effects in humans. - See more at: [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/papers/17047665#sthash.F6ArfHi5.dpuf](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/papers/17047665#sthash.F6ArfHi5.dpuf)

I've used it a few times, and had mild GI issues that I was able to overcome. The effects were mostly interesting to me when I also used ketamine. It made it a lot more psychedelic and it may have enhanced the body high to make it more comfortable, by numbing side-effects.

It felt a little toxic to me, I would say it felt alright to do a few times / occasionally, but not more often than that.

Both the N,N-diisopropyl substitution and the 5-Methoxy substitution make this one very stable.  I've had some almost decade old 4-AcO-DiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT stored at room temperature with desiccants and neither show any degradation, and I would expect 5-MeO-DiPT to be even more stable than either of those compounds.

I found this drug to be quite visual and very euphoric. Yet, it was still very clear headed and allowed me to focus on mixing music which would normally be impossible on psychedelics.


Good shit, either way! I liked it almost better than mushrooms, it seemed like it had a positive push to it that most other tryptamines completely lack

7mg snorted with a 4mg booster after an hour or two. The fact that I insufflated it might have added to the positive push that I could never find with 4-AcO-DMT or mushrooms but overall it was a great trip.


Amazing (but not overpowering) visuals, a fairly intense body high and a clear yet still very psychedelic headspace. I'm surprised there's so much negative feedback on this one!! I did end up throwing up, but most psychedelics do that to me and I ate Taco Bell like an hour or so before dosing so that certainly didn't help.

The only other time I tried it I was on such a large amount of other substances that I literally couldn't distinguish the effects... so I don't have a base to compare it to.


7mg was a bit underwhelming though, I'll probably aim for 10mg or so next time and take it orally. Erowid says that redosing via insufflation works quite well and I'd agree, redosing psychedelics usually doesn't work out too well but the fairly quick come up speed can let you titrate your dose up to where you want to be. I could see how a "body load" might get in the way for others but that translated into euphoria for myself. I understand why it's sometimes sold as MDMA, but it's WAY too psychedelic to pass off as anything other than what it is.... Foxy :D

Interesting! I have 500mg I have yet to try - I think the time has come to give it a whirl. I usually like mixing with a bit of alcohol and a few bumps of cocaine... Anything else is a little too distracting - will have to experiment with this stuff.

I would certainly recommend it, I was very skeptical of it at first after reading all the trip reports but in the end it seems to be a very worthwhile psychedelic. Can't wait to try it again!

Seems this has become almost impossible to find these days ....lucky for me i got to try some recently and found it to be a awesome experience ....totally unlike any tryptamine i have tried... pure cosmic love shooting straight up my spine neither a masculine or feminine compound....

a hermaphroditic psychedelic if that makes sense ... its not pushy love like 2cb or a pure flood of empathy like good MDMA its more of a breezy tryptamine love that really connected under my circumstances..the auditory effects are minimal but it had what i would call alien pitch shifts strange stuff...not much of a bodyload other then what is experienced with most tryptamines i would call it chakra purging...the visuals i would say are similar to Dpt and low dose 4homet...very wavy yet ethereal....this is def a compound for the RC connoisseur there is nothing else quite like it and i would put it on par with the greats being that its so obscure truly some foxy stuff...i kept my doses around 15mg and i would say that was perfect..i could only imagine how great the extremely rare MIPT and DIPT are...

I think DiPT is pretty sexy as well, but as always the 5-MeO is a bit more charged and frantic. Still, I disagree that 5-MeO-DiPT is exaggerated 5-MeO-MiPT... on the latter I just tend to feel over-energized, anxious and tense while on the two times I took 5-MeO-DiPT, I felt more or less fine.

MiPT I don't like, it just made me feel weird - alienated. 4-HO-MiPT also has that alien quality for me but is at least interesting, fun and a bit easier to handle body-wise.

DiPT is a high-class psychedelic, incredibly unique with the potential to be spiritual and deep and profound.  It feels good too.  5-MeO-DiPT I found pretty stimulating in a somewhat uncomfortable way, but fun.  I vastly prefer 5-MeO-MiPT to 5-MeO-DiPT, for me it's a wonderful tool for energy realignment when necessary, but none of them rank even close to DiPT.

Surprised we only have a single thread on this with only 377 (now 378) posts, given it was one of the original RCs available and was quite popular.  I tried it a couple of times in college at 20mg (it was sold at that dose and I didn't know anything about it), and later in lower doses.  I like it, although not as much as 5-MeO-MiPT or many other psychedelics.

Ive only tried it once and the setting wasnt proper for it ... nor is my scale... given the size of the dose I doubt the accuracy of my gemini pro ... even with added weight on the tray and taking averages...  but I digress


Wasnt a bad experience. Comparable to 5 meo mipt, from what I remember but less visual (not much in the way of colour enhancement, slight breathing/patterning...), felt more shakey throughout than 5 meo mipt though. Weed helped to settle in.. Cant recall the dose though


Would definitely repeat for a social evening when everyone else is drinking.

Its short duration and lucid head space has its positives lol

iirc it was shorter but not by much

And of note when I say shakey, I mean physically...though oddly enough, despite this, I still found it less stimulating, physically, than 5 meo mipt ..


But n=1 so ... more trials needed before I can draw any conclusions, for myself anyways

In my experience, 5-MeO-DiPT is almost as good as 5-MeO-MiPT. However, there are some differences worth noting. The former lasts longer (not shorter!), is a little less hard on the body at doses in the medium or high range (although a fair number of people experience nausea and/or vomiting), possesses a somewhat less mentally psychedelic space, is less adept at aesthetic enhancement (e.g. 5-MeO-DiPT tends to distort sound, rather than enhance it, in a way similar to base DiPT, albeit much less dramatically), and is less empathogenic, yet more viscerally erotic.

So, I just thought I'd share...


After having a strange experience with 5-meo-mipt many years ago, I had assumed I wouldn't like foxy. So I've had a stash of it for 8 yearsish and finally I decided to give it a whirl.


I loved it. There were some occasional stomach discomforts but it wasnt like some of the hellacious reports I've read on erowid. And to be honest, while I was in my bed they were barely perceptible. Aside from that, it was everything sasha and Ann had described. Very tactile, possibly more than 2c-b. While it wasnt overtly sexual for me (I took it alone) I know exactly how it would be if I had a cutie next to me. Dreaming was extremely vivid during sleep, so much so it was a bit shocking upon waking, as I was convinced my dream was reality. Next day I felt fine, if not better. I look forward to trying again at a slightly higher dose (I took 15 mg) or a different roa than oral. 


Kind of happy in waited 8 years to give it a real try

 Its been banned in the USA since 2002. Interest in it seems to have fallen off since then. 20+ years ago I thought back then it might rival MDMA for next big club drug, it had cool street name and everything. This in a pressie of unknown strength sold as XTC could be dangerous when kids take 3 though.  

 I bought some a few months ago still haven't tried it. Audio distortion is something I have never experienced, TBH it sounds a little scary. I will probably give this a taste in the next few months. I have a lot of tryptamines to sample

My impression's of 5 -meo-DIPT where less then consistent. And nothing like 5-ho-MIPT. Which is very soft and nice overal.


The come up is terrible, vasoconstrictie (sucked up testicles). But once you get there its quite LSD like as I remember it (LSD). The new analogues seem way softer as the parent (ALD-52/ 1p-LSD).


Snortin however bypasses the painfull gastric problems and vasoconstrictie to a point.


All in all not worthless, but there are way better out there.

Finally after years I've come across this one, and looking forward to it. I am a big fan of 5-meo-mipt-curious if anyone finds Foxy as good as Moxy?

Foxy is different than moxy.  it has more bodyload but also is more pleasurable.  It's more stimulating.  More recreational, less truly useful.  I prefer moxy, but they both have their place.

**Theta:**


I prefer 5-MeO-DiPT to 5-MeO-MiPT when they are taken orally myself, though our alters are not all in agreement on this, and we've only taken 5-MeO-DiPT once so far. I'm particularly sensitive to the psychedelic effects of 5-methoxytryptamines though and thus find it easy to find things about them to like or to latch on to for comparing and contrasting. We recently had an experience smoking 5-MeO-MiPT that I very much enjoyed but we haven't smoked 5-MeO-DiPT for me to be able to compare them in that way.


5-MeO-DiPT reminds me more of LSD than 5-MeO-MiPT does, which is relatively more alike mushrooms by comparison, though I would say they're both more alike LSD than mushrooms, and more alike mushrooms than LSD. Both 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT are notably more similar to one another in some obvious ways than the step in between them, 5-MeO-EiPT, is to either for me, so I think there's some chance that someone who likes one may still enjoy the other that has more to do than just with them being 5-methoxytryptamines, but I wouldn't say it's a given.


For me, 5-MeO-DiPT has come out on top so far because even though we've only used it once, orally at 10 mg, the trip rapidly came crashing in with an immense yet rather calmly dissociating euphoria that definitely surpasses the other 5-methoxytryptamines, exploded into rich and colorful geometric imagery filled with cartoony visions similar to LSD, and produced a very analytical and energetic headspace that I felt was insightful without being too forceful, and the body load was very low until the much later hours of the day when we started experiencing things like head and neck tension. We felt high for something like at least fourteen hours, though by the end mostly in terms of the mental stimulation still going. The sexual effects didn't make themselves known without provocation but were apparent when searching for them and definitely stronger than 5-MeO-MiPT's, though I also found them kind of animalistic and even desperate compared to the more standard euphoric psychedelic sexual edge I find in 5-MeO-MiPT, and I may have to say I do prefer that specifically about 5-MeO-MiPT so far, but it probably wouldn't be my first non-5-MeO-DiPT psychedelic choice for sex nonetheless.


I've enjoyed 5-MeO-MiPT the times we've used it, but it so far seems to me like it has more classical psychedelic flash but less cerebral drive, and I haven't really been able to take the former far enough with it to make it as memorable for me in that way as 5-MeO-DiPT has been in its own way so far. Most of the time we take it the other alters are out more than I am seemingly because they get more out of it than I do, but I enjoy it through them, and them getting something out of it is also me getting something out of it (since we're the same human being). It so far seems to me like they've gotten a good amount of introspection leading to releases of tension out of it, which some of them are now agreeing with internally. I wouldn't be opposed to getting that sort of use out of it myself, but just have gotten that more from other substances so far, but I'm not pushy about it. When we take 5-MeO-MiPT orally we feel it for at least like nine or ten hours I want to say, though similarly to 5-MeO-DiPT it's quite subtle by the later hours. The body load isn't terrible but we've had worse on 5-MeO-MiPT at times than on our one 5-MeO-DiPT experience so far.


There's a fairly even split in the number of alters in here who prefer 5-MeO-DiPT to 5-MeO-MiPT and vice-versa for what it's worth, so in the end I'm guessing it's more so just one of those things you'll just have to try to see which way you swing.

yeah you really just need to try them both to decide.  5-MeO-DiPT can have a really cool effect on sound, reminiscent (but just the barest hint of) DiPT itself, which 5-MeO-MiPT lacks.  Both are worthwhile drugs.

Does anyone here have any experience smoking/vaporizing 5-MeO-DiPT? I did a thread search for some key words and the only thing that came up was my previous post.... I'm mostly just interested if anyone has some anecdotes or insights to share. We've smoked both 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-EiPT to notable effect recently and have enjoyed 5-MeO-DiPT orally so far so it's likely coming soon, though starting low for sure.

I thought 5-MEO-DiPT sucked.


I had several hundred grams of it many years ago and did it a few times. It wasn't a particularly interesting trip, but the worst thing about it, which the friend I took it with also experienced, was that it caused a disturbing visual disturbance. I'm not talking about visuals (those were pretty mild in my experience) or blurry vision or anything like that. Rather, it caused small dark streaks to appear in my visual field. It's hard to describe but quite similar to floaters (floaters are a common and harmless phenomenon whereby you see what looks almost like bacteria under a microscope). Your brain eventually learns to ignore them. What they actually are is little pieces of your eyeball that have fallen loose. They eventually resettle into your eyeball.


In any event, I suspect this phenomenon I saw with 5-MEO-DiPT was bleeding from ruptured blood vessels, though there was no visible rupture so it was probably very small. My friend described it looking like mud on a car windshield.


That alone was reason to not like it, but the trip itself just isn't very good.

I like 5-MeO-DiPT alright, it was my first RC actually, back before I knew anything about them, I just knew it as "foxy".  I had some really fun times with it, but it's just hedonistic and can have a pretty high bodyload (though when properly channeled, that energy is quite pleasurable... if not properly channeled, it can manifest as anxiety and discomfort).  It is slightly visual, and has an effect on sound about 1/100th of as strong as DiPT itself does, that is, it slightly drops pitch, so slightly that the net result is that sounds just sound more powerful and intense... listening to music on my early trips with it was awe-inspiring.  My friends and I in those early trips would have a great time, non-stop laughter, discussions, but nothing profound or deep.  It is infamous for being a sex enhancer (hence its classic nickname "foxy"), but I have never gotten to experiment with it for sex.


It has similarities to 5-MeO-MiPT, but the -MiPT is just better all around for me.  5-MeO-MiPT (moxy) is deeper, more centered, more useful, and lighter and more truly psychedelic.  Moxy is quality material for actual psychedelic work, as well as recreation, whereas foxy (5-MeO-DiPT) is purely recreational

I've only tried 5-MeO-MiPT, but I plan on trying Foxy one day to see how they compare. Seems like ~60-70% of people prefer Moxy, but there's enough people who prefer Foxy to make me consider trying it.

I know this is an old quote, but there is nothing scary about 5-MeO-DiPT's audio distortion, it just makes things sound a bit deeper.  DiPT on the other hand has profound effects on sound that are just out of this world and need to be experienced to be believed.  It can be quite intense, I could see it being scary but I just thought it was fascinating.  There seems to be some inner ear movement, you can feel it, very interesting.  The scariest part was that the sound distortion lasts quite a bit longer than the mental effects and I started to wonder if it was going to go away, but it did.  I could imagine that if you took it and then were around a bunch of people you weren't comfortable with, it could be very intense, because people sound like frog robots and literally everything sounds way different.

I loved DiPT, and I'm hoping to try it again soon. It's a very fascinating compound, even compared to most other tryptamines. The sound distortion is incredible and I'm very interested to see if it has any applications in music composure and production. Do you happen to have any experience with playing music on it, or just listening to music?


I had my DiPT trip years ago ruined by three things: 1. Mixing it with some sketchy LSD (I think it was just low purity with a heavy bodyload caused by a precursor, far too weak to be an NBOMe), 2. sleep deprivation, & 3. My father coming in to scream at me half an hour after I took it, and me laughing hysterically because he sounded like a demonic robot which just made him more pissed off. Tried Aspirin and Seroquel for the body load + stress caused by all of the screaming, but ended up having to take a Klonopin because the body load was causing circulation issues that were very concerning to the people around me.

Well I have tried it once, and at 50mg the audio distortion was well past downward pitch shift, I don't even know how to explain what happened.  It made music sound like just noise to me.  I stopped listening to music because it was just kinda harsh and metallic and dischordant.  Listening to the world/nature/background noises was where it was at.  So personally, though I haven't tried, I wouldn't think it would be good for music production.  However at the time I tried it, I hadn't been playing music for years so I never tried playing or anything.  I actually have a handful of doses and haven't tried it again yet for whatever reason (not wanting my hearing to be wildly altered for ~24 hours I suppose).  At some point I will try again and I'll definitely give playing music a shot.

Definitely eating it for a first time.  And 8-10mg is a good place to start, yes.  If it's like 5-MeO-MiPT, then weirdly, it is less potent vaped.  But also more stimulating.

Yeah, eating it is the way to go for your first time. It's just harder to fuck up and you want to get a good feel for the material. However, in my experience and personal opinion from using 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-EiPT, and 5-MeO-DiPT, vaping/smoking is ultimately the way to go with 5-methoxytryptamines. The experience is better in almost every way pretty much except for being shorter, but it still lasts multiple hours. 5 mg is a good starting dose for that too I think.

This is the lore but I increasingly doubt it the more I experiment. If you look at, say, the TiHKAL page on DPT, it seems like Alexander Shulgin and/or his friends may have had a really poor smoking technique, because 100 mg of DPT smoked is described as "The entire experience lasted only 20 minutes. I found the visual experience to be everything. It was a lot more benign than mushrooms with pretty much no toxic things, more like mescaline." Sounds nice and all, but I tripped harder than that from smoking 30 mg personally. And the claim that 5-MeO-MiPT is weaker smoked originally comes from TiHKAL, so....


So far the potency of each route actually seems pretty similar to me with the smoking/vaping being more intense and memorable, although again a little bit shorter-lasting, but not too much. Possibly the main thing taking them orally does better for me is produce more open eye visuals, but inhaling them does still produce visuals and they're more interesting than the visuals I get from eating them, at least to me.

Well it was my direct experience, repeatedly, that it was like half as potent vaped.  Maybe I vaped poorly, I know I didn't have the freebase.  But I rather disliked the effects compared to oral, and it took double to dose  to get to a somewhat similar level of strength, but the nature 0f the effects was decidedly inferior.  My buddy was vaping the same batch as me, at the same time, and he said it was amazing though, and said he likes it WAY more vaped than orally.  He also noted that it took a higher dose to get to a comparable level of strength, compared to orally.  It doesn't really make sense though why that would be.

I can't deny the possibility that everyone just reacts differently in this way, but to me that does sound odd and like it's possible that you just burnt through it rather than vaporizing it properly or something. I think it's likely very easy to burn through and waste these things with just a single slightly wrong hit since there's so little powder required.


I've never freebased any tryptamines that I've smoked so I don't think that's the problem. I pretty much always layer them in between two layers of cannabis (in the middle of a normal-sized bowl) and slowly lower the flame down over the top of the cannabis, including with these 5-methoxytryptamines. It usually seems to work pretty well, unless I accidentally torch the cannabis. I have no idea how well this would work with anything other than cannabis honestly, I actually think cannabis seems like a great medium for smoking tryptamines in without heating them up too quickly. I would actually be afraid of wasting it if I had to do it in a different way.


To me the effects of them smoked are clearly superior to taking them orally, except again that orally lasts longer and produces more open eye visuals of the simple variety, which are not the deciding factors for me. Orally also produces significantly more body load than smoking them for me which *is* one of compelling reasons that I prefer smoking instead, but not the only one. I just think they're fancier when smoked, they feel like they have similar kind of benefits to what you get from smoking DMT compared to taking other psychedelics orally except that they also come on slower, although beginning nearly instantly, and last longer and still feel more like they work a lot more like taking other psychedelics orally overall than smoking DMT does. They feel less flashy but deeper, in a way that's made it really hard for me to want to go back to experiencing them without that added depth.


I still haven't smoked 5-MeO-DMT yet but I'm making plans to soon. Hopefully that will add some meaningful insight to this situation.

When I smoke Tryptamines or Psychedelics in general I like to use an oil burner or as its commonly known a Meth Pipe. With a torch lighter and holding the flame significantly away and just bringing it close enough to watch the compound start to vaporize it works so well. You hardly waste any with this technique, as compared to doing something like vaping with a piece of aluminum foil and inhaling it with a pen. I'd say that using this way is the best way to conserve your precious psychedelics if that is the ROA your interested in using

Used to like using oil burners for nn-dmt, 4-aco-det, and 5-meo-dmt. Never had a proper full 5meo-dmt trip but did have some interesting experiences mixing small bit of 5meo-dmt and nn-dmt together. 


Vaped 2c-p out of one of my dabbers before; actually works decently; gives you a nice rush like nn-dmt but without the depth. Was vaping little bits while watching the Hamilton episode about meth.

ended up vaping about 9mg in two hits about 10 mins apart from a dab rig. Seemed to work really well, I have the freebase and never noticed any burnt taste. Re: [@Cosmic Charlie](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/98703/)  have you tried a rig before? Ive used an oil burner before for dck and do like it, is there more of a rush would you say with that method?  got kinda nervous about doing a 6 hour trip cuz it was already kinda late and I had went to work.


Had a superrr nice body high, really nice tingling feet sensation. No nausea at any time, was warned to empty y self prior for the gi stuff, seemed to work. Visuals were very sight once weed smoked, definitely had a lot of energy,ended up dancing and walkin around my porch for an hour or so.


Only uncomfortable part was a little vasoconstriction in my left arm, but I’m hoping that on an oral dose it might not be so noticeable due to being more engulfed in the trip (hopefully at least haha)


Should I be fine to try an oral dose tonight at around 10mg or do you think tolerance would really neuter it? Don’t wanna waste any of this precious stuff. If not I may just go for a 2c-x trip tonight, kind leaning towards -c right now.

Tolerance is definitely a thing with 5-methoxytryptamines in my experience. I wouldn't risk it personally if you have a limited supply. It would probably still do something, though.

If my experience with 5-MeO-MiPT is any indication, you'll likely have tolerance. I take about a week between 4-HO-MiPT doses, but at least two with 5-MeO-MiPT. It produces noticeably longer lasting tolerance than the majority of psychedelics that I've used. I can still trip, but I need more and the experience is much less satisfying.

gotcha, i do have an ample amount to experiment with but since it seems to follow the standard psych rules of less fulfilling with tolerance ill go ahead and wait. sometimes its kinda  a bummer having to wait so long when theres so many things to try, but i guess its all about learning patience and all that, eh? thanks for the responses yall

Let's see.. 

I have some questions about 5-meo-dipt

First time I used the Mipt version (Moxy) I had very strange but not concerning side effects, it felt like jolts of electricity untying in my body, in some specific parts, it was pretty intense as sensations, didn't get very concerned because I was having an amazing body high at the same time..

Does something like that happent with the Dipt version? I also have bad bloating at the end of the Mipt trip, when the comedown begins I get bloated, pregnant like xD

Other than that I only had strange "gritty brain" and "gritty organs" feelings at unpredictable parts of the trip, but *usually* when reaching the second part of the experience.

As it's usual to read that the Dipt version has worse and more unpredictable side effects I would like to know what those effects are. Same as the Mipt?


I had amazing trips on the Mipt, sometimes up to +20mg which could get very visual (but also had stupid OCD-like behaviours on those doses, for a while). Very strong tracers and ninja scrolls (as I've seen depicted somewhere else) were the most noticeable OEVs.

I'm specially interested in the sexual enhancing properties of Foxy. Are those sexual feelings more natural-neutral-sensual (like on mescaline) or are they "perverted" like a-php or moxy?

Someone else with direct experience may be able to answer your question, but I feel like I can hazard a guess. Your description sounds like mine with 5-MeO-MiPT, and I get the same elements from 4-HO-MiPT, 4-AcO-MiPT, MiPT, DiPT, and 4-HO-DiPT. I kind of suspect that gas and grittiness are common qualities with isopropyl substitutions.

I took 3mg at a concert and found it to be quite dissociating and somewhat anxiogenic.

I also found 5-MeO-MiPT somewhat dissociating during my trials with it.


Is this typical of the 5-MeOs?

In my experience, yes. My suspicion has long been that this may be because they are mostly all full or nearly full agonists of the 5-HT2A receptor, significantly above the efficacy had by most other commonly used psychedelics. They are most likely affecting something about our neurochemistry in a more significant way than most other 5-HT2A receptor agonists we've taken.

Thank you [@Kaleida](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/377522/) for your comments regarding smoking/vaping. 


I just had a really good experience smoking/vaping 5-MeO-MIPT and was kind of curious if 5-MeO-DIPT is similar in action when comparing ROA's. I really didn't care for 5-MeO-MIPT orally, but with 5-MeO-DIPT oral was just fine. I been playing with the idea of smoking/vaping 5-MeO-DIPT.

No problem, happy to help.


Personally, I find 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT to have similar differences from one another regardless of whether they are taken orally or smoked, and I do enjoy taking both of them in both ways. I wrote [a trip report](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/5-meo-dipt-5-mg-smoked-second-time-challenging-foxy-orthodoxy.895757/) (what seems like a million years ago now) about smoking 5-MeO-DiPT if you're curious.


In my experience, 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT have significant similarities, and I don't think it's just because they're both 5-MeO tryptamines because the 5-MeO-EiPT in between them I find to be more different from either of them than I find them to be from each other, but there is definitely a difference. The very quick and simple way I usually characterize it is like this: while I find both of them to be rather LSD-like tryptamines compared to all other psychedelics I've taken, when compared primarily just to each other, I would say that 5-MeO-MiPT feels a lot more like mushrooms to me and 5-MeO-DiPT feels a lot more like LSD. 5-MeO-MiPT for me tends to be more colorful and geometric and emotional, while 5-MeO-DiPT tends to be a little more shadowy and visionary but very deep and cognitive (granted that I've only attempted to trip hard on it, not just get high like some people use it for). 5-MeO-DiPT is notably sexier for me as its reputation suggests and also more alike LSD than mushrooms for me in that way.


For me, 5-MeO-DiPT seems to have some consistent body load potential when taken orally, and one of the best things about smoking it is that it completely does away with that for me, as is typical with 5-MeO tryptamines smoked in my experience. However, it's kind of like smoking DMT where even though it's more impressive and fun than taking a psychedelic orally, it doesn't really have the chance to fully flesh itself out and really bring you into it, chew you up, and spit you back out. For example, in the trip report I linked, I had some very cool and powerful visions that seemed to be teaching me about how my brain comprehends consciousness and what happens to it when one animal consumes another, although aside from that the main thing I remember about it is rolling around with smoothly-transforming visions going along to music similar to what I've gotten with LSD too, very cartoony although also realistic. By contrast, the last time I took 10 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT orally the visions were present but less developed, but they involved a full breakthrough-style story where I spent hours rolling around in bed feeling like I was seeing a strange hyperspace entirely inhabited by female entities and understanding how the social hierarchy worked there and learning to respect my own place within it, and no specific memory stands out as much as the vision I described from smoking it, but the trip as a whole was a lot more meaningful to me. However, I spent the whole time in bed with lots of muscle tension and generalized pain, although I was also too confused to really grasp that at all times.


I would smoke 5-MeO-DiPT again much more readily than I would take it orally again, but I do like both. I'd also probably be a little cautious about jumping into a higher dosage with smoking, but not *too* cautious. It's just that when I smoked 5-MeO-EiPT at 15 mg it got a lot more 5-MeO-DMT-like from what I can tell (still haven't actually done that one yet myself) than it was otherwise, and I could imagine 5-MeO-DiPT doing that kind of thing more readily than 5-MeO-MiPT would too I think. But I wouldn't be too worried about that if I was anticipating it.


I'd love to hear back about your results if you try it, I really love this family of tryptamines and I am especially curious how it would relate and compare to smoking 5-MeO-DMT from someone who actually does have experience with it.

That's a great report and addresses the exact info I'm looking for. It's sort of piqued my interest in 5-MeO-EIPT a little as well.

I've a small amount of 5-MeO-MALT that I've not tried but am told it touches on the 5-MeO-DMT experience.


I will probably eventually smoke the 5-MeO-DIPT starting slowly and will likely report back.

At 20mg orally I would call it a +3. Smoking the 5-MeO-MIPT, I think in the past I've rushed it's dosage too quickly so I'll be a little more careful with the 5-MeO-DIPT. I got it to very visual (35-40mg?) but that also gave me stronger GI bodyload which I really want to minimize. Neither 5-MeO-MIPT or 5-MeO-DIPT got very visual at 20mg orally (would say 5-meo-dipt was more visual orally), but I've really enjoyed the visuals of smoked 5-MeO-MIPT at 20-25mg area. (I recently combined that dose with nn-DMT and it was crazy visual)


The only 5-MeO that I ever have dismissed since 5-MeO-MIPT, was 5-MeO-MET. I had such high hopes as I love both MET and 4-HO-MET but it just had a very pronounced bodyload, mainly expressed as bloating of my GI.

Yeah, I touched upon this a little bit in my trip report, but it should be clearly noted too that I respond very readily to 5-methoxytryptamine in terms of getting stronger psychedelic effects out of them. 10 mg is definitely enough for a memorable trip for me when taken orally. I think it's probably just a matter of dosage scaling rather than me actually experiencing totally different effects out of them compared to other people though. I've heard of a number of people say it starts to get much stronger for them in the 20-40 mg range like you too.


For what it's worth, I don't remember a single body load problem from smoking 5-MeO-DiPT. It's possible that wouldn't always be the case or it could disappear at a higher dosage for me, but it was something I recall really liking about it in that particular trip I wrote about. The same is true for me of 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-EiPT, the latter of which I found nearly crippling when taken orally, so it does seem to make a lot of difference for me at least.

You're not the first person I've heard of being quite disappointed by 5-MeO-MET. It is surprising and unfortunate given MET and 4-HO-MET, I'll agree. I'd still try it one day if it fell into my lap, but I avoided seeking it out because of the reports. I've encountered some people who enjoy it though, but they seemed to think of it as more of a light buzz.


The only one I didn't manage to get anything out of other than body load was 5-MeO-DALT, but I unfortunately didn't get to experiment with it to the degree I would have liked and I'm not convinced it could never have gotten better. I really do like this family of tryptamines and would give them a lot of chances if I could. Although at the same time I do respect them a lot, and probably wouldn't take them unless it really felt right, especially these days after what I've been through with them.

So I did a preliminary trial of consuming 5-meo-dipt via inhalation. I sandwiched approximately 10mg into a pipe of cannabis, and took one single deep toke. With my trials of 5-meo-mipt, it wasn't difficult to underestimate the dosage due to the extended come-up, so in this case I am glad I set the pipe down after a single toke.  Like Moxy, I felt it almost instantaneously, however the effect continued to increase peaking, probably around the 45-60 min mark.


What I thought was most interesting and rather surprising was how visual the experience was. While it never got nearly as visionary as DMT does, it did have the same effect of changing the** texture** of my vision significantly. A normal everyday object looked very different in regards to both texture and color. Everything just looked very different. I did get a fair amount of CEV's as well, but I can't really describe their nature. I don't remember them being super intricate.


Physically, I didn't really notice any negative bodyload at this dose. Orally, in the past it caused me quite a bit of stomach tension. It wasn't as tactile enhancing as 5-meo-mipt, but my dosage with moxy has always been a lot higher. In this case I took the toke and a pleasant body buzz settled in. I didn't really explore it however (possibly due to the unexpected visual nature of the experience), and so for the most part I laid down un-moving for the better part of 4 hours. It wasn't until I started moving around that I could realize just how altered I really was. When I finally got up, i felt like different parts of my body were enlarging and shrinking at different rates. It made walking very unsteady. Sometimes this vibration effect was pleasant, sometimes it was just plain weird. This effect persisted for at least another hour, but mentally I still felt it at the 8Hr mark, whereas with 5-meo-mipt, I'm not sure I still feel it that far in.


In conclusion it was overall a positive if weird experience. I might actually prefer 5-meo-dipt orally whereas i prefer 5-meo-mipt inhaled, however I should probably repeat this experiment a couple more times, and I might push the dosage up a little. The 5-meo-mipt seemed a bit more entheogenic/hedonistic while the 5-meo-dipt seemed like a heavy psychedelic. I also feel like the 5-meo-dipt either lasted longer, or due to its heavier nature, the effects were more thouroughly felt, especially at the end of the experience.


last observation, the 5-meo-mipt tasted better. Like a sweet DMT.

Fascinating, thanks for sharing your report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I would say that your experience aligns with my observations generally. We all respond differently but I can definitely see the similarities in what you describe to my own experiences. The differences are intriguing as well. You’ve given me much to ponder.


Looking forward to your future observations as well!

I've had 2 vaped/smoked experiences since my last post. I really think less is more with this substance. I put approx 20mg in a pipe and smoked it with 2 other people so dosage was probably in the 7mg range. It wasn't nearly as physical as my larger doses, so I was able to enjoy the effects much better. OEV's were minimal, maybe a little tracery/blurry, CEV's were quite pronounced and beautiful.


It is a interesting substance for sure.


I still prefer 5-meo-mipt which I've taken crazy high doses of and never had any body issues.

Finally got around to trying this material after twenty odd years. ![:LOL:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png)


I was out of town for seven days and found that I needed to head right back out for another stint. I decided that I wanted to use this time to connect with a friend. 


I had intended to start at 8mg, but ended up taking 7.2mg orally instead. I would have started my friend at 9mg, but they also took 7mg. Neither of us wanted to risk day 2 diarrhea. I suspect that I need to take a higher dose to determine its character. At 7.2mg, it was pleasant but nondescript.


It was decidedly bi-phasic. I alerted strongly almost immediately, but it didn't really start for something like 45-60min. Even that's hard to determine, because the experience was *so* mild. I would describe it as a mild sense of energy, some suggestion of headspace, and some impact on emotional affect. Also, not great for my or my friend's erections, which seemed to take more work to achieve and maintain than on any psychedelic I commonly take, especially at what amounted to an early + level. No other indications of vasoconstriction, though.


The second stage didn't kick in until the 2nd hour, long after we got bored and started vaping N,N-EPT just to boost it to something a little more interesting while being pretty transparent and benign. At that point, it became quite lovely. Noticeably visually active, if not exactly interesting. It was pleasant, positive, and pretty neutral. I wasn't terribly surprised by this based on prior, similar vibes on with 4-HO-DiPT and N,N-DiPT. This was less weird than N,N-DiPT, more positive than 4-HO-DiPT, and less determinedly neutral, probably because of that positive push. There was definitely a psychedelic headspace, but it was a light one. Kinda like 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-PiPT, and 5-MeO-MET, I was left with the feeling that I needed "just a bit more" to get a full experience. This felt like it had the least unique character of the bunch, but that may very well be just a dosage thing. I'd assume so, if it weren't so true for the other DiPTs.


I had some jaw tension in the peak that didn't bother me at all, and briefly some tremendous gas that was easy to expel; otherwise, no side effects. It took me copious amounts of alcohol to sleep eight hours after dosing. Intimacy was fine, but not much to remark on. It was comparable to the other 5-methoxy isopropyl substitutions above, if a little less interesting. Somatic sensations and body energy were not remarkable either.


It's possible that I have some tolerance, but not super likely. 5-MeO tryptamines have been used about every fourteen days for six weeks. I've also been on a regimen of 5-HTP, which was discontinued several days prior. My friend who took the same dose had not, and our experiences seemed comparable. They had poor sleep quality and woke exhausted, taking the day off of work, something they never do.


I'd like to revisit it. Maybe at a light dose to see if there's utility, maybe at a higher dose to see if it has any character, and maybe at the same dose because it was pleasant enough. I might explore vaporization, to better enable me to titrate up to get a feel for the space without risking GI side effects (although mine were exceedingly mild at 7mg.) I think this might have been a more worthwhile experience if I had taken the time to appreciate it properly in its own time. The immediate alert but two hour delay to peak was unexpected, and by the time the peak arrived, I'd kind of moved on with my interests for the day. At 7mg, it wasn't able to compete for my attention.

Thanks for the report!  Do you think the age of the material may have affected its potency?  Or maybe 7 mg really isn't that much.

5-methoxy subs are relatively stable, and the material was stored in optimal conditions. I doubt degradation was a factor. 


As to the dose, I think that's a matter of application and personal taste. Lots of people use 5-MeO-MiPT in 2.5-5mg doses, but I prefer 6.25-7.5mg. I've taken it up to 12, but don't really think the increased intensity is worth the increased side effects. 


I'd read that 5-MeO-DiPT is a little less potent than 5-MeO-MiPT, but also that it shines at lower doses. Above 8mg, I was reading that unpleasant GI symptoms tend to appear. I wanted to try to go as high as possible without risking nasty GI symptoms on my first trial.

Yesterday almost bought some Philosopher Stone s. 

Psilocybine Truffle s claimed to be mild, abandoned the idea. 

Which was taking a Tryptamine, which i stopped doing. 


As Lysergic s were so clean acting, then discovered 2C-E. 

Also went well. but Tryptamine s kick you the hardest. 


And imo work in there own realm, ime most therapeutic of the 3. 

And i need some change, most of the times after the actual effect s. 

This on Tryptamines occurred, i felt great for day s and after coming down. 

Insight s where gained. Shall i give 5-Meo-DIPT one more try i wonder. 


It was quite a kick in the ass, compared to Shrooms, 4-HO-MIPT/ MET. 

Like 5-Meo-Mipt & MET when compared too their 4-HO substitution s. 


But FOXY, was like shorter acting LSD [added pitch distortion] less visual. 

+ a bunch of Speed. Very stimulating substance, unlike Lysergics. 

Might take some in the near future.
