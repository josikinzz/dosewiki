## Subjective Experience

This is an analogue of the more widely known 3-MeO-PCP, and is generally
described as a dissociative anaesthetic. Given that there are warnings on harm
reduction websites stating that heavy doses of 3-MeO-PCP may result in psychosis
and mania, and that the doses generally suggested for that chemical are considerably
lower than those mooted for 3-MeO-PCMo, the need for caution is well sign-posted.

I sampled this about a year ago, snorting 45mg, but with only minor effects. I have no
idea why I chose that RoA, particularly as this was a new compound and it was
crystal, but I will take the more familiar oral route this time around.

Forum posts seem to be mixed, with many, but not all, suggesting no or little activity
(via any route).

On the basis of this my first inclination was to dose at 200mg. However, even though
I purchased from a relatively trusted vendor (BRC) the red flags referred to above
persuade me to go low.

Having consulted with a colleague (online), I dose at 100mg.

```
T+0:00 I crush the crystals into smaller shards, and then bomb them down
the hatch. [4:30pm]
```
```
T+0:15 Is a tingling in the head developing? It does seem to be: a sort of
benign heady anaesthesia. It is barely noticeable, but it is there nonetheless.
```
```
T+0:30 My head feels comfortably warm, which may or may not be a prelude
to something more significant. There may be a tiny anxiolytic effect, or
perhaps not.
```
```
This is all very shallow at present.
```
```
T+1:00 That heady anaesthesia has intensified and a gentle dissociation is
now in play. The familiar numbing of my hands has emerged, albeit mildly at
this stage.
```
```
It is beyond question now that I have passed the threshold dose for this
substance. I am comfortable with it, so I hope it will go further, although I
don’t expect it to.
```
```
T+1:30 I sense that this has definitely hit a plateau. I am slightly off kilter, but
in a pleasant way, and there is numbness to the experience, both physically
and mentally.
```
```
T+2:00 By most accounts I should be peaking about now, although I feel that I
did so an hour ago. Indeed, this now has a coming-down feeling about it, and
appears to be tapering towards normality, although I remain calm and
somewhat dreamy in a slightly insentient bubble.
```
```
T+3:00 The mild physical detachment and pleasant headiness are lingering,
albeit at the lower level. Mentally, I feel in a better place than I did before I
sampled this, so long may it continue.
```
```
T+4:00 I now feel that I am more or less back to base.
```
```
T+16:00 I retired to bed, tired, at around 11pm, and had a reasonable night’s
sleep. This morning, if anything, I feel more relaxed and refreshed than usual.
```
There was nothing unpleasant about this, in that at this dose the ride was quite nice
throughout, if a little unspectacular. I suspect that it would be better still on perhaps
150-200mg, but those red flags and the existence of more market tested alternatives
will probably dissuade me from experimenting further.
