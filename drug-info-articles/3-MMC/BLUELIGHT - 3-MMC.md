So I took Codeine, Morphine, Dihydrocodeine, Promethazine, Diazepam, Propranolol and Prochlorperazine together (mixed with my daily Fluoxetine).

Could be a side effect of withdrawal but I'm not quite  informed enough  on that class of goodies

thats a huge cocktail 

a SSRI like prozac inhibits cyp2d6 which reduces the effectiveness of opiates ....if my memory recalls 

so i ask why even take anything opiate/opioid related? IMO....personally think you are just wasting them

let alone mixing opiates and a benzo isnt a good idea either...dangerous almost if you have no tolerance, since both are CNS depressants


actually surprised you only had/have blurred vision

I see you are on propranolol. Besides the possibility it is an adverse effect from mixing (even if you've taken the same combo before you may still react differently each time), if your blood pressure is too high/too low it can cause blurred vision. If you are able, check your BP. You may need to have the propranolol adjusted.

When I used to W/D from Opana regularly, by day 2 or 3 I used to get kinda cross-eyed.  And since I watch a lot of TV it's a real pain in the ass.  I used to have to cover one of my eyes to be able to actually see anything.  Does that happen to anyone else?

I used to get funny vision whilst on opiates, I also take propranolol so could most definitely be your blood pressure, please be careful, body is giving u signs to calm down a little, listen to them ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)
