Sounds interesting to me:


[PIHKAL entry for 2C-P](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal036.shtml)


I just obtained some. I have been somewhat dissapointed with 2c-e, it is a very mild experience for me as contrasted against the many reports I studied.

2c-t-2 is my favorite so far. Similar potency with more trippiness and a slight edge of euphoria to go with the sensations. This 2c-p sounds like it may compete with 2c-t-2 as my top choice for the 2cs. We shall see. Clearly, I am in the minority here for the reports I had studied had me braced for extreme caution with 2c-e. The individual variation in effects is interesting.


It does not seem this one has been widely available before, I find no trip reports or information available beyond the  Pihkal entry. Any one lucky enough to have consumed this relatively unavailable compound?

2C-P sounds VERY promising. Its dosage and duration are enough to make it wonderful, lol. Besides (and Iknow chemical suggestion can be misleading) I find Propyl tryptamines and dimethoxy phenethylamines to be the best psychedelics. So having both groups in one drug sure is nice ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Sounds yucky. Lately I've been really fed up with the stimulative side of psychedelics. I think it's gonna be the thing that convinces me to give em a break for a while.

It's  sounding more  and more unattractive, I still  plan on experimenting with it  in the future to see for myself. I'm not  gonna  just throw it out,  unless I  hear  something *really* bad about  it.

In PiHKAL, it is written at the 12mg dosage, "Could do a lot of learning with this material, but probably not a group thing. It would lend itself too easily to hypnotic power-games, and it would be too easy to open up the shared consciousness level..."


Connectedness on the consciousness level is my strongest drive for psychedelic use (or, at least one of the main motives). Any ways, this compound seems extremely promising for that benefit. However, it was noted that 16mg was a clear overdose... is any one else worried by that??!?!!!

^ I am. That's a very small margin of safety.


I don't know why people are so interested in this. I think it's just because it's something "new" on the market. I'd be very wary of a substance who's dose range is 6-10mg. but just 16mg was "clearly an overdose". The duration is also a turn off, but that's just me.


And to add to that.. based on what little information is available, what do people think this substance can do  that others cant? Because what's described in PIHKAL doesn't sound all that unique to me.

My interest is how powerfully he claimed the shared consciousness level was opened. The duration is a turn-on for me, as I'm sure many would agree (it's all preference, of course). However, my scale is nowhere near accurate enough for me to risk such a narrow dosage range. I'm hoping that test run was a fluke and some fellow psychonauts have better luck...

I took between 10 and 12 mg about 2 1/2 hours ago.  


There is color enhancement, and I am surprisingly (perhaps even deeply) relaxed.


I can see how the word "hypnotic" came up earlier when describing this compound.  It's almost like rolling, without the amphetamine push.


There may be some CEVs, but no open-eyed ones for me at this level.  Then again, it took a somewhat massive dose of 2c-e to make me get any visuals either.


That's all I have to add for now.

Another 2C is out on the mainstream market. I wish Shulgin hadn't enjoyed the 2C's as much as he did. Perhaps them we'd be messing around with the TMA-series or GANESHA ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I don't think we'd be messing around with the TMA series as the TMA-2 thru TMA-6 are all schedule I as positional isomers of TMA. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also, I wouldn't write off 2c-p simply because its another 2c or that it didn't get a dazzling review in pihkal. Just look at what people are saying about 2c-d which Shulgin labeled as "tofu". While the 16mg mg 'overdose' trip report is an indication of a low margin of safety, Shulgin also mentioned a bad experience that someone had on 30mg 2c-e, which would imply a low margin of safety for 2c-e too. Really, many of the psychedelic phenethylamines have a low margin of safety.

While I am curious about this substance, I too am worried about the 16mg overdose... a "physical disaster" sounds like a really negative thing, since that's the first time I've heard of a physical disaster in either book... no good guys, no good. Be really careful with this one. I'd recommend a scale with a +/- .01mg accuracy, personally.

I would assume it would be similar to 2ct7 only a little more stable in terms of dose/response. I don't like propylated chems but I did like 2ct7, it was alot of fun but I didn't love it as much as other methylated type chems.

^^^


Considering how radically different 2c-e (ethyl) is from 2c-t-2 (ethylthio), I see no reason at all to assume that 2c-p (propyl) would be anything like 2c-t-7 (propylthio). Just my 2 cents.

Though I do notice somewhat the methylated vs. (iso)propylated pattern that you pointed out. Just look at DMT, 5-meo-DMT, and 4-ho-DMT versus DPT, DIPT, 5-meo-DIPT and 4-ho-dipt for example. The N,N-dimethylated tryptamines are by far the best, whereas the one's with longer alkyl chains seem less consistant amongst different people. For the phens, DOM, 2c-d and mescaline, all of which have nothing but methyls and/or methoxy's on top of the phenethylamine skeleton, are the most profound phens I've ever done. So my guess is that 2c-p will be somewhat like 2c-e and 2c-d but probably not as good as either. I could be wrong though.

I noticed a [new report](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=32435) was added to erowid. 


Although short (why oh why do new substances always fall in the hands of non-writers first? LOL) it makes this substance look even weirder and more intreguing (and intimidating) than it already wasin PiHKAL....


(Actually I am less excited than I was about trying it. But we'll see as new reports come in...)

^^^ I always try to write up reports when there's very few of them available (aka my 5-MeO-MIPT reports)  Of course 2C-P has even fewer reports.  Will probably have test of 2C-P this weekend, so I'm looking forward to it!

when i was up at my sisters college, researching 2c-i, a friend of hers pointed out that she had tried 2c-p, and was interested in 2c-i for that reason.  i told her they probably werent similar. she gave me the description as follows


very long and visual. it made me rather sleepy, though i couldnt sleep (i guess it made her relaxed). 


i find it sounding veryinteresting, and may perhaps ask her for a sample. ill be sure to put a report on BL, as erowid takes way too long.

Any more experience on this one?  Mainly I'm intersted in the dosing factor.  It seems that the 6-8mg range is a decent starting point for a PEA tolarant person, any thoughts on this?  I promise I'll reward any info with a decent trip report once I try it(not as long as my 2c-d report though).  Thanks in advance.

In response to whoever was discussing the similarities between the 2C's, I find them all hard to distinguish. I've tried 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, 2C-T-4 and besides duration, potency, and level of nausea, I think set and setting have more of an influence on the different effects of these chemicals than the chemicals themselves. I have a feeling 2C-E might be an exception due to everyone's comparing it to LSD, but I imagine I would have a hard time distinguishing 2C-P from the other 2C's I've done, besides noticing that it lasts a long time.

> In response to whoever was discussing the similarities between the 2C's, I find them all hard to distinguish. I've tried 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, 2C-T-4 and besides duration, potency, and level of nausea, I think set and setting have more of an influence on the different effects of these chemicals than the chemicals themselves.

Well I'll chalk that one up to saying we all respond differently. Having tried 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-I, 2C-P, 2C-T-2, and 2C-T-21, I can say with confidence that set and setting does not account for all the differences I have noticed. I've used them all pretty much under the same conditions and notice consistent differences over multiple experiences. I have little doubt that in most cases I could tell the difference in a blind test. Perhaps some of us are just more sensitive to subtle differences. Of course generally differences between psychedelics are more pronounced at higher doses too.


> I have a feeling 2C-E might be an exception due to everyone's comparing it to LSD, but I imagine I would have a hard time distinguishing 2C-P from the other 2C's I've done, besides noticing that it lasts a long time.

I didn't find 2C-E  to be that much like LSD at all. I mean well, OK, its more like LSD then any of the others I've tried, but I don't think any of them are really much like LSD, esp. at higher dose. 2C-P, incidentally, I found to be alot like 2c-e.

gloggawogga - could you describe the differences between 2c-e and 2c-p? I ask because i have tried 2c-e but not 2c-p so i'd be interested to read a comparison from someone as experienced with the 2c-x's as you seem to be.

^^ Me too. I had a hunch 2C-P and 2C-E might be similar based on subjective reports, but this is the first time I've seen someone directly compare them. As a BIG fan of 2C-E I'm interested to know more. (And yes, I wouldn't say 2C-E is much like LSD at all).

I find 2cp very lethargic. No where near as lethargic as AMT. It's more potent than 2ce but takes a while to come on unless you take alot. I've vaporized 2cp with good success. It lasts longer than 2ce and has less of a tolerance build up. Visually it's superior to any 2cX i've tried and musically as well. IMO better than 2ce,2cd,2ct2, I have yet to try 2cc but I feel that my opinion will still remaine the same.

I have had 2c-p upwards of 10 times, the only other PEA I have tried is 2c-t-2 and mescaline. A friend of mine aquired an amount of 2c-p some time ago and it was all measured out into 9-10mg doses. Quite an intense body load the first few times, but it seems to decrease the more you take it. I dont find it that visual, distant objects such as trees etc seem to breath, but thats about it. Smoking weed increases the visual aspect significantly, as does Nitrous. As for the mental side, 2c-p makes me feel clear headed and like a zombie at the same time, the trip almost has a sarcastic nature to it.


i have also tried insuffulating around 4mg once, 1mg at a time over 30 mins. wouldnt wanty to try much more via this route as the extremly long come on (3-3.5 hours)  is halfed and  quite intense. One 10mg dose left which i am saving. 


VERY intense I have found and some gut pains are often present, well worth it tho, one of my favourites

Please do write a trip report. Even if it's brief. There's very little info on this compound compared to many of the others, so every little bit of info helps! %)

Ditto. I'll be sure and write up a report when I get around to checking this one out.  It's just with that 12-18+ hour duration, this one takes a little bit of planning (and at least 2 days off) in order to do it. :D

Haha. I know exactly what you mean. I've got a NICE dose of cactus I really want to eat but the time commitmant is hard to come by these days. So I usually end up with a shorter-acting tryptamine.


Haha. I'm really intrigued by 2cp though and would love to read more about it. If I ever get a chance to flirt with it, I will post back as well. :D

I revisited this material last month, 14mg. This was my third visit w/ this mateterial, the previous being 7mg, 11mg and 14mg.


Typically with 2c phenethylamines I find it best to have an empty stomach on the come up, otherwise I tend to have indigestion and abdominal pains. That means fasting at least a few hours before ingestion until the peak is well developed. On my last 14mg 2c-p experience, last June, I ate a meal a little to early, at about t+4 hours and had indigestion for the next few hours as a result. This time I dosed in the morning, not having eaten since the night before, and held the fast until about t+6.5 hours, having a snack at the time, and then a meal at about t+10 hours. And this way had no body problems whatsoever, just a warm energy in my body, not any overstimulation or particular discomfort. Last June I had dosed in the evening, at 8pm, and ended up not sleeping till a nap at about 6pm  the next day, followed by a good nights sleep later on that night. This time I had dosed at 10am, fell asleep at around 4 am that night, and woke up around 11am the next morning. Much better for the sleep cycle 'day tripping' on this material. Though the visuals are something to see at night ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


The headspace of this material was nice. While there were some aspects that reminded me of mescaline and others that reminded me of LSD, I'd have to say it was more like 2c-e than anything else. 14mg was a pretty immersive dose, making it really easy to go off on mental tangents and get lost in day dreams unintentionally, but other than maybe a little bit of anxiety on the come up, I never felt like I was in much danger, i.e. it was very forgiving, more so than 2c-e. Most of the trip was by myself except for some social contact with my wife, and some casual contact with strangers while walking in public. I don't see any really difficultiy with social contact on this material though it seems a better material for deep internal thought. I don't think I would want to be 'trapped' in a social situation I didn't like on this material. Hours and hours of deep internal thought is just nice on this stuff.


Though 14mg was a strong dose, due to the ease on my body and the forgiving nature of the head space I may bump the dose up to 16mg next time, though I doubt I'll have a chance to do this stuff again any time soon.

I have taken a 8.5 mg dosage of 2c-p.  Let me be the first to say, use extreme causion when taking said chemcial.  you need atleast 24 hours to do nothing, i had visuals for over 20 hours, and i have never tripped this hard in my life.  I have no desire to use it recreationally, its way too strong for that.  I dont know how i found it, but i'm glad i did, and i'm glad to be on the the few who've ever tried it.

I have acquired ~12mg of this. I am very skeptical though, as the dealer EYEBALLED these doses. I am considering splitting this dose in half with someone, as I am only mildly experienced with psychadelics. With that said, I am not going to rush into this experience, and will wait for when the time is right.

Id wait until you have a scale.  The difference between 10mg and 16mg is not much....with 16mg being labeled an 'overdose.'

Earlier this year I tried 2C-I and didn't really enjoy it... I had 16mg on my first time and a couple months later I tried 12mg...


Both times I just had this whole sense of uncertainty and it made me nauseus and get a really REALLY bad headache... ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

^ If only more people had this sort of an approach to using psychedelics, we'd have a lot less horror stories about trips to hospital etc.


If you *really* want to get a feel for what it's like, you could always go with a 4-5mg dose. That's enough to take you into what the headspace is like, but low enough to allow you to still act as a sitter. My experience of 5mg was comparitively anxiety & body load free and was on a par with say 200mg of mescaline

4-5mg is a good start indeed.8-9mg seems to be the sweet spot,at 10-12mg theres some minor body load present.All in all I must say this is my favourite psychedelic,together with 2c-e.


2c-p has the best overall ratings,great (!) CEV,long enough duration,ease on the body,excellent sleep afterwards,the erotic fits (2c-e is clearly anti-erotic...), a most profound after effect aka very relaxed feeling for a whole week but no hangover,hypnotic,excellent psychotherapy tool,you can surf graciously your unconscious,feel every part of your body (diagnostic quality!),the slow come up feeling is a bit like dom,good OEV's


Don't use it too often,it appears relatively mild at first but I strongly suspect it is very powerful on a yet undefined level.

Thanks fast... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I know some of my friends like to see how far they can push themselves (brawn over brains maybe?).... yet some of my other friends are like myself and would rather gradually build their dose up until they're at a level they are comfortable with...


Why take an insane amount of drugs in one go (especially one you've never tried before) and then be uncomfortable, or worse yet wind up sick or losing your shit?  Lucky it hasn't happened to anybody I know, but I've sure heard some stories from friends!


Last weekend I decided I'd take 2 trips in one go, something I've NEVER done before purely because I don't need to (same goes with double-dropping ecstasy)... especially the trips that are going around right now in my area, they're pretty darn strong, the strongest I've ever had...  But I knew I would be in a safe environment, at my friends house so I felt comfortable to experience two in one go... I definitely don't regret trying it - it was amazing... there were moments where I'd nearly lost the ability to function and do anything (eg: eating BBQ was impossible because it would take me about 5 mins to work out how to cut my food and another 5 mins to work it out again after I'd finally stop laughing... and chewing/swallowing... what's that? :D ) ...I wouldn't have experienced two for my first time at a doof or club... same with RCs...


...and in regards to the 2C-P or the 2C-I tonight, I'm more convinced not to bother... I just don't like the idea of taking chemicals that haven't been researched nearly as much as acid, MDMA etc... and with 2C-P I'd think it's even less known than 2C-B or 2C-I... and I think I've read enough to realise I'll probably find it worse than 2C-I... I'd probably also like to observe other people on the drug first and nobody there has tried it before, so I think it's probably wisest if at least ONE of us isn't tripping on the substance...


I think I'll do my fave thaang & candyflip ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

^^ update!


Nobody ended up having any 2C-P... My friend's sister was over and although she knows what he gets up to, he wouldn't have felt comfortable having an RC session with her around...


Some other real good friends of ours ended up joining us (a few hours beforehand they were saying how they wanted a 'quiet one') and we all munched on mushroom chocolate :D

**Earth shattering**


the other day I parachuted 16 mg of 2c-p.  Two of my friends did the same.  Not realizing the small discrepancy between a normal dose and an overdose.


I can safely inform all of you that 16 mg is indeed an overdose 


The trip lasted for about 20 hours.  I was granted absolute clarity and insightfulness into the workings of all minds around me.  Visuals were exceptionally intense, things would appear in mid-air, and not only that, but even my hallucinations would warp.


There was a space of.. I would estimate.. an hour or so, where I left my body.  My conciousness and spirit went away for a while, I was able to see into, and even explore different dimensions, each with their own laws of physics, and order.  


I think I almost had a heart attack about 5 times, both of my friends reported the same.  


This was the most unbelievably intense experience of my life.  It was as if you could sit down and speak with god, but not only that, you could teach him something.


Do not take this heavy of a dose unless you feel yourself capable of seeing your Universe End.  By the end I was reduced to scratching concepts of the working of time and space into my wall, in the dark.


(any questions you all have I will field.)

**also of note**


it is also worth noting thatr throughout the day I had a constant fairly steady supply of opium and pot.  Luckily I did not add any cocaine to this mix.  Needless to say...  It was a wholly overwhelming experience.

EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY: There is certainly a broad mixture of experiences with 2C-P but, on the whole, probably more favorable than not. There was one report of an experience in which a single dosage of 16 mg was clearly an overdose, with the entire experiment labeled a physical disaster, not to be repeated. A consistent observation is that there may not be too much latitude in dosage between that which would be modest, or adequate, and that which would be excessive. The need for individual titration would be most important with this compound.

**yes**


yes I read that after I had taken it.  my dealer had taken 12 mg the day before, and a couple of my friends had taken 10.  It was only after me and my two buddies had taken it that we were informed it was 16 mg.  We foolishly assumed it was a 10-12 mg dose since that was what everyone else had been receiving.  Also of note, I weigh approx. 135 pounds.  


To be honest with you I might have been legally dead for the hour that I left my body, it wouldn't surprise me too much.  


For those uninformed to the meaning of 'parachuting' that is when you place the crystals in a small piece of tissue paper for a makeshift pill, which is swallowed after being wrapped tightly.


As far as the near heart attacks, it is not clear whether it was an actual severe problem, or if it was simply because I could feel each individual chamber doing it's work.  As if my brain was telling me 'look, this is what I have to put up with on a daily basis'  There was certainly a marked increase in heart rate, whether this was related to the effects of the drug, or anxiety from seeing existence unravel in front of me, I do not know.


The level of detail in everything surpassed everything I had witnessed before.  When looking in a mirror, I could not only see myself reflected in my own eye, but I could see the reflection in my reflections eye, which happened to show what I was seeing.  *that* was a bit fucked up.

I'm glad you made it OK, Sounds like you had a bit of ego loss and some intense realizations.


Next time you come across something new like 2c-p, you should really check around for as much information as you can, before diving in. especially if you come across DOC.


[www.erowid.org](http://www.erowid.org) is a good starting point for learning about most of theses Un-researched chemicals. This is for anyone that comes across this treats post too!


Now that you have this experience under your belt,  you can teach others you know, start low then work your way up! 


Do you think your gonna try it again, it is a great chem at lower dose Its like 2c-e on steroids <joke ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Namaste

**mmm**


I am quite surprised I made it through okay.  I am usually more careful with psychoactives, especially expiramental ones.  But I figured 'what's one or two mg'  Which is a mistake I will not repeat.  (for those not keeping score, I took 16 mg)


As for ego loss, I've had a bit of that before, but this experience absolutely shattered any idea of an ego.  It was an absolutely humbling experience in every way.


I still have the etchings in my wall, I will try and get a picture of it up here for people to see.  This was etched out feverishly at the height of it all.


I've taken 2c-e before.  Which was an extremely spiritual, perhaps life-changing experience, but after 2c-p, it pales in comparison.  (important to note, I indulged in a short ether binge at the height of my 2c-e trip, by no means was it mild.  I forget the dose, but it was high enough to get some pronounced visuals.)


I can safely say that 2c-p presented me with some of the most beautiful and terrifying images and epiphany's I have ever been graced.  Also,  for a short while I was the most astute and learned psychotherapist on the planet.  I understood the workings of all mind and matter.


I repeat.  16 mg is an OVERDOSE  you will come out of it a changed person.  not one of the three of us are the same as we were before we took this drug.  I believe it was for the better, but to get there you have to go through the absolute worst.


If you have any deep seated emotional issues, painful memories, or their ilk, a dose of this calibur will not only serve to bring them back in all of their soul-crushing glory, but will arm you with the tools to come to terms with these issues, and put them to rest.  


(brief explanation of the etchings)


while I was drawing the universe on my wall, I labeled each section in the order that I drew it, so that it would be easier to trace the thought process.


1. the words "DON'T FORGET"  with thick, obviously urgent underlining


2. a small, black, parallelogram, I would say it was a square but the sides are slanted at odd angles.


3. Arrows pointing towards the square, labelled "The Universe"


4. in quotations (edit: parenthesis as well) under 'the Universe' is the word 'Everything'  this is everything with a capitol E folks.  Everything, all of life, matter, time, and space within this universe.


4a. Above the small black box-like object, are the words "I understand this"  it is implied that the rest remains a mystery, though I have been to those places (see 5, it will make more sense then)


5.  Three orbit-like elipses, with the words 'everything else' repeated twice within, these rings circle the small black object, and weave within eachother at two points.


6.  Way off to the right, at where the ceiling connects to the wall, is an infinity symbol surrounded by three short, thick strokes, implying motion and change.  This is infinity in adition to Everything, and Everything else.


7.  the words "they would have this painted over in white" off to the side of the etching, right between my work, and a dali poster 'the metamorphosis of Narcissus'  It's implied that this statement applies to both works.


In summation, I had complete understanding of everything, every thing within this universe that existed, I had a plethora of knowledge about.  Everything...  with this knowledge, also came the knowledge that Everything was far from all there was.


Looking back I do believe I probably died briefly.  something tells me the 2c-p both destroyed and revived me, this is certainly what it felt like.


So powerful in fact that I consider overdosing again to get that effect.  I doubt that I will.


Be exceptionally careful with this one.  It is different, in a fundamental way.  Be warned.

Iv been meaning to try this for a while but i only have a 12mg capsule of it which makes me just a little nervous, as i usually start low and than build my dose up with each consecutive trip.

Personally i have never reacted negatively to any of the 2c-x's so i dont think this one will pose any problems either, even at 12mg.

I hear it being compared to 2c-e alot. My highest dose of 2c-e was 20mg which was mind blowing for me but still managable. How much 2c-e would 12mg of 2c-p feel like?

I might be trying this one out soon.

^^^


I've done 2c-p at doses of 7mg, 11mg, 14mg, 14mg and 14mg. I'd say I found 14mg about as mentally intense as 20mg 2c-e. But it was different. It didn't have 2c-e's explicit 'dark side', it was more subtle. It was also way more visual, sometimes immersing (at night). Its a strong drug physically, stronger than 20mg 2c-e at that dose, but in a way like I find most phenethylamines, which is that if you can let your body flow with the effects, it won't hurt you. 2c-p is perhaps a bit more sedating than the other phens as well, pleasantly so for such a long lasting psychedelic. Keep in mind the come up takes a good 4-5 hours, and the come down 2-3 times that, and then you'll need to recover.

I have only tried 2c-e once, at 20mg. While the visuals were great i didnt find it nearly as intense as 12mg of 2c-p. 2c-p is a GREAT trip, id have to say that its my favourite psychedelic. As of yet i havent tried it above 12mg, but am considering maybe 14mg in the near future, and i doubt ill go higher than that
