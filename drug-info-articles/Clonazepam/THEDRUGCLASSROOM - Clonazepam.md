# Clonazepam
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/clonazepam/*

Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that’s prescribed for seizures, anxiety, panic disorder, and other conditions. Like other benzodiazepines, it has anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties.

The drug is able to reduce anxiety (e.g. social anxiety or GAD) and it tends to dull emotions in general, not just panic and anxiety. It’s a strong sedative, which means taking it at common-strong doses is likely to make you lethargic.

Due to its depressant actions, it’s wise to not combine the drug with any other depressants, such as [alcohol](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/alcohol-ethanol/) or [opioids](http://thedrugclassroom.com/categories/opioids/) . Strong+ doses should also be avoided due to the potential for dangerous physical actions and memory loss.

Both overdoses and withdrawal can be dangerous. In an overdose, you could experience respiratory depression, confusion, hypotension, and coma. Withdrawal can come with rebound anxiety/panic, tremors, and seizures (in severe cases).
