**alpha-Pyrrolidinovalerophenone** (also known as **α-PVP** , **A-PVP** , **alpha-PVP** , and **flakka** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) and [pyrrolidinophenone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pyrrolidinophenone) classes. α-PVP is chemically related to [prolintane](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prolintane) and belongs to a group called the [substituted cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinones) , which includes compounds like [MDPV](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDPV) , [hexen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hexen) , and [a-PHP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PHP) . It acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor.

α-PVP was patented in the 1960s by Boehringer Ingelheim, although it was never marketed. Reports of its use began to appear in the early 2010s. α-PVP has been subject to much scrutiny by the media as one of the ingredients found in "bath salts" or "legal highs" products. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It has been mass produced in China and sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It has been linked to numerous hospitalizations and overdose deaths.

User reports indicate that α-PVP produces powerful but short-lived stimulant effects comparable to those of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) when [insufflated](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflated) or [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporized) . Commonly reported effects include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Like other synthetic cathinones, α-PVP is associated with compulsive use and addiction.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of a-PVP. Due to its potent psychostimulant effects and unknown toxicity profile, it is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using with this substance.

## Chemistry

α-PVP, or alpha-Pyrrolidinovalerophenone, is a synthetic substance belonging to a group called the [substituted cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinones) . Substituted cathinones are derivatives of the naturally occurring substance [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) , which is one of the psychoactive principles in khat ( *Catha edullis* ). Cathinone is composed of a phenethylamine core with an alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon, and a ketone group attached to the beta carbon. α-PVP's structure consists of a cathinone core with a propyl group substituted at the alpha carbon, and a pyrrolidine ring at the amino group.

The hydrochloride salt of α-PVP is described as a white or off-white, odourless crystalline powder, with a melting point of 161.3°C. It is reported to be soluble in PBS (~10mg/ml, pH7.2), in EtOH (~20mg/ml), in DMSO (~10mg/ml) and in DMF (~3mg/ml).

## Pharmacology

α-PVP is a potent and selective [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (NDRI), with a similar potency to [MDPV](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDPV) . α-PVP does not act as a transporter substrate, i.e. it does not cause neurotransmitter release. It is a more potent inhibitor of DAT and NET than the classical stimulants cocaine and amphetamine.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, α-PVP can be considered to be extremely stimulating and energetic. This encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing, although it can also encourage just sitting immobile engaged in repetitive tasks. The particular style of stimulation which α-PVP presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general loss of motor control.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of α-PVP can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelming at higher dosages. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - α-PVP can enhance one's sense of touch to extreme degrees, often leading to states of sexual arousal.
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - α-PVP can cause the eyeballs to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This condition is known as nystagmus.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - Due to the potency of its rush, α-PVP can cause various uncomfortable or painful sensations in the heart, especially when abused or used for extended periods. Those with genetic a family history of heart issues are discouraged from using this drug in its most potent methods of administration, if not avoid it entirely.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - α-PVP, especially when it is vaporized or injected, can lead to sudden spikes of blood pressure that may manifest in an extremely uncomfortable "exploding heart" sensation.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with α-PVP and are a product of an increased heart rate, adrenergic activity and the motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated, especially when out dancing in a hot environment, there is a potential possibility of suffering from water intoxication through over-drinking. Therefore it is advised that users simply sip at water and be mindful of their water in-take.
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - In a similar fashion to that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , a-PVP numbs the areas of the body which it touches, these areas can include the nostrils, gums, mouth and urethra of the user.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Higher doses of α-PVP result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination, an effect that is temporary and typically harmless.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - This typically can occur towards the end of the experience, but can sometimes happen during one as well.
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - α-PVP is reported to be very vasoconstricting at higher doses, and is on par with that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , though becomes more present at high doses.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - α-PVP may lower the seizure threshold in some individuals, especially when it is abused. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - α-PVP can make spaces seem brighter due to its ability to dilate the pupils.
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** - This effect is usually very mild and increases with sleep deprivation.
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - α-PVP can have visual and vision-impairing effects that can lend readily to peripheral hallucinations.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)**
- **[Scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of α-PVP can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The ample head space of α-PVP is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation and a powerful rushing euphoria that dissipates quickly. 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - α-PVP can lead to states of extreme paranoia when abused or dosed too highly, which is why eyeballing this substance is strongly discouraged. The paranoia this compound produces shares many features of the paranoia that can be induced by [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) or [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , and typically happens while during the come down.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - A euphoria very similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) is present as well as feelings of joy and happiness which are likely a direct result of marked norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - α-PVP has been noted as enhancing focus, but in a way that leaves the user totally fixated on whatever task at hand, however trivial.
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)** - Similar to the ego inflation of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , α-PVP can temporarily induce states of egomania at its peak.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - Like its predecessors MDPV and pentedrone, α-PVP can induce states of extreme sexual arousal due to its powerful disinhibiting effects
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - Users report that this effect typically only occurs at low doses, and becomes increasingly more impairing as one increases their intake.
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)** - This effect provides short-lived states of extreme motivation, but due to the cognitively narrowing aspects of its action, rarely ever translates into productive action.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - A high tendency to compulsive redose is a hallmark of this class of drug.
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This typically is experienced when the substance is abused, but can happen at higher than needed doses, or the comedowns of binges. It can also happen spontaneously, although this tends to be rare.
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are common within α-PVP and increase in the perception of perceived experience is greatly increased
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)** - This compound is known to readily induce psychosis if it is abused for prolonged periods of time.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational α-PVP use do not appear to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because α-PVP has very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be guaranteed).

α-PVP has been reported to be the cause, or a significant contributory cause, of death in suicides and overdoses caused by combinations of drugs. α-PVP has also been linked to at least one death where it was combined with pentedrone and caused heart failure.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of α-PVP can be considered highly addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of α-PVP develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). α-PVP produces cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of α-PVP all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

α-PVP, like other stimulants, can result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with A-PVP should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - A-PVP may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

Alpha-PVP is a stimulant drug which has been used recreationally since around 2013. It’s an NDRI (norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) and a member of the cathinone and pyrovalerone classes.

Its strong stimulant effects encourage physical activity and are accompanied by a euphoric body high and mental state.

While it may be more capable of causing temporary psychosis (like what’s seen with other stimulants), that risk primarily exists with very high strong+ doses. It’s a risk that needs to be taken into account and it’s a good reason to make sure you’re using a reasonable dose.

Deaths have been reported, though there aren’t many on record. The ones that have occurred are generally connected to high doses, combinations (e.g. with pentedrone), or the application of a physical stressor (e.g. restraint).

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone*

α-Pyrrolidinovalerophenone (α-PVP), also known as α-pyrrolidinopentiophenone , O-2387, β-keto-prolintane, prolintanone, or desmethylpyrovalerone, or colloquially as flakka or gravel, is a synthetic stimulant of the cathinone class developed in the 1960s that has been sold as a designer drug and often consumed for recreational reasons. α-PVP is chemically related to pyrovalerone and is the ketone analog of prolintane.

## Use and effects

α-PVP is used by a variety of different routes of administration, including oral, insufflation, injection, vaporization, sublingual, and rectal. The dose range of α-PVP for therapeutic purposes was originally defined as 10 to 50 mg, with a most-suitable dose of 20 mg, whereas the recreational dose range is typically between 10 and 300 mg. The effects of α-PVP onset after 10 minutes, peak after 10 to 40 minutes, and last 2 to 3 hours.
The effects of α-PVP include cocaine-like psychostimulant effects, euphoria, elevated mood, alertness, pleasurable rush, feeling "sped up", mania-like symptoms, enhanced energy, motivation and productivity, enhanced music enjoyment, mild sexual stimulation, insomnia, paranoia, hallucinations, and increased aggression and violence. In emergency settings, commonly observed effects have included psychosis-like state, agitation, aggression, hallucinations, abnormal heart rate, and vomiting. It also produces sympathomimetic effects, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure.

## Adverse effects

α-PVP, like other stimulants, can cause hyperstimulation, paranoia, and hallucinations. α-PVP has been reported to be the cause, or a significant contributory cause of death in suicides and overdoses caused by combinations of drugs. α-PVP has also been linked to at least one death with pulmonary edema and moderately advanced atherosclerotic coronary artery disease when it was combined with pentedrone.
According to Craig Crespi in the journal Case Reports in Psychiatry, "symptoms are known to easily escalate into frightening delusions, paranoid psychosis, extreme agitation, and a multitude of other altered mental states." These common adverse effects of α-PVP are in line with other stimulants.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

α-PVP acts as a potent norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), similarly to other NDRIs like methylphenidate, cocaine, and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). Its IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration values have been found to be 14 to 70 nM for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and 13 to 80 nM for dopamine reuptake inhibition in rat brain synaptosomes and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells expressing the monoamine transporters (MATs). In contrast to its effects on catecholamine reuptake, α-PVP has negligible effects on serotonin reuptake.
The drug is much more potent than amphetamine as an NDRI in in vitro, with 46-fold greater potency in terms of dopamine reuptake inhibition and 7-fold greater potency in terms of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition in HEK293 cells. It is one of the most potent dopamine reuptake inhibitors in vitro known.
Similarly to other cathinone, α-PVP has been shown to have stimulant-like effects (i.e., hyperlocomotion), reinforcing effects, and sympathomimetic effects in rodents.

### Pharmacokinetics

The absorption of α-PVP is very rapid. In humans, the effects of the drug onset after 10 minutes, peak between 10 and 40 minutes, and last 2 to 3 hours.
α-PVP is said to be highly lipophilic due to its pyrrolidine ring, which in turn is said to markedly enhance its ability to permeate the blood–brain barrier relative to other cathinones.
The distribution, metabolism, and elimination of α-PVP have been studied.

## Chemistry

α-PVP gives no reaction with the Marquis reagent. It gives a grey/black reaction with the Mecke reagent.

### Detection in body fluids

α-PVP may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma α-PVP concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/L in intoxicated patients, and >300 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage.

## History

α-PVP was first described in the literature in 1963.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

α-PVP is banned in Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Russia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Norway, as well as the Czech Republic.

#### Australia

α-PVP is a Schedule 9 prohibited substance under the Poisons Standard (July 2016). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. The drug was explicitly made illegal in New South Wales after it was illegally marketed with the imprimatur of erroneous legal advice that it was not encompassed by analog provisions of the relevant act. It is encompassed by those provisions, and therefore has been illegal for many years in New South Wales. The legislative action followed the death of two individuals from using it; one jumping off a balcony, another having a heart attack after a state of delirium.

#### China

As of October 2015, α-PVP is a controlled substance in China.

#### European Union

α-PVP was required to be banned by EU member states by 3 July 2017.

#### Italy

Cathinone and all structurally derived analogues (including pyrovalerone analogues) were classified as narcotics in January 2012.

#### United States

On January 28, 2014, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) listed α-PVP, along with nine other synthetic cathinones, as a Schedule I controlled substance with a temporary ban, effective February 27, 2014. The temporary ban was then extended.

### Economics

α-PVP is sometimes the active ingredient in recreational drugs sold as "bath salts".  It may also be distinguished from "bath salts" and sold under a different name: "flakka," a name used in Florida, or "gravel" in other parts of the U.S. It is reportedly available as cheaply as US\$5 per dose. A laboratory for one county in Florida reported a steady rise in α-PVP detections in seized drugs from none in January–February 2014 to 84 in September 2014.
