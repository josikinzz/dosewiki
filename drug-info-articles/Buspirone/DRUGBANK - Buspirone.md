## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-arylpiperazines. These are organic compounds containing a piperazine ring where the nitrogen ring atom carries an aryl group.

### Background

Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent with a unique structure and a pharmacological profile. Belonging to the azaspirodecanedione drug class,
2
buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT
1A
receptor agonist that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative/anxiolytic drugs.
13
Unlike many drugs used to treat anxiety, buspirone does not exhibit anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Due to these characteristics, buspirone been termed 'anxioselective'.
1
First synthesized in 1968 then patented in 1975,
10
it is commonly marketed under the brand name Buspar®. Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA
4
and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate.
10
The potential use of buspirone in combination with
melatonin
in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated.
4

### Indication

Indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety.
13

### Pharmacodynamics

The clinical effect of buspirone in alleviating the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to achieve.
10
The delayed onset of action of buspirone suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness in generalized anxiety may involved more than its molecular mechanism of action at the 5-HT
1A
receptors,
9
or buspirone may induce adaptations of 5-HT
1A
receptors.
10
Buspirone was not shown to alter the psychomotor or cognitive function in healthy volunteers, and the risk of developing sedation is relatively low compared to other anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines.
1
Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates used in anxiety disorders, buspirone is not associated with a risk for developing physical dependence or withdrawal, or any significant interaction with central nervous system depressants such as ethanol. This is due to the lack of effects on GABA receptors.
1
,
10
Buspirone also does not exhibit any anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing properties,
5
but may interfere with arousal reactions due to its inhibitory action on the aactivity of noradrenergic locus coerulus neurons.
9
Despite its clinical effectiveness in generalized anxiety, buspirone demonstrated limited clinical effectiveness on panic disorders, severe anxiety, phobias, and obsessive compulsive disorders.
4
,
9
The clinical effectiveness of the long-term use of buspirone, for more than 3 to 4 weeks, has not demonstrated in controlled trials but there were no observable significant adverse events in patients receiving buspirone for a year in a study of long-term use.
13

### Mechanism of Action

5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A
Partial agonist
D(2) dopamine receptor
Antagonist

### Absorption

Buspirone is rapidly absorbed following oral administration.
13
Bioavailability is low and variable (approximately 5%) due to extensive first pass metabolism. While absorption of buspirone is decreased with concomitant food intake, the first-pass metabolism of the drug is also decreased, resulting in an increased bioavailability
10
as well as increased Cmax and AUC.
13
Following oral administration of single oral doses of 20 mg, the Cmax ranged from 1 to 6 ng/mL and the Tmax ranged from 40 to 90 minutes.
13

### Metabolism

Buspirone is extensively metabolized upon administration, where it primarily undergoes hepatic oxidation mediated by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Hydroxylated derivatives are produced, including a pharmacologically active metabolite 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP). In animal studies, 1-PP possessed about one quarter of the pharmacological activity of buspirone.

### Half-life

In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of 14C-labeled buspirone, the average elimination half-life of unchanged buspirone following administration of single doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg was about 2 to 3 hours.
13

### Toxicity

The oral LD
50
of buspirone is 196 mg/kg in rat, 655 mg/kg in mouse, 586 mg/kg in dog, and 356 mg/kg in monkey. The intraperitoneal LD
50
is 136 mg/kg in rat and 146 mg/kg in mouse.
13
,
11
In clinical pharmacology trials, administration of buspirone at the dose of 375 mg/day resulted in symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. Few cases of overdosage that have been reported usually resulted in complete recovery. In case of overdose, the use of general symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended along with immediate gastric lavage and monitoring of respiration, pulse, and blood pressure.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Buspirone is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Buspirone may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Buspirone can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Buspirone can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Buspirone can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Alcohol may cause additive CNS depressant effects.
Avoid grapefruit products. Grapefruit increases the plasma concentrations of the drug.
Take at the same time every day. Take consistently at the same time in regard to meals.
Take with or without food. Take drug always with or always without food in a consistent manner.

### Mechanism of action

The therapeutic action of buspirone in generalized anxiety disorders is thought to be mainly derived from its interaction with two major 5-HT
1A
receptor subtypes that are involved in the brain's anxiety and fear circuitry to enhance the serotonergic activity in these brain areas.
10
Buspirone acts as a full agonist at presynaptic 5-HT
1A
receptors, or 5-HT
1A
autoreceptors, expressed at dorsal raphe while acting as a partial agonist at the postsynaptic 5-HT
1A
receptors expressed on hippocampus and cortex.
7
,
8
5-HT
1A
receptors function as inhibitory autoreceptors by being expressed on the soma or dendrites of serotonergic neurons or mediate postsynaptic actions of 5-HT by being highly expressed on the corticolimbic circuits.
9
They are inhibitory G-protein coupled receptors that couple to Gi/Go proteins. When activated, presynaptic 5-HT
1A
autoreceptors causes neuron hyperpolarization and reduces the firing rate of the serotonergic neuron, thereby decreasing extracellular 5-HT levels in the neuron's projection areas. Activated postsynaptic 5-HT
1A
receptors promote hyperpolarization to released 5-HT on pyramidal neurons.
8
The anxiolytic action of buspirone is mainly thought to arise from the interaction at presynaptic 5-HT
1A
autoreceptors. Acting as a potent agonist in these receptors, buspirone initially causes activation of these autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT release. It is proposed that buspirone induces desensitization of somatodendritic autoreceptors over time, which may explain the delayed onset of action of the drug. Desensitization of the autoreceptors ultimately results in heightened excitation of serotonergic neurons and enhanced 5-HT release.
9
Buspirone also displays a weak affinity for serotonin 5HT2 receptors and acts as a weak antagonist on dopamine D2 autoreceptors,
10
although there is not much evidence that the action at these receptors contribute to the anxiolytic effect of buspirone.
6
It acts as an antagonist at presynaptic dopamine D3 and D4 receptors and may bind to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors as a partial agonist.

### Volume of distribution

In a pharmacokinetic study assessing buspirone over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg, the volume of distribution was 5.3 L/kg.
3

### Protein binding

Based on the findings of an
in vitro
protein binding study, approximately 86% of buspirone is bound to plasma proteins.
13
It is mainly bound to serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.
2

### Route of elimination

A single-dose pharmacokinetic studies using 14C-labeled buspirone demonstrated that about 29-63% of the dose administered was excreted in the urine within 24 hours, primarily in the form of metabolites. About 18% to 38% of the dose was eliminated via fecal excretion.
13

### Clearance

In a pharmacokinetic study assessing buspirone over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg, the systemic clearance was 1.7 L/h/kg.

### General Function

Translocates drugs and phospholipids across the membrane (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:8898203, PubMed:9038218, PubMed:35507548). Catalyzes the flop of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane. Participates mainly to the flop of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, beta-D-glucosylceramides and sphingomyelins (PubMed:8898203). Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:9038218)
