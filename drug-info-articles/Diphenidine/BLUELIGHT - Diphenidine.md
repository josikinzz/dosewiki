> Diphenidine is a novel dissociative anaesthetic drug with mild stimulant potential and a large amnestic component, making it relatively easy to feel like you black out during the experience, unable to recall what has happened. This also suggests there may be a potential risk of losing control over one's behavior. Always start with a very low dose and slowly work your way up. The dose-reponse curve can apparently be quite steep and another individual may react quite differently to it, needing a different dose; especially since (cross)tolerance developed to NMDA antagonists / dissociatives drugs can be chronic!
> 
> 
> 
> Diphenidine is unusual because it is not an arylcyclohexylamine like most other dissociatives such as ketamine, PCP and their analogues. If you have tried this drug, please write a trip report and submit it in the trip reports forum of Bluelight, or here in this thread and we will move it for you. This drug does not seem to have a long history of use in humans at all and we can use all the information on it there is.

[original post:]


So a certain vendor has released this to its advanced customers. Its meant to be an NMDA antagonist so that means it could have effects similar to MXE/Ketamine if im not mistaken?


From the website:

Anyone got any ideas on what this would be like? Whether it will be a decent chemical or a waste of time?

This is just the piperidine analogue of lefetamine.


It's been studied, go through the lefetamine papers.  I don't think it's very active, as either an opioid, stimulant or dissociative.


Put a 4-phenyl on that ring and you've got a fairly active opioid, IIRC- er, that was with a piperazine, though.

This makes me think of other lead compounds like [MT-45](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT-45). 


I bet you money it's shitty. Lefetamine and/or MT-45 are both considered pretty lame drugs.

Sampled this at the weekend and was very impressed, and so was a friend who said he could not distinguish it from MXE apart from the fact that the dosage is higher!

Really? I would have expected the duration of this to be quite a bit longer than that of MXE... rather a duratin along the lines of PCP / 3-MeO-PCP / 2-DPMP.

So it does not appear to be analgesic?

I only had a small sample and didn't take note of the duration to be honest. All i can say is it is rather MXE like in my uneducated opinion.


I have not tried PCP or 2-DPMP, and only tried 3-MEO-PCP once so i can't compare. The only real experience i have with Dissociatives is with MXE.


I'm sure other more reputable sources will be along soon with more detailed info. Seems like a very interesting chem anyway! Personally i'm interested in it for it's potential antidepressant qualities more than anything else!

I have a gram of this arriving on Wednesday and will sample it that evening and report here. I've had lots of experience with ketamine (although not for several years) and have had partaken in MXE and 3-MeO-PCP an awful lot before the uk ban (a bit too much frankly), so I should be well placed to directly compare it to those compounds.


As much as I want this to be great, I'm trying not to get my hopes up too much for it to be a direct replacement for my beloved arylcyclohexlamines. I'll settle for it being a fun drug in it's own right - caballero seems to like it, and I've read another positive review on another site.


Here's hoping!

Sample arriving tomorrow, my mileage might be comparable to yours, lastest, I have a similar recent history of hexylamines. I'm also being careful not to hope too hard for a 'replacement.' But this one sounds like it has a promising (albeit likely short-lived) future. Will update on trial. I've seen approximate dose reports of anywhere between 50 and 100mg - my guess is that the disso tolerant amongst us will end up finding solice in the higher end of that range, but if we learnt nothing else from the beautiful beast 3-MeO: we should probably start small! ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Well, I got my gram, thanks postie. In appearance it's just about the clumpiest chem I've ever seen. It's extremely rocky and seems to stick to itself, but thankfully not to the bag. I'm going out now but I'll post a pic when I get back. It's noon here in the UK, I'll sample this around 9 PM and post again when it's worn off.

Got mine too. Day off today, excellent timing for an experiment. After an allergy test (about 5mg, waited 40 minutes) I've plastered my nasal membranes with 60mg. I have to say, even to someone that (by some slightly masichistic streak) derives some pleasure from insufflating stingy caustic chemicals, this one is a challenge. I would compare the physical stinging sensation as something in between 3/4-MeO-PCP and 2C-B. It actually smells a little like 2C-B, too, in my opinion; a fairly pungent but not overpowering aroma. The crystalline composition (despite being powdered) is rocky, and it took a lot of chopping to get it into a reasonably fine dust. It does tend to clump together and I suspect that it will pick up moisture and clump more if not kept dry. I'm not certain what kind of salt this is but (not being a chemist!) it has the appearance of HCL salts of other compounds I've come across before. On that note, a question to anyone that knows - is it possible to identify salts in this way (by physical appearance) or am I stabbing in the dark by suggesting that it's HCL?


Little is known about effective ROA, obviously, but I would advise against insufflation for anyone that generally finds that route to be particularly uncomfortable.

Will update with tentative onset and duration information, and any other comments.

Nutty Professor II: The Klumps


**NSFW**:

Eesh, thanks for the warning about insuflation Dioxy. It certainly doesn't look like it'll be much fun to snort. I'm in two minds about whether to try it or to just go for oral. I don't mind a bit of pain, but I'm not mad keen. I found 3-MeO pretty much fine to snort, but of course the very low dosage was a major factor in that.

I would have kept administration to oral ROA; this does not seem very fun to snort.


Presence or absence of "clumps"/"crystal shape" is not a good metric of freebase/HCl purity. pH testing a solution in distilled water would be better.


Anyway, important things to note in bioassay: onset time, time to peak f/x, total duration. If you have equipment, measure solubility in water, melt point, hygroscopicity (tendency to absorb water from the air), rxn with any color change reagents.

Onset was gradual over 30-40 minutes, a feeling of stimulation, focus and clarity that I associate with low-dose MXE and 3-MeO. General mood lift with a hint of the manic properties of the aforementioned compounds, a slightly stimulatory compulsion to get things done. Tentatively, could have application in creativity. 

Heart rate about 100-110 after a 60mg starting dose followed by a 100mg dose 1.5 hours later. General sense of fuzzy dissociation and calm but no notable motor impairment. Not pushing this one too much yet, too little data.

Well here's a turn up for the books. I swallowed 5mg in OJ as an allergy test forty minutes ago and I do believe I am feeling slightly dissociated. I don't entirely discount that it could be psychosomatic, but I doubt it. I'm having dinner with my family in a minute, and I'm feeling odd enough to be slightly anxious at the prospect. In any case, this hints at the fact that oral may well be a more effective ROA than intranasal, and I've therefore decided to go with 50mg orally this later this evening.

Very interesting. My sample was small and my NMDA tolerance is high so it quickly disappeared, I didn't get a chance to try oral. Insufflation leaves a clogged sinus for a few hours too - for some reason I insist on that ROA sometimes even when I know that others are more effective and efficient, but basically it seems like a pointless way to take this drug.


I noticed that the effects changed over time, the dissociative buzz turned into a feeling of serenity and wellbeing. For that reason, and taking into account the onset and duration, I'm finding this chemical has a lot of similarities to 3-MeO-PCP. I will have to wait until next opportunity to try a higher dose and report on the more intense end of the effects.

How did it go, lastest? My sinuses are still fucked, and I think my tonsils even swelled a little. I wish I wasn't such a nose-fiend! Hah. Definitely swallowing/sublingual next time. 

I felt pretty much back to baseline around T+4 Hours after the last dose, but with some residual anxiolytic effects. No particularly uncomfortable hangover as yet, except a slight feeling of fatigue/tiredness, reminds me of MXE after-effects in that way, though I kept well hydrated (dehydration was notable as with hexylamines) and I've just taken 1mg Etizolam in case sleep is an issue. Consumption was 60mg doses rising to 100mg, didn't push it further than that on this occasion.

So this one is fairly good? I'm nervous about trying any new RCs after I spent £20 on a pretty much inactive chemical

Ladies and gentleman, we are floating in space.


I dosed 50mg orally at 9:30 PM and watched the finale of Justified on the way up. Mild to moderate feelings of dissociation made the plot slightly confusing towards the end. After that I conducted a phone conversation with a friend with no real difficulty although I had the distinct feeling I was experiencing things from a third person perceptive. At 11:30, feeling quite wonky but not trashed by any means I redosed 70mg oral. Between then and now I have no idea what happened subjectively, or rather, I can tell you that there was *nothing* going on subjectively. I feel that I was fully conscious  but my mind was a complete blank. I'm pretty sure I've just been sat on my bed staring at my banjo in the corner of the room without a single identifiable thought for over an hour. At some point I felt hot so I stripped to the waist and lay flat on my back breathing deeply and evenly with my mind still completely blank. It was about the most relaxed I've ever felt in my life. I guess it could be considered a hole but very different from a hexylamine hole. It was like a zen-like state of non existence. It wasn't good, it wasn't bad, it wasn't anything at all. Worthwhile? I'm not sure I can answer that. It was like being pure form without content. It was either the most boring or most fascinating experience of my life. Or maybe both at the same time.


EDIT: Reading back the above, I'm pretty sure what I've written is a really poor attempt to put into words what the experience was like. But minute by minute, all memory of the subjective effects of the drug seem to be fading away, like trying to remember a dream. I feel that this stuff has very profound and strange effects on memory. I'm not sure how recreational it is but it's pretty fascinating in my opinion.

Interesting, I think I'll definately be giving it a try when it becomes available to the public. Maybe you took too much and lesser doses would leave you with more memory of what happened?

Intriguing report. Based on what's surfaced so far, it's my view that anyone looking for a 'psychedelic' dissociative will be disappointed. The feeling of 'nothingness' and relaxation, however, which I would equate to a meditative state, is something that other arylcyclohexylamine users (including myself) find alluring.

The only information available at the moment (that I know of) is in this paper.


[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089609002624](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089609002624)


I can't post attachments and since it's a commercially available paper I expect it would be against several rules. 

There's no toxicity data, though. That study is looking at the binding affinities, not toxicity. We still have little to no definitive information about human toxicity in most PCP/Ketamine derivatives anyway so we really are taking a stab in the dark as far as health goes.

A couple of things to add in the clear light of day.


There were definite hallmarks of NMDA antagonism - distant sounds seeming very clear, a feeling that the events of the day leading up to taking the drug were somehow unreal as if they'd taken place in a dream. What was definitely lacking was a noticeable dopamine rush which makes the onset of hexylamines so satifying.


There was none of the introspection that I usually get with hexylamines - no rush of fragmented thoughts, just a kind of blankness. It was quite peaceful in some ways but there was something a bit unnerving about it too. Hard to explain.


There were some worrying moments where I felt quite panicked and my heart started to race very fast - but this could simply be the anxiety over using such a new and untested drug. I was quite easily able to get back to a calm state by lying down and regulating my breathing.


Also, I rather foolishly took a third, rather large, dose after my last post last night. I felt back to baseline at that point, but it may well be that the drug was exerting a manic effect on me. I think it may have been 80mg, my memory is hazy. I started to watch a film on my laptop and remember seeing the first couple of scenes but then either fell asleep or blacked out. Next thing I knew it was 7 AM and I opened my eyes to the WMV player screen showing that the file had finished playing. 2mg of etizolam I had taken earlier during one of the short periods of anxiety probably contributed to that, although I am rather tolerant to etiz and 2mg wouldn't usually make me pass out.


Diphenidine is clearly a rather powerful NMDA antagonist. Subjectively it feels completely different to hexylamines in my opinion, and my feeling so far is that it does not have anywhere near the recreational potential of those drugs. It's interesting, but not what I'd call fun. On the other hand, it may be an acquired taste - it took me a few goes to actively enjoy methoxetamine.


Finally, I'd warn everyone to be careful with this - much more careful than I was. It seems like there's a fine line between not enough and too much.

As far as I know nobody really cares about posting "commercial" papers; mostly because people get 'em free at the library and wouldn't want to pay $25/page anyway.

This seems like a Dizocilpine/MK801 type drug. Sure it's a dissociative, but... it's a dissociative user's dissociative, not a "fun" dissociative, if you get what I'm trying to say.


At doses of 50-100mg though, it had better be cheap and hella safe if it's going to take off. This is kind of in league with 4-MeO-PCP.

I understand what you mean about it being 'peaceful but unnerving.' Something I didn't mention, for lack of enough testing, was an intermittent feeling of unease, and a definite feeling of 'blankness' at points which is also something I have experienced on 3-MeO-PCP (in between the "fucking awesome"). My heartrate was on the high side but it didn't concern me, and I am prone to anxiety, so I wouldn't link that to the drug directly. I feel like 3-MeO also suffers from the lack of a dopamine hit due to the long onset, although that part of the effect does become noticeable over time... Similarly on Diphenidine, I *think* I experienced an analogous dopaminergic effect in the main body of the experience, which gave way over a couple of hours to a feeling of what I'd describe as meditative dissociation.


There are also possible issues here about receptor tolerance when giving subjective descriptions - In my own case I expect that my receptor tolerance to the NMDA antagonism is significantly higher than my tolerance to the dopamine reuptake inhibition (assuming the vendor is right about that mechanism). We can't be sure how this compares between us individually. It could mean that highly NMDA tolerant people will experience a higher ratio of DRI to NMDA per-mg. We also don't know how this might vary based on ROA, so I will need to try eating instead of snooty-tootling to gain a better idea.


That last part makes it even more vital that everyone is cautious with it. Such powerful NMDA antagonism for non-tolerant users, combined with the long onset is likely to cause users to re-dose or 'over'-dose if they don't feel the dopamine hit they expect. Especially for a drug that's being touted as 'like Ketamine' (slightly misleading marketing but it's obvious why it's there...) Luckily, however, I think the lack of that initial dopamine rush will put a lot of potential casual/weekend binge users off, because it's my view that this was one of the primary reasons MXE was (is) so popular.


sekio - I would second your comment about it being a 'dissociative user's dissociative.' A bit like the Stewart Lee of dissociatives ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't really know anything about those drugs, but yeah I think that sums up my first impression of it. It brought to mind what I've heard about Tiletamine - dissociating in a similar way to ket but lacking in euphoria.

At I what I paid for the gram, the price per dose isn't too bad - that is if it turns out to be worth anything at all recreationally speaking of which I'm not convinced. I haven't entirely given up on the stuff, my experience last night wasn't negative, although quite unsettling at times. I do feel that I potentially fall into the 'dissociative users' category as I am deeply interested in the idea of dissociation in and of itself - I feel it shows us fascinating things about our relationship with time, memory, emotion, all sorts of things. But at the end of the day it's pleasure rather than interest that's going to popularize any drug. I kind of doubt the crowd that bought 'offical MXE pellets' from headshops will dig this stuff.

I get what you mean, but I very much doubt that diphenidine will become my drug of choice, whereas Stewart Lee is without question my comedian of choice. "Del Boy, Stew. He fell through through the bar... and Trigger made a face." Any drug that gave me as much pleasure as Stewart Lee's comedy I would hoover up in Tony Montana-style quantities.

You make a valid point. My analogy falls short there haha. It's only the 'Stewart Lee' in as much as that a lot of people won't 'get it,' so it could just as easily be 'The Flying Spaghetti Monster of religion' and 'The Bruno of social commentary.'


P.S. "... Trigger made a **face**..."

Just started a second bioassay. This time it's 100mg oral and I will not be redosing whatever happens. I hope to get a more orderly picture of onset, time till peak, total duration etc. I'll take written notes as I go. Having survived a total of 200mg last night with no ill effects I feel much less anxious tonight and I'll therefore be better placed to enjoy the effects, if there is indeed enjoyment to be had.


EDIT: Here you have it. Sorry, it's a bit dull.


T + 0:00 Swallowed 100mg Diphenidine in orange juice. The juice almost completely masks the taste of the compound, only a very slight bitterness.


T+ 0:15 First alerts. A tingling sensation in the lower body and some minor muscle relaxation.


T+0:40 Marked dissociative headspace. A feeling of distraction like I am on the edge of remembering an important fact but I just can’t quite work out what it is. A kind of dreamlike state indicative of NMDA antagonism. Slight physical and emotional numbness. Moderate tinnitus, not too annoying. Very relaxed. Heart rate normal.


T+ 1:40 Spent the last hour listening to music while watching the itunes visualizer.  No particular increase in music appreciation. I just feel a bit bored really. Back to watching TV.


T+ 2:10 I don’t think there’s much more for me in store for me than this.  Barely perceptible feeling of dissociation, perhaps very slight stimulation.  At this point I feel that if someone had spiked my drink with this compound two hours ago I probably wouldn’t have noticed. The effects I reported at T+0:40 may not have been noticeable if I hadn’t been looking out for them.


I’ll see what 200mg does on another occasion but I’m becoming quite pessimistic about this substance. I’d certainly have had a much more satisfying evening with a few beers or a nice hit of codeine. It just didn’t seem to do anything much at all at this level. Quite boring really. Maybe there’ll be a sweet spot at 200-250mg but that’s going to make it pretty expensive.


EDIT 2: I went to friend's house to buy some weed before coming home and conducting this experiment (I don't smoke - paranoia-city for me - it was for my gf) and I mentioned my plans for when I got home. He said "Oh it's like ketamine is it? I could probably get you some ketamime." I said "Mate, I will love you forever if you can get me some ket." Frankly this super-novel compound experimentation is a bit scary. Just let me have my hexylamines and I'll be on my way. I'm not bothering anybody, I just wanna get dissociated.

Is it possible that this stuff is just not very active orally? Considering what Solipsis said about expecting it to have a long duration, and the fact that the effects for me last night were over in about two hours, it would seem that oral dosing is not an effective ROA. The reports of snorting, although not exactly glowing, are much more positive and the duration is reported to be longer on smaller doses. A report has surfaced on 420chan from someone who's had good results with plugging, but I'm a bit squeamish about that ROA frankly.


Or am I just flogging a dead horse? Should I just shut up and start crushing up my co codomol tablets and stop hoping for a good non-hexylamine dissociative that's never going to fucking happen?

I think there is more to be said for this compound yet, but it is definitely a subtle one and difficult to assess. 

At 13:30 I insufflated 50mg and swallowed 50mg. An hour later I felt slightly dissociated but nothing to write home about. 

At 15:30 I swallowed 100mg and insufflated 50mg, and over the course of the last hour I've had some really quite pleasant body high effects combined with a 'clean' feeling dissociation. 


Collating our experiences, I think this compound has much more therapeutic potential than it does recreational. It isn't a psychedelic experience at these doses, but it does have something. I'm just not yet sure what that "thing" is. 

I too am a little hesitant to plug. The anxiolytic and antidepressant effects are of interest.

Looking at its structure I would say that its best ROA should be oral with a fatty meal, since it has no polar groups and will therefore be poorly water soluble. Following the same logic I would expect it to have a pretty long duration ala 2-DPMP or PCP.

Ended up railing 90mg last night. I didn't find it all that bad to snort once I'd chopped it up really finely and snorted some water. It definitely hit harder than oral and felt a bit methoxetamine-like even. However, I was already feeling good on the tail end of a large hit of codeine to it just added some dissociation to the codeine euphoria. It wore off pretty quickly leaving me tired and confused and wishing I'd just left it alone to be honest. My girlfriend did 30mg (we were both going to do 60mg but she found it too painful so ended up only doing half of her's, so I had the rest) and said she felt quite pleasantly dissociated for a short while, and thought it was an interesting headspace. 


Like I say, with properly prepared sinuses it wasn't hell to snort, although it did sting for ten minutes or so. Although obviously I was under the pain-killing effect of codeine at the time so that would have helped. Today my sinus feel fine, only slightly clogged, no biggie.


So intranasal does work better than oral for me, but I still find it an unsatisfying drug. Might try it once more oral with a fatty meal like you suggest Transform, but once my gram is all gone I will definitely not be reordering.


**EDIT: Oral DOES work, and how! Please see my post below.**

I don't want to get involved in hyping something that is not even on general release as yet. I've read all threads with interest here and elsewhere, have now had a chance to test myself. Purely in the interests of HR some thoughts:


As others have said, insufflation with this stuff is vile. Worst. Drip. Ever. I was shooting water up my nose with an oral syringe within 10 minutes trying to clear the burn. Super caustic. Luckily nasal is a waste of time. At 50mg at least. As is plugging up to 150mg. All about the oral route with this stuff. 150mg oral will straight hole you, hard and deep. That was foolishly my starting oral dose after thinking it would be ineffective there too after failed earlier trials with other ROAs and expectation it would be rubbish as per speculation here. Very, very wrong. High doses 250mg and above are so far out of earth orbit it's not even funny. My trials with MXE, some in similar car crash  territory with runs out up to a gram never got anywhere near this. Anyone gets this go easy, work up slowly, make sure stuff is put out of sight to make redosing difficult till firmly back to terra firma and rational. Somewhere safe with a trip sitter absolute requirement if aiming to hole.


It takes easily an hour to produce full effects, or that's your proper entry point anyways. It may have more to give still longer. It is a much more real, and much more fully immersive, self-contained universe you're entering than with MXE IME but takes higher doses to get there. I have not experienced that stimulated, warm, sparkle stage you get with of MXE around ~30-50mg insuff with this, don't know if that's even to be had yet, will test more next week. Would say the hole lasts order of approx 3-4 hours but cannot be accurate, you're out in realms where time is meaningless, couldn't even have begun to keep notes to accurately time. Good thing about it is you come round fairly quickly once back out of the hole it seemed to me. Hour-ish perhaps, maybe even less. Again difficult but doesn't linger on over much mentally, though some residual effect for some hours. 


It is not massively physically disabling afterwards like MXE was for me, you can walk and stuff easily but the transition period between hole and a rational state is way out there for a time and you're physically capable at that point. This is your danger zone here, where you can act out but being a long, long way from rational. Will likely blitz your way through a bag of the stuff if you leave it out to hand redosing in this state too with no understanding of just how fucked up you are, or how fucked up you're gonna get. In the hole I think you're pretty much well under physically though. The blankness others have mentioned is found in the borderlands here too. Sure I stood holding onto my bedroom door frame for grim life a good 15 minutes or so staring into my room in horror at what seemed total destruction, all thought gone, just zoned out completely. You could never be safe out in public with this stuff anywhere.

Well thank fuck for this thread. I received a sample of this without asking and misread the label as diphenhydramine. Great I thought, thank you i guess. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


Weighed out 150mg for a nightcap and only just realised whilst closing the bag it was infact dephenidine, which I'd never heard of so googled it expecting a stronger sleeping drug or something. What an idiot!


I do like my ketamine though, quite happy with the little present now ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'll try it one day.

Crikey, Sepher, you holed that hard from 150mg oral? As I said, 100mg oral felt very weak to me. I feel I bare partial responsibility for you going so high with your first oral dose (although it seems like you handled it well, being so obviously experienced with this sort of thing) but honest to god, 100mg oral felt like 25mg oral MXE to me at most. After your report I've certainly revised my plan to do 200mg oral next time - maybe 150mg or 125mg even. Heartening to hear that one can hole on this stuff, maybe I've found my legal hexylamine replacement after all. Did you do your 150mg oral dose on an empty stomach?

52mg intranasally has produced some pleasant dreamy sensations. Quite an interesting compound, I must say. Very smooth, I feel quite nice.


I feel this could be my limit, any more and I could imagine feeling a little sea sick. I'd describe it as 'wishy washy'. Hardly a scientific report sorry, but this is interesting none the less.

Lastest, empty stomach yes, I started quite early in the a.m. after picking my mail up. Also on not a great deal of sleep, dunno if that may be a factor also or not and perhaps I'm unusually sensitive to NMDAR antagonists. A hole dose of MXE for me could have been anything >50mg insuff. for instance with the better batches I had of it if that helps with any comparisons. I certainly have no tolerance to them, this is the first drug I've used in this class since before the MXE ban over a year ago. 150mg def. holed me but my memory of it is blurred into subsequent deeper ones so difficult to say just how hard. Will be working up more cautiously this week trying to find the precise tipping point for me. What I experienced felt very, very real, fully constructed, fully immersed, fully populated with a whole parade of visistors to my interior world, yes. 8(

Yikes! Okay, yeah ignore what I said about oral being ineffective, 150mg send me to Jupiter and beyond infinity, in line with what you said Sepher. Very of surprising as 100mg did so little as I said.


I don't know if I found the fully constructed, peopled world you did Seph, I really don't remember anything at all about it. All I know is I started watching a movie and then all of a sudden it was towards the end of the movie and I had been *somewhere* in the meantime - somewhere beyond space and time and words. Scary, amazing. Fuck.

Hahaaa, now we're getting towards some of us singing from the same hymn sheet at last, glad the two of us can agree on something. I recognise that exact state you describe, absolutely yes. I think this drug is gonna prove to be all kinds of different things at different doses with different ROAs. It's just a dreamy, relaxed bit of a buzz with the nasal and plugged doses I did, perfectly pleasant but nothing to write home about with little appeal, and something else completely with the higher oral doses.

I had a weird day today after my crazy trip on 150mg last night. I dosed late - about 2AM - because I'd been up late talking to a friend and watching tv with some beers - the alcohol could have had some bearing on all this but I had five cans between 4PM and 2AM and my tolerance is quite high so I wasn't feeling in the least bit drunk by the time I dosed.


Anyway, I was down from the diph by about 4 or 5, but then I do have some strange memories of stumbling to the bathroom and back at 7, with severe motor coordination problems. It was like I'd done a ton of benzos, although I'd only had two etiz and I'm super-tolerant.


Anyway, I knew a friend was coming round a midday and I assumed that I'd be all dandy by then. But the next thing I knew she was standing in my room and calling my name. It turns out that my brother had let her in half an hour before and she'd been in and out of my room trying to wake me a few times without success. I've been falling asleep in the middle of conversations all day and I'm having real trouble texting and typing - this is taking me ages.


I don't know what's going on really. Is it the diph, or did I eat more etizs when I was zoned out and then forgot? Because it feels very much like I'm benzo'd up. Not in a bad way, I feel very relaxed. But it's all a bit unexpected and confusing.


Sepher, how have you been finding the day after your hole-dose trips?


I'm so tempted to hole again tonight, I'm getting really intrigued by this stuff now. But I have to go to a meeting at ten to eleven tomorrow morning and I have other stuff to do after that. Best leave it for another night I think.

Gonna reserve judgement on mental, emotional and physical state the day after for now. I didn't sleep at all that night after it, it had been a bad week, stimulants entered the mix later, all contributing factors, probably more so than the Diphenidine. If I had to call it anything though at the moment, take this with the pinch of salt it deserves, it would be the exact opposite of an after-glow. Not a great place to be in but mostly functional.

I ended up taking several 100mg doses (pre-prepared) when I went out on Friday night/Saturday. It was all finished by about 10am Saturday... I combined with some MDMA. The last dose was 2x100mg doses taken within a space of around 30 minutes (if I remember correctly), so the effective dose at the peak was probably more like 200mg for a short window. I also had a line of MDMA at the same time, and whilst apparently I was fully functional, I have absolutely no recollection of what happened for about an hour. Something quite emotionally 'difficult' happened at that same time (matters of the heart and all that), which might or might not be relevant, but the last thing I remember is this event happening, and then coming round in a different room. Someone approached me and thanked me for providing them with some Etizolam; confused, I told them it was no problem, checked my blister packet and saw that several had gone - apparently I handed them out to the group! Whilst I was coming round I must have let out my frustration at the situation that had bothered me to the person in question, which I hadn't intended to do - I'd meant to keep it all nice and bottled up - so I clearly wasn't in control of my emotions or inhibitions. Seems like that combination can be a potent one.


After the party finished on Sunday night, I slept for most of Monday and today - In much the same way as you describe, lastest, I've been struggling to keep my eyes open, feeling like my mind wants to 'shut down.' I believe this is partly an aftermath effect of the weekend, and partly a psychological response to the emotional stress, but either way it's certainly more lethargy than usual.

^ Jesus, sounds like quite a night Dioxy! Sounds like you've had a bit of rough time personally speaking, very sorry to hear that.


I did end dosing again last night in the end. I weighed what was left of my gram and it came to exactly 150mg on the dot so I thought "what the hell, go for it." Again, a delay of forty minutes maybe and then the feeling of being picked up bodily and chucked straight down a deep, dark hole. In the first few minutes I remember thinking things like "is it day or night?"; "do I usually go to bed at this time?"; "do other people live here with me?"; "are they in bed now?" And then stuff like "what kind of thing am I?"; "are things usually like this or different?" I also experienced what was either a very realistic and loud auditory hallucination, or else heard a normal sound that in my state I was completely unable to identify. A helicopter going over head maybe? Or could have just been the toilet flushing (my bedroom is next to the bathroom). I remember thinking that it was an air raid siren for some reason. Then I just took my clothes off, got into bed, turned out the light and was just gone entirely. I have a vague memory or being conscious of my breathing, and being glad that it was happening automatically and that I didn't have to worry about it, if you see what I mean. But that's about all, my sense of who or what or where I was was basically non-existent.


So that was at about ten, and at half past twelve my text alert went off and I seemed just to snap out of it all at once, I knew exactly what it was and what to do about it. Replied to the text no problem. At that point I actually got out of bed and got dressed again, as it was still so early in the evening - I rarely go to bed before about half one unless I have to be up very early. The after effect was a kind of strange, fractured feeling - a feeling of having been put through the ringer but being basically okay. Certainty not an "afterglow" - almost the opposite, as Sepher said. Like a mild hangover. I cracked open a beer and watched an episode of *Veronica Mars* (what? It's good!) as I probably would have done around that time anyway. I fell asleep about an hour or so later - I did feel very tired by then.


Today I've been feeling fine really, but quite tired. Went to a short meeting mid-morning, then went to meet up with a friend for a few hours to play arcade games and bowl. I do feel more exhausted by my day than I would normally considering I haven't done very much, but it wasn't like yesterday when I was quite non-functional.


So that's my gram gone, with some some very unsatisfying lower dose experiments and two straight-up, say-goodbye-to your-ego, dissociative holes at 150mg. I'm not sure whether to get more now. I might wait a bit and see what emerges from other people's experiences.

Thanks lastest, it wasn't pleasant but 'them's the breaks' in life and love eh.


I'm yet to try a single dose of 150mg+. I'm ready to embark on another trial this weekend, but can't decide whether to go for oral or nose again. I found it difficult to distinguish between the onset/duration'intensity profile of each ROA. I will try to confirm/revoke this statement tomorrow. I know I said I found insufflation uncomfortable but if it's the better ROA it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. I have to be careful about going into serious holes in case my disapproving housemate discovers me - the rest are cool but one of them is a bit of a nightmare!

This is an odd one. I dunno how tolerance works with chems in this class but I can't reproduce my earlier results. I've confirmed the dose. 50mg, bugger all there hardly, 100mg is verging on something / somewhere, but still here, 150mg is a headlong launch into somewhere very much not here. I just can't find anything whatsoever on the other side with my second trial. It's a completely blank void.


I have a TR written up of my notes this last run but I don't know it's useful as a TR anymore given the complete difference in the character of my two tests with this. FWIW, here it is, NSFWed for lengthiness.


**NSFW**: 


14:30 = T=0:00


T=0:00 50mg oral. 


T+1:00 15:30 There's really next to nothing going on. Vaguest bit of pressure at the temples, vaguest bit of a tingle in fingers, face, scalp. No sparkle or softening of colour as yet that I'd associate with MXE, none of that looking at things through the wrong end of a microscope either I always got with it. Music in no way enhanced. There is neither the mu opioid warmth nor the slightly stimulated feel of MXE either. No physical impairment I'm aware of, can type fine, which is not the case an hour in on MXE at 50mg insuff.


T+1:30 16:00 A great calmness descends. Otherwise all exactly as per the above, perhaps a little more so. RHR 100bpm. MOST surprising it's that high, nothing going on would ordinarily account for it. Poss. some mood lift, poss. just in a good mood today anyways, just very, very chilled out.


T+2:00 16:30 As above. No development, still active, effects much the same.


T+2:30 17:00 As above. RHR 90bpm.


T+3:30 18:00 As above with some small diminishing of effects. Walk out to local shop quite easy, fully functional, no problem interacting with others. RHR 90bpm


T+4:00 18:30 100mg oral


T+4:30 19:00 Wonderful mood lift. Some bouncing / bubbling on the quantum foam. Borderlands here. We are surfing the event horizon.


T+6:00 20:30 There is confusion here. I've been moving stuff around my bedroom, PC flat on its side, monitor down to the floor, table here, chair over there, trying to make a safe environment so I won't break anything. And then I put everything back exactly where it was to start with. LOL! There have been flashes across to the other side, or perhaps they are more just bubbles of memory coming to the surface of previous voyages than a real ping-ponging between two worlds, I'm not sure. I've been mostly here, even managed to get posts together here and there that, though difficult taking some concentration, have made perfect sense. Temperature sensing is buggered, I'm warm top half, feet are cold, I have waves of strong tremor, 'spesh in the legs. Bouncing hard. I'm OK though, functional, typing easy.


T+6:30 21:00 There is an easy softness to everything, vaguest shift in colour saturation to the pink and purple end, but super subtle. Tremor gone.


T+7:00 21:30 150mg oral


T+10:00 00:30 I have been somewhere. But I don't know where. Somewhere not here. I have no memory of it whatsoever, but wherever it was, I've just come out of it. It's taking me a while to get myself together. Came out about 11:30 actually, quite confused for a while, though improved fairly rapidly to a mostly lucid state. I remember lying in bed waiting to go under with the last dose and beginning to inflate, expand, and then slide, and that's it. 


There is a quilt rolled out alongside my bed ( just a mattress on the floor really ) parallel to it, with pillows, the monitor is down on the floor. Obviously so I could reach my PC which is a little way away from my bed. Good skills Sepher, good safeguarding. Tabs are open in my browser, I was posting quite coherently up till 21:30 here and elsewhere, and then . . . nothing. My replies are just there, and I have to read back through different forums trying to reconstruct a timeline but I can't. There is no timeline to find. I have lost two or so hours completely. But everything is fine and I feel well. The world is bright and shiny white at first somehow, less so now. I have come back to myself.


T+12:00 02:30 250mg oral. I'm going in hard.


T+14:30 05:00 Back again. Exactly as above at 150mg. No memory of where I've been, except there was a state of absolute greyness either going in or coming out, no visuals whatsoever, nothing there but a black hole of the senses. Most odd. Cannot repeat first trial which was a whole interior universe on a grand scale. Will leave a while before trialling again at high dose with what's left. I don't understand how tolerance to NMDAR antagonists works, but clearly at work with the vast differences in my results. 


Experiment ends.


I have a little left, ~200mgs maybe, haven't weighed it. Will save a week then go in hard again, see if I can find that first inner world that seemed so very real at the time.

Sepher, I envy you for having found an alternate reality even once, even if you can't reproduce it. Both my 150mg trips have led to a profound, highly interesting but quite scarey blankness, which is fascinating in its own right, but I would love to have entity encounter and vitual reality etc. I'm coming up on 80mg oral with my girl now (yeah, I did buy another gram, big surprise) - kind of a strategy to stop us redosing on eph and therefore maybe getting a little sleep tonight. We shall see...


Edit: Well it it did stop us redosing on ethylphenidate, but it didn't produce an experience to write home home about, so there you go.

I'm quite fascinated by this, it's a small part of the action of this drug that seems to happen in quite sudden and pronounced way, and aside from the 'hole' experience that we're all chasing, it's arguably the most interesting effect. The first time I did it is when I noticed it most, around 1.5 hours after my last of four doses in the 60-100mg range, after some mildly MXE-reminiscent tingling/buzz, gentle dissociation and nervous energy, I felt suddenly, unexpectedly and undeniably at peace, almost like a benzo calm but without the sedation. I think I mentioned before it reminded me of the meditative qualities that 3-MeO can induce, especially in certain settings. Recreationally it's almost more of an 'absence of effect' than anything, but I'd love to understand its origin because it's still very cool.

I think I'm done with my experiments with this one. I did write a trip report, but I accidentally deleted it... idiot!


The MXE-like dissociative headspace and buzz is nice, but just nothing particularly special. There seems to be no 'in-between point' between that and un/semi conscious emptiness, which is, as we've discussed, interesting, but given that nothing seems to actually happen, and it's subject to complete amnesia of the experience, I can't say I'm particularly enamoured with it. I'm extremely happy for those of you that have managed the 'alternate reality' complete mind-fuck explosion, but it seems that just isn't on the cards for me personally, or if it is, I have absolutely no memory of it. Hah. I managed to re-dose whilst I was 'vacant,' anyway, and came round wondering why there were no lines left on the CD case. Not a friendly substance for a disso fiend. 


There is something really quite sinister and dysphoric about the hangover afterwards, too. When the remaining dissociation and 'peaceful' feeling leaves, one is left with (as others have described) the 'opposite' of an afterglow. I've spent the last couple of hours quite blankly staring at my computer screen and not thinking very nice thoughts... 


I'm glad I gave it a go (in the at first cautious and then heavy-handed way that I seem to approach all dissociatives!) but I'm afraid as far as Diphenidine goes, I'm out.

I holed pretty hard again, this time from 110mg oral. This time I had music playing (Nick Drake) and it made the experience more memorable, as it provided some sort of reference point that made it easier to remember the time spent in the hole. The lower dose also helped I'm sure. Still, it is very much a blankness - an absence of reality rather than an alternate reality. "A black hole of the senses" is a nice turn of phrase, Sepher, very apt. Towards the end I also had the most extreme feeling of 'thinness' as I call it - the sensation that no part of my body has any height, width or thickness and/or that every part of my body is hollow - all outside and no inside. It's something I fairly often experienced on hexylamines and is a truly disgusting sensation, not nice at all.


I came out of the hole with the notion that I now knew *exactly* what dissociation is in phenomenological terms, but every attempt to put it into words failed. My girlfriend eventually became (quite understandably) irritated with me so I gave up. However, having smoked a joint I felt I could give it a go after all, so I put pen to paper and came up with several sentences that boil down to this:


"Dissociative drugs inhibit the ability of the brain to correlate sensory data into an apparent totality in any given moment."


I don't know whether that is true at all. If it is, I don't know if it's a pretty commonplace idea of what dissociation is. It's just never occurred to me in quite that way before, and I think it's a reasonably logical idea that fits my subjective experience.


As you can tell from the above, once again I was fascinated but not entertained by this drug. I don't know if it's simply a lack of dopamine action or something more complex, but I agree with Dioxy - it works but it's not fun. Having had a read about MK-801, Seiko, I would guess that you are right to draw a parallel there.


I'm sure I'll use up the rest of my second gram, but I doubt if any further experience will yield anything to say that hasn't been said here already. Kudos to the chemists that have produced such a reliably effective NMDA antagonist, but it seems that more than NMDA antagonism alone is needed for a good time. This drug has clearly been designed to fill the dissociative-shaped gap in the UK RC market following the hexylamine ban. Close, but no cigar.

Whilst I don't know how close your analysis of dissociation is to the actuality either, I relate entirely to what I think you mean. I've described the experience of dissociation in similar ways before, and I feel as though this drug might be quite a good example of a fairly 'purist' dissociative (without the significantly present dopamine/mu-opioid/SERT actions of others). The dissociative experience seems always to be one of 'distance' from the external, which I find manifests in two main ways:


a) A loss or alteration of the organised interpretation of sensory/proprioceptive data (very similar to your description, in fact I've borrowed some of your phrasing there, nice work!)

b) An emotional distance/detachment (literally the dis-association of experience from response) from external events and from transient thoughts - I would speculate that this could be some part of the anxiolytic/stress-relieving properties of dissociatives.


For the sake of avoiding the spread of misinformation, I better mention that the following is *pure (and probably quite ignorant) speculation*! Just in case... haha.

What I find in my experience is that this distance from, and perhaps disregard for normal thought patterns and sense data can provide a proverbial 'space' for introspection. I also think that the reduction of external stimuli causes the mind to, for want of a better description, 'feed on itself,' focussing on inner thought patterns and and generating some erroneous feedback in the form of hallucination, based on the lack of sufficient input, much as we do when we cut ourselves off from light or sound. The way dissociatives can encourage us to focus on inner thoughts can be a very emotional experience, so I don't think it's that it disconnects one from emotion as such, rather that it applies a detachment from the every-day 'background noise' of life by changing the way we respond to it emotionally, in a manner that feels like there is a 'buffer' placed between the self and its surroundings. That is just an analogy of course based on how it feels, obviously not necessarily what is physiologically happening, but it's for this reason that I often compare the experience to a meditative state, in which one can choose to let thoughts pass by unheeded, or focus very intently on an individual train of thought. 


That state of being is one that's very attractive for many of the same reasons that meditation is, which is why I now try to choose the latter option to deal with the inner human malady!

Actually (Zen) meditation, dissociatives and the link between them has been fascinating for me recently, but I may be starting to distrust something about it. Because a Zen state is one of being, including active thought patterns and associations, paying attention to the present... and the more one goes into the void the more 'denial' there is of parts of yourself. That nothingness is not meditation, it sounds more like being zombified and I am familiar with that aspect - I think -  from 3-MeO-PCP especially having witnessed my housemate on considerable doses of it. He, too, lost time although I am sure it is still not as total and complete as dizolcipine and diphenidine apparently can produce.

Of the dissociatives I tried I find moderate doses of 3-MeO-PCE more conductive to a Zen state because I feel much more like I remain there. If a subtle part of you is quieted, that might make for a peaceful meditation session... but IMO this still suggests that to quiet down a part of your mind or self is a denial of it, and that is not truly the idea of meditation but rather what we often mistake as meditation. Surely even sober *some* meditation sessions have much more of a void-like quality but to think this is somehow a superior or advanced stage in meditation is - from what I learned about it - wrong, at least for Zen. Maybe not other methods.


But compounds like this, as it seems, could be quite interesting for ponderings about ontology and other fields of metaphysics if it allows a person to experience abstract concepts that may be related to nothingness.


It seems the matter of the ROA with diphenidine is cleared up and I am not surprised, the molecule does not seem to have groups that would be metabolized via first pass metabolism rendering it ineffective, but from the looks of it I would guess it to be a lipophilic compound. From these reports it sounds like it is considerably less long lived than dizolcipine, then again PCP does not have such an lengthy duration either. Maybe binding to fat is not the only factor to consider, there is protein binding as well which I cannot speculate on.


Would you agree that making this substance highly available could cause many amnestic disasters (including redosing bouts) a la phenazepam but sans the super potency?

Funny, that is almost exactly how I describe how anticholinergic drugs work - the acetylcholine receptors get blocked from sending the nerve impulses to our brain.  Since your braining is running on 25% real information, it has to "fill in the gaps" by bullshitting the other 90%, making things up from memories.  That would explain the super realistic visuals including bath and forth conversations but more importantly how common it is for people to hallucinate friends, family, and other things stored in your memory.  


I don't think that the exact mechanism of action is known for anticholinergic drugs, but anyone else think that's decent explanation?

I perhaps described it not as well as I'd hoped - because I was meaning to talk about reasonably low-dose dissociative experiences, where the mind is fully conscious and aware of the present, and where thoughts are available for examination, but in which it becomes easier to either 'allow them to pass' without intruding emotionally, or equally, easier to study them in detail. From my very limited current understanding of quite basic meditation techniques, some of the states achievable through meditation are similar to the experience of zen-*like* (not necessarily strictly 'zen') calm that can be catalysed/encouraged by dissociative drugs. I think to an extent I use the state of serenity that I sometimes achieved, with conscious assistance, on low-medium doses of 3-MeO as a benchmark for the experience I aim for through sober means. I might well be doing it wrong, though! I certainly wouldn't call it 'advanced.'

Yes, almost certainly. I can't recall if anyone else here has also experienced the 'unconscious' redosing phenomenon as I have, but there have, clearly, been several cases of 'vacant' holes, which I believe to be by far the most hazardous. It also seems that mobility (and in some cases even higher functionality) isn't necessarily impaired during the amnestic periods. The margin of error in dose between "buzzy" and "vacant" is hazardously small, in my view, again reminiscent of 3-MeO despite being markedly less potent.


kakti your speculation on that mechanism is interesting and I'd like to do some further reading on anticholinergics following it.

I do think that the profound memory loss caused by this substance could certainly could lead to unfortunate incidents taking place. It is certainly the most memory-wiping drug I've ever experienced at hole dose levels, and that in itself seems quite dangerous. I've also noticed that when I come out of the hole I feel as though I am completely sober, but when I try to watch a film or TV show, I find the story utterly impossible to follow, in a similar way that I cannot follow narratives when on hexylamines. Last time I holed in diph I tried to watch the new Game of Thrones episode immediately after having come out of the hole but had to give up after ten minutes as I couldn't make sense of it, even though I could have sworn blind I was stone cold sober. Interestingly, a second attempt to watch the episode two hours later was just as fruitless and again I had to give up. It's as if that once you emerge from the hole you continue to be quite profoundly dissociated in a way that's difficult to recognize, perhaps because the hole is so extreme that the after effects seem very mild in comparison. This illusion of sobriety clearly has the potential for mishap.


However, in terms of redosing, my personal experience is that I have not felt the urge to do so after having taken a hole dose. I feel almost like I do following a breakthrough on 5-MeO-DMT - that it was a wild and slightly scary ride that I'm in no hurry to repeat. I've done four full-on holes on diph and not redosed after any one of them, or felt the slightest urge to do so. This is in marked contrast to my hexylamine use where jumping straight back into the hole has very often proved to be an irresistible temptation.


Of course that's just my experience - I wouldn't be at all surprised if others start caning this stuff while in the state I have experienced on the way down from this drug, which as I have said tends to make me feel much more lucid and rational than I actually am.

As per my first post on this thread really, I absolutely blitzed my way through a gram of the stuff my first evening with it barely knowing what I was doing. I had the presence of mind to weigh out the later doses and do them in, which I would have found near impossible on MXE by comparison, I always struggled to get a redose together on that till I was well past the physically disabling after-stage but was still a very long way from rational at the time.


I was convinced I'd had a steady stream of emergency services through my bedroom that first trial, it seemed so very real. I was confused to find my front door still locked and intact coming out of my last voyage somewhere and actually ended up ringing 999 to ask the emergency services operator if I had in fact had a visit from anyone as I stood on my doorstep and gazed out onto an empty street I was sure would have a whole array of police, ambulance, fire engines parked up waiting for me to show my face. I think I almost expected to see police marksmen taking cover behind parked cars. Somewhat confusing conversation with the operator I can't quite remember except for my last apology for troubling them cos I was *'on drugs and need to go to bed'*. Not really something you should say to someone responsible for despatching the police to your door probably, but no harm done. 8)


So, yeah, unconscious redosing, bizarre behaviour, I reckon it ticks those boxes nicely. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) Saying that I felt a whole lot more rational on subsequent trials, probably because I was aware that madness was lying in wait if not careful and treated it with a lot more respect. Those lacking such caution might well get bitten on the arse with it.

^ I have been wondering what exactly you experienced on that first hole of yours, you had hinted that there were 'visitors' and you were fully immersed in an alternate reality. Now I know, thanks for sharing! It seems possible, as you suggest yourself, that the hallucinatory (perhaps even delirious) aspect of the trip was a response to the shock of holing so deep without expecting to - perhaps it was so hard for you to get your head round the fact that the drug was responsible for such a radical consciousness shift that your mind started inventing other scenarios, in this case a medical emergency situation. 


It sounds proper frightening - were you scared or too emotionally detached by the drug to feel that way?


I on the other hand was pretty sure 150mg was going to hole me hard because of your report - thank god you posted because I was going to go for 200mg after my disappointingly weak 100mg trip, and probably would have gone to crazy town like you did. Not that it necessarily would have been a bad thing, I don't mind getting pretty out there. Still, hyper-real hallucinations of paramedics probably isn't first on my list of things I want to experience.


It's very much the old 'set and setting' mantra - seems like if you're expecting a hole on this stuff you'll get one, but unless it takes you by surprise it's going to be pretty content-free, as you've found on your subsequent forays Seph, and as Dioxy and I have consistently found.


I must say that anyone who complains about not being able to "find the hole" on methoxetamine, and 3/4MeO-PCP should probably have a pop at this. At 150mg oral the hole will come and find you. Whether or not it's a hole you enjoy comes down to (as has been discussed above) whether or not you like dissociative holes for their own sake, or whether you're looking to find anything down there in terms of hallucination or euphoria or delusion or anything else. It's an empty hole - perhaps some clever chemistry bod can tweak the molecule to fill it with something.


Sorry, I feel I'm hogging this thread a bit. Dissociation is one of my deepest interests, largely because I had a terrifyingly full-on dissociative experience (consisting of the feeling of 'thinness' I described in my earlier post) when I was a small child without the aid of drugs, and it's a nightmarish puzzle that has haunted me throughout my entire life. Discovering drugs like this that recreate that experience are therefore fascinating to me to the point of obsession.


Okay, I'll shut up now. My second gram is used up and I'm done with experimenting with and talking about diphenidine for now, although I will continue to be an interested lurker on this thread. Yeah I know I said that before, I'm sticking to it this time - unless anyone has a specific question for me of course.

What - are from that patent? Sorry - don't mean to sound fatuous but I take it you mean THIS RC is from that patent?


I hoped some chemists might look at the QSAR (which is in patent) and suggest stuff? I mean, it's beyond me but the relative position of the phenyl & the N is just the same as in PCP.


They have the o-Cl (like K) and the m-OCH3 (like MXE)


Of course, the above might mean nothing - I'm not a chemist; I just had to file the patent in the place I work which is how I cam across it.

If it isn't a patent, then just some research that shows affinity for some involved receptor. Another pretty wild example of that is RH-34, hardly gets more experimental than that - or irresponsible, I'm not sure which.

Ah-7921 is from a patent - even the 'dreaded' Wiki page has a link.


RH-34 is a good example where no human animal trials took place. At least a lot of animal models of AH were carried out.


IS RH-34 now an RC? Shame on them!!!!


I just wanted an expert to tell me why this compound (is active, sent sample) is nothing like PCP.


Please indulge in my innocence (and plain stupidity).


Many thanks,

CC


BTW - F&B talked a lot about it - but not an explaination for this.


Expired patents - still lots of x10 potent analogues in the series (also expired patent)

I'm not completely sure why, but I'm getting some more of this tomorrow. 


Like many others here I was compulsively fascinated by its profile, even though it isn't what I'd call a 'recreational drug.' It's too interesting to let go without one more trial a few months down the line (ie now). Also it's dirt cheap at the moment, though I fear that is for good reason. 


Anyone else have any further experiences of it since our discussions?

Dizocilpine actually seems to follow a similar pharmacophore and gives us a clue as to the binding conformation of this drug. In fact it looks like the piperidine is perhaps a bit too large of an N-substituent. 1,2-diarylethanamines (diaretamines?) probably go a bit further, Wiki says the pyrrole-lefetamines were safer (presumably pyrrole replaces benzene).

Yeah, they were less neurotoxic, but I believe that was simply a result of their reduced effect on monoamine release. I don't think there is much reason to think that it's connected to dissociative activity, so by just increasing the dissociative effect instead of the stimulant and opioid effects you'll be reducing the neurotoxicity.


Yeah, I definitely think you can consider this a ring-opened analogue of dizocilpine.  Dizocilpine has such high affinity because it has what may be a nearly perfect conformation.  Diphenidine is almost certainly binding in the same way, but it has to assume a conformation close to that of dizocilpine first.  Since that isn't the energy minimized conformation Diphenidine wants to assume, it will assume the necessary conformation less often, thus less affinity.

That's very interesting information chaps, especially in light of so many anecdotal comparisons to MK. No wonder it is such an odd dissociative. Can any of you make any guesses about ROA efficacy from the structural data? Oral and insufflation have both been mentioned but with no obvious consensus either way, except the implication that it might be lipophilic and not water soluble.

It will be lipophillic as freebase but the salt forms will be water soluble.


In terms of bioavailability, I would guess that it would be similar to amphetamine and be active via oral administration without a problem.

Pre-requisite information: 1mg etizolam consumed 1 hour before experiment.


+110mg oral

Come-up 40 minutes - 60 minutes

A gradual, pleasing ascent from +20 minutes to +60 minutes into a state that gives me nostalgic (but subtly unique) throwback to some of my experiences with MXE. I would call this feeling closer to MXE than it is to 3-MeO-PCP. Clear dissociative head-buzz, a feeling of calm. An urge to communicate ideas and initiate discourse. An urge to re-connect with old friends. I'm experiencing a whole-body buzz which I find really quite pleasurable. Anxieties dissipated, stresses put to one side. There is a 'vacancy' to the experience again, but one that feels safe and somewhat comforting. Breathing is slow and heart rate normal, perhaps elevated slightly. Some possible motor co-ordination issues, typing takes more concentration than usual.


+1hr insufflated 50mg. The initial insufflation is quite comfortable, but the sting grows and fades over time. I wouldn't call it overpowering, but I'm not fussy about stingy compounds. It does however seem to close up the sinus in the nostril so would recommend only using one nostril to avoid looking like a drippy drug addled nose-fiend. *Edit* Weirdly, this seems to have changed since I first experienced this drug. I'm not sure why. The substance also looks a little different in recent batches. */Edit*


+1.5hr waves of dissociative pleasure, with a feeling of the head being encased in a buzzy metallic structure. This might read as f it is unpleasant, but it isn't. It 'breathes' around the head and body, akin to the experience of physical dissociative 'shifting' which I'm sure my fellow aryl enthusiasts will relate to. Peaceful. I feel as though I can allow myself to indulge in the experience if I want to.


Oddly, one of the experiences I would describe is one of empathy. I feel a union with the people I'm talking to online.


An overall positive experience so far. Definitely an interesting compound which I feel I may have dismissed too quickly before.

I've got 2 grams coming in. Old K, 3-MeO-PCX and MXE dog here, so I'm pretty excited. 3-MeO-PCE put me in a very depressive state for days though - someone here said it was more of a mediative drug. I found 3-MeO-PCP to be MXE with more stimulation, less dissociation & longer duration -  but definite dissociative mind set and euphoric properties ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Possibly. We don't know *what* makes dissociatives enjoyable. Dizocilpine is self-administered by rats even in the presence of dopamine antagonists, but humans dislike it.

To confirm: This is a powder to take, if you don't want to recall what you are gonna do for the next 1-2 hrs, or so. 


I just watched a full length movie under the influence of 120 mg of Diphenidine, and *poof*. 

I literally just skipped through it again, to find that** from 40 minutes in, and all the way to the credits, I was a blank**. I didn't do anything, just - well - dozed off, with all senses and signs of life there. I had a conversation with a friend afterwards explaining what happened, and I repeated myself, he said. Positives? Great mood lift. And the fact that it tastes like very very bitter chemistry dissolved in water. 


I can't imagine what this stuff would do to people out in the open, at festivals or the such.  


Scary. This is going to the trash bin.

In retrospect: I over-estimated the above statements.

The last post I made was written whilst coming down from a unexpectedly intense reacton. The mindset I found myself in, had hints of mania, moodlift and slight paranoia. At first it really felt like I had been part of a "Russian memory wiping experiment" or something like that. 


Diphenidine is not that bad. It is scary how steep the dose-response curve is, though, and it is indeed capable of putting you in a blank state, with no recollection of what was going on.


What I am trying to say is: Diphenidine is indeed a NMDA-antagonist, because it brought a completely unexpected antidepressive effect the following days. But it is not for the broad crowd looking for a legal Ketamine- or Methoxetamine substitute. 


To make myself clear - I am not under the influence of anything, but a cup of coffee at the moment, so the bias is next to none ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Tried this stuff not long ago, so thought I'd add my own thoughts. I had a somewhat odd reaction to it in terms of my metabolism, I see most people here and others I've spoken to have found this stuff to come up fairly quickly and last 4-6 hours, while I experienced a rather drawn out 4 hour come up (very little going on til around hour 3-ish), and then an additional 3-5 hours of trip after that depending on the dosage. No others posts I've read or people I've talken to who've taken it have experienced this, and I think it's due to my weird eating patterns (due to stimulant use and such).


I feel as a result I might also be needing slightly higher dosages than others. 60mg was very very light. 115mg was strong though I'd imagine needing approximately 130 for a "hole" type experience.


Personally I very much liked the experience. It was more similar to MXE than to Ketamine though had its own character. Due to the similarity to Lefetamine I'd expect it to be some kind of a stimulant too, probably dopaminergic rather than serotonergic like MXE. 


If you're a dissociative enthusiast then I'd give this one a try, just approach it with an open mind, don't go looking for MXE v2.0 or Ketamine v2.0 but look at it as what it is - Diphenidine, and you should have a nice experience.


Be careful with dosing this one since as mentioned the dose response curve is extremely steep. 


I've yet to experience the hole yet since the weird slow metabolism I've had lately with this and other drugs makes it hard to fit into my schedule unless I plan well in advance, but I'll be sure to post back when I do.


I'm not sure if this was due to the particular batch I got or if Diphenidine is always like this but snorting it was pretty dire and really blocked up my nose, sublingual also burned my tongue and left a residual taste for hours. Stick to oral with this one I'd say personally. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Does this stuff have the potential mania and stimulation related effects that drugs like 3-MeO-PCE and 3-MeO-PCP show? Because I don't react so well to them especially as an after-effect. It may be related to me having contracted a propensity to anxiety and tolerance to the NMDA action of dissociatives but much less tolerance to their other pharmacodynamics...


I'm aware of the void or blank state that you can get with dissociatives (the more potent the more possible, it seems), but what are pleasant and useful effects of diphenidine? The bodily sensations, things like feeling wobbly / shimmer-y?

I know someone else I spoke to who tried this said it was most similar to 3-MeO-PCP (I think it was 3 anyway not 4) out of the dissociatives they've tried (which include 4-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCP, MXE, Ketamine, Ethyl-norketamine and this) so take that as you will. I found this stuff to be stimulating and there was some mania when it came to typing for me, I was typing to people for hours on end excitedly about everything that came into my head, but that's not an unusual thing for me to do on any remotely stimulating drug honestly so it's hard to accurately say.


I found I was able to sleep on this stuff though, almost too easily on lower doses, to the point that I've missed an entire experience by falling asleep on the peak because it wasn't strong enough to keep me awake - so I'm assuming that means this stuff is quite a bit less stimulating than some other dissociatives. I was always able to fall asleep on Ketamine too but on MXE or DXM there was no chance of that happening until the very tail end of the experience.


One pleasant thing about this for me was that it gave me this very still sense of zen and purity, I would use words like "white", "clouds", "mountain tops", "angelic", "pure", "crystalline", "clear", etc to describe the experience if that gives a better idea of what I mean. Ketamine also has this sense of cleanliness to the body high but the mind high is so warped with Ketamine the words would be more like "shpdslkjdkla" :D


I'd go more along the lines of shimmery and pulsating light more than wobbly for what it's worth. I have a feeling at low-medium doses this could be attractive to those who've investigated dissociatives for anti-depressant effects, since I find until higher doses this is more clearheaded than other dissociatives I've tried, so there'd be less of any sort of impact on routine to those not looking for full on dissociation but wanting the after effects. At lower doses the experience itself is not unlike the typical dissociative afterglow too.


On the flip side if we talk about downsides I think the same potential for delusions as with MXE and the MeO-PCPs is definitely there, as there was a sense throughout the experience that this was something big and important and I was some grand powerful individual conquering unforeseen grounds - an egocentric tendency I know all too well from playing around with MXE ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) (but hey this is the guy who goes around calling myself Jesus.. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png))

Posted up a report for 115mg here: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...ed-with-dissociatives-Caught-up-in-the-clouds](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/689747-(Diphenidine-115mg)-Experienced-with-dissociatives-Caught-up-in-the-clouds)


As far as the name goes, I've only ever heard it referred to as Diphenidine, think the full name was left in from the original ADD thread, unsure if it's necessary in the title or not but no harm keeping it since Diphenidine itself is fairly new.


---


**Update:**


Just updating to say I tried this again last night at 140mg last night with a 20mg snorted top up, one of my best dissociative experiences to date, pleasantly surprised. I did quite enjoy it at lower doses but the other posts here and elsewhere made me think higher doses weren't worth exploring - turns out I was wrong :D


I'm not sure if I can write a report since a lot of the experience has already vanished from my memory, and more is fading even as I type this. I didn't "hole" in the traditional sense of lack of contact with/recognition of my body - though when I closed my eyes I would float and fly past these HD textured walls, some were like rugs or made out of cloth, others liquids or jelly - it was real enough to make me unable to tell if my eyes were open or closed at the time, but when I'd open them I'd quickly snap out of it and be in control of my body just very dissociated. It was also highly introspective and gave me answers to some big questions I had pertaining to some decisions I should make in the near future.

The more experience I have with this one (and the more tolerance), the more I enjoy it. There were an initial few sketchy experiences, but much of that was, I think, 'user error.' It's a very interesting dissociative, though I'd still be cautious of recommending it to anyone without the necessary 'previous' with similarly eccentric dissos... Things can get pretty crazy without a lot of warning, and controlling it isn't far from an art form lol.

Can you elaborate on how one learns to use it and what kind of errors one would tend to make before becoming more experienced? That should be very helpful information for others. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I will do my best, Solipsis, but my information will have a natural limit to its use because of such a range of tolerance... 


Most users seem to report an ideal dose as '110mg.' That is a recurring number from (mostly) non-tolerant experimenters. Under this dose, not a lot is reported to happen. I've never had a particularly noticeable effect under about 90-100mg. 


However, this depends quite a lot on what we mean by 'happen' - At sub-hole doses, this drug is a very smooth, potentially very subtle dissociative. Anyone with a predisposition to anxiety will, I think, notice its therapeutic effects more clearly. It takes *at least an hour* (oral) for onset, and the strength of the effect appears to increase markedly between 1 hour and 1.5 hours. 


The entire duration of the drug is very long, and the onset-peak-comedown trajectory is very comparable (IMO) to 3-MeO-PCP. The effects are a little different, but the timing is similar. After a couple of doses in the afternoon, it's not unusual to still be feeling the calming, 'fuzzy' dissociative headspace the following morning. 


In my own tests, I find that an initial dose followed by a top-up dose about 2 hours later is the most effective routine. I start with 120-140mg, wait to feel the first plateau at +1.5 hours, then prepare another 120-150 (depends how daring i'm feeling) for consumption at the +2 hour mark. What follows is several hours of gradually increasing waves of dissociation, pleasure, physical 'buzzing' and the familiar disso body-shifting (when lying down, particularly). Positive and motivated thought processes replace sober ones, and a feeling of slightly egocentric mania. I find that I have access to repressed emotions, and creativity and the desire to communicate are enhanced. The effect profile shifts over time, and about 4 hours after the second dose I am left with a feeling of profound calm, a 'zen' stillness.


This state is maintainable, but the balance is a very careful one. Much like 3-MeO, a small mis-step on dosing or timing sends the user into a unique confusion, bordering on ego-death, and retrograde amnesia sets in very hard and without warning. This state can accompanied by panic, and I have found that in more recent experiments, I recognise it starting, prepare myself into a safe position (in bed, audiobook on, comfort zone restored), and allow the feeling to take control for a while before subsiding. It's enjoyable, as long as you are safe and stay calm. The state itself is inexplicable other than in terms of other heavyweight dissos - an utter sensory mis-match, unable to understand writing or speech, a feeling of eternal uncertainty.


In several experiments, I've found myself coming round sitting in bed listening to a book, with absolutely no memory of how I got there. Clearly I've taken responsibility for my impending loss of control and taken myself into a safe place, but it takes a while to piece that information together, and the exact sequence of events is completely lost.

is there any binding affinity data published for this one yet? I am very interested in trying MK-801 but can't seem to find it anywhere and if this is a "pure" NMDA antagonist like it, then it could be worth a shot.

Yes; see [European Patent 0346791](https://www.google.com/patents/EP0346791B1) which contains quite a lot of data on the drug and its enantiomers.

Do any of you's snort this?


I feel 'good' off 35-40mg but I wanna feel euphoric. I pushed the dose the other night and had 3 doses of approx' 40-50mg, but ended up blacking out on my bed whilst listening to music, so I can't rememberif I got any euphoria or if I even holed.

I'm definitely interested in the anti-depressant properties of this compound, since I've had trouble acquiring MXE and 3-MeO-PCP lately. Hopefully will be sampling soon.


Oh and, anyone tried the i.m. route?

Interesting Drug


Had my first experience with Diphenidine yesterday. I am a big fan of dissociatives and have had extensive experience with both Ketamine, MXE (my beloved, and much missed), 3-MeO-PCP and with some of the less-notable ones that came out after the MXE ban. As previous people have mentioned, Diphenidine lacks much of the *sparkle* of the arylcyclohexamines but that's not to say that it lacks merit or doesn't warrant further exploration. 


I've not written up 'proper' trip reports here (i.e. with exact timings) as I wanted to experience the drug without thinking too much about the process, but here are my first two trip reports.


Height: 170cm/5'6"


Weight: 73k/160lbs/11.5 stone


Drug interactions: No alcohol, nicotine, cannabis or other drugs were consumed during both these trips (apart from the benzos taken post-trip)


*PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM AN EXPERIENCED USER OF DISSOCIATIVES. THE DOSAGE I TOOK MAY WELL BE TOO STRONG FOR NOVICE USERS. IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TRY OF A DISSOCIATIVE PLEASE EXPERIMENT WITH MUCH SMALLER DOSES FIRST*


1. Saturday morning. Dose: 110mg, measured carefully on scales. Timings are approximate.


00:00-01:00 Took about an hour to come up. Around the hour mark I started to have the familiar dissociative 'buzz' and wandered around the house switching off all electrical devices (much to my long-suffering partner's annoyance). Was full of energy and love/compassion, behaved in a generally silly fashion and had a romp about with partner, nothing sexual, just goofing about.


01:00-02:00 From hour one to two the effects increased - lots of crashing, deep thoughts and positive insights into things (time will tell if they were insightful or just mad ramblings). It became almost overwhelming at times, I'd definitely recommend that you stay indoors the first time you do this, with someone around just in case. I put a lot of things in order and had some excellent euphoric insight into an upcoming piece of work. Heartrate and energy levels definitely increased.


02:00 It seemed to peak around the two hour mark, feeling somewhat like a 'big drop' ride in an amusement park, one minute you're OK, sitting at the top of the slide and the next - bang - you're emploding. Lovely for me, but could be unnerving for others. Dosage will play a big part in this too I'd imagine.


02:30-03:30 The effects subsided, leaving me energised and warm, empathic. Around the 3.5 hour mark I was in the baseline area, functioning OK, went to the shops and could converse with strangers with no problems. Still very energised, made a delicious evening meal but found it hard to sit and watch TV as there was lots of residual energy. Around the 5 hour mark my energy levels dropped and I found myself quite flat and tired for about an hour, but this soon passed.


2. Saturday night. Dose: 110mg, measured carefully on scales. Timings are approximate.


I like to take a risk so decided to drop another dose that same day and go out on the town with friends. I'd explained to them what I was doing and they were going to keep an eye out for me. **PLEASE NOTE: THIS WAS A BIT IDIOTIC. If you're going to do something daft as this make sure you've got good mates with you**


00:00-02:30 Took a lot longer to come on this time. Possibly to do with the fact that I'd dosed earlier that day, but around the 1 hour mark I started to have some gentle tinglings, these grew gradually for an hour or so. I was mildly intoxicated, quite amusing and a bit energised and silly but nothing too notable. In retrospect I probably could have dosed up to 130mg+ but that could have gone nasty. As a side note, I have a physical condition that leaves me in near constant pain and I'm happy to add that Diphenidine has analgesic properties.


02:30-03:30 I had about an hour of disintegration, crazed/jumbled thoughts. Could walk around OK but focus was hard as everything kept breaking up into molecules. I still managed to play a round of pool in this state, however couldn't distinguish between spots and stripes ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Despite moments of joy it certainly missed the sparkle and wonder of the arylcyclohexamines and at times, even in the middle of the chaos state, I found myself a bit bored and uninterested in the process. Perhaps due to my having taken it that morning, who knows...?


03:30-04:30 The disintegration lasted longer than it had earlier in the day, and I was still dipping in and out of it up to four and a half hours later, having been picked up and taken home by my partner. I then stayed up and energetic for many hours to come, heart rate very accelerated. I also found myself quite low in mood during this time, quite self-critical and negative about my behaviour during the night (although this is nothing new, it's not something I experienced while on arylcyclohexamines).


To counter this negativity and also to try to slow myself down with a view to sleeping I dropped a couple of benzos (10mg diazepam and 2mg Etizolam if I remember correctly). This then lead to a beautiful couple of hours in which I was full of love and empathy, for myself and for the world, while floating in a state that I can only describe as feeling like Kubrick's 2001. This was an amazing couple of hours, and I will certainly look at adding benzos towards the end of my next trip with Diphenidine.


Although on its own this drug has merits, I think what will be very interesting is if some way can be found of adding some 'zing' to the Diphenidine to give it some more warmth and glow. Its interaction with benzodiazepines was fascinating, and I will certainly be taking these again towards the end of my next trip.


The next time I take Diphenidine I will test out some sort of empathogen/entactogen at the start, for example MDAI, to see how the two drugs interact. 


Happy emplosions to all!

^ For what it's worth I've taken 6-APB on the tail end of Diphenidine and didn't really enjoy the mix, it just seemed to get a bit uncomfortable, sedated me during the 6-APB come up, and made it take a while for the 6-APB to really kick in (which in fact was precipitated by me taking another stimulant anyway), feeling more like an SRA or something up until then. I suspect though this is due to Diphenidine being a DARI (at least I think it is.), so counteracted some of the dopamine release.


That said I don't know, it might be better the other way around, rolling first and then taking the stuff.


Also, we have a Trip Reports forum especially for these reports, you should post them there ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) you can then link your report here in the Big & Dandy threads if you want people here to see it. I'll move your report over for you but first, do you have any specific title you'd like the report to have? If not I'll just use "Interesting Drug". ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

That'd be great thanks, and the subject is fine. I can't imagine having enough oomph left at the end of a Diphenidine session to get a lift out 6apb but would like to hear how you get on the other way around. I'll post with any MDAI combo information when I can.

My favourite thing to do with ketamine is to put as much as i can possibly fit up both of my nostrils, usually 400mg+ (i have a stupid high tolerance), switch the lights off and put on an anime of some sort to watch. I was just curious if anyone has used Diphenidine to a similar effect? I just love the way you get sucked into the film and can feel your body morphing and what feels like it melting into the bed. With a tolerance like mine im expecting i'll probably have to dose about 150mg if it is even possible to achieve a similar sort of effect?

Just received a g of this and tested with 5mg sublingual. Interestingly enough felt early stages of disassociation, similarly to my early usages of MXE (which I hugely enjoyed - and greatly miss as a 'legal'). My favourite combination of MXE was 30mg MXE/ 60mg MPA - awesome combination that I likened to Alka-Seltzer for the brain "Plink Plink Fizzzz", loved it - anyway, after getting through 15g of MXE and probably twice that of MPA in a little over a couple of months, I decided it was probably best not to try sourcing any more quality MXE and eased right off the MPA too..... So, here we are, a few months down the line and my favourite party combo of the moment is MPA/5Meo-DALT, which again, I very much enjoy. Round to the question - has anyone tried Diphenidine / MPA yet.... or is anyone aware of any reason why this combo shouldn't be tried ? - any useful feedback verrrry much appreciated - cheers m'dears x

Generally ppl advice is around 30mg for the first time.

I suggest 20mg, then if after 30/40min you feel it can get harder, you can redrop another 20mg.


Or, seeing you are experienced with mind altering substance, you can take directly 50-60mg, eventually taking bump each hours or 1,5 hours.


Don't forget "allergic" test (snort 2mg, wait hours, snort another 2mg, wait hours, and if nothing detrimental happen you can begin the MXE experience - remember/tips : allergic reaction occurs after the second contact with a substance)7


EDIT : major mistake I was thinking you was speaking about MXE :/ ... I confused tabs opened on my browser, was thinking I was on the MXE thread... Ive no idea about a starter Diphenidine dose, sry...

hey guys... So first trip report here don't know where to post been with the site for a good few years maybe, I arrived in london at the very begining of the whole mephedrone epidemic.


26 years old, medium body, done every drug you and I’ve ever heard of and some i stil have no idea what they were e.g. i boiled a trumpet shaped flour in some milk once before my graduation… my mate said it “sounds” pretty cool and it turned out to be…………………………..datura. i still managed to make the graduation but spent the next three days short sited blind, psychotic and very envious of my brothers guitar playing skills (he plays keyboard).


in a nut shell k is my thing… i love all dissociatives but a bag of s-isomer k my bedroom and a very warm duvet in which will spend the next 6 hours acting as my cave that i float through on my magic

k-arpet


my 500 mg package of dephenidine arrived in the mail, and the past 5 days went a little something like this


day1:


10: pm 5mg oral (allergy test) nothing but a strange taste on the tongue best way to describe is a slightly acidic/overly bitter taste (kinda like the days when you’ve run out of toothpaste and all thats left in the house is bicarb soda) this may seem a little odd but if you can get past the taste its actually a very effective type of toothpaste)


…….waiting waiting waiting... nothing… (i hate the allergy test day… but understand its importance ever since my first bag of mdpv which i was told was just like a pretty strong meph)


day 2:


6:am wake up as i was planning on losing no time had a rooibos tea and 40 mg insulated. this lead to nothing but a sore nose and maybe a slight 20 minute little itty bitty tingle of what i remember the come up of 5mg’s of 3-meo-pcp orally with a little confusion 

(honestly I’m putting it down to 20 mins of what I’m 76% sure was nothing but complete and utter placebo possibly due to the roibos tea).


10:am 60 mg bombed…. turns out that placebo might have been a little summtin’ summation as i was getting increasingly tingly for about 45 mins from 10:45 am in which i peaked for 20 mins and to be honest it was absolutely nothing special just tingles although i do forget roughly 6 hours of the day….?


day 3:


7:00 wake up i rectally plugged 85 mg with a dog feeding syringe. from this i got the whole tinker bell dust/slight itchiness in my brain kinda thing you get from that exact moment when you realised you’ve over done it with the 3-meo pcp …. if anything it kinda just reminded me of, the very tail end of when i once I’M'd 100mg of mxe (i grew a very fast tolerance to this lovely chem)


I’m sure theres some of you that can relate to my experience in the early days of mxe 20-30 mg snuffed had me in my room peeking out my window at all the helicopters flying around and th fire truck that had pulled up next door only to wake up the next day 70% sure it all did happen but as the week goes on the statistic seems to turn to 96% sure it never actually happened (keeping in mind 84% of statistics are made up on the spot).


day 4:……… 80mg I’M’D… little rush nothing spastic although i only did it 3 hours ago, wrote this report in 20….. maybe 20 - 1h 45 mins and my washing hanger is actually a very comfortable looking man reading todays news paper with his legs crossed…. thing s its 3:30 in the morning and its defiantly not a man it is my washing


thats my trip word for word…. i have forgotten a lot of whats going on around me but have completely kept it together as in absolutely functional… 


**** edit *** it is now 12:00 pm and i have just got back from filming profile shots of some “less appreciatd workers around london”e.g. firemen, policemen, street cleaners and ambulances.


i don’t know why i went out to do it or how the idea came to me but it is as it is and the footage is quite good….. this is the strangest experience i’ve ever had in my life


all in all i dont know what to say about an IM ROA with this substance i know now i was silly for doing it but it's done now and ive learnt some kind of lesson im sure

captan cucumber,  any side effects from IM'ing this? A lot of people like that route for MXE/Ketamine, but I'm guessing you were something of a guinea pig for IM diphenidine.

Dear God don't sniff this stuff.  Tastes bad, smells bad, hurts nose, hurts throat, hurts gums, hurts lips, hurts skin around nose, made me photosensitive, then stuffed up, then runny nosed.  Plugged made me feel like I needed to poop. It doesn't dissolve in cool water, either, has to be heated up, so don't even ponder shooting.  Oral route seems the only way to go with the sample I had, but I can't guarantee the purity of the stuff I tried.

Has someone tried vaping/smoking this? 


It's freebase, melts fast and gives a clear smoke which obviously smells and tastes horrible. Cant say for sure if or how aktive this roa is and I'm in fear of toxic pyrolysis byproducts.


 So i only tested very small amounts. Oral is definitely the best roa and I've had very good experiences with this chem. Unfortunately I seem to have a huge tolerance to this only from d-methadone (now) and mxe years ago.


 I also find it quite stimulating so sleeping was impossible on a high dose and i never came near a hole. But you can stare at one spot with a total blank mind for hours. This is something I never experienced before. Not one thought came through my brain but i can clearly remember it and could get out of it any time if I wanted to. Never lost control but would advise on a sitter for unexperienced and high dose trips.


If you ever asked yourself what is the most psychotic mindstate you can get yourself in... just mix it with deliriants. I would love to write this experience down but I just cant find the words to describe it.

Anyone tried low dosing this yet?


MXE at low dose (10mg say) was my favourite. Nowhere near enough to hole, just chill dafuq out on my bed with tunes and talk to people.


Interested to know if there would be any similarities given it would only be minor affects.

The dose is a little high and the stuff is far from tasteless, right? So I don't think so. Sounds a bit like a cliché.

Don't take this if you have a seizure disorder or are withdrawing from benzos. 5-HT aktivity from piperazine? 

125mg light experience and the next day mindfuck from 140mg. Metabolite accumulation? 

Very strange chem. Vendor claimed it's freebase


Sorry for double post. Can't edit on my phone. ***fixed***

On the 140mg dose i had the most disgusting feeling of my life. 

It felt like i was but in a microwave and every atom of my body was vibrating and heating up.

At the same time i thought blood was leaking through my veins bloating up the skin of my arms.

Sounds stupid but not in that state of mind. Have to correct that it is easy to loose control on a high dose.

The dose-response-kurve is extremely steep! Stick to low doses without a sitter. I learned it the hard way but I have a very low seizure threshold. Had one only from low dose srri.

I just got a 1g amount of Diphenidine from a good supplier online.

I have a history of Ketamine and MXE use from both low to high doses with k-holing extreme, even had a genuine NDE (that was on PCPy).

I want to contribute to this site and will do so by forming a trip report.

I'm just preparing the setting first.......

Coming soon. (about 1 hour)

I took 0.5mg Alprazolam 6 hours ago (about 8am) on an empty stomach. Since then ate a good meal with high-ish fat content.

I am a non-smoker of both cigarettes and of weed, and I have not had an alcoholic drink for over a week.

So there is no alcohol/cannaboids/nicotine in my system, just the 0.5mg alprazolam


OK,,, here we go!


T+0.00 swallowed Diphenidine 62mg in a gel cap with a glass of water.


T+0.02 mild nausea and bowl movements (placebo excitement i guess)


T+0.21 nausea gone and bowel movements over... no noticeable effects


0.40 feel bit tingly but not much. going to walk onto roof of apartment and look at the view see if things feel or sound different


0.45 verging on head visual shimmering, things seem extra focused, think pupils dilated a little, skin feels like fits well over my muslces... might like to swim or something

Wanted to add that this seems to be (for me at least) a drug best not taken in a bad mood.  Others have commented that it lacks the mood lift and feelgood factor of ketamine.  Although really one should never take any drug in a low mindset, I think a lot of us do, and ketamine or weed can lift a blue mood sometimes, for some people.  But a recent trial of a low-ish dose of this (100mg) plugged after a rough day just had all the characteristics of dissociation but no buzz, and a weirdly dark and lonely sense of emptiness and despair and total loss within the universe.  Never had anything like it even on huge doses of ketamine.  It sort of reminded me of a bad diphenhydramine trip.  May have just been my brain, of course, but I'd approach consumption of this one with caution if you're not feeling totally chilled.

Morning after... 1.0mg Alprazolam before bed yielded a normal sleep. Woke up with a mild headache. Mood neutral. Want to get that initial oral dose feeling back. Will that be possible so soon after (1 day). Feel that 100mg oral would be better than the 62mg oral i did yesterday. Scared that active metabolites or residual material lingering in lipids/fats in body will add to any gel cap oral drop i make now. Any comments fellow friends? PS: the insufflation of 60mg last night left a painful effect which persists into the morning. I will strongly advise against insufflation RAO for Diphenidine. Normal Ketamine or MXE are fine compared to this stuff, although to be fair this Diphenidine is milder on the nose than 4-meo-pcp.

I read about metabolite accumulation from a chem that is similar to this one. But that guess was probably bullshit.

100+40mg (1hr) felt a lot weaker than 140 in one cap.

Dark, lonely, emtiness is a good summary of effects akerman. It also reminds me of diphenhydramine but not as trippy and scary.

First time this was sampled very little was remembered.  Sampled again and combined approx 75 mg with up to 250 mg ketamine insufflation, with alcohol and weed.  I was sure I'd put lights out at 1.30am and remember settling down for the night thinking it had not really affected me.  When I woke in the morning my computer was fully powered down (both PC and monitor physically switched off).  Yet when I checked my internet history (to be sure) my youtube favorites playlist had been going on it's own from about 1.30 until about 5am.  Since I would never jut sit through that playlist video after video like that, I can only conclude I was sat in a fugue state for about 4.5 hours and remember precisely nothing from it.  No wonder I was so tired the next day!


It's dissociative like a 'too much' dose of mxe, where you can lose hours (but possibly remember some bits like a dream), but without any of the pleasurable head-sledging feeling you get when a traditional arylcyclohexylamine kicks in.  It's like MXE without the fun.


Also insufflation (my favorite ROA) is not recommended, VERY painful and made they eyes water.

Okay, first post, so bear with me.


I weight out 100mg of Diphenidine into a gel cap and a 40mg booster for if needed later on. I had fasted for 24 hours before I tried this as I really felt that I needed to empty my system of a lot of shit.


After an hour or so, the 100mg didn't seem to be doing much at all, or so I thought. I decided to just swallow the 40mg cap and see what happened. Very slowly, things started to get a bit crazy,


Over the course of four hours, I more or less sat contemplating why I had done this to myself. Music had turned completely metallic and I was hearing very strange noises. A conversation I was having with someone over facebook was freaking me the fuck out  because I didn't realise the other person was drunk - I thought I was literally going insane. I distinctly remember being too afraid to go to the bathroom, despite none of my flatmates being in.


What really seemed to happen was how I imagined being "dissociated";  I didn't feel like I was in the room or house that I lived in. My room seemed to be twice the size it was before and I spent most of the time curled up in my bed incoherently posting on the internet. I do remember feeling like a giant then a midget  very instantaneously, which was very strange. I'm just hoping that there will be no negative side effects after this. 


The last half hour was fucking awful. I felt that this was it - I had finally reached a point of mental retardation. Nothing made sense. Words just... didn't work. Everything on facebook seemed 'pre-generated', much like the post of a spambot or something. I had this sort of dread as I slowly realised that everything was in fact pretty coreherent, I just couldn't make much sense of it. I felt like a different person, as if I had been 'reset' or something, which was scary. This invoked quite an emotional response in me. I more or less just rid it out, as it reminded me of a typical psychedelic trip in which you think that it's never going to end.


Eventually, it ended with a complete pop. I was back in reality. I felt that I had visited multiple different realities, mainly of paranoia, but I came out of it feeling fully refreshed. It's so hard to explain, but there was no 'comedown' or anything; I simply just, returned to normal. I felt great. I felt like a snake who had shed its old skin, mainly due to getting out of my sweaty clothes and putting on my bed time gear, sitting down with some water and chatting with a few friends on IRC. No after effects whatsoever. I took some benzos to get to sleep after a while, watched a movie and just let it do its magic.


Anyway.,. I don't have many experiences with Ketamine or other Dissociatives but I would... sort of recommend this to others. I do feel like the experience as a whole was very positive, but at the time, part of it seemed like a scene from Trainspotting. I probably seem like an idiot right now, but this was my thoughts on this.


'Nuff said, I feel good now. Real good. I'm glad I tried it.


Apologize if this isn't the best format of a 'trip report' per se, but its a good description on how it made me feel.


Thanks for listening.

After three consecutive trials with this novel research chemical I have found it to be very disappointing. I started very small and only had treshold dissociative effects before going to bed. Even while typing this I have doses as much as 90mg, 70mg and another 70mg over a course of 4 hours. I don't think I'm getting anything from this chemical whatsoever. Can anyone give me some advice? This has been the second time I tried this, last time being two nights ago. I even did a bit of 3-MeO-PCP earlier this day, but this didn't contribute to the diphenidine.

Might just be you need more, many have needed 100mg+ but work up slow. Only tried a small amount but interesting compound.

Third trial right now, I had a climax for about 15 minutes during which I felt like I was going upwards on a rollercoaster, I had massive euphoria and before this peak experience it reminded me of DXM in low doses without the icky body feeling and a much shorter come up and duration. I think I already have a bit of tolerance and that I might need 150mg to achieve some sort of "D-hole". I think I'll try again on Thursday. I also think the 3-MeO-PCP afterglow contributed greatly this time, because I was still experiencing heightened sense awareness, increase in empathy and sociability. I feel really great right now. Not noticing any of the emptiness reported by others. I feel compelled to further confirm the consensus that this is not a replacement for arylcyclohexylamines, but it is a real nice pacifier with a lot of potential.


This stuff is pretty awesome. I don't have any trouble remembering these experiences, but I can't speak for higher dosages. It's also not as addictive as MXE or other dissociatives. I'm gonna write a summary of my experiences when I finish whatever I have left. I only ordered 500mg of this stuff, so I'll probably put it online sometime soon.


Edit: I also think the weed contributed a lot. I feel that tingly body feeling coming up again. Really interesting stuff! Can't really compare it to anything else, and I have used DXM, ketamine, MXE, 4-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCP and nitrous. I guess I can kind of relate it to DXM and MXE a bit, but it's still fundamentally different.

I posted somewhere else about this so in short after several experiences:


No idea about dose- not much to total amnesia unforgiving, have yet to get it right


Amnesia  occured several times in different ways,  one I dosed oral and I nasally expecting little effect whilst watching southpark. Dont remember end Apparently I needed help undressing and getting to bed. Blank


At parent house after dose I was found in kitchen "awake but no one home" in kitchen. .  Scared non user apparently was told to turn off xbox and get sleep.  1hr later I came back downstairs and asked "did I sleep walk earlier? " told above.  Vague recollection.  Think passed as sleep walking but caused concern


Dosed low (not sure exact but lower then previous) to pass time while baby sitting house while plumber working.  Thought fell asleep on sofa.  Vague wake up as he left hours later cant remember conversation but he may totally busted me and mocked me. He txt partner out of concern pretty sure I was not thrashing around or anything.  Passed as being on "medication" 


Dosed at night. Music on. Dark trip. Sinister evil force and, well,  blackness.  Listening to orb willing light /good trip. Total absence glow. Redosed 6am remember cuddling up to partner.  45min music.  Partner wakes. Has bath. Hears me shouting name: used to me but runs to aid was on floor. I remember coming to and thinking I had a stroke...then lack of drama made me think I had been in coma unknown time scale.  Another 30min to grasp reality.  Told had been "posturing" earlier in night. Sat upright staring into space making sounds.  No memory of that....exhausted slept day with after low similar to mxe but it took above to achieve. 


From above risks are obvious.  


Unlike mxe (so far) had not suffered rise in blood pressure and pulse which was mxe side effect on occasion past a&e visit come down feeling stupid and discharge self to leave bed to someone worthwhile


Snorting hurts. Really.  Like first bump eyes watering. After kinda gets used and easier.


Most falls out nose either immediately or when nose streams. Good prep essential to crush fine. No idea dose due to re dosing


Oral possibly more active and not too slow onset. But it keeps on setting! Waves of effect So really hard to predict from min to many hours


Despite Redoses and miss judgement no real binge feeling like mxe. Maybe longer duration and amnesia takes out of you.


No wayd I'd do this socially


At no point have I taken more total 300mg in divided doses. Estimate 30-80mg depending tolerance after above. 


Be careful with this

@missimoo: Too bad about your more negative experiences. I do agree with you this can be quite difficult to manage in social occasions, but I haven't tried this out yet. I might test the waters with methoxphenidine in the future.

I dosed orally about 2pm guestimate under 100mg, had nice drift to music onset 20min max, drifted of to sleep snug and rather pleasent woke fine (had to be "on call" last night so sleep deprived maybe 2hr max.


if you can get the "goldilocks dose" (not too little  not to much) was nice head space. no universes opening up or visual trip,  but for a fan of this type of drug, it was a pleasent float wrapped extra snug still mind (like meditation)


I think to get the most of this one, you have to learn the hard way what the dose range is for yourself,  start small, build up over a few different trips and work out your own range..I had two small "bombs" of 50mg one 20min after first. it was no mind altering experience, but it ticked the right boxes as far as im concerned. bed, headphones, music.  its no way MXE or K or even DXM its unique at the right dose to just feel. <<nice>> ...its easy to get nothing or a black out. but if you hit the spot. i'm a fan.  (note like DXM i think redosing has minimal effect have at least a couple days to clear head. ive had another 100mg 2hr ago with no noticable effect compared to earlier. 


steep learning curve but if no alternatives it is what it is. learning the hard way and the potential for people to mass "the new MXE" will lead to disaster in clubland etc. it needs respect and caution

Now that's a broad generliization right there. Have always been wanting to get my hands on MK801, especially with that one glowing report on erowid about it, seems like it could be exactly my cup of tea. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) rats


So, IV anyone yet? One guy on another forum said he'd prefer oral over iv, but he didn't go into detail. With dissociatives, I really like to be "instantly gone", completely incapactitated, just torn out of this reality altogether. Really sounds like I'm gonna be enjoying this one a lot.


I'm really not in the habit of taking drugs recreationally anymore, and I'd like to limit myself to one or two experiences with this substance. I just don't have any intentions to start very low and then work myself up until I find the sweet spot over five or more trials, especially not with how quickly tolerance builds to dissociatives. The less trials to figure out that spot, the better. Would therefore prefer to get a rough estimate of a proper IV dosage before I first try it.

that is a really tricky question to answer..... i would say that there are similarities between them all! and at the same time it is not the same as either mxe or 4-meo-pcp , IMO

i'd say diphenidine is a kind of MXE light ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) in such a way as with the diphenidine, at memory loss stage, you are still fully physically able to move around and interact with others, i found this to be the case. watch out for that memory blank hole. also the mxe feels bit dirtier/chemically in its later stages... wheras with diphenidine did not feel so dirty (skin/nails/face). but MXE easy to insufflate, diphenidine and 4-meo-pcp v.bad drip and nose pain.

Kinda conflicting these reports... I was hoping for a full sensory shutdown that I can get with (im/iv) ketamine or very high doses of phencyclidine, but which MXE and 4-MeO-PCP have not been able to supply (while I just can't get to that level with DXM due to side effects). I really don't care for euphoria in dissociatives at all, in fact it was very bothersome for me in the case of MXE. Just leads to me doing stupid shit. That's why I was kinda happy to hear about this one.

crOOk; Well yes, the come up on orally injested diphenidine did come with euphoria although mild, much less stimulating than mxe. in my experience benzodiazepines can fuzz the experience out (ground you down) to remove a lot of the desire to get out on the streets and do crazy shit and fall over etc etc. could you be one of the first to dare to go in head first with 200/250mg oral? Maybe the benzo's counteract dopamine reuptake inhibition's effects but allow NMDA antagonism to take place. I do not know.

Nah I will try around 150mg oral. I can usually take pretty hefty dissociative doses despite abstinence (e.g. I tried 4-MeO-PCP @ 1g rectal), but I don't want to black out. I won't combine the stuff with anything, most certainly not benzos since I've done some of the most stupid shit of my life on GABAergic drugs (both benzos and booze). It's just gonna be: door locked, key hidden, handy battery removed and hidden, facebook account removed from firefox profile. Those should be sufficient safety measures. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


No dissociative except for MXE ever caused me to have desire to communicate with the outside world. Well if ketamine and pcp ever did, I was pretty coherent by the time I did so. On MXE I was just behaving like a total fucking moron.

I posted this on another forum but I figured I'd post here as well just to add to the collective experience.


    So I thought I'd share my experiences with Diphenidine since nobody seems to be talking about it. This is based on four experiences, never higher than 100mg. I'll probably push the dose a little but the magical 150 people talk about seems like a bit much for me. To start this one has almost no euphoria or sense of well-being like many of the arycylohexylamines. WIth MXE you can take a low dose and just relax, enjoying movies and music. With Diphenidine everything seems distant and uninteresting. This is one to take for exploring different states of mind rather than recreation, I'd be very surprised if there was any affinity for SERT or DAT.


    The time frame of diphenidine is what makes it difficult, it has a slow come, about an hour without feeling much of anything. Then out of nowhere it all comes on at once. A very powerful dissociation characterized mostly by sensory distortion, a strong buzzing in your head, and amnesia. This state, which I'll talk about a bit more later, lasts maybe an hour tops before devolving into a pretty lucid but still altered headspace. The entire experience resembles a dissociative punch in the face, the rapid onset of the peak leaves you disoriented and confused, combined with the amnesia the second less intense portion is spent mostly wondering what just happened. 


    Now when I say amnesia I don't mean it in the sense of benzos or alcohol. You can still remember what you were doing and what happened but you can't remember your thoughts, feelings, or even being there really. It feels like you blacked out for about an hour and someone else made up some memories for you to fill in the gaps. It's the kind of drug where I could see myself staring at a wall for 45 minutes without even realizing it. Some people have described this as being similar to a type of "zen state" where you have silenced your inner dialogue but comparisons to becoming a zombie or having a lobotomy also come to mind.


    There are no CEVs like MXE or Ketamine but there is the capability for some horrendus sensory distortion. I'm sure all of us are familiar with the "stuttering" effect that can happen with high dissociative doses, the stuttering on diphenidine was to the point where I couldn't tell what was to my left and what was to my right at times. To summarize your senses become a jumbled confused mess and your subconscious seems to take control almost like an emergency autopilot as your conscious mind fails to connect with even your thoughts or emotions. 


    Next I want to talk about the "buzzing" I've experienced. With many drugs there is an associated physical feeling in your head. Diphenidine is one of those, the only way to describe it is a buzz especially since there is a literal buzzing sound which I can only assume is some kind of tinnitus warped by the sensory distortion. This buzz is very similar to the one that I get on 4-MeO-PCP but beyond this superficial aspect the chemicals are nothing alike. Infact the headspace doesn't resemble arylcyclohexylamines at all, when described they both sound like dissociatives but they *feel* completely different.


    Finally I want to mention the combos with MXE I've done. The "boring" phase after the peak tends to last for a really fucking long time and so sometimes I've found myself taking bumps of MXE during it to spice it up a bit. Both times have resulted in a very deep but lucid hole from relatively small amounts of MXE. The hole resembles some of my early MXE holes but without the overwhelming confusion. The visual aspect is more muted than a standard M-hole, there are no otherworldly visions conjuered but there are some rather abstract psychedelic CEVs.


    I hate to simply reiterate what everyone else has said before but this is something worth taking a handful of times at most. It certainly gives you some interesting data points in the spectrum of altered states and I would be VERY interested to see it's binding affinities, but it's not one that I can see myself coming back to for mind blowing experiences and certainly not one for recreation.


    I will give it one or two more tries, maybe 110mg and once again mixed with noopept. The second phase is a good launching point for other dissociatives but I also found the mix quite physically draining.

This stuff is complete mind-fuckery. 


My dissociative experience: Methoxetamine pretty much since it came out but don't do it too often anymore, I've done quite a bit of Ketamine, and tried 3-MeO-PCP and 4-MeO-PCP about 5-10 times each. 


I tried this last night, about 4-5 hours after 5mg of 3-MeO-PCP, some sake and 6 beers. 


Since I have a tolerance to NMDA antagonists I figured a good starting dose for myself would be 95mg. My girlfriend and I both came home from a party and figured we'd end the night off trying this as we'd just received some this week. We both did the same amount and both have close to the same tolerance towards NMDA antagonists, but her body reacts differently to it as she gets motion sickness/dizzy from mxe/ketamine fairly easy, whereas I have pretty much never in my life felt dizzy or sick from either.


We both parachuted 95mg at the same time, and as I swallowed mine I noticed that it tore open a bit because I could taste it instantly (tastes like pharmaceutical vomit fyi).


I don't remember a whole lot after that other than this morning I have slight memories of being in my house with a lot of different people (even though it was just us two), and being very confused and mind blown. 


My girlfriend barely felt anything other than it kept her up for two hours. But from what she said, 5 minutes after taking it I started feeling it, and I just sat on my couch for 2 hours with a blank/terrified look on my face, completely unresponsive. I apparently noticed her and would look at her when she talked to me but I wouldn't say anything back. That's pretty normal for me when I K-hole, so I suppose I would kind of relate this to a K-hole. After 2 hours I became sober enough to start saying what the fuck and holy shit over and over a again for what she says felt like half an hour; but she says her time perception was a bit off as well from taking it so she's not quite sure. 


But as I started slowly coming back to reality I was talking about how I figured the world out, but couldn't explain anything beyond that. She asked me what happened but I just kept saying what the fuck, and holy shit. She went to bed once I started to seem kind of normal as she wanted to make sure I was okay, and apparently even after she went to bed she could hear me saying what the fuck and holy shit in the living room. 


That's pretty much all I know. All I remember now is having my mind completely blown at some point last night and feeling like I wasn't even in my own house, but somewhere else in the world with random people. It felt almost salvia-esque in a way. Normally I can't remember anything when I K-hole so I would relate it more so to Salvia than Ketamine for myself personally.


This is straaaaaaange shit. And that's coming from someone who is very used to strange things lol. I basically fell right off the end of the world.


Will be trying again at a lower dosage; I'm thinking 80mg should be less confusing. Also I'm assuming that the tail end of 5mg of 3-MeO-PCP and alcohol had an effect on my trip so we'll see.

3-MeO-PCP seems to have some very intense interactions with other dissos, and with psychedelics. Its total duration is much longer than 5 hours, so it will still have been very much active - I've found it significantly deepens Ketamine, MXE and Ethyl-Ketamine experiences in a very unique way, so I expect it had a profound influence on the Diph hole. Very interesting mention of the combo, Mung. Wish I could still get hold of 3-MeO to try it myself!

**IV 50 mg diphenidine and 50 mg MPA**


My first post on Bluelight (been reading for 5+ years now) is a kind of a warning or small trip report. I had a really scary experiece with diphenidine today. I've used most the common dissociatives (Ketamine, MXE, Nitrous, 3-MeO-PCE, 3-MeO-PCP and ether) a lot and feel familiar with all of them. Today - under the influence of various benzos and on 45 mg mirtazapine daily - I decided to IV 50 mg diphenidine and 50 mg MPA in the same shot. 


Not a good idea. I went straight to dissohell, I instantly lost connection with with the normal world and my body transformed into extremely weird forms. The left arm, where I had just shot the mixture transformed into a wavy shape, double its normal size. Heart rate doubled and I got scared shitless that I had some kind of reaction to the shot mutilating my arm. As I feared for my life I instantly called for an ambulance, slurring my name and address. By the time the paramedics had arrived I had regained control of myself, so they just monitored my vitals for like half an hour while I returned to a sober state and explained the pharmacology of diphenidine and MPA. After a while my vitals returned to expected from the MPA (high BP) and I refused to go to the hospital for overnight monitoring (despite adviced to do so from the doc they called), as I now felt I could handle myself and actually felt quite sober. After a long talk with the paramedics about changing my habits they finally left. Scary as hell though, I'd advice all of you not to go beyond 25 mg diphenidine IV and don't mix it with substantial doses of MPA. 


Just a warning. Stay safe!

Glad you're ok. Have you tried other roas for diphenidine? If you have, how do the doses compare between them and iv for you?

Phew, good to hear you're alright gaba. I had a scary experience (high BP/temp/seizure) with a high dose of Methoxphenidine recently, and that on top of your report suggests to me that these two compounds are dangerous to combine with other dopaminergic drugs. Diphenidine seems to have significantly lower affinity for dopamine sites than the Methoxy derivative, but your report has further convinced me that serious care must be taken when combining either of them. Hazarding a guess, I don't think your experience had much to do with your ROA.

I've tried intranasal, rectal and just swollowed a gelcap with 50 mg. Sort of idiotic to IV dissociatives as the "hit" can be quite scary even though I enjoy the hit from ~25 mg Ketamine or MXE IV. The reason I did 50 mg IV was the very pleasant and managable experiences I've had with 20 mg diphenidine + 25 mg MPA + 15 mg zolpidem IV and hence had an urge to try i higher doser. Being on lots of benzos yesterday made me reckless. I should have threaded easier, like upping to 25 mg dipenidine instead. As pointed out earlier it appears to have a non-linear and quite steep response curve.


Rectal and nasal ROA definately has a lot lower BA, longer and softer onset and seems a lot safer.


I came to think that I almost when into hypertensive crisis, with a BP of up around 120/160 for about half an hour (I closelý watched the monitor the whole time). No actions where taken to lower my BP though other than me taking 40 mg propranolol after the paramedics left. They admitted that I had a lot more pharmocological knowledge than them, so I didn't talk to them about taking propranolol. The doc they called apperently did not recommend any measures to lower my BP, despite alarming values. I should also add that my EKG looked like a childs drawing for the first 10 mins of monitoring, but then returened to normal sinus rythm. BPM was 80-90 all the time (as expected from the MPA and maybe mirtazapine and me being scared), but that wasn't considered a significant problem by the doc or paramedics. I should add that my oxygen saturation never went lower than 97%, and I had no chest pains or breathing problems. 


Big thanks for the caring words, black53 and Dioxy, despite not knowing any of you from before. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

gabafish, so how stronger would you put iv as opposed to other roas? 4x oral? 


>Being on lots of benzos yesterday made me reckless.

Believe me, I can relate to doing stupid stuff on benzos :D

Yeah, in my experience the BA appears to be about 4 times higher IV compared to oral. Just a rough estimate though. The time of onset is a big factor to take into consideration here aswell. Those of you whom have ever went IV with Ketamine or MXE knows that it hits hard and strong within a few seconds after injection and the same goes for diphenidine. Oral adminstration on the other hand will creep up on you and reach full effects at about T+60-90 minutes. The experiences are fundametally different.

I'm after the potential long term antidepressant (i.e. ketamine therapy) effects but I'm fascinated by altered states and will explore this one. I have no experience with dissociatives other than DXM so I started very cautiously, a vaped allergy dose a few days ago and today vaped ~5mg, then insufflated 20mg. I took 15mg mirtazapine last night so that could have combined with the effects. About 1 hour after insufflation I got some confusion and a buzzing in my head. I was looking for euphoria, but didn't find any. There was a bit of dysphoria instead. My plan was to gradually ramp up the dosage on the condition that there was no dysphoria or scary effects with that small dose but there was definitely a hint dysphoria there. I'm not experienced with dissociatives, but I am with other psychedelics so I know how a hint of dysphoria can turn into a full blown spiritual ordeal and I try not to avoid that kinda thing unless the time and place is right. Its only been 2 hours since insufflation and the confusion and dysphoria is gone completely. I'm wondering now if adding a benzo will counteract the dysphoria and confusion. Since its christmas I'd like to be able to socialise. With that in mind, I'm guessing I should just leave this stuff alone until after christmas but in reality I'm gonna end up doing it, are there any drugs to take to make things more manageable (as in make it easier to function). Benzos really help with other kinds of psychedelics, but I hear combining them with NMDA antagonists causes blackouts. Thats obviously dose dependant though, if anyone here has experience with combining this with BZ agonists like alprazolam or etizolam can you share your experience. 


Also, how does diphenidine compare to DXM? I've had good experiences with DXM doses of 200-400mg (bad experience with doses above and below that) and found that it interacts with trazodone, taken over 24 hours after trazodone theres profound synergy (my theory is that the longer lasting SSRI effects of trazodone are responsible for the synergy), but under 24 hours after there are bad interactions like dizziness, disorientation and nausea. I have never tried it after mirtazapine.  


BTW: I should mention that microdosing with this stuff does seem to be providing a significant mood lift. Only done it twice so far though, too early to make any conclusions, might just be the placebo effect.

Alright, I'll take your advice and halt this experimentation until the time is right. I've heard many people say that low doses of K and MXE are relaxing so I took that to mean that they don't render you unable to function, similar to low doses of serotonergic psychedelics. I take it I have the wrong idea, thanks for filling me in.

I'll probably push the dose a little but the magical 150 people talk about seems like a bit much for me. To start this one has almost no euphoria or sense of well-being like many of the arycylohexylamines. WIth MXE you can take a low dose and just relax, enjoying movies and music. With Diphenidine everything seems distant and uninteresting. This is one to take for exploring different states of mind rather than recreation, I'd be very surprised if there was any affinity for SERT or DAT.
> 
> 
> 
>     The time frame of diphenidine is what makes it difficult, it has a slow come, about an hour without feeling much of anything. Then out of nowhere it all comes on at once. A very powerful dissociation characterized mostly by sensory distortion, a strong buzzing in your head, and amnesia. This state, which I'll talk about a bit more later, lasts maybe an hour tops before devolving into a pretty lucid but still altered headspace. The entire experience resembles a dissociative punch in the face, the rapid onset of the peak leaves you disoriented and confused, combined with the amnesia the second less intense portion is spent mostly wondering what just happened.

> 
> 
>     Now when I say amnesia I don't mean it in the sense of benzos or alcohol. You can still remember what you were doing and what happened but you can't remember your thoughts, feelings, or even being there really. It feels like you blacked out for about an hour and someone else made up some memories for you to fill in the gaps. It's the kind of drug where I could see myself staring at a wall for 45 minutes without even realizing it. Some people have described this as being similar to a type of "zen state" where you have silenced your inner dialogue but comparisons to becoming a zombie or having a lobotomy also come to mind.
> 
> 
> 
>     There are no CEVs like MXE or Ketamine but there is the capability for some horrendus sensory distortion. I'm sure all of us are familiar with the "stuttering" effect that can happen with high dissociative doses, the stuttering on diphenidine was to the point where I couldn't tell what was to my left and what was to my right at times. To summarize your senses become a jumbled confused mess and your subconscious seems to take control almost like an emergency autopilot as your conscious mind fails to connect with even your thoughts or emotions. 
> 
> 
> 
>     Next I want to talk about the "buzzing" I've experienced. With many drugs there is an associated physical feeling in your head. Diphenidine is one of those, the only way to describe it is a buzz especially since there is a literal buzzing sound which I can only assume is some kind of tinnitus warped by the sensory distortion. This buzz is very similar to the one that I get on 4-MeO-PCP but beyond this superficial aspect the chemicals are nothing alike. Infact the headspace doesn't resemble arylcyclohexylamines at all, when described they both sound like dissociatives but they *feel* completely different.
> 
> 
> 
>     Finally I want to mention the combos with MXE I've done. The "boring" phase after the peak tends to last for a really fucking long time and so sometimes I've found myself taking bumps of MXE during it to spice it up a bit. Both times have resulted in a very deep but lucid hole from relatively small amounts of MXE. The hole resembles some of my early MXE holes but without the overwhelming confusion. The visual aspect is more muted than a standard M-hole, there are no otherworldly visions conjuered but there are some rather abstract psychedelic CEVs.

It certainly gives you some interesting data points in the spectrum of altered states and I would be VERY interested to see it's binding affinities, but it's not one that I can see myself coming back to for mind blowing experiences and certainly not one for recreation.

This is quite close to my experiences with this: I Really liked this stuff - certainly didn't seem dysphoric - I can see why some would say neutral maybe: I've had quite valuable experiences off it. It's definately distinct stuff. Orally takes a good hour to kick in and the trip lasts about 2 hr although true baselines a bit further off although I wasn't bored, I'd cetainly like to do more and explore it a bit deeper. There's definately some buzzing which superficially reminds me of ibogaine and makes me feel I'm heading somewhere magic. It doesn't seem to have the amnesia of ket (better recall)nor be as disabling .As to DXM - only tried that twice & I found this better.

Chances are there are no long term antidepressant effects. A lot of NMDA antagonists are great for rapid relief of depression, but there have never been any studies for maintenance of those antidepressant effects and judging by my own extensive dissociative use and what I have seen from others, you might get even more depressed. Careful man.

I'll tell ya, its a strange one alright. Stranger than MXE. Someone above asked about etizolam, I can confirm this is a good combo. I hid all substances in a hard to get at place but I had no desire to redose. I don't think I was physically capable of it, I had this important task that I needed to do before 3:33. I don't really know what that task was, I was trying to figure something out or solve some kind of universal mystery or something. I think I solved it, I believed I had uncovered the meaning of the everything and it all revolved around the hole and the number 0. I snorted 80mg over about an hour period.

Lol dude, you had me when you said "This is substance is even weirder than PCP". Not that I wasn't gonna go for 150mg tomorrow anyway, but now I'm really fucking optimistic about this substance. The harder the mindfuck the better, when it comes to dissociatives.

I just had 100mg orally to test the waters, since I'm pretty drunk and would probably just puke my guts out and not remember a thing on a full blown dose. Really looking forward to tomorrow morning. Gonna cut off my internet, hide my cell phone battery, turn off the lights and then... who the fuck knows? probably just complete and utter boredom! 

Ketamine, PCP and MXE have just stopped being weird for me, despite me having been off them for years aside from single doses every few months. If I go and give myself a good and proper iv dose I just won't remember shit. 

Really hoping for diphenidine to allow me passage to The Twilight Zone once more.


edit: nothing noteworthy going on at t+70min @100mg oral. this is over 7h post xmas dinner, 3h after which 150-200ml 114proof whiskey were consumed over the course of 4h(occasional drinker, 90ml ethanol, less than 2l beer -> buzz with slight disinhibition). maybe some euphoria, but that could just be due to being very excited about this novel chemical. there should be SOMEthing right? if this doesnt turn into anything, ill go straight for 180 oral 2moro morning. (no disso use for months except for 80mg iv+30mg rectal mxe about 5 days ago, 90kg bodyweight, male, 9yrs of episodic->sporadic k/pcp/dxm/mxe experience, in that order)


edit2: so... any more anecdotes about iv experiments? any info appreciated, even external links to 1st hand iv reports.


edit3: at t+80min there might have been something akin to a dissociative come-up/down that never really takes off. a fleeting hint of background white noise and metallic body feeling. could just be the joint i lit at t+60. this surely is nothing to write home about (good enough for a bluelight post though ;P).


edit4: trying to justify that comment about the current uneventfulness being sufficient input for a bluelight post, i google things like jigsaw pieces puzzle (e.g. "puzzle pieces saying"). what im trying to say, when u want to get an idea of what a novel psychoactive chemical has to offer, sometimes the most superfluous post somehow adds to the big picture. so while i dont have anything clever or profound to say (despite there being a strng urge to do so, obviously), its still noteworthy that i find a sense of cleverness in feeling particularly unclever and dull right now. it might be the joint (daily nighttime smoker), it might be the whiskey i had earlier being manufactured on a very small island, it might be the diphenidine playing tricks on my brain at 100mg oral. maybe the barrels used on that island where the whiskey was manufactured are host to an endemic fungus that does something to the booze, something that modulates those effects of the whiskey targeted at our nmdar's. i really cant tell right now, but im still hoping for a massive fucking transient psychotic state tomorrow.


edit5 (im really still in edit4, but paragraphs are great to improve readability of a post!): there have been days in my life where i have perceived myself as a lot smarter than i do now. most days of my life went down like that. i really want to be clever and have profound realizations though right now. booze does that right? i didnt have that much to drink.


edit6 (you guessed it, its still edit4, but a new train of thought) tomorrow i will look down on my naive 1 day younger self. i am very glad im not posting on facebook right now.


edit7: maybe if i iv this, i get an idea of what a stroke feels like.


edit8: t+190min ive been pondering whether it would be a good idea to become a clown or not for what seems like more than half an hour. very promising compound, this one. i can really see some serious enlightenment coming my way, so deep.


edit9: ok wtf, if i can compare this to any other dissociative, id say it feels very close to pcp. i used to get very hard erections every time id come out of a pcp haze and this stuff seems even more seckseh. i wanked like 3 or 4 times and each time was more awesome than the last. the mindset is also very far on the weird end, e.g. ive been wondering if i might have a brain tumor lol. this is exactly that sort of bizarre alternate reality shit that i loved about pcp. becoming a CLOWN?! WTF?! ill give it another try tomorrow for sure and will go for a higher dose. this seems like very very awesome and powerful stuff so far!!! i should mention that i really never enjoyed mxe and dxm the way i enjoyed pcp and k.

I forgot to say that I'm a beginner, I've done dissociatives maybe 20 times in total. PCP, MXE, ket, DXM, they all mind fuck me beyond all recognition. Diphenidine was so strange though, it seemed distinctly different to the other ones. Have you ever tried adding something to make it stranger, like say subbreakthrough doses of DMT or salvia (or both)? Iboga is a mind boggler too, but I'd avoid that since it seems to interact dangerously with all kinds of substances. Subbreakthrough doses of salvia alone gives me a pretty large mindfuck. Smoking a bit of salvia while on dissociatives would be sure to add enhance the strangeness of it. 


BTW why go orally and not insufflation? I tried vaping and it seems to work but I start wheezing (asthma) and need to use a salbutamol inhaler so I think vaping is a bad idea in terms of lung health especially since you need such large amounts of it. You mentioned getting an idea of what a stroke is like. I've overdosed on GHB/GBL a few times, and experienced what ischemia induced cognitive impairment is like. The worst overdose I had (5g or GHB followed by 1mL of GBL, I went to sleep and woke up an hour later feeling violently ill), I had no idea what was going on or why I was feeling so sick, I couldn't remember the way around my own house. It wasn't fun (mainly because of how sick I felt). In less extreme cases like the other day after diphenidine I simply can't think in ways that I usually can. Its not very interesting, just a bit frustrating. Although its interesting to see it occur due to blocked NMDA receptors as opposed to ischemia. The most extreme case of this I experienced was on a salvia breakthrough, I couldn't remember who I was or where I had come from, I felt like I should be able to remember where I came from but all attempts to do so failed because there was a blockage in my ability to think about it, now that was interesting. Interestingly, it says on the wiki page that diphenidine was researched for its potential to treat stroke related brain damage. Piracetam is also used for this, from what I read piracetam if administered within a short time window after the stroke occurs prevents a large percentage of the long term damage from occuring. Whats interesting there is piracetam enhances glutamate activity rather than blocks it. I believe piracetam works on AMPA receptors (its a positive allosteric modulator) though, not NMDA receptors. 


EDIT: Actually no, I put DXM in my list of mind fucking dissociatives but I've never got a profound mindfuck from that. The highest dose I did was 500mg and at its peak I felt a sudden wave of panic and dread come over me, but no dissociative effects. My experiences with DXM were mildly trippy at most. DXM seems to be in a class of its own,  it feels nothing like PCP or diphenidine to me. With diphenidine there was no panic, just this profound weirdness, at its peak my body went on auto pilot its like I was possessed (not in a bad way), my body was performing this task in sync with my brain, that was just after I posted about God being 0 in that live trip report on the shroomery. Mind you, I took etizolam before hand, that always nullifies any fear and panic so maybe this woulda been scary if I wasn't on etizolam. Maybe the etizolam even added to the effects, GABA drugs can cause mind fuckery of their own, zolpidem gives me waking dreams sometimes, and I haven't tried Amanita muscaria yet but I believe it works as a GABA_a agonist. Psychedelic benzo modulated GABA effects only seem to apply to z-drugs though, not the less selective BZ agonists as far as I know.


Anyhow, I'm derailing the hell out of this thread, so I'll shut up now. Looking forward to reading about your trip report with 180mg.

Well I do have plenty of quality DMT around and an awesome telescope opium pipe. I'd imagine this could be pretty fucking crazy. My last trial with PCP+DMT was many years ago and it wasn't very fun, not much in terms of synergy. I don't think I'll throw any DMT in there for now though. I'm at T+45min and shit's coming on STRONG. The hissing sound can be ignored no longer. Louder and louder and louder, it's drawing me in, I'm starting to feel quite clunky. Omg this shit is just what I was looking for. BRING ON THE WEIRDNESS, turn me into a piece of furniture! WHOAM WHOAM WHOAM WHOAM it's got me by my balls. Comeup seems so rapid at T+50min. A screaming vortex of insanity seems to be embalming me. Cover myself in metallic lasagne, bring on the clowns. WHUUUUT i love it. faster faster. chemical lobotomy. this i the tribal vibes, im entering novel territory. so much awesome. the sound, crescendo. booya whoa gta v. im trevor.

I have to express my respect to you crOOk for being such a hardcore psychonaut. Shine on you crazy ass diamond. Have you tried this dissociative+DMT combo with benzos or z-drugs? I find that benzos make everything much more enjoyable. I reserve benzos for special occasions such as this. I tried zoplidem + 5-MeO-DMT once and it was very enjoyable. Good to hear the doors to crazy land have opened up for you. Looking forward to see what you have to say when you're back.

I just hate insufflation. There wasn't any input from users about dosages etc. for rectal and IV routes, so I went for oral (capped the stuff up). I'd also rather not mess with needles too often for health reasons, eventhough it's often by far the best route for dissociatives imho. Not sure if I am gonna try this one IV at all, it is everything I love about dissociatives via oral route already though. 


There's sort of a problem though about this one for me. It makes me EXTREMELY HORNY!!!!!! No other drug has ever done this to such an extent. I guess that could be utilized pretty well with a partner, but I don't have one momentarily and the sexual arousal really kinda draws my mind off the experience itself lol. I just had another 150mg orally btw.


Oh and I'd like to mention that this stuff does not cause ANY vertigo or double vision at all at the dosages I've tried unlike ketamine, pcp and mxe.


Edit: Administered another 170mg later last night for a total 570mg within 13 hours. Have not experienced any side effects. Antidepressant activity seems to be close to that of PCP which has always worked best for me in that respect.


Edit2: I should add that NO DRUG has ever made me as fucking horny as this one does. Not even MDPV. The entire experience was pretty much about wanking and I actually spent some time in the deepest dissociated state booking a hooker for the night, which is really absurd considering the state I was in. I cancelled when I came to myself, but repeated the process during the next dose. I must've wanked around 20 times during those 13h. PCP only did this to me after I came down, here the level of dissociation positively correlates directly with my horniness it seemed. So yes, I guess you could say I experienced side effects.

I'm gonna try this combo next time I get a hold of some quality crystals. I kind of intuitively knew DMT would go well with this, but you don't know until you know. You're likely the first person in the world to have tried this particular combo. I haven't noticed any increase in sex drive but I have quite a low sex drive after using stimulants regularly for a few years. Maybe this compound does have some dopaminergic activity afterall.

I remember reading from someone on a high dose ejaculating on friends furniture. 

Think of waking up after a normal party went to gangbang heaven with this. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I was just about to warn crook that 180 will fuck you up 10 times stronger than 100 and this will be to much for most people but I guess he found out himself.  

This "hole" can feel dangerous or toxic to you even if it's not. To many people have gone to hospital just because they pushed it to far and got scared.  Hide sharp objects and especially your drugs. (Diphenidine. Benzos)

Don't we have a "Ketamine guide for beginner's" somewhere.?

Yes we do, a very nice guide actually. Must've been roughly 8 years ago when I used that to get into ketamine. 

The diphenidine Didn't feel threatening at all at 170, not even confusing, but I'm quite the veteran when it comes to dissociatives. Was just really nice dissociation. I don't think I ever felt uncomfortable on dissos except for my first time on PCP. Well and DXM sides can be awful lol.


That being said, this is definitely one of my favourite dissociatives, right up there with ketamine and pcp (unlike mxe, dxm and 4-meo-pcp). Glad someone else has experienced that EXTREME libido stimulation!!

alcohol and ketamine is a really bad combo. it makes me puke every fucking time, even if i only had 2 beers. we are about to find out if that applies to alcohol+diphenidine as well! 170mg oral diphenidine on top of 4 drinks. cellphone off, bucket ready!


edit: at t+37 there are barely any effects, maybe i feel a tad more dizzy than before.


edit2: didnt puke, nope. all good.


edit3: god this is some surreal shit. redosed again this time and i can definitely say that this is one helluva drug. makes pcp seem like kids' stuff.


edit4: about 23 hours after my 2nd trial (4 doses of 570 total during the 1st, 2x170 during the 2nd), I can definitely say that this is my favourite dissociative. Kicks ketamine and pcp from the throne with ease!!!!

People combining this with etizolam, benzo's or z-drugs sure seem to be asking for an amnestic black hole...


I'm wondering about strong dissociative tolerance, is it more likely for a very tolerant person to get manic effects because there is tolerance to the NMDA antagonism but not to the dopaminergic effects?


And those are interesting remarks by frog in that live TR but such shame that a lot of shroomerites start discussing god...

Aleister Crowley would've adored this drug. This is the pinnacle of mindfuck.


btw, comedown film recommendations: escape from tomorrow, mr. nobody


we filled two full notebooks i think. [edit: well some pages only contained one word since the letters in my handwriting were very large]


for a moment there i thought i had lost my friend to insanity. 5min of intense guilt at the tail end of the experience. i never thought id get that far out anymore. 


this drug isn't any drug. it is THE drug. if u dig mysticism and surrealism and if u dig brain damage (or what feels like such), this is for you!!!!!!!!!!! this isnt just the best dissociative out there. this is the shit! 


FUCK ketamine!


FUCK pcp! 


**ALL HAIL DIPHENIDINE!!!**


does anyone think i should transcribe the notebook?


edit: i am quite impressed at my ability to keep a record of the most striking moments of our "conversation" despite being on 215mg of the stuff myself. this wouldnt be possible on ketamine. but ketamine and other dissociatives just lost the magic for me, they never fuck with my mind like this stuff does anymore, not even if i iv them. couldnt imagine what would happen if i iv'ed this stuff. not planning to lol.

I would strongly recommend this when you start your trials:

-Remove cell phone battery, hide separately from the cell phone

-Remove door keys and hide them

-Log out of social networks and remove saved passwords


I have experienced a strong urge to share what I am experiencing, which could have undesirable social consequences. Aside from that, you will NOT "hole" on this. For me there haven't been any sensations I attribute to holing, visual perception is relatively unaltered, there're no proprioceptic shifting/morphing/falling sensations. Other than that, this stuff has everything I desire from a dissociative and plenty of it. Pure insanity!!!!

my friend said she lived a whole life as my daughter (aka "the green princess") in the first 15min of the experience lol. it got a lot weirder after that. god i hope shes gonna type up the notes. we went over them a few times and disected the events. most definitely the best dissociative experience ive ever had. "you didnt poison me to vivisect my brain, did you?"


after all the shit the rc labs have thrown out in these past years, finally heres one i really fucking like.


i cant stress enough that this is only for major dissociative enthusiasts though!!!!

Nope none at all. My friend asked if she had peed anywhere into the room though lol. PCP seems like kids' stuff compared to this one. Done pcp over 100 times.


I experimented with redosing on every of my 3 trial days and this is what worked best:


Something around 150mg orally for the first dose (optimal dosage will obviously vary), boosted by 1/3 of that at 90min after ingestion. Also, dissolving the substance in water and drinking it works a whole lot better than capping it, even on a full stomach it didn't take more than 30 minutes to kick in pretty hard, while with gel caps it took around an hour.


When I redosed another full dose 3h after ingestion, I ended up in a complete stupor which I did not have any memory of for ~2h, so I guess more frequent but lower dosages after the initial one work better.

For YOU there is no hole because your tolerance is insane. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Without tolerance it's very easy to black out. But don't expect a K hole it's very different.

> — Polytoxic said:

Yeah that's what I'm saying. The expression "hole" has never really been clearly defined. It used to be associated to the state you enter on a breakthrough ketamine dosage, but NOT the dream like state on a high dosage of PCP or the pure blankness I experienced on very high doses of diphenidine. IV MXE supplied something very similar to a k hole, most remarkably proprioceptic sensations (floating, falling, travelling, morphing etc.).


So needless to say diphenidine can take you VEEERY far out there with little to no side effects. To me that state is nothing like the ketamine hole at all though and I doubt anyone else will find many similarities. Also, I perceive my surroundings pretty much unaltered except for the auditory distortions on diphenidine. Coordination seems only minimally affected, since I was still able to listen to my friend and scribble down whole sentences word for word. Remarkably enough, she was also able to remember these sentences word for word during the after effects and could relate them to specific thought during the experience, thereby being able to elaborate on the more bizarre of the statements, eventhough she is a complete dissociative virgin (had 135+50mg).


Oh and regarding my tolerance: In the past 4-8 weeks I administered dissociatives 4 times. Before that I had was using them occasionally, maybe every 2-6 months. I had one episode of daily PCP use for 3-4 months in 2006, but never have used dissociatives on a more frequent basis since then (more frequent then every couple of months). When I last used ketamine I still dosed the exact same amount I needed 9 years ago for a hole. I never had any episodes during which i had to increase my ketamine dosage to yield the desired effects.

I therefore wouldn't say I have any acute tolerance in the classical sense, it's just that the dissociative experience changes over time and becomes more familiar. I felt really comfortable at my 165mg+50mg booster dosage. I don't attribute that to tolerance (there is SOME tolerance ofc though, but to that level of dissociation being more processable for me than it would be to less experienced users. There is a level where I would just black out altogether as well though. I guess you could call it tolerance, but imho it really demands for a different word because it is a different phenomenom than the one that requires me to simply increase the dosage of a drug in order to yield the same effects.

I finally plucked up the courage to try diphenidine and I can see why some people find it scary - total (super)ego loss is something I've only experienced with high-dose DMT (85mg). If you can let go - not fight the trip, it's very peaceful. It does lack the dopamine push of MXE but I hate all stimulants with with a vengeance so it suited me. I think that a more soluble (i.e. snortable) form would be a great improvement so people can control the dosing better.


I haven't tried the 2-MeO derivative and reports suggest it's more stimulating so I may pass.


Just my 2c

i think this stuff is best suited for i.m or i.v to be truthful some thing i will not be trying but it seemed to be talking to last time like ok you hit a wall next step is a needle in your arm


**edit:**

just got my 2 g about 30 minutes ago vaped a nice few lumps noticed all ready even with this sparse use that tolerance issues have all ready a risen strange head ache this time starting to fade now but odd .


also its the tastiest drug ive ever had its delicious but the taste smell lingers its one that just catches you by surprise you just get a whiff  and flash backs . 


back to the foil for an hour or two before heading out ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

foolsgold I'm moderately confused by your post. So you're seeing black fish after vaping a few bumps? Anyhow, I just want to say that pregabalin goes well with this. Replaces the head vibrations with a warm fuzzy feeling. Too soon to conclude though. Wait for that wizard with the beard to come by, he knows whats what.

Yeah I don't know, I actually think I am gonna pass on iv'ing this for now. I'll iv ketamine and mxe, but for some reason it doesn't seem that appealing to iv this one. I guess it's kinda shtronk enough already when taken orally lol.

Yesterday I did 80mg (spaced out over about 2 hours) of diphenidine with 150mg of pregabalin and found the experience more pleasant and less chaotic than the time I did it with etizolam. It was still completely mind warping and confusing but I managed to carry out my preassigned task of watching a youtube hypnotic induction. I cant be hypnotised when I'm sober so I wanna know if it'll work when my concious mind isn't functioning normally. I think it worked to a degree, I need to experiment with it more though. Interesting note: I think I cured my negative relationship with cannabis. I smoked some cannabis at the tail end of the diphenidine and for a good 20 minutes I was very high but not the least bit paranoid, then I remembered that cannabis is supposed to have bad effects on me and slowly things started turning bad until I felt all the psychosis effects I usually do, then I realised that its all in my head and I reversed it again. I tested this out by taking a massive dose and not the slightest bit of paranoia. Very interesting. 


Has anyone mapped out a timeline yet, from ingestion until your "fully" back to normal? Yesterday I thought I was normal enough to go back into the world and I tried to engage in a conversation but found that I couldn't talk. I could think about what I wanted to say, but I couldn't actually verbalise it so I was just mumbling and saying short, incomplete sentences.


**edit:**

Another interesting note: Yesterday after smoking the cannabis, I noticed my mind was rapping, everything I was thinking about my mind was converting into rap lyrics along with the tune. This might be a good substance for music producers, I was hearing rap music I'd never heard before, some of it was pretty good. Weird stuff. Why rap? Why not country music or reggae? Maybe in the future it'll be a different genre. Hopefully drum n bass thats my favorite. All in all, I am really glad I found this substance (or this substance found me). I didn't know if it was even possible to reverse that negative reaction I had to cannabis, I tried to solve it with ayahuasca in the past, and here out of the blue diphenidine solves it for me. It was a profoundly interesting observation because the moment I remembered that cannabis is supposed to make me psychotic, things started turning darker over about  10 minute period until I was paralysed with a sense of terror, but then I thought, fuck this its only myself bringing on this negative state, I'm gonna change it and it worked. It didn't happen instantly, it took about 5 minutes for that paralysing terror to dissipate, and about 20 minutes until I was in a neutral state again. I did multiple tests to make sure it wasn't just a coincidence, after the DP and cannabis had worn off I tried taking large doses of cannabis, then after that tried UR-144 and the psychosis was gone.

Shit I think a batch that was falsely labeled MXE that I ordered through a Chems R Us-approved "trust-worthy" vendor and I am about certain that it was Diphenidine felt like a mild MXE dissociation, but with strange, possibly baribituate-like black outs, or at least I felt like I was kinda blacking out in a stimulating, manic yet strangely enjoyable weird dreamy dissociation, similar to low doses of MXE and Ketamine. 


Definitely wanna order again. Along with some quality arycyclohexylamines: 3-MEO-PCP, Methoxetamine, Norethylketamine (Maybe?..), and if possible 3-HO-PCP or some 4-MeO-PCP. Or PCP, preferably a wet cig, angel dust, clear liquid PCP, or PCP dipped parsley, mint leaves ie Spearmint dipped, or possibly just PCP-dipped nugs of marijuana.

For me, according to my last 2 experiences, the total duration seems to be around 8 or 9 hours, from ingestion to feeling pretty much baseline. After the 4 or 5 hour mark I'm always starting to feel relatively normal again.

 Residual dissociation (slight confusion, impaired motor skills) can be felt for at least 12h for me and those who I know and who have tried it. The plateau seems to be around 2h for me, but sleep usually won't come before 5 or 6h.

May I ask at what dosage range this is and is there redosing involved? It seems I'm dosing lower than you (80 - 100 mg so far) and I haven't redosed as of yet. I agree on the plateau, seems like 1.5 to 2 hours for me. I have (slight) trouble falling asleep even after 8 or 9 hours. Maybe I haven't been noticing after effects till 12h because I've been going to sleep sooner than that. But the feeling after 8 or 9 hours is pretty much baseline to me at my dosage. I should probably need some more experiences.

This might be a good substance for music producers, I was hearing rap music I'd never heard before, some of it was pretty good. Weird stuff. Why rap? Why not country music or reggae? Maybe in the future it'll be a different genre.

I've noticed that the auditory hallucinations evoked by dissociatives tend to riff off of and elaborate on droning or rhythmic environmental sounds to synthesize this mind music, so it's only natural that experiences of this kind lean toward the more rhythm focused genres (dance, rap, drum n' bass, etc.). If you start hearing a lot of aural hallucinations, that's the time to try moving around and orienting your head in different positions while listening to fans, washing machines, air conditioners and the like. They supply the "bass line" for all sorts of music you think you've heard before but, when you really listen, it's clear it's coming from inside your head. It's pretty fascinating. As far as I can discern the dissociatives are creating a mind state where patterns are subconsciously projected onto sources of droning noise that approximate white noise (true randomness), and rhythmic variations within that noise -- such as those the oscillation of a washing bin might produce -- are used as mnemonic cues to users' various memories of professional music, which are then "mashed up" in perception and output for us to hear in our mind's ear. At a bioinformatic level, I think what's going on is probably very similar to the phenomena of seeing animated forms in TV static in the visual modality (and that you can see stone sober if you've got an old television). 


![bubo2.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F_9kj-ndJPMJc%2FS9xL2c1pPhI%2FAAAAAAAAAA8%2FE2npOAXDsHU%2Fs1600%2Fbubo2.jpg&hash=f19925d2116b8512cda613bbdbbbb3e2)


By shifting your head, closing a door to increase distortion, putting your ear to a wall, or whatever, you can effectively re-orchestrate things. And if you listen closely enough and move systematically, you can hear how doing so alters the perceptual "musical" output. I'd think you'd have to be a producer who was extremely familiar with his equipment to faithfully translate this sort of subjective tinkering to an external source in the sort of mental state most dissociatives leave one in, but if you were diligent and disciplined enough maybe something could be pulled off.

I've acquired 500 mg of diphenidine but since I worried my roommate with my shameless display of MXE intoxication last month (who subsequently couldn't resist borrowing some when I was away for the holidays) I'd hate to be found utterly lost. It does sound like a person could use a trip sitter or at the very least it is not like drug use has to remain a secret but I'd like to be able to mind my own business. I guess that's reasonable? Hopefully in a short while I will either have the house to myself or he will be understanding of my little planned adventure.


The static seems like consciousness losing literal coherence, as in: different cooperating circuits are not able to cause resonating brain waves with proper clean efficiency any longer? I think the static is rather the left-over activity than the feeling of the drug tickling receptors... that should seem more homogenous right? In any case to me it always felt like ketamine tickled my brain using a specific wavetable pattern. Kinda like a slightly polished sawtooth that rattles like the one-way turning gear. It is also a sort of synaesthetic translation of the letter K (funny enough) similar to the [bouba/kiki effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect).

I kind of forgot what kind of wavetable 3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCE produced in me but I believe it was more transparent than that.

I start off with 150-170mg. I usually redose 50mg at the tail end of the plateau which seems to be around 90-120min, which will of course increase the duration. Last time I did that sleep came after no less than 7 or 8 hours actually, so I assumed without the redosing (I've always redosed at least once) it should be 5-6.


Regarding the subject off music. Has anyone ever tried listening to Air's "Talkie Walkie" on Ketamine or any other dissociative for that matter? It's such a strange synergy...

Actually discussion about music on dissociatives is moved to the thread especially meant for it: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/653649-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Music-on-Dissociatives-Thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/653649-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Music-on-Dissociatives-Thread)


Not because I am the sandman for vaginas but because the strange synergy you are talking about is fascinating and it deserves to be discussed on-topic. I'm gonna try that track next time I am on a dissociative but for now let's split up discussion shall we? Thanks!

It hurts the nose. Better off making a bomb and swallowing it. Seems to take about half an hour to kick in. Has a very pleasant feeling, the warm fuzzy belly feeling. Does not seem to  inhibit the mind too much, can go around doing your daily business and I don't think anyone would notice your feelings of warmth and inner floatings. However, i found this to be highly erotic. Think it would be a lovely addition to some dirty sex sessions. Slightly disorientating but nothing that prevents the ability to act normal in public so to speak. I have added this to my bedroom collection. My fella also reports the same kind of erotic feelings and sex whilst on this is full of pleasures.


Note: When mixed with a line of ketamine it seems to contradict the path which the ketamine wants to take you and causes a sort of spaceman fuzzbubble. Gravity,no gravity, coming up, wanting to float off, you get stuck in a sort of buzzing no mans land. Would probably be good in a club when dancing. If left to relax in this state seems to get t o visiual holes of ketamine but the intense erotic feeling of the diphenidine...at one point i was very close to orgasm just by laying down watching heath ledger in doctor parnassus heh ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Btw if you plan on doing this, best do it with a friend. It's pretty awesome with other people. If you do it alone, you won't visit other places like on a breakthrough ketamine or mxe dosage. It's closer to pcp in that way, eventhough you can even get into a similar state on pcp, but it's closer to actual dreaming in my experience than the places you visit on ketamine.


I can't believe this doesn't have a larger fanbase of hardcore dissociative users.

Just to be clear: we are not really okay with live trip reports here but we are very happy if you can just share your general notes or opinion on the experience or write a nice neat report and submit it to our trip reports section, and secondly people have advised against taking benzo's because it is very likely to add to the amnestic component which can be tricky whether you are going manic or not. I'd like to redirect you to an IRC channel that is probably a lot more suited for you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I think it is #tripsit


However I very much doubt that you will be able to use a computer if I even remotely understand the effects of this substance..


Personally I have checked with my roommate and he has agreed to be a tripsitter for whenever I decide to try diphenidine. It is pretty rare for me to arrange a sitter because I usually don't need one. But I wanna be careful using this stuff!

Honestly it would have been the most boring drug induced video you'll ever see, i started playing some totally random stuff on my trumpet. Then Gabberred on about who-knows-what or a good hour.....if you like watching paintdry.


As per HR i dosed no more than 125mg in a glass of water this morning and finished the rest of my 250 sample at an undeteermined time this afternoon and am no back to baseline some 6-7 hours later.

I'd right a TR but honestly as soon as the metallic hiss noise entered my earhole i have zero memory.


Luckily i'm a real nice laid back guy so nothing got broke and i just ambled around, the best part is i acccidentally left my webcam on the entire time so i can watch it all back.


As of now i have a real nice afterglow and the whole experience was really positive, head feels like its full of marshmallows and creativity.


I didn't piss about on FB or do any other stupid shit, but aye, my memory of the last 4-6 hours is kind of 'beige' at best


Will absoluteley trying this again again at a smaller dose.


*edit1*


Solipsis i feel like i may have pissed you of a little bit today. If you want 4 mins entertainment link me a youtube track and i'll blow some cool shit over it on my horn.


*edit2*


I also found a verrrrrrry long live recording of things that were happening in the room during the experience,....crayzy shit......

Uploading 2%.....this could take some time. Considering indulging in some Mxphenedine today so could be a act 2 to the sonata.

Honestly can we cut with the slowchat after the blatant live trip report, while I figure out what the deal is with posting such a video. Let's not have this thread dilapidate into a social thread like the incorrigible MXE threads, alright?


I realize diphenidine can cause a pretty rabid stupor but that doesn't make it okay for you to just do whatever we asked you not to.

So is plugging an option for Diphenidine? I see that oral is the recommended ROA and seems to work fine, but since I'm obsessed with the butt these days I thought I'd ask to be sure. MXP didn't seem very suitable for plugging in my experience, had to eject the material violently after reaching about 130 mg (20mg+40mg+40mg etc redosing) and from reading other reports it wouldn't really appear to be any more efficient than oral.

Haha I managed to stay off it for the past 3 weeks. Didn't take any effort. I couldn't do that with pcp (-> non stop use). But then again I've aged 8 years since my last 4 month long pcp binge, have a daughter now and have generally become a lot more controlled when it comes to substance abuse.

I did however redose everytime I took it without having planned it in any of those instances.

Yeah I've had a few nosebleeds myself. Tertiery, alkyl substituted amino groups tend to be alkaline. Turning it into a salt would sort that out, but also probably make it less bioavailable. So vaping it works? I was thinking sprinkling it in a pipe and bury it in ash or herb so not too much heat hits it.

Whoa, things got pretty crazy last night. I tried smoking it, in a pipe and to my surprise it works extremely well. It one point I was somewhat paralysed on my chair, all I could do was sit there and observe. It wasn't a negative experience, just a strange one. The effects wore off pretty quickly. I was actually having a good time while paralysed, but I was wondering what was going on and how I'd gotten myself into this bizarre state. I get sleep paralysis regularly and this dp paralysis a completely different kind of paralysis. I wasn't actually paralysed, its just mental processes that ordinarily direct my body to move were not present. So it was a mental paralysis, not a physical one. 


EDIT: I only loaded 20 mg into the pipe, so I think this ROA is much more effective than insufflation. I'm gonna switch over to this ROA, its far superior. Gonna be careful though, cuz that paralysed state was pretty extreme, I don't know what happens if I go past that. My curiority is peaked though, so I'm gonna try it and see what happens. I was kinda diappointed at the lack of visual and auditory hallucinations, thought that the higher the dose, the more intense they will get but this paralysed state lacked any hallucinations, I was just glued to the chair unable to do anything but stare a the computer screen. There was a youtube video about the human gastrointestinal tract on and my god was it fascinating. I had no clue what was going on, but that was the most fascinating youtube video I have ever seen.


EDIT2: I had my first bad trip last night too. After the paralyis wore off, I loaded the pipe again, this time with much less DP, a large amount of UR-144 (a cannabinoid) and a negative belief I have (the idea of the world being run by a corrupt elite, who control mainstream media) triggered a bad trip because I was listening to a mainstream MP3 track, so I got the idea that there were subliminals in there designed to do bad things and that steered things in a bad direction. First thing I noticed was the bodily relaxation and euphoria replaced with this electrical dysphoria. On the mental side, there was nothing dark or scary going on, just a sense of dysphoria. I took off the earphones and just sat there and waited for it to pass. The paralysis wasn't there this time so I was able to hit the play button on my laptop, and there was a trippy cartoon playing which made the trip take a 180 degree turn. In between the trippy visuals, they get putting in a big 3D, flashing word "EUPHORIA", it was awesome. It inspired me to make a video, designed especially for people tripping. I'm pretty sure it was the cannabinoid that triggered the bad trip. I have a bit of a bad relationship with cannabinoids, they regularly trigger bad trips in me, and what went wrong here is there was way more UR-144 in the pipe than dp, so the effects of the UR-144 took over. In the previous attempt, it was the other way around, and the DP completely overwhelmed any cannabinoid effects. 


dp is an entheogen, theres no doubt about that. Best approach it with respect. I learned an important lesson last night. That we need to actively weed out negative beliefs from our subconscious. For me, thats not so easy when sober because I can't remember them, but in certain entheognic states they come to the surface, and I can see the subtle but profound influence they have on me. With dissos you can kinda isolate and contain beliefs which is pretty cool.

Wow, I just packed my pipe, my dmt and my diphenidine to bring it to a friend, so it'll be out of reach for me, unless I carefully consider and plan before taking it. Now you're telling me I can smoke this shit like pcp?! FUCK! Probably best I get it out of reach then. :D

I can only advise you to go easy on the stuff man. I went overboard with my pcp use before and have seen many people who did so with DXM and it can lead to some serious affective/cognitive/behavioural changes over time.

Does anyone know approximately how long it takes Diphenidine tolerance to go down? eg if I did 100mg of Diph one night would doing the same amount a week later have the same effects or would a longer tolerance break/more of the substance be needed to achieve similar effects? I've become interested into this substance recently and would like to experiment with it more often this year but don't want to fuck myself up by taking it too often for my brain to recover from it or to end up with a massive tolerance so I have to spend a fortune to get high lol. I appreciate this substance is very new to the recreational drugs scene so the answer probably isn't known yet but the people posting in this thread seem to know a fair amount about it so even an educated guess would be appreciated!

NMDA antagonists seem to be the worst of the worst when it comes to long term tolerance.

Its more complex than just linear tolerance, I've experienced tachyphylaxis with numerous substances, and now I can only use those substances once a month, if I attempt to use them more than that they simply don't work at all, and even worse I can mysteriously find myself in withdrawal mode after using the substance only 2 or 3 days in a row. I learned my lesson after seeing this happen with GHB and opiates. Its not that difficult to limit use of a particular class of substance to once every 2 weeks or so. I tried phenibut recently after avoiding it for a year due to a bad experience with tachyphylaxis followed by withdrawal, and it worked. I got the positive effects once again, but this time I chose not to redose and now I'm fine. It took an ass kicking to turn me into a responsible, moderate user of substances. What I'm saying is don't make the mistake of driving tolerance up in the first place. Its so easy to avoid, but so difficult to come back from.

22 years, I can imagine your having some rough times right now. I quit amphetamines after 4-5 years of use, and I'm having a rough time with lethargy, low motivation and restlessness. PQQ, coenzyme Q10, acetylcarnitine, phosphatidylserine, all these things help the brain recover by healing/protecting the mitochondria, I've come up with a huge arsenal of stuff to accelerate recovery, I'll PM you with info if you want. I started a thread about this kinda stuff here a while ago, take a look at my profile to see it.

I've had about 9 years of dissociative experience now and I would advice you to not do them more often than every 1-2 months. It would also be best to write the dates down because your memory can be very deceiving. 

I personally used diphenidine 3 times in december (in ~1wk intervals) and didn't notice a tolerance. I think I went through 600mg throughout a whole day the first or second time, but it didn't take more than 150 or 180 (and a 2h 50mg redose I think) the 3rd time to get me go insane. It's somewhere in this thread. Don't make the mistake or redosing too quickly or too much because it will leave you in complete void over a certain dose. After doing allergy test, I'd do 120-150mg. 


If you do not have dissociative experience, try 80mg (after a microdose of a few mg). I'd imagine a high dose can be quite dysphoric for a first time user. Ketamine is very different in that it produces whole worlds full of visual and tactile sensations that can be explored, while phencyclidine (PCP) is closer to diphenidine and tends to produce a greater sense of confusion, potentially resulting in discomfort. Imagine dreaming of being a 5th grader having to sit through a very long scientific lecture of which you do not understand a word. Seconds drag for hours, you can't do anything productive, you can't sleep it off, you don't really know what's happening to your brain (Am I fried forever? Who poisoned me? Am I crazy? Am I dead? Am I time travelling? Who am I really??). It is an acquired taste. Some people simply do not enjoy dissociatives at all. This one though is most definitely only for hardcore dissociative enthusiasts.


If you are in fact inexperienced with dissociatives I would also strongly advise someone sober with you who can prevent you from doing stupid shit. You could also try smoking some instead, which supposedly works very well. You apparently need a much smaller dosage (20mg were reported). I would work myself up from 5mg. For me the first time intranasal pcp was a horrible experience while smoking it had me hooked in an instant (it is much easier to control use than use of other habit forming substances like opiates, downers, stimulants for most people).

We just don't know. If you were intoxicated when you wrote that, it's all good I guess. If you weren't, make sure you are 100% okay.

Thank you for your comprehensive reply! Until last year my only dissociative experiences had been with ketamine, never had abuse, tolerance or addiction issues with it (though this could be due to its sporadic availability in my area over the past few years rather than my own self control lol). I discovered diphenidine and its MXP variant at the end of last year and was intrigued as the effects I got from them were like no drugs I'd ever taken before. Have had a couple of slightly scary trips from them but at the same time have also enjoyed some wonderfully weird and euphoric experiences with them as well, 130mg of diphenidine with a small redose a couple of hours in produced my favourite drug trip I've had this year so far. I'm definitely trying to be careful with them now and have decided it' not a good idea for me to get into the habit of using them too often anyway, was just curious about tolerance to them as well. It's definitely a very interesting drug though, even if I prefer ketamine for recreational use. Thanks to everyone in this thread who's posted here regularly, I've found a lot of information about this chemical out and greatly enjoy reading about your experiences with it!

Alright fellas, should we say that insufflation of freebase dp is a bad ROA. The freebase burns the nasal cavity for a long time, I don't have any pH strips but I'm pretty sure if I tested it I'd find its quite alkaline. People end up with a uninostril from snorting cocaine for too long, and cocaine is the salt form of the drug, not even the freebase. I'll figure out the pKa of this compound at some point, but theoretically a molecule like diphenidine should be pretty alkaline. Tertiary amines are more alkaline because of the electron donating effects of the alkyl substituents. Sorry for the chemistry jargon, just need to lay it out there. I'm no authority on anything, but I'm gonna go ahead and say insufflation of dp freebase is a bad idea. It should be converted to its neutral salt form, if one wants to go the insufflation route. I could be wrong though, so anyone with more knowledge feel free to correct me.

You're welcome, man. So I see you have a bit more experience with this stuff. You should know that the effects of dissociatives on you tend to change with the number of times you've been using them. It's not a flat tolerance in the classical sense, which you can just come by with an increased dosage, but instead most people are not able to reach the same effects that they used to experience anymore. This is especially the case for ketamine, which lead me to switch from intranasal to IM and later to IV use. I never noticed anything that extreme for pcp, but when I'm looking at my friends on diphenidine, I am pretty damn sure they are way further out than I am.

I personally like it because it has good bioavailability and its more convenient than plugging or IVing (which I've yet to try, although would like to), and it bypasses the GI tract so it doesn't lose potency by being dispersed in the stomach and being converted to a salt by gastic acid. Not sure if insufflation bypasses first pass metabolism of not. Vaping is my favourite ROA, but I've only had success with dp when its mixed in with herbs (I used chamomile tea), I think theres a risk of combustion by products if the heat gets too intense, but thats just speculation, I don't know.


Okay, 100mg oral dose = good. No nasal burn. Gets converted in the stomach into the HCl salt. Still has good potency. 100mg oral feels like 80mg insfufflated. Hard to tell with insufflated due to urge to blow nose. Stomach naturally neutralises freeabasedp to dpHCl, and dpHCl has good bioavailability. Smoking might cause burning of lungs and could produce unwanted combustion byproducts. But may also have higher bioavailability. Smoking = not fully known, 


100mg ingested orally = neutralized to salt in stomach = good biovailability = most sensisible ROA 


All theoretical of course


**Best + safest ROA = oral**


Ok, no doubt fellas, dp is an entheogen. It gives me insight into how I can help other people in their philosophopies about life, give them knowledge which will help them see things through a positivie light. We need to make this a sacrament. This needs to be protected by law, because the very people making the laws, are people we can help by showing them the right philosopy that does good for all. We can make this world a better place. This isn't recreation. This is creation. Creation of wonders. Wonders which willl make the world a better place. Win win for everyone. Thats what its all about. Need I repeat the song? Ok the song need be repeated

Has anyone on here tried combining diphenidine with any other psychedelics or empathogenic/entheogenic drugs? If yes, what were your results? If no, would anyone care to speculate on the possible results/safety of such a combo? I really like diphenidine by itself but there are often points during the experience, especially in the last hours of the trip where there is still dissociation but a bit of a blank and empty feeling, was wondering if a low dose of something like EAPB, bk-2cb or 25c-NBOH etc might help add a bit more "magic" to the feeling. My main worries are potential heart issues due to overstimulation (I've found diphenidine mildly stimulating) if combined with one of these other chemicals, so if I added anything to the diphenidine mix it would be at a much lower dose than usual. Also I don't know if diphenidine has any conflict with the serotonin system that could result in serotonin syndrome? I'd like to do more with diphenidine but if it would be unsafe (more so than it is already!) to combine it with these chemicals then I'd rather not take the risk just to have a bit more "magic" lol. I reckon it could go quite nicely with something like weed but sadly don't have access to that at the moment. I've combined it with benzos and alcohol before for a very relaxing but not especially memorable experiences without issue. Read a post earlier in the thread about someone having a great experience on this and DMT, and one about a not so great experience on MPA, only combos I've come across so far...

It does indeed, if you don't overdo it (I'm prone to get pretty anxious from weed, so I have to keep the amounts low). Especially since I also find diphenidine a wee bit stimulating, which the cannabis can nicely smooth out on the come down (at least if it's a good indica). It helps me sleep afterwards, together with some etizolam.

Dissociatives generally go very well with psychedelics, but it can also be a very intense experience. I smoked some DMT on a large dose of diphenidine (over 150mg) and loved it.

If no, would anyone care to speculate on the possible results/safety of such a combo? I really like diphenidine by itself but there are often points during the experience, especially in the last hours of the trip where there is still dissociation but a bit of a blank and empty feeling, was wondering if a low dose of something like EAPB, bk-2cb or 25c-NBOH etc might help add a bit more "magic" to the feeling. My main worries are potential heart issues due to overstimulation (I've found diphenidine mildly stimulating) if combined with one of these other chemicals, so if I added anything to the diphenidine mix it would be at a much lower dose than usual. Also I don't know if diphenidine has any conflict with the serotonin system that could result in serotonin syndrome? I'd like to do more with diphenidine but if it would be unsafe (more so than it is already!) to combine it with these chemicals then I'd rather not take the risk just to have a bit more "magic" lol. I reckon it could go quite nicely with something like weed but sadly don't have access to that at the moment. I've combined it with benzos and alcohol before for a very relaxing but not especially memorable experiences without issue.

I tried it with DMT and 5-MeO-DMT. Great combo IME. I dunno about mixing long lasting serotonergics, I recommend having some sedatives handy (benzos or z-drugs, I'd avoid anything like opiates or GHB) just in case you start panicking and heart starts racing. I wanna try combining it with salvia, next time I get some sally. I'd say just start with low doses of the serotonergic psychedelic and slowly work your way up. Serotonin syndrome will become symptomatic before it becomes dangerous.

lol, some substances are better insufflated than swallowed. Not too many people eat cocaine. dp however isn't one of those substances. Oral works just fine. Just takes a slightly higher dose. Ended up doing 150mg in total and was nicely warped. Wasn't too far out there, didn't get paralysed. Have yet to be holed but I think when you get that paralyses, your foots in the door.

Just imagine going completely batshit. Many people, me included, gain insights into their own life, the choices they've made, with the added gimmick of being able to tweak events at my own will, so that new realities can unfold inside my mind and seem as if they're the actual reality I am living in. You can easily lose track of who you really are (and more importantly WHAT THE FUCK is going on). It's very surreal. Actually, if I had to describe the experience in one word, "surreal" would be best fitting. Diphenidine also makes me extremely horny, much moreso than MDPV or booze lol.

Last time I did that sleep came after no less than 7 or 8 hours actually, so I assumed without the redosing (I've always redosed at least once) it should be 5-6.

I don't have any insight about this compound yet. I have yet to have the opportunity to check it out yet. I just wanted to comment on Air "Talkie Walkie". It's an amazing, beautiful album on it's own - but Dissociative's just make it fucking AMAZING!! Thank you for giving them a shout out in the thread. Music + Dissociatives = What life is SUPPOSED to be on a daily basis if everyone would just shut the fuck up and get ALONG already! I view Air as my generations Pink Floyd if that makes sense. They absolutely have their own unique thing going on - but they have a few songs that I would swear remind me so much of Floyd around their Dark Side of the Moon times. Really GREAT music. Check it out if you don't already know. You'll be wanting to see them live soon after.

I think I'm going to give this compound a go. Any opinions of this VS MXP? Do the Disco Heads have a preference of which one they would rather enjoy? If I check this compound out, I will almost definitely give it a go IV - as I have with just about every compound that I enjoy which I felt was "Safe" to put into a point and put it in my veins.................I've used MXE IV for the past 3+ years now, and I'm still alive and doing well everybody. I'm not Advocating needles AT ALL. If you can get off just fine without this ROA - STAY AWAY!!! IV Disco's are a REALM OF THEIR OWN. That's the only way I can explain it. Stay safe everyone. Enjoy this new compound while it lasts...............let's try and keep it on the LOW so it DOES LAST FOR EVERYONE!! I used to make the mistake of wanting to "Preach the MXE Gospel" - but truthfully, these beautiful compounds are better kept to just US. I will forever agree internally that Dissociative's administered properly to the right people in power around the world could change everything and turn our world into an Amazing Place - or we could easily create Hell unintentionally. It's just hard to say......................so let's keep the little Gems of life like this compound to ourselves. I've learned my preaching lessons. I see a couple of folks in this thread that have the potential of becoming preachy - have fun, spread the information that helps us all experiment in a safer manner - but keep these new compounds safe so we don't have to lose another one too soon. Take care.

@Mr. Meowfis

Seeing you are such a big fan of dissociatives, I am pretty sure you will like this one. It's much closer to PCP than to ketamine and MXE though. I've used both ketamine and mxe intravenously and it's my preferred ROA for both of them. Diphenidine on the other hand... I just don't feel any urge to IV that one because it is intense as fuck even when used orally. IF you do try to IV diphenidine, I'd suggest that you start with about 20% of what you would take orally. There are a few anecdotes which claim the smoked dosage is only about 20% as high as that for the oral roa and the experience lasts much shorter. I could imagine that it just takes forever to get absorbed when you use it orally which would explain why it lasts much longer than smoked diphenidine.

I'm really glad to hear there are more people out there who get such absurd enjoyment out of Air (mostly Talkie Walkie for me) on dissociatives. Solipsis has repeatedly asked us to keep the music and social talk out of this thread though, so best leave it at that. :D


EDIT: Another word of warning. Diphenidine might be quite habit forming when inhaled, if it is anything like PCP in that respect. I can't see me IV'ing a dissociative over and over in the course of a single session, but with smoking it's very easy to lose track and just keep hitting that pipe.

WOW, you just got me psyched to check this one out! As much as I LOVE MXE, if I had a disco of choice, I would have to call it PCP. MXE is a little bit "Cold" for me at times physically, kind of like how Ketamine was at times. I honestly wonder sometimes if I would enjoy MXE as much as I do if I wasn't on an Opiate 24/7 - I'm prescribed Buprenorphine about 4-8mgs daily. I feel like it adds the warmth and glowiness that always made me love DXM - and what first drew me to trying PCP. Angel Dust is just in a league of it's own. Music is downright amazing, the visuals and colors are so bright and twisted - it's just a fucking candyland of colors. MXE reminds me of becoming or turning into a Hologram, like I've completely left the plane of existence that all other non disco'd humans reside on. As much as I don't really care for the MXE description, to me is like "Entering the Matrix" as many people have so fondly said at times.


I am a crazy mother fucker sometimes when I get down on MXE. I get manic as FUCK, even if I'm just chilling at my house. Sometimes I would stay up for 30-36 hours at at time, doing up to 4 or 5 IV shot anywhere from 50-75mgs of MXE. I once booted about 150mgs at the tale end of a session like that and basically COMPLETELY anesthetized myself unintentionally, waking up on my floor in my kitchen STILL in the middle of a madmans M-Hole wondering if I was alive or dead, or if I had reached the afterlife. I now set STRICT limits that I follow when getting crazy like that so I don't hurt myself on accident. I only relay this story as an example of how even a veteran of these compounds can get themselves in WAY too deep. I'm quite looking forward to checking out some Diphenidine and putting some in a rolling paper with some mint leaves and tobacco. Sounds like my kind of party. Thanks for the info.

I recently had this experience with this MXE analogue.


Did anyone ever have an experience like everything, including you, just dissolved into energy? 


I'm not experiened with psychedelics, so I don't know how common something like this is, but for a good length of time I could just feel the whole world just dissolving and everything being just waves of fluid energy.


It was awesome, and it seemed so real, I wasn't even sure if it was an objective or subjective experience. It felt really objective and like I imagine it would be if the whole world ascended to a higher dimension. Like a transition-phase or something before it rearranged itself again. 


Too bad I wasn't sober, though, or it might have been real. Or for me personally. "The day the whole world went to heaven and we didn't even have to do anything".

Diphenidine is an MK-801 (dizocilpine) analogue more than anything else. MK-801 is one of the most popular nmda-antagonists used in research. It's very potent and highly selective.

I thought it was something approximately close enough to be an analogue. 


It is a bit different, though. I like it more, has a better feeling in a way. Like MXE benzos also hinder psychedelic activity, but if you just have a bit in your system it still works and seems to make it better.


I don't know, I always take really big doses to get an effect of these drugs. They also only seem to stay effective for 5 days in a row or so, with the first one and two days with the most potential to be psychedelic. But I would guess it was about a 200 mg dose for that experience. Probably the most spiritual experience I've had on drugs, the others have mostly been love/unity stuff. Oh, and being sucked into movies like you are there.

Well you aren't entirely wrong to call it a mxe analogue, since there is close functional similarity on a pharmacological level. Diphenidine is structurally much closer related to MK-801 though and presumably in it's binding profile, too.


Anyway, it's a very impressive dissociative and I was hoping it wouldn't gain much popularity, so it would remain legal. It seems like I might've been wrong.

Dude are you nuts? You cannot give people these dosage recommendations, without telling them about your tolerance!


DO NOT follow his advice if you are unfamiliar with the chemical. For your first oral dose, go for no more than 120mg. 200mg will make you blackout with no recollection over what happened.

sorry, forgot to mention my tolerance, but i found it builds rapidly to this chem, i had been off it for a while before combining with bk2cb


for a first timer, i wouldnt push over 150 mg, but with all these things ymmv

And only if you have some dissociative experience imho. If you want to get a feel for it 100-120 is plenty. If you are looking for maximum effects, I wouldn't go past 150mg without tolerance, above that most people just black out.

No, nothing of the sort. Diphenidine is a **Lefetamine** analogue, where dimethylamine is swapped with piperidine. Its a predominantly NMDA antagonist Lefetamine analogue, so it might well haqve some opioid agonist/antagonist effects as well. As chemical analogues go, Diphenidine is inbetween Lefetamine and MT-45.

Have now tried this with both 5-EAPB and 25b-NBOMe on separate occasions. The dose of 5-EAPB combined with the diphenidine was 80mg each of both drugs, which for me and my friend produced a very relaxed, serene experience with heavy empathogenic overtones. Pretty much just laid on my bed listening to music and reminiscing about memories. We'd both had a couple of drinks beforehand so were a bit drunk as well. Was a pleasant experience though not at the incredible level that mixing, for example, ketamine and MDMA could reach. Had a bit of trouble getting to sleep afterwards but taking a couple of etizolam helped and still felt fairly relaxed so it wasn't too annoying.


With the 25b-NBOMe the dose was around 500ug of NBOMe combined with a few drinks as well (probably wouldn't have tried this combo if I hadn't been a bit drunk a I find NBOMe intense enough by itself sometimes). Initially around 80mg of diphenidine was ingested with it, but this was redosed multiple times during the night so I'm not sure what the overall intake was. Although it was an experience I don't think I'll be trying a combination like this again - I was very emotional for part of the trip (not sure if this was the NBOMe or the diphenidine or both interacting with each other) and then spent most of the rest of the night in a state of almost madness, hysterically laughing and forgetting what I was doing or what was going on. My friends had taken a larger amount of NBOMe were also doing diphenidine, and again were in a bit of a state. I remember worrying at one point that I had genuinely gone crazy and had broken myself with the drugs. The experience generally was very reckless and I feel lucky to have come out of it with just a bit of embarrassment rather than permanant harm to myelf. Anyone mixing diphenidine with NBOMe be careful, and don't dose drunk.

"Nothing of the sort"? Dude, you sound like a massive twat there, in case that isn't apparent to you. ;P 


Diphenidine is in no way a functional analogue of lefetamine, despite the similarity in structure. That is just plain wrong. I am assuming you are a chemist and are using the word analogue synonymously with "structural analogue", otherwise you wouldn't just disregard the fact that lefetamine and diphenidine are not sharing any pharmacological action that we know of.


Now, from a structural perspective you are of course correct. It is an analogue of lefetamine, but it is still very close in structure to MK-801 and is also a homeomorph of said molecule.


On the other hand, this DOES seem to bind differently from MK-801. That was one aim of the study, to demonstrate that diphenidine and methoxyphenidine do not profit from an opened nmda channel. In the case of MK-801, an open channel does not only allow for the cation current to flow (mostly Ca2+), but also for MK-801 to bind, since the binding site is located inside the channel (just like the pcp site, not sure if mk-801 also binds to that). This is apparently not the case for these two compounds. Correct me if I misunderstood that part, but it seems diphenidine's binding site is outside the channel.


To be honest, looking at these properties, it might be better not to call it a MK-801 analogue after all (and sure the hell not an MXE analogue lol). We can all agree though that it is a (kickass) dissociative which is very close in effects to PCP.

So this is in fact a structural mk801 analog?

Had a sample of that one a few years ago, how anyone considers it a recreational drug is beyond me.

Haha dude, read the last few posts... It's a structural analogue of lefetamine as Asante has pointed out. If you have to ask, I'll make the bold claim that it isn't of much interest to you which other molecule it is closest to in structure. It's a homeomorph of MK-801, but it does not seem to share the same binding sites if the paper can be trusted (I haven't really read it critically). From what I've heard about MK-801 it seems to be closest to that dissociative in effects, but from the ones I've personally used it's closest to PCP.


So I suggest we all forget about calling it an analogue of anything. Imho it's viable to call it an analogue of MK-801, but also of PCP and lefetamine, but that won't give the average bluelighter much of a clue what to expect from it. Just call it a novel dissociative, an intense one.

I slept 50h after my first acid dose (first psychedelic I tried). Slept through Dec 31st and part of Jan 1st, had people play drums in my room and had my eyebrows shaved off. I've never been able to explain how that happened. Unfortunately, I cannot explain you why you slept 24h either. From all I've heard from you so far, it might be a good idea to just go easy on the stuff though. We really don't know just what it might do to your body and mind. But I've told you before, more than once, so I'm gonna shut up. How did you dose that night?

Although I'm yet to try Diphenidine, I will say I've had a similar type of lethargy happen to me when coming down from MXE or 3-MeO-PCP binges, although at the same time - I feel like the longer the bender, the more my mind/body adapts to what I'm doing and I don't really require as much sleep as I would usually need. Some of that is just because I can't/don't want to stay in bed all day when I've got Portals to explore, so I don't sleep more than 7-8 hours when I would normally sleep 10-12.


After a long bender though, I always end up sleeping for at least a 24-30 hour period, sometimes even longer. I'm sure Diphenidine could have something completely different going on that causes this, but from my experience with MXE, I always felt like it was coming from my brain just being super amped up being used to it's full capacity for an extended period of time. When I'm in the land, I'm love going for walks, bike rides, skateboarding - I always try and take advantage of the energy and motivation that it gives me which is something that I tend to lack sober. I never felt like there was something Poisonous or Toxic about that feeling - I've just been using my body and mind to the fullest capacity I can use them for 2 straight months, or even 2 weeks - it makes sense to me and doesn't seem unnatural that our bodies would like a little extra time to regenerate for the first day or two.


 I attribute it more to the way I choose to live my life during those adventures, than something being truly wrong with myself. I've been off of dissociatives for a solid 2 months now and haven't noticed anything permanent lingering, other than the stuff I've had around since I first started on my trip with MXE. If you don't enjoy the type of Visuals you get from these compounds, I don't really recommend doing them for too long or taking them to their limits too often - as I will randomly have dissociative styled visuals from time to time, even after an extended period of abstinence. I really don't mind - I kind of expected it because I got a similar effect after using DXM way too much. Dissociatives just seem to really ramp up the amount of electricity being used in our brains if that makes sense - every circuit is on and fully charged, ready to go at a moments notice. It's pretty damn interesting - it feels like being on psychedelic adderall/speed. If that's what it's really doing, it would makes sense ending up feeling lazy and sleeping for a whole day or 2 even. I've done that after gnarly LSD trips as well. I've always felt like psychedelics/dissociatives just push our minds and bodies into whole new realms of what's possible as a human being. Being a little worn out is a small price to pay.

I didn't dose that night I had slept roughly on and off for about the same time since my last dose on Sunday/Monday morning but had to go out Tuesday so that interrupted everything but from Tuesday night till 4amish this morning I slept all most solid 


and yes same old same old with no self control one good thing though I've got an appointment next week with the doctors about getting on to some kind of therapy so it will most likely stop my drug use as I wont be able to take certain stuff because of the meds their going to put me on

Nope, I always found it takes you a little too far out to enjoy these things. The experience is pretty all-encompassing, when you're on a decent dose of diphenidine all you're going to be doing for the next hour or so is be on diphenidine. Lower doses generally make movies and other media to seem far away and not very engaging.

taste like a fat hit of 5-meo-dalt?


any i.v./i.m. experience? ..since 250mg activity orally is a quarter of a gram..


---

so.. allergy tested..


necked 50mg snorted 50 mg.. felt a nice muscle relaxant effect, almost pre-mxe-hole.

Easy to close the eyes but nothing beyond a slight blanket of warmth.


but the space seems empty and blank, just I.M. 50mg more to see if i can push a plateau. 


this is only my first trial but, nothing like mxe (obviously)

look forward to dropping a 250 cap tomorrow.

I am looking for a hole out of this, versus the versatility of mxe. 


curious though i was sedated at first but am coming up a little stimmy, i know it takes a bit for lengthy effect


>slight dehydration not sure if the chem itself

>less vasco is apparent versus mxe

>not for bumping

would not want to i.v.

I would just go for a full dose and then once you are just capable of understanding the concept of time again, fire it up. If it's too soon and you don't understand shit (which certainly happened to me), just rewind and start over again. The comedown is long enough to watch a 3h movie, starting about 1.5h into the experience.


I've never experienced this movie watching magic with ketamine as profoundly, but the best drug for this has most definitely been PCP. Diphenidine is close! Shit pulls you right into the movies.


Like I watched this clown horror movie in the beginning of my first experience. The next hour I was occupied with the idea of being a clown for children's parties lol. I started that one over and it was amazing.

Could you elaborate that? I haven't gone anywhere even remotely resembling a hole on diphenidine, has that worked for you with oral dosing? If not, I'd be inclined to try this one IV.

oral id have to take 250 mg to get the same feeling but no headache and less control over what i "dream", with 100 mg booted i feel floored and just wanna lay down and be in my own mind space, nearly dream like disassociation, with also control of what i dream, nearly like high dose dxm but less visual, hard to describe as the only dissociative ive done is high dose dxm. the bk-2c-b i took with 200 mg was an amazing hallucinatory dream state.

That combo sounds just as challenging to the imagination as I find DiPT combined with nitrous to be...

instead of the darkness i see in the diph-hole, it was filled with bright colors, swirls and stuff, like the lights were turned on, i bombed the dose slightly before peaking, felt like the euphoria from the bk-2cb was increased, though it was only my 2nd time to ever take the bk2cb. it kinda reminded me of what people say a k-hole is like but with more bk2cb style cev's 

after i abstain from both for a couple weeks im going give it another shot and write up a TR. it was a mindfuck for sure, but enjoyable and gave me more control of the cev's while holed and made the rest of the bk2cb trip smoother, the way i had to explain it when i cut most of the post down bc it was just crazy compared to bk2cb alone. at the moment, either the batch i have of diph is weak, or tolerance high, but i couldnt hole off 150 mg iv'ed yesterday, no headache either like i had from the 100 mg iv hole. nor did 250 mg bombed give me the effects i expect.


edit:

also while on diph i felt i had more control over the visuals, esp the cevs while i was still feeling the diph and laid out on my bed

Thanks for telling us about your IV experiences. I had been waiting for some IV reports ever since this thread started. Regarding your latest trials, I think you might just be experiencing some tolerance there. Just lay it off for a bit and then try again.

Its like soft liquid, warm euphoria, makes SWIM laughs, GOOD!! Very good dissoative, feels like MXE and DXM. Seventh heaven. SWIM feels like serotonin buzzzzzzz.. Music sounds great, lovey-dovey. Almost like first roll but softer and not too pushy. SEROTONIN SUNRISE! Take it with gf. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) SWIM has also take ethylphenidate, ab-fubinaca and few beers. GODLIKE! Ultimate happyness, joy and love.

I've heard murmurs of a death in Sweden from IV use....anybody have any more info? Also, judging by his posts, the beloved and now deceased EADD mod Knock took diphenidine for the first time the night he passed away...a few increasingly incoherent posts then nothing more...

Indeed. 


As amanitadine says, it's not really known at this point whether he'd ingested something else, but his posts went from articulate to unintelligible within a very short space of time. We do know that he'd done an allergy test and that his initial dose was (apparently) 100mg. So it's not as if he was really being reckless, at least to begin with. Whether he redosed or became less cautious as the night went on is anybody's guess.

Obviously conjecture about drugs dangers when BL loses a member is pretty common but it is almost always just that, conjecture. It's quite possible that we will not ever know. Knock's is a very sad loss to BL & eadd in particular.


I came across a little of this compound quite some time back, when I was still interested in Methoxetamine. But I did not find that I enjoyed Diphenedine nearly as much & in fact, I kinda went off dissociative drugs altogether shortly afterwards following a long & darkly unpleasant trip on 3-meo-pcp.

I can't get over the fact that they could not find a cause of death.


My guess would be that he kept redosing because the stuff can be quite compulsive, but that is pure speculation. 


I hadn't done any dissociatives myself since December until this weekend. I had both MXE and diphenidine in my possession on friday and instead of going for the diphenidine which I've always found extremely enjoyable unlike MXE, I actually went for the MXE instead (100mg IV twice). I guess I am a little worried about this compound now.


edit: tried plugging 100mg, but had to take a shit at t+12min. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ill have to wait for what happens and redose orally i guess. still doesnt seem very attractive to iv this stuff. i dont even know if its protonated or not... if it was water soluble id give it a go, but seeing how hard it was to dissolve 100mg in propylene glycole, i dont think iv use is overly attractive. at 23min, i cant say i feel much, but i might very well have 60mg in my system already, who knows. this sucks.


edit2: i plugged another 50mg and it went fine. effects were barely noticable, so i plugged another 60mg which I had to shit out 10mins later. this doesnt seem to be well suited for rectal administration. after having the shit, i ate 100mg and it finally worked. injecting this stuff with propylene glycol does not seem overly attractive. vaporizing it tastes nasty and isnt very effective it seems. if the hcl salt is a water soluble solid, it might be attractive for iv use, but until then oral roa still seems the way to go with this stuff.

wtf?! Did you IM or IV? Surely not 250mg, right? You didn'T IV/IM on top of 250mg oral either, did you? Would be great if you could elaborate, your post is currently completely useless. Also, would be nice if you could tell us how you prepared the shot, since diphenidine isn't very soluble in water.

True


I know nothing of this drug n as there are rumours that it may have been the cause of knock dying (we don't know for sure) but. Please try to be careful, ok?!  I'm not coming here to do the preaching thing but if that assumption is true then we don't wish to lose anyone else. 

Like I say I know. Nothing of this drug n am not posting to cause offence in any way.

We do know that he'd done an allergy test and that his initial dose was (apparently) 100mg. So it's not as if he was really being reckless, at least to begin with. Whether he redosed or became less cautious as the night went on is anybody's guess.

This is extremely upsetting - and what's more that we don't know for sure so we can warn others to prevent it happening again. Knock shouldn't have died he should be alive now god it's so so wrong - all of it! 


Take care,

Evey xxxx


Edit: knock's last post was 26.2.2014 which was a Wednesday. His family said he'd died on the Friday so it may not be down to this drug. It may have been anything.

Nah it probably won't hit you as hard as it does when you take the full dose at once. It CAN take some time to build up and seems a lot more subtle (unlike other major dissociatives) when you space out several small doses like that. You might just realize that you've been having extremely weird thoughts for the past few minutes... or wait, was it a couple of hours? Anyway, I'm sure that's not what you are after, so I'd recommend the following dosing regimen:

-150mg orally (I take it uncapped in a glass of milk, so it'll hit me faster)

-another 50mg if you are enjoying yourself and want to extend the trip when you first start to come down (not sooner than 2h after initial dose)

i orally ingested 250mg, which got me nowhere do to tolerance the night before.


IVd 30 mg shot for the sake of purpose same with, I.M route - 100mg on top of all this.


did not receive any indication of hole, and only slight dissociation, my tolerance and current immune system may play part.


i can elaborate once i have finished all testing atm i am enjoying MXP over diph, and both in combination.

Yes, it could have been anything, but it's highly likely it was something to do with diphenidine. I don't want to demonise a drug unnecesarily, but I think it's important to approach new drugs with caution, especially if they may have been involved in fatalities.

Glad you didn't die... a member recently took diphenidine and it was the last anyone heard of him, and he died.  There's been discussion about it in this thread, there's no proof it was diphenidine but it doesn't sit well with me.

120mg oral was quite enjoyable, i was mistaken about this chem. It isn't like blasting sherm but it definitely holds up better than mxe..

My only qualm is that i can't pin it =/

I wholeheartedly agree. I actually used diphenidine after using MXE IV @100mg for two days in a row and even orally diphenidine won that contest hands down. I still miss PCP though. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


Apparently quite a few people have IV'ed it, but nobody cares to elaborate how exactly they're doing it. I've actually asked 2 of these people via pm and still didn't get a reply.

From what I could gather, he died two days after last posting on bluelight, so it's very unlikely it was the diphenidine.

Yes. Too right. I looked at his posts n he never came back after. Good god that is upsetting to think that it could have been the cause. I hate the idea he was on his own dying like that n none of us could do fuck all. I just hope it was painless n that he's now at peace. 


Treat these drugs with caution please. We're not coming here to try n be mean or owt we're all really concerned.

need accurate scales and patience for substances of thees sorts. I've had no problems with 80mg 100mg and 120mg all oral in water or juice. combined with 5-meo-dalt quite nice as well ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) . but yes as others have stated, these are substances that can be very dangerous.  Their is a reason an Anesthesiologist is always present at major operations and in the US is a full MD PHD etc etc. be safe!

Well try not to worry so much, but maybe it will help you avoid redosing.  Plenty of people have done it and been fine too.  I'm sure you'll be fine. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Haha yeah I was thanks Xorkoth, and yeah it sure as hell stopped my redosing too much (last night was already a redose). Stuff's not great for me anyway, took about 300mg yesterday both orally and insufflation, and had just a very light dissociation effect. Slightly DXM headlike by then end, too mild to describe it as K like. Wanted to find a middle ground with this one but a lot of people suggesting you just tip over into a void and I like to remember so.. ah well, some money wasted.

I think I should mention something I observed after the last two times I took diphenidine. Once a toe went numb for two days and now two finger tips have gone numb for the last few days. I'm not too worried about this and it could be attributed to loads of other things (e.g. I've had back problems for over a decade), but if anyone else notices anything like it, please do tell us about it.


Also, this stuff is addictive as fuck, not far from PCP for me in this respect. I've only taken it 5 times in 6 months, but I have come a long way since I first took drugs and have some responsibility, too, so I won't just go overboard with my use like I once did with PCP or other classes of drugs. It's definitely a lot more addictive than ketamine for me, I catch myself trying to find opportunities for using it all the time. I don't even have it laying around at my place.

I think I'll get some of this and methoxphenidine. I'm not particularly fond of dissociatives other than ketamine, and recently I doubt I would even want to indulge in that, so I'll sit on these for several months until a more accurate effects profile is developed. Bless you brave explorers.

Took 5 days for those fingers to come back to normal and it happened gradually. Thinking back, I might've experienced this the first three times as well, but not as long. I'll very likely be taking diphenidine again and will watch out for this. So should everyone else imho.

If you're anything like me, I doubt you'll find what you like from K in any other known compound. I'm not even a huge K fan & not interested in holing, & I am certainly not a fan of dissociatives generally, although I respect folk who swear by them, takes all sorts. 


What worries me is that chasing the K hole, if that's what you like about K, using ever increasing doses of something like Diphenedine, or Methoxydiphenidine, or ANY dissociative other than K itself is a very risky endeavour & I would like to discourage it.


I know all the just say no crap, I know it's not the done thing to say don't take this drug, don't take that drug. I know people will do what they will do & I'd fight & kill to defend that freedom if I had to. Equally, I have the right to advise against it, even should I chose to, in the hardest possible terms.


RC's are inherently dangerous. I see dissociative RC's even more dangerous still. Sorry to piss all over your parades freinds. Be very fucking careful, especially with unresearched dissociatives. Please.

I've never had a problem with chasing a hole, or ever became really addicted to ketamine. I value the hole immensely, but my use of ketamine was predominantly in small amounts for an enjoyable buzz. Which would always annoy me since I usually acquired it with the intention of achieving deep holes, but I end up mellowing out with small bumps until there isn't even enough for a hole anymore.

Don't worry about the warning Si Ingwe, I think it's important to keep the potential dangers at the forefront of your mind when dealing with such novel chemicals. If it turns out, after more information surfaces, that neither of these sound like something I will enjoy I'll gladly chuck them. Dissociatives are strange enough, I wouldn't want to not be enjoying myself on one.

I tried a couple of times, but 3-meo-pcp proved consistantly unpleasant. It was like laying back in bed, & remembering all the most awful things you've seen in real life, on TV, all the things you've *heard* about, that have distressed you, all the memories of pain, terror or fear.. All rushing back, round & round in there! Boy, was glad when *that* one wore off.


Yes, Dissociatives, despite being facinating, are wierd fucking drugs.


I too have used Ket in the way you describe, never seeking a hole, but edging periously close once or twice. Mostly I just loved the colour enhancement watching Sci-Fi. In fact, at one point, having gotten some actual vials, I got quite used to having it in the evening instead of a spliff, & when it ran out I was quite sad Lol


I fought terrible fear of Ketamine to try it, after being sedated for a week with it in hospital in the mid 90's. I've never tripped so hard, & in such a sterile enviroment, under the knowledge that I'd narrowly avoided death & lost an entire week of my life. Bad trip city! I was tripping HARD on the K from the moment I awoke, for three whole days, 24/7 no sleep, & suffered auditory hallucinations for 3 months after I got out of hospital. Within the first hour I'd punched my way out of bed, hitting a cute Kiwi nurse in the face whilst almost overpowering 5 orderlies & had effectively gone psychotic. Ten minutes later I'd decided the Kiwi nurse was the cutest thing I'd ever seen & resolved to stay in ICU forever. Then a minute later I'd be making a run for it again... I thought nothing through, my mind was not my own. In fact, I didn't even know who I was, I had to get a nurse to bring a mirror over, once they got me calmed, coz I didn't know what I looked like! 


My first experience of K was memorable, shall we say, but terrifying. I steered well clear of it until about 5 years ago when an opportunity to try it arose, as it had many times, & this time I said a timid yes. Took a LONG time to get over the fear after the ICU trip, but I did it!


I doubt Diphenedine will fill this gap, but my experience with it was limited, biased in advance by the above 3-meo-pcp experience & an overly paranoid view of RC Dissociatives. Be careful but enjoy if you can ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well it surely won't replace a hole, but for things like watching sci-fi on k, diphenidine works much better imho.

Well last night is the last time i do Diphenedine. 177mg split in 2 lines with 40mg of crushed ritalins taken 1 hour between put me gave me a extremely strange state, kinda similar how to time-room goes bananas on MXE-ish, but in a really unenjoyable feel, killed it within 30min with 1mg clonazepam. It was kinda like [HSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_sensitive_person) and [HPPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder) gone extreme with all the "crazy"-feel that Diphenedine gives.


I've done 4g, and for me, Diphenedine is more like a stimulant, and much more trippy than other dissociatives, I even had my first bad trip on 80mg Diphenedine a few days ago, never once had a bad trip before. It also seems like Diphenedine caueses a amnesia-state after 1-2 hours, and in this state your mind goes blank untill suddenly the "crazy" hits, it's a new high every time but it's to unpredictaple for being worthwhile doing.. I liked it at first, i REALLY liked it.. But later, it feels rather psychotic ...and not healthy at all.


I wish i had MXE again...

i finally had the chance to test diphenidine. warning if you have a high dissociative tolerance don't just go ahead and take a big dose. me and a friend of mine have more or less the same tolerance to dissociatives, i took 270mg(in separate doses over the night) and was fine he took 150 and was completely shattered and had a horrible experience, psychotic even, he thought i was doing some kind of experiments on him etc. he first took 100 and was fine then 1h30min later took a 50mg booster and that is what took him to a dark place.


i found it wonderful and inspiring, reminded me very much of how dxm 2nd plat makes me feel  without the body load but also without much visual changes although visual changes were there, more comparable to a low dose ketamine, things just looked different but not in any shocking way. 


i first took 100mg, then had some 50mg and one 20mg boosters spaced some hours apart. one of the boosters was mixed with 100mg mxe at which point i blacked out for about 1h as my girlfriend was telling me about some things i have done that i don't recall at all. mix with mxe was good but doses must be much lower. 


i also tried mxp. i find them very similar but i prefer diphen it had a more positive vibe. mxp is more potent by weight though and could feel it as low as 20mg nasally. first 10mg nasaly was ok but second 10mg 10mins later started to hurt.


all my diphen doses were oral. 


overall a great chem, not anything spectacular for me but still very very nice. my friend hated it though and we generally share the same tastes in drugs

There will most definitely be side effects, but for now only a few thousand people tops have taken it and it has only been made available to the public for a year or so. I've personally observed some hypesthesia in fingers and toes after use, but it might be due to something entirely different, since I've been experiencing some relatively exotic health issues before I started using diphenidine.

whats up with that post diphenidine hornyness though ? :D (sex was great, not as good with 3meopcp but still up there, intense) 


also mix of diph and 2meo diph is better then any alone for me. also diphendine is one of those like dxm that need something like weed to unlock its potential. it goes great with weed and/or morphine, beer, small doses of mxe. it goes terribly with synth noids and hard alcohol. nicotine is also good. 


diphen is more relaxed and reminds me more of dxm 2nd plat without the visual aspect(but there is some visual aspect to it just not as shocking) and mxp is more stimed and reminds me more of mxe without the visual stuff. 


they are most similar to each other though. 


low doses work just give them time. high doses for some people can be bliss for other hell. don't redose too soon.


its great for activities - try swings! we did that there is this new big swing that can hold 2 people and its utter madness :D 


p.s. cr00k im telling you man watch "dante 01" and "slipstream" they are made for this stuff, very lab rat-y style ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Do you have a rationale for that numerical estimate beyond a vague guestimate? I ask because I'm very curious about how to estimate the actual usage of some of these rarer compounds, and so any potential indicator is fascinating to me. Despite the fact that this thread has over 50,000 views, I'm one of those non-users, so I suppose that's a poor sort of a confirmation of your "few thousand" figure (though I have used methoxphenidine, since I read it was more enjoyable).

I've read diphenidine is related to dizocilpine, and chronic administration of that drug has reportedly led to neurological changes in rodents similar to those observed in schizophrenia. I'm interested in any elaboration of the comparison, but if such comparison is warranted and generalizable to humans then limiting usage really does appear crucial for mental health's sake. If true, anybody using it frequently as a replacement for methoxetamine could seriously be fucking themselves.

Was gonna say the same thing as wayab, you just couldn't handle your shit and now you're claiming the chemical was "pure poison". It's just really fucking strong shit. I for my part enjoy this effect that occurs when the dose is high enough and don't know of any other dissociative (or drug in general) that can cause a state like this. It's somewhere between being psychotic, being lobotomized and gaining superhuman mental powers.


I am sorry I forgot about this, but I was gonna tell you when I first read your post that combos between dissociatives usually suck balls. Dosage becomes really unreliable, the onset and duration is usually different and they don't complement each other in any way. I've never found any worthwhile combos between dissociatives. Now some people do seem to find enjoyment in mixing 2-meo-diphenidine with this one.

Not sure if you are referring to what I said about that, but sometimes diphenidine just takes me to a VERY VERY DIRTY place. I don't even want to go into too much detail lol. It's much worse than anything I've experienced on MDPV and seems to happen on the peak mostly. It's so engrossing that I pretty much miss out on all the fun when "it happens".

Maybe you were really in a completely different place than I was, but I dosed it too high before as well so I figured I knew what you were referring to. I didn't enjoy it either, but to me it was clear I'm just completely zonked out and it'll pass. 


Then again, I was feeling psychologically okay when I once accidentally ingested a very very high dose of DOC (maybe like 15mg?) without tolerance which completely blacked me out and had me wake up in a steaming pile of puke hours later. It took me another 2 hours until I could finally see again to realize I had puked ALL OVER the place (windows, walls, computer, floor, bed, bathroom, living room, bed room, you get the idea).


I could see how even a regular full dose (150mg) of this stuff could be extremely unsettling to some people, so I wouldn't be surprised if a much too high dose had you worried you broke something. 


Maybe I really haven't been where you have been. Warnings are DEFINITELY in place about that stuff and it surely is NOT for everyone. I really just reacted to you saying it was "pure poison", which it definitely isn't. It might be poison, but some of us thoroughly enjoy it. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 

To me personally MXE feels a lot dirtier than this one. I dosed MXE maybe 1-2 dozen times from 5mg oral to 100mg IV, so I know the substance pretty well. I never liked it at all, but know that it's some folks' drug of choice. To each their own.

Yeah man, listen to your own body, you certainly can't hurt yourself but discontinuing use of diphenidine.  But, you could could hurt yourself by continuing to use, possibly.  Glad you're okay.

I haven't done that many psych+diss combos, but doc+s-ket was crazy as fuck. The visuals were nothing like I've ever seen on psychedelics, everything fell apart and regrouped to form gigantic mandalas that covered my entire field of vision. A million eyes looking at me.


Back on topic, diphenidine doesn't seem to be everyone's cup of tea. Something that was already very apparent to me when I first tried it, even when I read about it. I only know 2 people whom I'd suggest to try this. So maybe this one just isn't for you and you should indeed give/throw it away.

There's a turning point it seems. Usually happens for me when I redose heroically. No other dissociative has ever been this intense for me mentally once that point is reached. I have no tolerance at all to dissociatives since I only do them every few months, but I've recently tried to IV 100mg MXE a few times and it was just boring compared to this.


lol@your friend's statement btw. When I was doing this with a friend, I got ahold of a pen and a notebook and just recorded everything we were saying that seemed of importance. Pretty surreal shit!! :D

In almost all cases of "chest pain" at your age (under 30 I'd assume), it's due to a compressed intercostal nerve. There's other symptoms that would be more indicative for a recent heart attack (which I assume is exactly what your anxious ass is worried about).

Basically, you couldn't handle the experience, it induced a panic attack and now you're telling people not to take this drug? I mean, I'd rather see someone tell others NOT to take a drug than do the opposite, but sure your reasoning is valid here?

Wow you achieved a hole with this?!?! Godamn I envy you, I haven't gotten anywhere even remotely close to that on diphenidine. In fact, except for whopping doses of MXE IV (which would result in like a 5 minute hole lol) and ketamine, nothing has ever made me hole. PCP puts me into some sort of dream like state at very very high doses, too, but that's not a hole in my book.

What do we like about it? Well, I think I must've mentioned it in some way before, but I'll try again. Basically, I can let my imagination go wild on this which I really enjoy. I can create entire realities and play with them, all inside my mind. I like the body feeling, the numbness. I like that it doesn't give me double vision like all other dissociatives do. It can also be extremely euphoric for me, I repeat: extremely euphoric! It is definitely not always entirely pleasant, but I guess I don't mind a little dark side with my dissociatives as that aspect doesn't totally dominate. It felt poisonous to you, it just doesn't for me. Maybe this one just isn't for you. I don't like cocaine, I don't like MXE, some people don't like dissociatives at all, maybe you just don't like diphenidine.

crook i hope yor interpretation is correct...obviously i can't handle drugs and in particular dangerous combos. maybe i've also some gerd because i didn,t bomb but drunk some camomille tea or water with it.

dyspnea and some chest pain were my biggest concern during the p.a. i'm quite sure diph was not implicated because i used it the night before.

ah i' m almost 34. i've done some tests and i have a little bit high cholesterol but because of my thyroid condition that was not compensated well i think.

Yeah I hope so, too. GERD could be a reason as well. How long did the dyspnea last? How long did the chest pain last? Was the pain located exclusively in the chest? Any problems now?

I know this is not particularly helpful, but people who value my opinion might appreciate:  I am very put off by this drug and will not use it. The molecule isnt very metabolicaly accessible, belongs to a truly novel class of compounds (lefetamine derived dissociatives), there are reports of small margins between little effects and being catatonic and to top it off the great tragedy of someone, bless his soul, dying in this thread.


I'm taking the nope nope nope train out of this shitville, I won't experiment with it and will monitor the thread and be helpful if possible to the intrepid explorers who risk experimenting with this stuff, encouraged by their curiosity, confidence in their ability to subdue this beast and perhaps some initial overly enthusiastic and possibly vendor shill hype.


I'm skeptical about this one, I dont think its in any way an improvement, as in a BETTER dissociative than MXE and 3-MeO or 4-MeO PCP, It I think exists mainly because it is a legal substitute, not a better drug.


I will pray for the people experimenting with this one and aid them when they can, but when MXE ios still so widely available, me if I lived in a country where it was illegal would rather set up an elaborate scheme to get a good quantity of MXE illegally and risk the law than to experiment with this one and risk my health on this wildcard of an RC.


Godspeed guys and please dont throw this drug in the mix or go on runaway redosing schemes.  I feel that this is a very powerful and unforgiving one. This is nothing like the other dissciatives, its a completely new thing. Please be careful.

the dyspnea lasted 20  25 minutes i think it's a lot. everything started after a little walk in the park with a hill also ~3km. First beginned the chest pain...then when finally at home with a my father passage started the panick attack with the dyspnea.at more than 20 days the chest disconfort is there and respiration also has been affected. the pain is at the center of the chest but also on the left side.

Well I've had MXE lying around since I first got it, just a small amount, but I'm not using it because I think it's crap. I fully understand your worries about this one and your unwillingness to use it and I should not be using it either, but please make no mistake and call the effects undesirable. We are all different. MXE is crap to me, 4-MeO-PCP was crap, 3-OH-PCP felt like pure poison, but this one ranks up there with Ketamine and PCP in my book. I've just taken it for the 6th time in the last 5 months (230mg this time) and consider it very recreational with plenty of advantages over other dissociatives.

I could currently get ahold of quite a few other dissociatives, among them mxe and cheap-ass sket from the lab (opposed to processed stuff), but I don't see no reason to do so because diphenidine is the fucking bomb. I don't get double vision off it which is HUGE to me. I never heard of many people being bothered by it, but every other dissociatives gives me hellish double vision for hours and hours past the plateau.


I think warnings are definitely in place for this one since basically it is gonna have some side effects which we aren't aware of yet (e.g. this one could finally be the one to cause my cock to rot off), this would also be the place to let the world know how little you think of it, but please don't disregard it as worthless to everyone. I've taken close to 200 different psychoactive substances and this one does have things to offer that others just don't. Boys like ball games, girls like horses, you like MXE, I like diphenidine.


I agree on not mixing this with anything that's not exceptionally high on the safety spectrum of recreational drugs (e.g. DMT or pot have been fine for me as expected). Btw I once drank 30m ethanol before taking it and did not get nauseous as I usually would after even 1 beer and a full dose of any of the major dissociatives.


The vibrations are coming on hard, I won't make much sense very soon. T+27min

I'm not saying no one should do it, just warning that this is a Very Serious Drug, much more so than MXE or K. Its next to impossible to die from MXE or K with anything resembling normal use. Here someone died very early on and people are sent catatonic with zero mind activity on slight dose increases over rather unremarkable doses. This is a drug for our best and strongest, the ones with most self control, the best scales, apothecary skills and robust health.

I dislike the double vision from dissociatives too.  Other than extremely low doses of MXE (which I still dislike some of the parts of), I only like taking dissociatives while laying down with my eyes closed, for this reason.  Unlike others, I don't like low doses of MXE, I just take them sometimes to help with opiate withdrawal.  I really like MXE at high dosages when it gets psychedelic and hole-y, but the low doses don't give me the desirable effects that many people describe (euphoria, mania, stimulation, etc).

OH MY GOD! This stuff is beyond amazing. I just managed to enter a very specific dream realm that I have known my entire life. I've never been able to enter it at will and in fact it used to scare me quite a bit. I'll try to elaborate when I am sober. So hard to express mself on this.

But don't you really only take it at high doses when ketamine isn't available? :D The only use I found for it was IV'ed at astronomically high doses, so I'd get into a state resembling a k hole. I still never liked it much, I'd give it a 4 out of 10 personally.


Now diphenidine on the other hand is one of the most fascinating substance I've ever come across. I will probably fail trying to explain what happened yesterday, but I will try to give you a rough idea.

There is this particular type of dream I used to have as a child and it always scared the living crap out of me. I could never even understand what was happening in this dream, as if the language I have acquired isn't fit to do so. It is both another place, as well as a state I myself am in. There are two opposing forces at work in that realm/state, it's all very abstract and I really can't find the right words for it, sorry.


Anyway, yesterday I took my to date highest initial dose of 225mg (orally in a glass of milk as the other 5 times I have used this substance). When I was at the peak I suddenly found myself in that very state I always experienced as a kid and could switch out of it and back into it. It felt like I was switching between universes, absofuckinglutely insane. And the most puzzling thing about all this is, that even while I am that far out there, I can still function pretty damn well. Barely any motor skill impairment.

This might not sound like much to anyone reading this, but for me it was absolutely overwhelming, stunning, mystical, it left me speechless.


EDIT: The only real major criticism I have about this stuff is that the only really viable ROA is oral. It comes on gradually while I am still trying to prepare myself and put things in my apartment into order. Then it often creeps up on me and after crossing a threshold I remain whereever I am. With ketamine I can just lie down in my bed and wait for it to hit me, thereby getting the most out of the experience. I've consistently failed to do this with diphenidine.

I don't feel that way about MXE at all, first of all it's probably partly because I have zero dissociative tolerance, I haven't used them much.  I hit the most spectacular hole of my life (including ketamine) when I took 40mg orally of MXE followed by 20mg rectally.  It's one of the most intense and out there psychedelic experiences I've ever had, I went stright into the oneness more completely and vividly than ever before.  So far I actually prefer it to ketamine because it's warmer and MUCH more vivid (for me - I have always mostly forgotten my high-dose ketamine experiences).


That does sound like an awesome experience. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I can't say I'm not jealous. At first I thought people who were talking about the "m hole" were just kids who have never taken ketamine and have no idea what a hole is. After reading more here on bluelight I was taught that is not the case. Only scenario that allowed me to hole on it was to IV a very large dose, but even then the holes were very wishy washy, dark, not psychedelic, and most importantly, never induced any major proprioceptive hallucinations which is the most fun part of k holes imho. I'm gonna give you a rough idea of what my non IV trials were like: All the unpleasant sides of a class united in a single substance without any of the desirable effects. I've really been exceptionally unfortunate with this one. I did keep trying, but it just hasn't ever done what others describe it does to them, not a single time.


I guess it just shows once more how different we all and our reactions to psychotropic drugs really are. If MXE had been even 20% as impresive for me as what you are describing there, I would've just bought 100g for a lifetime supply when it was still legal. But as it is, my last gram has been lasting for years now.

Wow, I guess we're all affected very differently, indeed.  I found the M hole superior to the K hole, all of the stuff you describe it pretty much the exact opposite for me, I found it entirely more psychedelic than ketamine, much warmer and brighter, and highly conducive to proprioceptive hallucinations.  If I could remember K-holes maybe I'd prefer ketamine, who knows, but I never can.

Agreed. MXE is definitely more psychedelic, intricate, and warmer than ketamine IME. The best "x-hole" experience I've had was with MXE; usually via IV ROA. And I've had extensive experience with ketamine.

I like MXE, but the k hole blows away the M hole in all regards IMO. Too many side effects with MXE, too much stimulation and after effects...I love the smoothness of depth of a k hole..


That being said, I have had some fantastic holes on MXE...

I wholeheartedly agree with MXE having too many side effects.  My least favorite part is how it's so hard to sleep.  For me, it doesn't evenb produce a noticeable stimulation in the way that stimulants do.  However I can't sleep at all afterwards for hours.  One thing I love about ketamine is how I can easily and naturally transition into sleep afterwards.  I just wish I could remember my full-dose ketamine experiences.  K feels so much colder and less colorful and less psychedelic than MXE for me.  On my way to the M-hole, before I had even gotten all the way there, I had an intense recollection of previously forgotten ketamine as well as DMT experiences.  The experience I was currently having with MXE was emulating the peaks of those two experiences, and then it went even farther.

No, I have only ever snorted K.  I have never IVed or IMed anything, for the M-hole experience I described I ate 40mg and plugged 20mg 40 minutes later (yes I am a dissociative lightweight).

Interesting. Ketamine just doesn't work for me anymore when I snort it and even when it still did, injected ketamine felt like an entirely different beast, almost like another drug. I haven't done it in around half a year, but I know when I snort it it would just cause the typical dissociative side effects. I'd still black out at a certain dosage and that dosage wouldn't be much higher than 10 years ago, but I wouldn't experience the beautiful psychedelia I get off injected ketamine.


So that's another way how I explained those raving mxe reports to myself after I had done it a few times. "Maybe these people just don't have any experience with other dissociatives" I thought. I heavily abused PCP daily for close to 4 months and used ketamine 1-2 times per week for years before I first came across MXE. 1g of 4-MeO-PCP didn't really do much either except for some pretty pleasant but light dissociation. This is all quite striking. Either there just is some genetic predisposition in play or it'd the massive abuse of ketamine and PCP that causes me to not get much out of MXE now. This could also explain why I so very thoroughly enjoy diphenidine. It's very unfortunate that most people do not precisely list their level of experience when they write reports.


Back on topic...I should add that I do get some after effects off diphenidine, sort of like a hangover. It's basically the same thing I get off all dissociatives these days, an uncomfortable overall feeling in my body, slight nausea, a very slight headache, but most prominently some amount of depression (I'm bipolar) which causes me to withdraw myself socially and often leaves me overwhelmed by all those important issues in life I have yet managed to work out. All dissciatives used to make me pretty manic and this still occurs occasionally, but the depressive aspects are definitely more pronounced now. These usually occur on the 2nd day after use and last for a couple of days, how long exactly depends on a few other factors. Sometimes with diphenidine I was still hypomanic on the first day, but this seems pretty random. I always suffer some sort of affective consequences eventhough they're pretty manageable.

Yeah the aftereffects I get from all of the different drugs I have abused are definitely different than they used to be.  Abuse of drugs definitely alters the way your body and mind process those drugs and even other drugs in the same family.  I don't know if you ever return to normal, but the nice thing is that my processing of psychedelics seems to slowly be returning to normal after my extreme overuse of them years back.

Ha funny you would say that, I did a really good job ruining those for me. Especially the after effects got worse and worse (mostly just muscle and joint pain), so I kinda stopped using them. Good to hear that though, I'll still go for the occasional trip (definitely less than 5 times in the past 5 years). This doesn't inculde DMT btw.

i actually find diphen to be extremely recreational, and i love it like K and even moreso than mxe....


I have personally found my ideal dose to be 75mg sublingual... and also like to combine 100mg diphen with 100mg ethylphenidate orally

I have but I vastly prefer IM....smoother, more time to bobsled through wormholes, etc. IV was more hedonistic and rushy, and and much more prone to amnesia..


I hear ya on the NMDA bashing ruining a lot of dissociatives....I was a hardcore k head for many years, periods of IM'ing a vial or two a night for weeks on end,  did my runs with PCP, etc...by the time the pre commercial MXE and PCP/PCE/etc analogs were making the test rounds I had pummeled myself to a point where K usually just induced a blackout. So my first experiences with MXE and friends weren't quite as marvelous as others. Eventually I got to where I could get some good times out of MXE by some serious trial and error haha , but I wonder what it would be like if I were an NMDA antagonist virgin...Or at least not the pummeled bundle of flesh I am!


When I discovered IM K in the mid 90's oh my oh my....my cortex was blown, and my addictive nature sprouted....provided the perfect bridge from psychedelics to shit drugs (opioids, uppers, etc) via the needle. Oh well.


I've been curious about these 'phenidines, but have been cautiously waiting and watching for more reports. Crook, your enthusiasm is encouraging, as was Shambles, but you won my heart years ago by posting pics of that amazing drug collection being tossed, and well, shambles is just shambles, so I might be a bit biased..![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Still, color me intrigued. Just waiting for more "data" to seep in. 


I've taken very long breaks from NMDA antagonists and the original effects never return.


Fun, hedonistic things, but as to their actual worth to me personally I'm on the fence...sure, I obviously enjoy them, but I can't really say if there is anything more to them than just recreation, and abuse can sure be deleterious!

This can NOT be stressed enough!! That's exactly how it went down for me, eventhough I never had a serious needle habit with any opiate or stimulant. But dissociatives fill the gap between the quite forgiving psychedelics and the life wrecking (!) opiates and to some degree stimulants and benzos, yet dissociatives are treated more like another type of psychedelic even on here. Many psychedelics users have this internal guideline that will make them decline all opiates, but ketamine and co extend that invisible line somehow in many individuals.


EDIT: I'm glad someone remembers that. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) Hamilton that cocksucking hipster piece of shit posted them on his site (long story).

As for diphenidine, it has been the ultimate dissociative for me, but it's sort of brutal. Sounds like you'd like it. Definitely some habit forming potential there, too. I've only done it six times now (in close to half a year), but I catch myself thinking about it a lot. Just like when I started using ketamine.

Yuk how could anyone keep this stuff in his mouth for longer than the blink of an eye? I chug the full dose (at first 150, last trial I took 225) down in 50-100ml milk, then chug down some more milk immediately. Best way to hide the taste and believe it or not, onset is 30min with that method while it was 60-90min with capsules.

I'll tell you the detailled version in a pm. He just demonstrated to me on various levels that he is an asshole as a person when that interview about my dmt lab accident was published in Vice. Generally speaking the reporters I've met in my life were lying sacks of shit who'd betray their own mother for a story and he seems to be no exception.

He might be very good at what he does and I wouldn't dare argue against his qualities as an entertainer or semi-gonzo journalist, but I personally never cared much about his writings and videos as a source of information.


I think you're going about these substances the right way, unlike me. This is very strong stuff and it's probably a very good idea to avoid it which I apparently do not have the necessary restraint for, but I'll be making sure to keep my use under tight control (so far 6 times in 6 months which imho is too much for long term use). I could see people who are too enthusiastic about this substance and in consequence use it too frequently running into serious cognitive and emotional problems.


Did you talk to Knock on wednesday (?) when he created his last posts of gibberish or two days later when he apparently died? If it's the latter, did he use diphenidine again that day or did he even go on a 3 day binge?

I am still very sceptical about this whole ordeal.

**Yes I have IV'd K, MXE, and 4-MeO-PCP.** *edit- absolutely  despise 4-MeO


I love IV K and MXE, not together haha.


Seriously, now that I think about it IV K has such a bell-ringer, intense rush... or honestly, I think it was actually Esketamine; I could mix up minuscule shots of these crystals and my ears would ring with the intensity, yet blissful rush of the best IV DRI's (i.e. raw cocaine), completely dissociated, S-ket (yes, and good ole' K) has a unique psychedelia no other arylcyclohexlyamine and/or dissociative will ever have. 


MXE is just an overall better experience for me. It has a warm, euphoric rush when IV'd with legs for daze, especially with cannabis. More potent, better on my wallet, for me more visuals and psychedelia, M-holes bring upon spiritual introspection IME (I've never had anything like the experience I had on repeated shots of white, snowy crystalline MXE and medical weed; nootropic in a nostalgic, spiritual sense as in I was able to remember memories and dreams/concepts of dreams or their story-lines that I had forgotten long ago) 


Sorry to get off topic fellow BLightaz, I am interested in experiencing Diphenidine. **Would it be helpful for a methadone WD arsenal if I can't get MXE atm?**

I also find MXE to be more spiritual in nature than K (haven't really tried other dissociatives other than DXM when I was younger).  But, no idea about your question, sorry, never tried diphenidine and I'm unlikely to.

But surely you must enjoy racemic ketamine more than the s-isomer, right? I am so bummed out about not getting ahold of racemic ketamine or not as easily as I used to. I don't enjoy the s-isomer half as much. It never takes me on journeys that are as exciting as those I experience on racemic ketamine, the psychedelic aspects just seem a lot more dull. It's still an excellent dissociative when IV'ed, but in terms of the sheer amount and quality of content of those k holes, it falls far behind racemic ketamine imho. Do you disagree?

Well I have never had to withdraw methadone and I've never sued dissociatives to help opiate withdrawls. What's the idea behind it? I've never felt what people say is opioidergic activity on any dissociative. Or is it about the tolerance reversal (potential upregulation of receptors)? Personally I'd be afraid of becoming even more dysphoric with diphenidine in my bloodstream while withdrawing opiates...

with I heard from my cat who experienced mxp. Methoxdiphenidine. 


Hard to understand the trip. Evrything is wrong but a feeling of everything will be Ok.

You do seem to be interested though, seeing that you've been lingering in this thread for some time, eh? ;P Then again you have a good excuse, being a mod here and all. ^^

A friend of a friend (no, really) of mine tried this, once, twice and then he ordered 50g all for himself to consume. He's always been very fond of dissociatives (fond of any kind of drug really), but this is apparently this is apparently the vertex of mind fuck for him, as it is to me.


Seems like pretty soon we will have some data about the safety of regular use lol. Since I passed an url to him through my friend, I gave him all the warnings and worries that have been issued here as well, as that's the responsible thing to do. As expected, he didn't give a flying fuck lol.


Really, there aren't many questions around regular use of this stuff for me. It's NOT safe. Period. Just like any other dissociative isn't safe to use on a regular basis. I have a feeling this one could go a bit deeper even on an affective/behavioural level than ketamine, pcp, mxe, but it's just a hunch. Regarding some unexpected adverse reaction, I'm just not very worried personally (mostly because I like getting blasted off it).

I never tried any dissociative, but I am pretty interested in it. I was thinking about taking mxe or ketamine, but how is diphenidine compared to these two? Is it euphoric, does it give you some kind of afterglow like mxe? I know that you shouldnt use dissociatives for trating depression, but has diphenidine also anti depressive functions like ketamine?

There haven't been any clinical trials on it's potential antidepressant effects yet and I dare say there never will be. Of course you will always find some people who claim it is effective as an antidepressant (people say this not just about dissociatives, but about any drug, especially novel ones and even moreso when they're highly habit forming).

If you want to take dissociatives for their antidepressant effects, you don't need psychedelic dosage levels and it's probably counterproductive to administer them above that threshold on a regular basis.


Now as to whether diphenidine would be a good drug to try as a dissociative virgin, I would have to answer NO. FUCK NO actually. Unless you want to be turned off dissociatives for the rest of your life. If you had actually read through a few pages of this thread, you would know this. It's just very unforgiving at higher doses and there's a good chance you will want to redose it. Nothing like this ever happens with, say ketamine.


Ketamine would actually be an excellent start and it's the only one with at least some controlled trials out there when it comes to utilizing it's antidepressant effects. There are also guides for ketamine dosing schedules on bluelight if you try to use it as an antidepressant.


Just so you don't misunderstand me here, diphenidine is one hell of a drug, it's just usually not perceived as very pleasant by people who aren't used to the state. I even had a rough time on my first PCP experience despite having taken plenty of ketamine before I went down that road. 

Basically, there's a high chance you'll just be wondering whether aliens have stolen your brain or someone poisoned you and you're dead. If that sorta shit sounds appealing to you, you might as well give it a go.

You just keep making me more intrigued! :D 


I have unhealthy penchant for that sort of headspace. Like literally unhealthy, when years ago doing loads of PCP and ketamine I had times thinking I was actually inducing a schizophreniform disorder. I feel much better now but I honestly don't know if I permanently changed the way my brain functions at some very core levels!


But yeah, by everything I've read and heard, diphenidine would be just about the worst introduction to dissociatives....maybe with the exception of MK-801!

This times 1000. Great advice. ketamine is a really good beginers dissociative because of the short duration, and because it has a lot to offer in small doses as well.


It's still not for every one. I think it's a bit of an aquired taste too, for some people. But I guess that's dissociatives in a nutshell.

First time I did Ketamine, my online friend advised me to make 5 50mg bumps (racemic k! you need half of that for s isomer which unfortunately is more common these days) and then snort one of them each time I'm feeling the last one, which is roughly every 5 minutes. This way you get to experience the full beauty of the k hole while still being able to stop if it's not your thing. After I felt the first bump I snorted the other 200mg at once and fell in love lol.


Low doses have a bit more pronounced side effects for me that I simply won't feel during a hole until I come out of it. I've heard qutie a few ketamine first timers say "i don't know what to think, it was weird, kinda unpleasant" simply because they took it with other people, lights on, music playing, sub-hole doses. Don't get me wrong, it can be nice with others, but aiming for a hole is really the best way to experience it imho.


Whichever way you look at it though, as Fagott has pointed out, it's amazing for first timers because of it's short duration. Being locked in angel dust hell for what will feel like a day (really closer to 6 or 7 hours insufflated ime) is nothing I'd recommend as a first time dissociative experience.


Also, I totally agree that dissociatives are much more an acquired taste than psychedelics. Ketamine is the easiest to just enjoy from day 1, the others are really nothing anyone would call enjoyable (or only very very few people). Some people though simply won't take enjoyment in this class of drugs at all, not ever. It's not for everyone.

I've been experiencing something which I found quite remarkable. I frequently have dreams in which I enter the headspace that I associate with diphenidine. It's not like I am taking a drug in those dreams or feel like I am under the influence of one, but a switching between realities. E.g. in a dream I had last night there was a room that would take me into this state whenever I entered it.


I've taken my fair share of substances (close to 200) and some of them on a regular basis, but nothing like this has ever happened to me. Sure there have been dreams in which I got intoxicated, but this is not the case with these dreams. It's like I added a new state to the repertoire of states my mind had already known. This is after only having taken diphenidine for 6 times total.


The more experience I gather with this dissociative the more I realize how profound the changes are my brain seems to undergo while I'm under it's influence. To be honest, I figured I should probably go easy on the stuff because whatever long term effects there are, they might be just as profound and potentially not very helpful in leading a functional life.


Still though, those dreams were fucking amazing, every single one. This stuff impresses the shit out of me. There is only a very small number of chemicals that have ever intrigued me like this one (DMT, ketamine, pcp, but all that fascination is pretty much gone as of now, except maybe for DMT). I have a feeling there could be a whole lot of things I could do on it, if I put my mind to it. Even large doses can be extremely dull and uneventful sometimes, but then I've also had moments on it that simply have left me speechless, most notably the travelling into different realities where for example I could be a whole different person, with a different past and everything. This makes me wonder what more there is to be experienced. I'm most intrigued by it's seemingly intricate connection to dreaming. A lot of what I experience on it reminded me of dream states. I have a hard time even classifying this as a dissociative along with all the others, it just seems to be so much more (and arguably less on some levels).


As is easy to notice, I completely fell in love with this one. I had a feeling I'd like it when I read the first reports, but I never imagined I'd be this fucking fond of it. I wonder if the creators of this have any idea whatsoever what beast they have unleashed, maybe someone should drop them an email lol.^^

Diphenidine WARNING (orally vs. internasal)

I tried Diphenidine as a substitute for Ketamine. After hammering mountains of K over the years my tolerance had grow so much that it was costing me a bomb and I wasn't really getting much from it. I thought Id try Diphenidine and methoxetamine as they seemed to be the two substitutes on the research chemical market. 


I'd always insufflated/sniffed ketamine, so I tried the same with these two. I found the methoxetamine fairly easy on the nose but didn't really do much, the Diphenidine  on the other hand was horrible to sniff and blocked my nose up almost straight away. I persevered with it, but found it didn't really do much. The next night, when I had about 1/3 of the bag left (310mg to be precise, I weight it out of curiosity).. I decided to take it orally... all at once BIG MISTAKE! 


At first I was happy that it was actually giving me a hit - and was a nice feeling (similar to ketamine), but the feeling got stronger, and stronger and stronger..until I was completely fucked. ! I started to shit myself as I knew I could do nothing about the stuff already my stomach, and ended up staggering upstairs and telling my wife I thought I was going to die. (not properly concious at this point, obviously)


The next part I can't remember myself but was told my by wife and the paramedics/doctors....


I asked her to ring my an ambulance but couldn't talk properly enough to explain what I'd taken/done. Ended up being taken to A&E in an ambulance and woke up three hours later attached to loads of monitoring equipment in a  hospital bed! In the meantime I'd apparently tried to stand up in this bed (attached to all the equipment) had had to be restrain by the security people. I can't remember any of this!


Anyway the reason I've bothered to write this post (I usually just read other people's posts) is to warn everyone that:


1) Diphenidine taken orally is completely different to sniffing it. 

The latter does nothing apart from block your nose, the former can to what I've described above!)


2) An oral dose of 310mg of diphenidine is far too high. 

I'd even already read on other posts that 50-100mg was recommended , and 125mg was a very high oral dose, but thought I could handle more due to my ketamine history/tolerance, and the fact that sniffing ~600mg the previous nights had done nothing to me. Silly boy!


So that's my story. If you do plan to try diphenidine, DO take it orally, but DON'T take more than a very small quantity at first.


Apologies if you've read this post before, I just wanted to spread the warning around as much as possible to prevent anyone else ending up in A&E and wasting the resources of the already overstretched paramedics and nurses (who were fantastically nice to me considering how stupid I'd been!)

I really appreciate that you at least came here to create an account and warn people of what happens if they are as reckless as you. I will try hard not to offend you here, but please bear with me if I do because I really really feel like it right now.


You apparently did not read a single word about this chemical other than it being a dissociative. You could have easily found out that snorting this chemical is pretty much the worst thing you can do. I will never understand why people feel the urge to put everything they get their hands on up their nose. It's an extremely nasty roa and I know very few chemicals where it would actually be best suited. You could have also easily found out that 150mg would be an appropriate oral dosage for a person experienced with other dissociatives. Would've taken you 20 seconds.

What you took wasn't even a dose I would consider dangerous with what we have hear so far. It was twice a starter's dose. It would've simply had you black out, just like 500mg ketamine would. What caused your stay in the hospital is lack of knowledge about this, or in other words: fear, again in other words: You couldn't handle your shit. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


If you want to contribute to these forums, you get your whole folder from hospital, digitalize everything that's not already digital and let us have a look. If anything was even slightly out of the ordinary, we might at least get a hint of any potential risks that come with diphenidine.


That being said, I have zero dissociative tolerance (but many years of experience with said class of drugs) and 230mg was a great single dose the last time I did it. Not too far from yours at all now, is it? It is simply an extremely strong dissociative, but out of all the ones I've tried it's my number one. A kickass drug that takes time to be understood and appreciated. If you really love your dissociatives, read through this thread and consider giving a smaller dose a chance. If you are a fan of the surreal, take a fancy in lucid dreaming, are curious about existing in multiple universes at a time, experiencing whole lives of fictitious characters, assuming different identities and other very wild stuff that I have yet to find out, this is the drug you want to try. 


Unfortunately it has been given a very bad name by those who can't work their way up dosage wise or simply cannot handle their shit.


One question: Were the people in the ambulance/hospital told the name of the substance by your wife? 


It would be extremely interesting to see the records, you could send them to me personally and anonymize them first (or just give me your trust, but that's unlikely given your nickname^^). The scene might profit off this.


Please be safe in the future and thoroughly read up about drugs before you take them. Also always measure out your doses...

I've had some intriguing experiences combining this substance with a few combos, so I figured I'd find someplace to share.


First, 40mg Diph + 354mg DXM produced an absolutely phenomenal dream state that mostly faded from memory after a day or two, sadly. From what I can remember, I found it extremely comfortable and the usual stomach cramps were strangely absent, plus DXM's unique music euphoria was enhanced considerably. The afterglow was really something else, it felt like what I'd imagine my ideal antidepressant to be like. I wish I remembered more, I'll definitely be giving it another shot in the not too distant future.


The bread and butter of my experience with diphenidine thus far would have to be the way it compliments psychedelics. I've done both 5-MeO-MiPT and 4-AcO-MET with it on a few occasions in varying doses. The pure, raw dissociation diphenidine produces by itself is the coldest I've ever experienced, but it allowed the tryptamines to burn with an astoundingly bright fullness that reached every corner of my consciousness without causing irrational fear or becoming stifling in the least. 


I couldn't ask for a better stage to be set for dropping psychs. Even when going over 12mg of 5-Meo-MiPT or pushing past 40mg of the -MET, there was never any sense that the trip was being guided by anyone other than myself. I was gently but firmly drawing back a curtain on things I already knew rather than the distasteful sensation of having my mind regurgitating a runaway imagination like my 42mg 4-HO-DET trip, nor was it like my 30mg+ 4-AcO-DMT trips where it always felt like naïve questions were being muttered into my psyche regarding existence when I had already come to peace with them during my jaunts with 80X Salvia.


The most incredible of my trips was also the one with the worst planning; that wild night's menu looked roughly like this:


T - 0:00 - 5.4g Gabapentin spaced out fairly evenly over the following 3 hours starting now

T - 0:45 - 110mg Diphenidine, 7/10mg 5-MeO-MiPT/4-AcO-MET (all oral)

T - 1:30 - 25mg Diazepam and I pull out my bong at this point (benzos generally compliment psychedelics very well for me, but I was questioning the safety of this decision immediately after I ate them) 

T - 2:00 - 20mg Diazepam and 30mg Diphenidine, there's a rare and pleasant synergy taking place here that I was certain I wouldn't recall a speck of at the time, so I decided to indulge a tad more

T - 2:45 - Things are kicked into full gear at this point, I'm completely immersed and time is neither here nor there.


Engulfed in the most profound sense of utter peace and comprehension combined with proportion losing all relevance, my body was left completely and utterly behind yet I could still sense it like an organic anchor of sorts. I revisited the structure of the godhead from a broader perspective than I've ever approached it from before. Without the limiting label of "human" to dam the swift river of meaning with uncertainty and apprehension, I recognized it clear as day as being our own unique constants filling the fundamental variable(s) in the formula that determines the unfolding of any given universe within a particular range. 


Upon grasping that this extraordinary complexity is tantamount to consciousness, the view broadened further still and I understood our universe and all its native entities to be but a single bud nearing bloom sitting on a twig shooting off a branch of a truly colossal gatherer of light and knowledge that can be likened to a tree, a metaphor that simultaneously doesn't seem to do it justice yet captures its nature flawlessly. Each bud was a universe, with the closeness and positioning of its neighbors representing the degree to which their fundamental constants differ from one another. 


I found myself unable to maintain steady attention towards our "tree" for long as the pressure of a larger truth, long forgotten and greatly missed, continued to build around me. Like a bolt of lightning attracted to a lightning rod on a skyscraper, it struck me in an instant that our tree was one of countless others of innumerable types, shapes, and every other variable trait imaginable, forming something like an endless forest acting as a vast garden for the cultivation of *experience*, not knowledge, as knowledge is something seemingly in overabundance here. Where this knowledge was located came to me in the same instant the question arose, as that answer was quite an obvious one by this point. It was the essence this forest had entrenched its collective root system deep within to sap a boundless energy that was willingly being given.


After all this, the last realization felt like the lightest, easiest, and most gentle of them all. A moment that's best summed up as a breathless "ah.." washed over me as my identity returned to me. This luminescent, lush, incredibly fine material that emanated such grandeur was the only thing I could be comfortable identifying as "self" not because of an undeserved ego, but because anything less would almost be insulting.


I drifted off in this state of immense relief and the night finally took me. Speaking of being taken, I think I'll be continuing where I left off. I need to lay down, I have a plane to catch...

Lucid as ever as long as I keep it on a single stream of thought, hyperthreading keeps things flowing in a stabilized manner. It's just the pure sensation of the platonic ideal of experience itself unfolding, to call it euphoria is laughable.

Wow, thanks a lot for your contribution. I tried combining with DMT and had similarly impressive results and others had even suspected it would go very well with psychedelics before having taken it, simply judging by the reports.


It really does seem like the perfect dissociative to combine with psychedelics. Unfortunately I cannot currently take the latter, due to being worried about interactions with lithium...

Reading these reports, I am starting to become interested in diphenidine.  Not sure if I'll ever try it but I will if the opportunity presents itself at this point, as opposed to before saying I never cared to try it.

This was very different with diphenidine, even when people were exclusively badmouthing it I figured it's a winner. I just couldn't resist the urge to get some of it.


And I totally agree, he did write a very nice report there.

Over enthusiasts & casualties are equally deplorable. With the amount of rchems being pushed the past few years the majority of these colorful reports reek of shillery IMO...


That being said, i've really enjoyed my sessions with diphenidine lately. If you can handle pure mania, the experience is nothing short of sublime

Deplorable? Well that sounds quite arrogant. Maybe you just don't enjoy this as much as those you call overenthusiastic.

I haven't seen very many as enthusiastic about this as I am. I know this isn't for everyone, a lot of people hate it and for good reason, but I know at least one more dissociative fan who is equally enthusiastic. MXE in comparison seemed mediocre to me from day 1, eventhough I figured it would be a major hit, so I would claim my excitement isn't simply due to this one being a novel compound.

Overenthusiastic would mean my enthusiasm is inadequate, but this substance is huge for me. After having used pcp and ketamine hundreds of times and having dabbled with a few other dissociatives, this is the first one that has ever really added a new spin to the effects. I've rarely fallen in love with a drug the way I have with this one and at the moment I would prefer it over ketamine or pcp any day, eventhough this might change over time. So far, there has rarely been a day in the past 6 months on which I didn't think about diphenidine, eventhough I've only used it a total of 6 times during that time (still too much).


Again: This beats IV ketamine and mxe and smoked pcp for me. I actually thought I was "overenthusiastic" when I first made those claims months ago, but my passion for this substance has only increased throughout the last half year and while you might think very differently about it, that is YOUR opinion. I probably don't enjoy the same food, music or movies as you do, but I still wouldn't call you deplorable for it.


Regarding the mania, it CAN induce mania, but it doesn't always do so. It's quite dysphoric for some people and has been dysphoric for me as well at one point.


Just so we make this clear: It's not like with PCP where hypomania would be triggered after the main effects of the drug have worn off and where the hypomania would last for days, not for me or anyone I know of. I've actually felt pretty euthymic the day after using diphenidine and tend to feel slightly depressed the days after that. However, this might be different from person to person and for some it might induce some lasting hypomania, act as an antidepressant or even trigger manic episodes while others are gonna have to cope with some post drug frenzy depression, just like the trip can at times very dysphoric, at other times very euphoric. This doesn't only vary from subject to subject, but also from experience to experience.

By 'over enthusiasts', i was referring to vendor shills who shitpost overzealous chem reviews to sell the next flavor of the month

(mxe,2-meo-ket,4-mec etc.) Don't get me wrong, i have no scorn for anyone who is genuinely captivated or enjoying themselves. 


After testing a proper dose recently it definitely ranks up there next to dust. i didn't expect anything of that sort with my tolerance ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Sorry, I should've looked the word "shill" up on urbandictionary before I first replied. I'm really twitchy as of late, due to not having smoked pot and whatever the Lithium is doing to me. (constantly losing my temper which reflects on overreactive posts that I later feel were inappropriate)


But yeah that's annoying as fuck, I just got into sort of an argument with one of those low lives in the 'Brephedrone' thread. In retrospect, he might've just been a 0 post brephedrone enthusiast and I might've jumped the gun.


I have actually been worried multiple times that people could think I'm getting paid by vendors for ranting about diphenidine the way I have lol, but it's just that good to me.

You pretty much confirm everything I observed regarding dust which is probably the only dissociative I could compare diphenidine to. Once the excitement of an experience has settled, I used to say it ranks up there with it, but during the experience, I quote "FUCK PCP! FUCK KETAMINE! ALL HAIL DIPHENIDINE!" lol


Too bad this stuff can't really be smoked very well if you want a strong experience and definitely doesn't taste nearly as good as dust. IV is also not an option considering how hydrophobe it is.


While I was able to take PCP daily for quite a long time, I fear this wouldn't be very healthy with diphenidine. I can't say what exactly would happen, but I'm afraid the same thing that happens when you overuse other dissociatives, only times ten. That's the feeling I got anyway, this stuff is strong as fuck. I'll try to make it as rare an undertaking as possible. I catch myself thinking of it so damn often though, so I'm afraid it's gonna be going down very very soon. 


I think it's actually time to write down the dates or it'll end up being like my ketamine love affair where I figured I hadn't done it more than every other week after a year (I had a large stash), but ended up having to admit it was 2-3 times per week.

If you couldn't tell, I dropped a similar dose after finishing the first post without hitting reply and added the last line while the trip was coming on. The second post was from my tablet in bed when the peak started, so please forgive the semantics. The dose was a 130/9/12/1800mg mix of Diph/-MiPT/-MET/Gabapentin 7 days after the previous trip; it was focused on experiencing existence to the fullest rather than deep contemplation. The trip was 100% visual and sensual as opposed to the fluid, somewhat manic epiphanies of the previous one. I knocked myself out for 12 hours with 5mg of diazepam and 40mg of melatonin for some really wonderful rest at the end of the trip.


Low doses of gabapentin are quite benign generally speaking, but the voltage-gated calcium channel activity worries me enough to keep me from adding more than maybe 1-2 300mg pills to future trips involving diph, or better yet just 5-10mg of diazepam to help the excess stimulation. I know that dextrorphan is a L-type calcium channel blocker and I'm more than a little experienced with it as a metabolite of a straight single dose of DXM when there's no toying with CYP2D6, but I was too quick to pull the trigger on the dose seeing how further investigation after the fact seems to indicate that gabapentin affects most other calcium channels considerably more than L-types. Not to mention some mild NMDA activity as well. (Source: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1573104/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1573104/))


There doesn't appear to be any particularly dangerous interactions with CCBs besides enzyme inhibition as far as I can tell, but that doesn't make my choice any wiser.


I had been finding it difficult to keep myself away from diphenidine since I acquired it, but this last trip has left me deeply fulfilled to the point that I don't feel inclined to touch any drug in the least. With exams over and my mind settled in a good place, I'm going to start tending to my health and stashing money for more psychs during a much-needed tolerance break from weed. I've realized that I miss reading books in the town common terribly as well as the fact that my french press would be ideal for making a hefty LSA CWE for dirt cheap. More Salvia is in order before that though, just having it in my room gives me an intense aversion to idleness because boredom gets associated with it before long. Having insanity in a bottle that I can physically put away after I've had enough has helped me more psychologically than any prescribed medication, I start to love sobriety nearly as much as tripping after having it around long enough.

It's my pleasure, I've had a lot of fantastic trips that deserved reports I never wrote. I'd forgotten how satisfying putting them into words can be. A Diph/DMT combo sounds amazing, I've put off trying DMT among other things since I took business ethics and both of my required accounting courses accelerated along with a standard composition class in a single semester. The stash I already had was about all I could keep myself away from when writing paper after paper and filling spreadsheet after spreadsheet.

As a standalone dissociative, essentially every other one out there would be a better recreational choice for the vast majority of people into dissociatives. It's not always wonderful and peachy, 140mg of diph without psychs was intensely unpleasant even with weed, the sharp dose-response curve can't be stressed enough. The OEVs were something else though, everything consisted of deep purples and blues, it would've been fantastic if it wasn't so rough physically. I agree 100% that it's nothing less than sublime if you can manage mania and a trip induces it (as cr00k said, sometimes it does and sometimes it just falls flat), I'd say there's a small chance I would've had a psychotic break if I had taken these same doses several years back before I experienced and learned to handle mania. 


Diphenidine seems better suited as a substance to use very sparingly rather than something for frequent (or even semi-frequent) recreational escapades. Using it like you could with ket or MXE doesn't seem like a great idea. I feel rather less than healthy physically after doing it yet superb mentally. Definitely proceed with extra caution, but don't write it off completely until there's more info to be had.

Well first of all the stuff can solidify to a very firm plastic like material which ruined a lovely small pipe that was just given to me by a friend. Maybe one of those large freebase pipes would work better for the job. Other then that it only ever gave me a slight buzz, no full-blown trip. I have heard people make other claims, but I'm highly sceptical. Another major concern for me is the large doses that are needed. Just seems nasty smoking that much chemical.

I think it might work well with the right equipment and the right technique, but it's not like PCP in this respect which you can pretty much sprinkle/drop on anything, no matter if it's the HCl salt or the freebase and it'll smoke really well. IV use would probably work as well with diphenidine, but neither smoking nor IV seems very practical to me.

I think it depends on what you want and what you dose more than anything. If you're looking for a crazy escape from reality trip the more stimulating dissociatives like the x-PCPs and Diphenidine might not be the best place to start, you'd be better off with Ketamine or even to some extent MXE.


If on the other hand you want to start off dipping your feet in the dissociative water without fully leaving your body behind and enter a more zen tranquil place with a clearer mind I'd heartily recommend starting with a low (60-70mg) dose of Diphenidine, then a medium dose (90-100mg) and a higher dose after that (130-150mg) or a similar scaling up from low to high doses with another stimulating dissociative like 3-MeO-PCP or 2-MeO-Diphenidine.


Just don't redose, take your dose in one go and if it's not enough - take a higher dose in a couple of days time, patience is key with drugs like these - and don't dose too high to begin with, get a taste for the drug before you dive in at the deep end ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I would disadvise using diphenidine without any prior dissociative experience. I'd say ketamine would be a good place to start. It's simply a lot more enjoyable if you don't know what's coming and requires less "work" on your side. Even if low doses would lead to some successful trials with diphenidine, I don't see you taking this to a level that actually gets interesting. Ketamine on the other hand allows you to go for a full dose (->k hole) on your first trial and you will absolutely adore it with a very high probability (I dare say "certainty" if you prepare your surroundings properly).


Don't get me wrong I love diphenidine, it's probably my favourite dissociative, I just think it's even more scary and confusing than pcp and significantly so, so I don't see this working out. We have around 90% negative experience reports eventhough people with some prior dissociative experience have been reporting about it. 


IF you are still dead set on doing it, stick to very low doses as Jesusgreen suggested. That might actually be interesting, especially if you do it with a friend. I don't think you should go much further from there though, before trying some easier dissociatives like ketamine or mxe.


I don't mean to sound arrogant here, but dissociatives like these are really quite uncomfortable, dysphoric and confusing to most people unless you have become used to the state. This is not so much the case for psychedelics or other classes of drugs, e.g. I would trust any psychedelics naive person to smoke DMT.

I think there have been a couple of mentions of low doses here and people generally found the effects favorable, but unspectacular.

I can't commend on actual low doses, but I've taken moderate compared to very high doses and there is definitely a level of dissociation that allows you to function well and not "lose your shit". :D It's just that it's not as reliable to reach as it is with other dissociatives. With substances like ketamine or mxe (pcp to a lesser extent), you can increase your dose steadily and get a proportionate response to the dose you took. With diphenidine there's a turning point where you tend to "drop of a cliff" as someone has so accurately put it. It's easy to step over that threshold, so one really ahs to work out what a low dose is for him and then stick to it without redosing.

The biggest advantage of low doses diphenidine over other dissociatives to me personally would be not getting any sort of double vision which every other dissociative I've used has caused for me. This makes it very suitable for doing things like watching movies (great immersion into the movie), but I'd say it's also fun for chatting about absurd theories and brainfarts with an equally intoxicated friend. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

OK, after having read this entire thread, and having had three experiences with diphenidine on separate occasions, I feel I am finally qualified to post here ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). My experience with other dissos is limited to N2O and K so I can't really compare it to PCP or its derivatives. 


First I would like to summarise some "facts" that I've been gathering about this substance:


1) **It is very important to use accurate scales and start with a low dose like I did (50mg) even if you think you have tollerance on dissos.** I am very glad I was cautious as 50mg almost sent me to space the first time. Another day I had 100mg which was even more insane and surreal, and another time I had 100mg with a redose of 50mg a few hours later. I had a good time but I don't think I would go further than that as there's no point. This stuff is super strong and can some times feel overwhelming. Generally it hits you at about T+1h, lasts about two hours and after effects last for several hours, during which it might be hard to sleep. Could it be that it does indeed activate the dopamine system, but slower and to a less degree than, say, ketamine? I would be interested to see scientific data on the binding profile.


2) **It has been well established by others again and again that this substance is NOT meant to be snorted **so I'm not even gonna try that. If you're a diph virgin, and you're determined to try it, just eat it and don't go above 50mg the first time. You can always do more later, but give it an hour or two first.


3) **There is the potential of some amnesia, although in my experience it's nothing as extreme as benzos.** The fact that in the beginning of this thread almost everyone who tried it was combining it with etizolam seems crazy to me. I find it worthwhile to write down notes while on diph.


4) **It is still not clear if it is a good combo with any other drugs in low doses.** I remember when I was high thinking "boy, this would go really well with psychedelics, especially the ones that have minimal body load. And indeed others have had success with it. Remember when doing combos to always take MUCH less of each substance than you'd take separately. I tried combining it with N2O whippets and the effects just added up, with no detectable synergy. Same thing with weed. I can see how it could be disastrous to mix it with downers, especially respiratory depressants, as it could possibly potentiate them, but this is only a theory not based on any evidence.


5) **It can induce both euphoria and dysphoria.** My experience personally was one of depersonalisation and distance from emotions, almost as if the reptilian and mamalian brains had finally shut the fuck up and the primate brain was left to roam free of all instincts and emotions. (By the way this was exactly my experience with ketamine, too.) I believe that this is the source of some peoples' dysphoria, but personally I enjoy living like a sociopath for a short while. I think it is valuable (from a psychoanalytic perspective)  to get a view of your life while free from emotion, because then you know which of your choices are rational and which are emotionally founded. Some people might feel uncomfortable with such an "unhuman" experience. YMMV. Because the logical part of my brain felt free, at the time I thought I could solve all my problems by just sitting down and thinking about them till I found a solution. I had the feeling that anything is possible, you can be anyone or do anything, YOLO, and all that positive crap! Unfortunately I didn't come up with actual solutions ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) . I'm not kidding myself, the goal here is not psychoanalysis or personal growth, but recreation; i.e. to have a good time. If you gain some insights that's an added bonus but take any "truths" you gain with a grain of salt as I feel like this substance can also lie to you, if you get what I mean.


6) **It can lower inhibitions, much the same way alcohol or benzos do.** You might do things that you normally would avoid and therefore you need to be extra careful and aware of this. A lot of people have already mentioned that you should abstain from facebook because there's the danger of posting things you might later regret. It's not a particularly social drug, although I think in low doses ~50mg it could be fun to do with friends who are also drug-savvy. I had a conversation with a good friend while on 50mg and he said later that I did look a little confused and was talking all the time but unless I had told him he wouldn't be able to tell I was high. There are no visual cues such as dilated pupils or too much perspiration. Still, avoid social settings at least until you're very experienced with this substance.


7) **It is important to keep some drinking water near you and to make sure that your body does not overheat.** This is not as important as with, say, amphetamines, but in my experience it is an issue you need to be careful about if you want a smooth ride.


8) **Yes, a moderator here on bluelight died shortly (2 days) after taking diphenidine. **The idea that he died *from* diphenidine has evolved throughout this thread from a theory to a fact, despite no new information coming in about the incident. In fact this entire thread is a wonderful example of how drug myths get started. We don't know if what he took was actually diphenidine as he thought it was, we don't know why he died two days later, and we don't know what dose he took or if he took something else with it. The fact is that we just don't know.

Mind you, I'm not saying diphenidine is harmless, and yes, sure, it's better to err on the safe side, but all I'm saying is that we just don't know. I feel like diphenidine is reasonably safe since I don't feel much body load during or after the experience and the next day there's little to no hangover. Also I monitored my BP and HR throughout one of my 50mg experiences and they seemed unchanged. But we just don't know. 


9) **Don't expect to fall into a "D-hole". **From my experience, diph does share similarities with K and others have reported that the experience is even more similar to 5-MeO-PCP but it's not really the same. Generally on high doses you're much more likely to put yourself into a depersonalised, fugue state where you might run off and do stupid things, rather than lie on the floor trying to find the reason why the universe exists as you'd normally do in a K-hole.


10) **Some people have tried IV and smoking. **After [15 years of continuous poly-drug abuse](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/441150-What-Are-All-The-Drugs-You-ve-Tried-In-Your-Lifetime-%28Taking-An-Inventory-Of-Oneself%29?p=12338006&viewfull=1#post12338006) I'm still scared of needles, but I'd very much like to know more about smoking it.


Long story short, diph is a fun drug but you do need to know these 10 things I mentioned before you can try it with relative safety.


All in all this is a fun drug to have lying around, I've up to now not  felt any hints of addiction and I think I might leave this in my drug  collection to be available for whenever I feel like doing it. I noticed a  lot of people have hated it, and at first when I read their posts I  thought I had wasted good money for a shitty drug, but then I read on  and decided to try it, which I'm glad I did. I think a lot of people's  distaste of this drug is about the fact that it needs to be treated with  a little bit of respect, not unlike salvia, and most druggies are not  that organised. I know people who have taken LSD and hate it, while we  all know LSD is a wonderful drug that everyone should love. But usually  it's people who were like, "yeah, let's do some acid and go watch a  movie at the cinemas", then it's the same people freaking out and  blaming inanimate substances for their poor life choices.


Crook, I think you mentioned something about **smoking** it. You're the defacto leader, president, and moderator of this thread, so please enlighten us! After how long do you get effects? What's the duration like? How do you know if you need to redose? Also, someone please tell us, is it possible that it would be more readily smokable (or snortable) in a salt form? How would one go about converting it? Is the smoked dosage smaller than oral? Does smoking it change the subjective experience compared to oral? As I have purchased 2 grams of the stuff I would be willing to be a guinnea pig and find out what's the best way to smoke it but please share any info that already exists so I don't have to start from scratch.

^Thanks for that, that's some helpful stuff.


I'm becoming increasingly curious about this one, and not just because it's the only disso available to me ATM. Some stuff I've heard in this thread sketches me out a bit, but others report glowing experiences. I have a decent amount of experience with DXM, ketamine, MXE, and nitrous. I have also dabbled in 3-meo-pcp and salvia. If/when I order this stuff, I think I'll try 50mg. I'm just so very worried about falling into the "it's not working, better take more" trap as I have done PLENTY of times with k and mxe. But I feel like k and mex are quite a bit more forgiving than this one!

@aminophilous

Oh my god, that was the best post about a single drug I've seen in a very long time. I can't believe how well you extracted all the valuable information in this thread and how accurately you presented it. My favourite parts here were the points you made about not snorting it (and kudos for not trying it unlike many others), making notes, the primate brain (eventhough it has a lot more to offer at higher doses) and the inhibitions it can cause which is really useful to know for anyone who wants to try this substance.


I really don't know why you do not post more often.


Regarding point 9, you should edit 5-Meo-PCP to 3-MeO-PCP.


Regarding the smoking... I did do that, but I always used it on top of my oral doses. Smoking used to be my preferred ROA for PCP, but for diphenidine it simply doesn't seem to work that well. I couldn't get a full dose that way, it just slightly intensified what I was experiencing instead of sending me miles away from this reality like an oral redose would have done. It was definitely working, but not sufficiently in order to get a full-blown experience from it. I also had problems with the pipes I used, one of them was ruined because diphenidine turned to a plastic like mass, that was covering the hole and which I simply could not remove anymore. It might work better with a proper freebase pipe, but I honestly can't be bothered to experiment with that. 

I'm usually all about fast onsets, so I definitely enjoy IVing and smoking my drugs, but this one simply does not seem suitable for that. For intravenous use you would need another solvent than water, propylenglycol would work. Unfortunately propylenglycol can be toxic in relatively small amounts (I could check on the exact amounts if you like), so I don't want to go down that road. If a substance is well fit for smoking or iv'ing, go for it. If not, don't force it.


Btw I administer my diphenidine by mixing it into milk, it seemed to come on significantly faster that way, around 30min. This might just be due to the high dosage I use (180-230mg). Btw I really enjoyed 230mg which added a lot to the experience. I had no tolerance whatsoever and only use dissociatives occasionally, very rarely more than once a month and often not at all for 3-6months.


Again I can only stress:

-An excellent post, it should be moved to the first page.

-I fucking love this drug.

You make some valid points.  We don't know as to whether the substance taken was really Diphenidine or not.  I don't know if he had a tester kit as, well I don't know much about anything other than opiates - so you make a valid point that I didn't think of.  I don't really want to say anything further encase his relatives are reading this and it appears disrespectful to them.  I subscribed to this thread at the time to warn people to be cautious as we know that he took Diphenidene but as you say we're not sure if he took anything else with it, how much he took, whether it was Diph etc.  I think, from what another member has said, so please don't quote me, that he may have taken it for the first time.  


Anyhow I just wanted to say that but I don't feel right coming here anymore as I classed Knock as a friend who was extremely helpful even though only knew him on here a few months, so I'll unsubscribe from this thread now.  Others who know more may comment I don't know.  


When we all came here, I don't think any of us were trying to tell anyone not to take it or anything, I'd never dream of doing that.  Just that this is a harm reduction site and if none of us from EADD came to this thread and said anything it wouldn't have been right.  I cannot speak for anyone else so will just say I just advise you all to be cautious that's it really. 


Take care and sorry if any of that came out wrong.  I'm not the best at expressing things at times n have a tendency to say things the wrong way.

I know about the trap you're  talking about. If you only have a very small amount of a substance, then  you're worried that if you don't do enough you might not "get it", so  you're inclined to go for higher doses. Because I had bought 2 grams I  knew from the start that I'm going to be able to do multiple trials so  there was no rush. I even did a 1mg allergy test. I've  done some stupid shit in my youth but lately I think I'm becoming a model  tripper, hehe!


*@I B Profane*: I think with the experience you have on dissos, and if you  are careful to take a small dose, nothing too horrible will happen to  you, at the very worst you might not like it and spend a couple of hours feeling lousy.

*@crOOk*: Because I'm new to the forum! Thanks for your kind words! As I was reading the thread I noticed your posts as being some of the most coherent around here! 


I've been posting as much as possible to get to the point where I can start a blog here. But I don't want to spam, I post when I have something constructive to say.


Initially I signed up on the forum to post about my experiences with 5-EAPB and diph. The info I found on 5-EAPB was miserable at best so I posted a complete trip report and some of my observations after experimenting a few times. Get ready, next I'm going on to Ethylphenidate (admittedly a much more well-documented drug) and from there, who knows? I promise to post a lot! This community is awesome, all the world's junkies in one place on the web. I love you all, you miserable misfits!

@*Evey*: I don't know why you are sorry, I don't think you did something wrong. You just said that we should all be careful (thanks for your concern by the way), and you repeated some info that you knew about this incident. I'm sorry for your loss since Knock was a friend of yours.


But after your post I noticed a lot of people mentioning the incident as a definite diphenidine overdose, which it might have been, or it might not have been. The part where we don't know was just not repeated but was lost, only the scary part of the story survived and was retold. That's why I said that this is a classic example of how myths get started. I was not criticizing you and please don't unsubscribe from the thread just for that reason. I am sorry if I sometimes sound harsh but coming from a scientific background I am used to only making verified claims, and while I have left that line of work behind me, some habits die hard.


I agree with you that this substance requires you to be more careful than usual, if nothing else simply due to how new it is.

STOP THE PRESSES!


New info: I gave smoking a try about five minutes ago and I don't know why smoking doesn't work for other people, it worked wonders for me! After reading [a post over at the drugs-forum](http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=237989), I decided to measure about 10mg and put it in a glass crack pipe. The smoke does indeed taste OK if a little plastic, but more importantly I felt the high in about 2 or 3 minutes. Admitedly 10mg might be a low dose but I'll wait and see. Might smoke another 10mg after a while. My tongue and lips are very numb at the area where the vapor hit me, feels a bit like xylocaine, but more importantly the CNS effects are there if only mild because the dose is a bit low. Maybe it's too early to tell but unless something horrible happens to me in the next few minutes, that's it, I've decided smoking is the best ROA for me, it feels so much more clean and it's awesome how fast it hits you. I don't think I'll ever eat it again, smoking is awesome.


So excuse me, I have to go to space now. I'll keep you guys posted, maybe tomorrow morning ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


10 euro for a proper glass crack pipe = best investment I've made in a long while, can't wait if it works well with ethylphenidate too as that guy suggests


EDIT: OK after smoking a total of 25mg maybe this route is OK but not the best, since I'm not very high right now, I'll wait to see if it hits me more later. And if not I'll do more tests tomorrow and report back with a more conclusive report! Got way too excited for a moment ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But still my breath feels so fresh as if I was chewing a mint gum, that's gotta count for something. Topical anaesthesia FTW!


EDIT 2: It's the next morning now. I ended up smoking about 40mg in total. The high was very clear, minimal confusion but very potent euphoria. You need to keep the flame about 5 cm away from the glass pipe for best vaporisation. If the flame is closer the powder immediately burns up. Overall the experience was A LOT better than the oral route. **Guys I can't stress this enough, this substance is not meant to be ingested, we've been doing it wrong all this time.** I felt a strong antidepressant effect similar to low doses of ketamine and I felt like I was flying in zero g and intense euphoria but almost none of the confusion or depersonalisation. Not sure but I think I also felt a dopamine rush and hints of addictive potential. I ended up staying awake all night, haven't slept yet but feel fine. Just be careful guys and keep doses small, a drug that makes you feel this good has got to be harmful in some way.

This is exactly why I don't like smoking it. I don't want minimal confusion and depersonalization and I try to avoid this type of euphoria like the plague (being bipolar). The depersonalization (a word that usually refers to a pathology and really doesn't do justice to the potential behind this state) is one of the most attractive aspects of the experience to me. I'm pretty sure I explained what I enjoyed so much about the six experiences I had, but either way they always aim for the maximum dosage that will still allow me to maintain some memory of the experience.


I DID enjoy the initial effects of smoking it, but it never really took off like it would've done had I eaten the substance. Maybe smoking a lot more of it would help, but I don't have a crack pipe and I surely don't plan on buying one since I try to distance myself from excessive drug use. A freebase pipe isn't in good hands with me as are needles.


Still it would probably be a good idea to tell people the difference between the two routes without stressing too much which one is superior. Those who are looking for a massive mind fuck go for the oral route, those who want to have a good time with lots of euphoria and slight dissociation, but  without committing to anything they might regret might want to go for smoking it.

Haha I guess you're right. I should be more neutral.


 Also I was quite high when I wrote those comments, I might have exaggerated. It was good fun. I've left the pipe aside for now since it's obviously something that you can redose compulsively. (possible opioid or dopaminergic activity?)


So yeah people, you've got these two equally valid ROAs, smoke it and get a feel-good high or eat it and go batshit crazy. Not taking any sides here.

Yeah smoking PCP which is comparable I would say is also very habit forming. Once I had started, I didn't let go of that pipe for almost 4 months, even smoked low doses at work (as a physical therapist). I can imagine diphenidine to be very similar in that respect.

Agreed about the habit forming properties. Yesterday afternoon and all day today I was thinking about smoking it again but have decided not to. I'll let a few days pass before doing it again. I can see how it could be a drug that you can do at work, especially if it's a boring job. It also seems to inhibit appetite so it's important to remember to eat.


On another topic, I'm beginning to think that combining with psychs is not such a bad idea after all, in fact it might be a very very good idea! Check this out: [Serotonergic agents that activate 5HT2A receptors prevent NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9408919). In the full text they explain that 5HT2a activation seems to be linked to anti-psychotic effects while 5HT2c activation is mostly responsible for the visuals in LSD and promotes psychotic symptoms!  Also they've observed neuroprotective effects when co-administering MK-801 with DOI. I think an in vivo experiment with DOI and diphenidine is in order, mainly to determine if such a combination is practical, since it seems like it would be very safe in terms of toxicity, according to hard science! Will report back soon.

From the abstract:


> It is proposed that 5HT2A agonists may also prevent the psychotomimetic effects of NMDA antagonists. Among the 5HT2A agonists examined and found to be neuroprotective are LSD and related hallucinogens. The apparent contradiction in proposing that these agents might have antipsychotic properties is resolved by evidence linking their hallucinogenic activity to agonist action at 5HT2C receptors, whereas antipsychotic activity would be attributable to agonist action at 5HT2A receptors.

I'm pretty sure that last part isn't entirely true, article is from 1998. From what I know the psychedelic effects were linked to 5HT2A, but then there are psychedelics that are an exception like LSD. I'm not sure if it's entirely clear where those effects come from. Either way that would mean that some of the psychotomimetic aspects would still have to be significantly attenuated which I am pretty sure can be perceived by an experienced psychonaut even with the psychedelic effects from the serotonergic drug being present. In my experience that isn't the case, but while I'm very familiar with both psychedelics and dissociatives to say the least, my experience with combining the two classes is limited to maybe a dozen experiences. 


Anyway, amazing synergy. Nothing one should do with high frequency though. I'm not too worried about frying my brain personally since I try to keep my use occasional and recreational. Habitual use, multiple times per week or even daily definitely doesn't seem like a very good idea, especially not with a monster like diphenidine that hasn't even been researched properly.

I also thought that psychedelic effects are mostly mediated by 5HT2a, not 2c, as did the authors, but their findings suggested otherwise. Anyway my post was tongue-in-cheek, I was just trying to say "hey, look, I'm going to try DOI & diph because of science"! ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


In all seriousness, I think it might be fun to take DOI, wait about 6 hours till the trip is well underway, and then smoke some diphenidine. But I don't want to waste my precious LSD for an experiment that might turn out to be a fail.

This is soo true. Diph definitely seems like it could be a destructive drug in the long term. Even though the whole idea of NMDA antagonism causing real, measurable toxicity or Olney's leasons in *primates* is still open to debate, at least for dissociatives that have not been studied extensively. In fact I would argue from personal experience that even cannabis shouldn't be used with too high a frequency. Not because of any direct toxicity but because of behavioural changes. We've all here done stupid things in the past but just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.


To give others reading this a rough measure of the addictive potential of diph, I want to say that I used it frequently over the past week and I ended up slightly craving it for about two days after last use. Last summer I (ab)used vicodin, codeine and heroin for about a week and the withdrawal I experienced afterwards was at about the same level. Nothing unmanageable, but I can see how it can go out of hand if you don't impose limits to your self. 


In fact I think this should be the main take-away message about diphenidine for people reading this thread, that it can be fun if you like dissos, but can also be habit forming, a lot more so than, say, ketamine. What a sneaky, surreal substance!

My *intention *was to do try to vaporize ~15 mg tonight and see what that was like. I started with what can't be more than 1 mg followed by another 3 mg, just as a sort of safety check. However, with just 4 mg, I quickly felt pretty high and didn't want to go further tonight. Now don't get me wrong: I only got the slightest hint of a dissociative space as such; a tease really. Nevertheless, when combined with weed, I was quiet high.. I was also stimulated, if slow. I stayed up late, worked on a photo project (that I had hoped to do), and had a good time.


I would try more tomorrow night, but I need my sleep these days and it's probably not the best of ideas. We'll see. The (tiny) hint that I did get of the dissociative buzz (literally) was nice and beckoning. My favorite thing about MXE is the DMT-like vibration. Getting lost in meditation there... is ecstasy. If DP has such a space, I with to experience it.


I don't particularly want to lose my head; just let go of it.

*@Listening* I'm not surprised that you got high from vaporising such a small amount. You are wise to take it slow, when vaped, diphenidine is quite potent. At first it works mostly as a dissociative and brings about some confusion and amnesia, but if you do it repeatedly over several days (and you presumably get tolerance on your NMDAs), then it feels increasingly more like a very, very potent psychostimulant and analgesic opioid. Expect all the effects of amphetamine-like parasympathetic stimulation: Appetite supression, increased confidence/social skills, tirelessness, insomnia etc, although it doesn't really make you feel "tweeked" or "wired" in an unpleasant way. I remember thinking to myself, this is way too good to be true, there's gotta be a harsh comedown waiting for me around the corner.


I remember reading on a vendor's site (admittedly not the most reliable source) that it blocks DAT, and also if you check the [wikipedia entry on diphenidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenidine), two of the similar compounds mentioned under "see also", i.e. [Lefetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefetamine) and [MT-45](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT-45), are potent opioids besides being NMDA antagonists. So yeah, get ready for an addictive feel-good high that can last for days. I haven't experienced much in terms of withdrawal symptoms as far as I can tell, but still, be careful. There's also [this anecdotal report on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/22qq6j/diphenidine_is_evil/) which describes its addictive potential as very high.


The wiki article on Lefetamine says


> it showed some effect against opioid withdrawal symptoms without causing withdrawal symptoms itself.
> 
> Click to expand...


As much as I want to believe that there are opioids out there that don't cause withdrawal symptoms, there's a part of me that just knows better. Also, I think it has all the antidepressant qualities of Ketamine, even in very low doses.


And people claim that with rediculously extensive use, diphenidine can cause bladder damage just like Ketamine, but I couldn't find hard info on that.


So. That, in terms of warnings! Other than that, yeah, it's a pretty cool drug. Certainly the best RC that I have tried. The tricky part is that for a while it makes you feel superhuman with no apparent side effects. Common sense says that there's got to be a downside though.


Enjoy and be safe, buddy.

Oh god I fucked up so hard. While I do like to indulge in high doses of dissociatives occasionally, fuckups like these are not usually my style. Here is what happened...


So I had waited about 4-8 weeks since my last dose of diphenidine and have had some 2-meo-diphenidine lying around for a few days. After dropping my daughter off at kindergarten on thursday, knowing I'd have more than a full day for myself, I felt confident enough to dive into 2-MeO-Diphenidine. I initially tried smoking around 40mg to see if there'd be any noteworthy serotonergic action since I have heard such rumours and am currently taking venlafaxine and lithium.


After that went fine and with minimal effects, I started off by dosing 155mg 2-MeO-Diphenidine at T+0:00. The effect were much less intense than I had inticipated. For some reason I remembered having an appointment in around 2h time. Hesitant at first, I quickly made up my mind that I'd be fully capable of taking a taxi to the location of my meeting. LOL! I called a cab, stumbled outside and somehow made my way inside the ride. After riding towards my destination for around 30min I got a call that the appointment was cancelled, so I rode back home.


At home it seemed like a no brainer to dose another 245mg 2-MeO-Diphenidine, to make for an even 400mg. When that again fell short of my expectations I threw 200mg diphenidine into the mix. I felt pretty fine throughout the entire ride, despite being underwhelmed by the effects.


Right before going to bed I wasn't sure if I had taken my lithium dosage, so I skipped it just to be safe.


The next day I woke up with a splitting headache, absolutely destroyed. I had an appointment at the clinic later where I had some blood drawn. It turned out my lithium levels had skyrocketed from the usual 0.9-1.0mmol/L to 1.7mmol/L, which I can only explain by having taken 2 doses the night before. 1.7mmol/L is well into the toxic range which is probably why I slept from friday noon until saturday noon, drinking a total of 7L of water during that time to fight off my splitting headache. Memory of the entire episode is cloudy at best, eventhough i was functioning very well (e.g. I had a psychotherapy session of which i barely remember anything).


I'm just really fucking glad I didn't take that third dose of lithium, which would've meant highly toxic lithium levels. I don't know how much of my headache, lethargy and amnesia was due to lithium and how much to the dissociatives.


I'll be taking more precautions for myself the next time I take this stuff, e.g. predosing my meds and putting a note on the box, putting a note on the door "DO NOT LEAVE THE APARTMENT!", stuff like that.


Despite probably ignoring such advice myself, I'd really recommend anyone, no matter how experienced with dissociatives, to have a tripsitter!

Oh no, crOOk buddy, I'm sorry to hear you had such a bad time, at least it sounds like you're OK now and no harm was done.


Know that we've all done stupid things, even if we're more knowledgeable than the average drug user. I myself came very close to death one time when I was at university. After finishing exams I mixed a few too many 10mg valiums with a lot of alcohol. I never mixed benzos with alcohol again since, and have since treated benzos with a lot more respect, only keeping them for emergencies. I'm sure your experience will teach you to be more careful in the future because you sound like a generally responsible adult. These are potent mind-bending drugs we're using and they have the potential to make a fool out of anyone.


On a lighter note, I was not aware of diphenidine having serotonergic activity. I'm beginning to wonder are there *any* receptors that are safe from this drug? Seems like quite a broad binding profile.


I wonder why your lithium level was high, could it be that you didn't take it twice, but some protein that metabolises it was saturated by the other drugs you took? I know nothing about the metabolism and excretion of lithium but it sounds like a possibility.


Also, can you please compare diphenidine and 2-MeO-diphenidine for us? I'm very curious to know.


EDIT: Reading your post again, I had another theory. 


Sorry for the constant wild speculation, but this is a harm-reduction  site and I think it's important to discuss the details of your bad  experience as much as possible here. Others might benefit from it.


If indeed diphenidine has serotonergic activity, and since you had taken venlafaxine which is an SSRI, and lithium which increases serotonin synthesis, is it not possible that you might have had a serotonin syndrome? Do you think the symptoms you experienced matched [those of serotonin syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#Signs_and_symptoms)? Again, in my stupid years I once took a fluoxetine that someone gave me and somehow thought it would be fun to mix it with some L-tryptophan, my theory at the time being that more serotonin = better high. After a very strong headache, sweating and overheating I think I may have slept for days although to this day I'm not exactly sure what happened. I was a know-it-all idiot and I got punished for it.

Thanks for your concern, it wasn't really such a bad time until the next day when I experienced the lithium side effects (was mostly that headache and some major lethargy). ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I counted my remaining pills and I definitely took a double dose. The measured lithium level supports this as well. Lithium doesn't get metabolised at all, it's simply excreted through the kidneys, similarly to how sodium ions are excreted.


I've had serotonin syndrome a few times and it is very easily recognized as such. There wasn't even a hint of any additional serotonergic activity, judging by how I felt. I also took my temperature a few times and it was normal.


I'm really not a big fan of these wild and unsubstantiated speculations about the pharmacodynamics of a novel substance like these two (not referring to your speculations regarding what could've happened, that's definitely a good approach). Sure there is a chance this has some serotonergic or dopaminergic activity (the latter being much more likely!), but there simply is no evidence to support this. I guess theorizing can be a good thing if it prevents people from combining the respective substance with other drugs, but it's easy to start very persistent rumors like this.


What happened was really just

regular dose --> disinhibiting and reinforcing properties of 2-meo-diphenidine along with an inability to reflect on my state --> multiple redoses --> amnesia --> double dose of my lithium


Btw I do know a lot about harm reduction and would generally say I at least KNOW how to be responsible. Yet there have always been those moments in my life during which I behaved extremely reckless, as if the entire part of my brain that makes me reconsider what im doing had been removed. usually this involves ethanol intoxications, but ive also pulled off some really dumb shit while i was sober. Its really a miracle im alive and have never been to jail looking back at some of those things. Now with these two dissociatives i find myself acting in ways i never wouldve imagined. no amount of precautions seems to prepare me for it either.


About the comparison... I will try, but it's very hard to do so after only one trial of the methoxylated compound. 2-MeO-Diphenidine definitely had a more pleasant body feeling to it, but I never felt as deeply dissociated as with diphenidine; music was greatly enhanced in a way that is completely unfamilar to me from dissociatives, more common to stimulants. mentally it felt very calm, clear and kind of meditative to me, while diphenidine tends to bring on the heavy shit: depersonalisation, confusion and some very surreal states that remind me of dreaming in a way.

For a feelgood drug I would guess 2-meo-diphenidine is a lot more desirable for most people, but those who are into blasting themselves as far out of reality as possible, diphenidine seems to be the way to go.

Do you not keep track of how much lithium you have and how much you have taken?


I don't think it could have been metabolic issues since Lithium is an ion of one atom, there is nothing to metabolize about it like molecules made up of different atoms. I guess it would have to be a kidney issue.


Lefetamine is implied to be neurotoxic in some study though I can't really find any good info about the proof... I really hope diphenidine isn't.


Have not tried diphenidine yet myself, I think I will only do it when I am not regularly taking other things like kratom (taking bipolar medications together with stuff like this just sounds very generally unwise by the way). And I will want to have a trip sitter, at the very least someone who is aware of me staying put at home, like my roommate who would hear it if I would leave through the front door.


[fyi @ lefetamine neurotoxicity - this study: Synthesis, Neuropsychopharmacological Effects and Analgesic-Antiinflammatory Activities of Pyrrole Analogues of Lefetamine]


The lipophilic structure of diphenidine and analogues seems kinda tricky as well, it just binds so damn long to stuff.

Lol not sure if you have read my reply there. 

"Do you not keep track of how much lithium you have and how much you have taken?" - "I counted my remaining pills and I definitely took a double dose."

"I don't think it could have been metabolic issues since Lithium is an ion of one atom, there is nothing to metabolize about it like molecules made up of different atoms." - "Lithium doesn't get metabolised at all, it's simply excreted through the kidneys, similarly to how sodium ions are excreted."


Lithium affects a wide range of organs, not just the kidneys. Kidneys, thyroid, cns, immune system, everything really. The headache, lethargy and polydipsia are all classical signs of a lithium intoxication. It wasn't severe enough to have caused any lasting damage, but it sure gave me a scare. If I had taken that third dose, I could've run into some very serious trouble. On the following I still wasn't sure if I had taken any at all that night and even (quite ironically) stated in hospital that we should probably measure the levels another day, since I might have skipped my dose on the day before.^^

I meant that since the kidneys are involved with excretion, that was the only thing I can think of being affected causing less lithium to be filtered out. But you already cleared up that it was the double dose and not renal deficiency. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Agreed. In retrospect you are of course correct; it doesn't make sense for an atomic element to be metabolised. This is why at first I said

As you pointed out, it could also have been a matter of kidneys being busy with filtering other stuff, but since crOOk took a double dose, mystery is solved.


Also, I wouldn't be surprised myself if Diphenidine was neurotoxic. Even though it has been [patented as a neuroprotective](http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=EP&NR=0346791&KC=&FT=E&locale=en_EP). Or it could be both at the same time, protecting some neurons while frying others. The toxicity debate is still going on for some chemicals that have been with us for ages and have been studied extensively. And the addition or removal of a single atom can often have wild effects on the toxicity of a molecule. So any theory about diphenidine is just that, a theory, and therefore is likely to start "wild and unsubstantiated speculations about the pharmacodynamics of a novel substance" which is likely to annoy crOOk ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


I want to stress again how much perfectly wonderful and addictive it was for me when vapourised. I ended up smoking it over the entire past week, feeling better and better, confident, social, laughing and joking all the time, thinking more and more clearly, being productive and getting stuff done, I felt stimulated almost as if on an amphetamine but weirdly without any insomnia, and generally it was just too good to be true. Till I noticed I was doing it every few hours, with no dissociative effects whatsoever, but with amasing euphoria that lasted for less and less after every successful redosing. I've decided to stop using it on Saturday just to see if there's any downside to the heaven I was experiencing. I've been thinking about it all the time since. I used a lot more than I had intended (went through about a gram in a little over a week I think). Over the weekend I experienced mild withdrawal symptoms, mostly pain all over my body, also felt as if I had a slight fever or high blood pressure (didn't bother to measure it though), and some slight discomfort when I peed (ketamine-like bladder damage??). Today is Monday and after some rest, all negative symptoms have subsided. There is nothing negative about my mood right now besides the fact that my brain keeps coming up with lame excuses about why I should smoke some more. Keeping myself occupied with work and other stuff sure helps. I guess some good old cannabis could also help right now if I had access to some. I think I will have a strong psychedelic trip over the weekend, psychs usually help me in these mini-battles with miscellaneous addictions. Next time I use diphenidine will be after a long while and only after I'm sure I've stopped craving it, and even then I will have to remember to impose limits on my use. On the bright side, the window of sociability and confidence that diphenidine gave me resulted in me making a few new friends and even passing a very demanding aptitude test and interview for a much better job than the one I currently have. I will know for sure if they hired me in a few days, but they were impressed with me and I feel I owe half of my success to diphenidine. I think the most addictive substances are the ones that make you behave like a better person in your regular life. My only wish is that I will soon forget how easy life feels when you're on this stuff. I'm posting this as a warning to others but also to commit to myself about the break that I decided to take from my honeymoon with diph.


@crOOk: Sorry for making wild theories, I know this is how rumors get started but still it's important that you pinpointed exactly what had happened. I was just offering theories so that you maybe could pick the correct one and therefore we could avoid the rumor-creating part which I also hate. Again I'm really glad you're fine now.

Oh yes that makes sense now and it does actually happen in patients who receive lithium and whose kidney function isn't monitored. :D


Btw I didn't want to take the thread OT and turn this about a discussion of my raised lithium levels, but was trying to show what a miserable state my overindulgence in these two dissociatives put me in. The taking a cab across Germany on the peak of my trip was probably even more concerning.^^


@aminophilous

I might've given you the wrong idea there. I'm actually a fan of wild theories, but it's awful when people start to recite them and assume they are valid simply because they read someone elses post. It tends to reach a critical momentum and misinformation spreads. This usually happens when someone mentions the name of a monoamine in combination with a novel research chemical.^^


I also wouldn't be surprised if diphenidine was neurotoxic, but it also wouldn't keep me off the substance altogether. Ethanol and it's metabolites are neurotoxic and nobody seems to take that into consideration when it comes to getting wasted lol. If a brain is being used the way it is intended to be used, it can compensate for a whole lot of damage it seems. If on the other hand someone hangs around watching tv all day long, he will soon give the impression of an imbecile, no matter how intact his brain may be.


However there are of course substances out there (e.g. MPTP) that cause rapid and severe damage that will bring functional impairment. So far, it doesn't seem like this is one of them. Let's hope it remains that way.


Very interesting stuff you have to say about inhaling diphenidine there. I wonder if it could be turning into another active compound somehow. Either way, keep your hands off PCP cause that smokes beautifully and is insanely compulsive. And god does it taste lovely.

I'm telling you this stuff is insanely addictive. I can't stress this  enough, for me at least it was more addictive than smoking pure #4  heroin. I can only compare it with when I was in the hospital and they  had to give me IM codeine repeatedly. When it vaporises it smells and  tastes like burning plastic, but after a while it seems to you like it's  the sweetest thing in the world. Amazing high too. I'm glad to say I'm  not craving it any more and I'm back to baseline feeling fine now. I  will be more careful with it in the future.


I also thought about your theory, that maybe a pyrolysis byproduct is  somehow more active, because vaporising it was nothing like eating it,  but again, theories, theories lol!

I agree with your comments about toxicity, it's always a matter of how  much. Otherwise life itself is neurotoxic, when you get stressed because  of some harsh event, some cells die but it's no biggie. But remember that a substance doesn't need to be neurotoxic to be dangerous. Heroin is hardly toxic but because of its addictiveness you are likely to use it so much that you die of respiratory depression. Nicotine is not very harmfull but if it causes you to inhale tar you can die of lung cancer. Diphenidine is dangerous IMO precisely because it seems so benign at first, but if you carry on doing more and more of it, probably some organ in your body will fail somehow.


I would really love to see some proper research being done on this.


What I CAN say from experience, and this is not some wild theory but a  fairly educated guess, is that it binds to opioid receptors (not  surprising considering the structural similarity to Lefetamine and  MT-45), and it definitely messes with the catecholamine reward pathway  in some way. I have no way to know if it blocks NAT or DAT or if it's  simply an adrenalin agonist, but it felt a LOT like amps but without the  tweekiness and insomnia, possibly because the sideeffects were masked  by the opioid activity. And I don't think it touches the serotonin  system to any significant degree because I didn't feel any drowsiness at  any time. Again, I hope I don't start any rumours here, but I would bet  money on this guess because I've experienced a wide spectrum of drugs  with known binding profiles and I experienced diphenidine for several  days. Maybe in a few months some paper will come out and we'll all be  able to see if I was right.

T+0 250mg oral on full stomach --> onset 5min, 30min full-blown insanity

T+3h sanity creeps in, must find way back to disorder, another 250mg administered. This is by far the weirdest compound I've ever messed around with. 

Yet the sadistic professor demands more experiments on my brain. must comply.


EDIT: Ok, fuck this shit. I clearly went overboard this time. More on it tomorrow.


EDIT2: Ok my latest "trial" was a complete fucking disaster. Maybe I just dosed too high. 230mg was beautiful, 250mg already caused pretty bad amnesia and wasn't very enjoyable at all. However the imaginary professor that was performing experiments on me instructed me to dose another 250mg on top of it. Fucking brilliant. A few hours later I found a very large wet spot in my bed without being able to identify how it got there (since sense of smell is usually severely impaired). I eventually figured it couldn't be urin due to the location and shape of the spot and it could not have been vomit either since it had no solids in it, so it had to be water.

Due to the high amount of diphenidine I took, but even more than that out of disgust of my behaviour that day (uncontrolled abuse of this substance) I puked a few times, all nice and clean, turned my matrass around and put a new sheet on and went back to bed brabbling "happy fucking father's day" to myself. An extraordinarily shitty experience.


It seems I simply cannot tame this beast. Everytime I take diphenidine I feel compelled to redose ridiculous amounts no matter what security measures I take beforehand to prevent me from doing so. This has never ever been an issue with other dissociatives. Even when I am with other people and tell them beforehand I end up convincing them to redose mid-experience. I think it'd be best to stop experimenting with this compound altogether.


Another note about oral time of onset. It seems that it hits me much faster when I have a full stomach than it would when taken on an empty one. I had previously noticed that taking it with a glass of milk instead of water seems to reduce the time of onset from 45-60min to 30min for me. This time I had a large pizza 5 minutes before taking the first dose and clearly felt the first effects at T+8min. At T+13min my face felt numb and some time soon after that I lost track of what happened.

vaped diph mixes well with (moderate doses of) vaped ethylphenidate for the kind of high that lasts for days **EDIT: DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS, READ MY POST BELOW**


eating healthy and exercising helps too


edit: Lately i've been  feeling a lag between action and reaction, in the tactile sensation.  Especially if people pass me spliffs. A bit confusing when doing complex  manual stuff, like, say, trying to roll a spliff. Also pins and needles  sometimes, not unpleasant, it must be from the eph but I wonder what it  is and if it's dangerous. Could it be nerve endings dying or am I  becoming paranoid?

I just took it for the first time: 65 mg.


The pins and needles is paraesthesia, I don't think it is immediate cause for alarm although it should go away over time.


I read about the milk / fatty foods... just drank a glass of milk though I only have soy, not that much fat in it.


By the way FYI about the MPTP, the parkinsonism it caused was apparently mostly reversible. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Took 1000mg L-Tyrosine, feeling better already. No more paraesthesia. Don't know if that contributed though.

Not sure how you even figured it would be smart to take that, seems like that would be the place to start tracing the logic of whether that is sensible. 


Boy that was not a pretty sentence, not feeling eloquent, I am affected. It's screwing with my cognition, my grammar, and I have just started coming up with the buzzing static feeling others have reported as well, and one that is sort of familiar to me from compounds like MXE and 3-MeO-PCP / 3-MeO-PCE.


I heard redosing is relatively ineffective, is that right? Also it seems like maybe it would be good to take this compound in a bit of olive oil, just like how I take my synthetic cannabinoids and Co-enzyme Q10.


Today felt like a good day to try this, my legs feel messed up from training (I might have a little DOMS) and I feel out of it maybe because of quitting a brief kratom streak.


I'm not really interested in going on a long 3-MeO-PCP-like hypomanic stimulated dissociative run, I'd rather cocoon a little, try to eat the right things to get my vitality back.

I assumed that it's a poor signal transduction in the catecholamine system. I first googled and found that others have not died combining it.

Redosing works, at least when vaping. Oral too, but I dislike the drunkenness you feel when you just eat it. crOOk disagrees though. Vaping seems to me more efficient in terms of bang per gram too.


If you redose by oral, I'd go for a smaller dose than the first.

I didn't mean it would be unsafe to take tyrosine... but if anything take vitamin B12 since there might be a link between nitrous oxide and other dissociatives depleting that, and paraesthesia.

Diph is a devilishly nice drug, I'm almost done with the last of my 3 grams of it and I definitely can't get any more. Even 5-6 days after a dose it leaves aches in unsettling places for me now.


I just got an entire gram of 5-MeO-MiPT HCl today and I've been mixing it with doses of diphenidine orally and vaped throughout the day, about 100mg spaced around. I just discovered that it's active nasally as well, though I've never seen such a report. 


Both oral and vaping ROAs have their pros, I usually take an oral dose and vape as needed.

@Solipsis: Thanks for the tip, I'll test to see if B12 is something I need to keep replenishing. It certainly can't hurt. Did you have a good time with your oral administration? I still don't get why you and crOOk like the oral route so much compared to vape. For me oral diph was not unpleasant but mostly just confusion and general mindfuckery, while vaping is more like heaven and eternal bliss. I know that every body and mind is different, but could we really be *that* different?


@Sprack: Didn't you have any trouble snorting diphenidine? I've never tried it but others in this thread have said that it burns your nostrils like a bitch for days.

OK guys I want to stress that this was a very, very, very bad idea. PLEASE NOONE DO THIS. It's wreckless, stupid and very dangerous.


After my last post I got carried away with Eth and got waaaay too high with it, possibly because side-effects such as high blood pressure were masked by the diphenidine. For a couple of days I was like god, the sky was my little blue hat, the earth was my comfy pillow and all the people were put there just for my amusement, so I wouldn't get bored. The world was crystal clear and my mind was racing. I felt invincible. I had some weird ideas like that I should pull out my nails and teeth  because they are not needed and that if I do I will become perfect. This  made perfect sense at the time. Absolutely no sense of danger. Then, fortunately I was so wired I dropped and broke my glass pipe. I started going to the shop to buy a new one because of the sheer dread of not being able to smoke more Ethylphenidate. I fortunately still had some reason in me and at the last moment before going into the shop I decided to go back to my house and throw the Ethylphenidate away. I've never thrown drugs away before and I thought people who did that were stupid and should just take it easy and use less. But Ethylphenidate is something that no amount of willpower can manage, it's like having an unlimitted supply of crack cocaine to smoke. I am soo glad I threw it away. I went through a breakdown Charlie Sheen style, or like the movie Hurlyburly. The most upsetting thing was I didn't know what I was supposed to feel any more, which eventually made me break into tears.


It's three days later now and I'm still high as fuck but fortunately I at least feel somewhat human again. I have some strong but manageable cravings for it which come and go in waves. When I crave it I get sleepy, obviously from the lack of dopamine. I now take Tyrosine and B12 daily and try to eat healthy and maintain a normal-ish sleep pattern. I lost over 5 kilos of weight in a few days; I was eating just a small salad per day with no dressing, which I had to force myself to eat. No permanent harm was done except I worried a few friends with my behavior. I probably fried more than a few neurons too, but at least I didn't end up in prison or dead, although I'm sure it could have happened.


If my pipe hadn't broke and I had gone on for a few more days I would have been hooked for life, I'm sure. This has almost nothing to do with diphenidine, except maybe that it contributed into me getting carried away with Ethylphenidate.


I never really liked cocaine or ritalin anyway and now I never want to take something similar again. Not because it's bad but because it's so damn good. I threw the diphenidine away too, although I didn't really have to, there was less than half a gram left anyway but at the time I felt it was the right choice. In fact I'm sick of addictive stuff altogether. I learned my lesson. From now on if I want to get super high I'll stick to the psychedelics, thank you very much. I got really scared guys, this stuff is evil. It short-circuits the reward circuitry like it's nobody's business, till very soon (sooner than you think) nothing else in life gives you pleasure besides smoking that shit. I am lucky to be back.


Cocaine used to be the most expensive drug, now its analogues are so potent that they are the cheapest drugs around, and are also perfectly legal at the moment. For the first time in history an average joe like myself can get hold of the equivalent of half a kilo of cocaine in some analogue substance. This calls for some maturity, to know that you should not do it, even though noone is stopping you currently. I do not think anyone has the willpower to control such a powerfull addiction.


So, if you mix diphenidine with other stuff, be careful because it might mask side-effects that you should normally be aware of.

I'm not sure if anyone has posted on this yet, but one of the batches of diphenidine being sold has been analyzed by WEDINOS and determined to contain methoxphenidine and phenylethylamine. Just thought I'd throw that out there, here's the sample info for anyone interested: W001151.

could the phenethylamine be the cause for the more stimed effects of vaping diphen ?

could all batches contain it for some reason ?

It's possible that phenylethylamine is responsible for the stimulating effects some people are reporting, however it doesn't seem to match very well with other reported doses of vaporized phenylethylamine, which apparently requires a much larger dose than others are reporting for vaporized diphenidine. Also, it seems like the stimulative properties being described from vaporized diphenidine surpass what people have reported with phenylethylamine on its own, however there may be some interaction between it and the methoxphenidine, or maybe methoxphenidine on its own has stimulating characteristics when vaped.


Also, for some reason I doubt all batches have it since I assume it is being produced and distributed by more than a single source. Also, the sample of diphenidine I have on hand seems to have a more damp look to it, smearing against the bag it's contained in, while my methoxphenidine looks more like the sample picture of the diphenidine, with very small dry granular crystals. Of course appearance doesn't necessarily indicate anything, and this is purely speculation, so its better to err on the side of caution.

You need to buy a proper glass pipe and hold the flame at least 5cm away from the pipe, so it melts slowly. Once vapor starts to form, start inhaling. Don't do the same mistake I did and mix it with other things because you might get carried away. Be careful, it is very habit forming although there was absolutely no withdrawal symptoms both times when I quit it. Weird, eh?

Interesting question, I would worry though that most typical reagents wont work and here's why:


Like PCP, diphenidine has very little reactive groups but instead only basic hydrocarbon components like alkyl carbons and aromatic ring(s), the only exception being the piperidine nitrogen.


I encourage people who have diphenidine and reagents to just try anyway, but if it were me and I only had one shot I'd try cobalt (II) thiocyanate in chloroform.

I guess my hope would be that at the very least it would be enough to rule out the Phenylethylamine/Methoxphenidine batch.

If you go for oral, don't take more than 100mg the first time. I started with 50mg and got strong effects. Expect some loss of inhibition and control, dissociation and possibly some amnesia. Once you're experienced you can even do 150mg. I prefer vaporising it (in which case 20 to 30mg should be more than enough for a first trip) but it's a matter of personal preference.

So far I've gone up to 20mg vaporized. The initial onset is a rush of goodness, but the effects don't last too long. One interesting thing: I was able to sleep without problem, 3:30 after vaping it (at my normal bedtime). Pretty interesting, because I felt at least mentally stimulated, but I was able to relax when I tried to.

If you didn't you should try oral next time, it probably is better (but I haven't done diphenidine personally).  Just because it worked snorted doesn't mean you should snort it when you use it.

This was also my experience. After your NMDA receptors go into full tolerance mode, diph becomes simply euphoric, kind of like an opiate/stim combo but milder. You think you're too wired to sleep but actually you can retain your normal sleep pattern with no problem.

Since aminophilous seems to be quite enthusiastic about smoking this substance, I decided to give it another try. I smoked it off foil which worked very well. Not a lot of heat is required to cause diphenidine to evaporate. I used two "pinches" of powder, probably around 50mg each. Some of the substance solidifies after turning liquid and leaves a translucent, very light brown residue (probably just diphenidine, but who knows) which is much harder to smoke on successive attempts because of the lower surface area. The taste is absolutely vile, not as bad as the metallic nastiness of smoked ketamine hcl though (just don't!), but definitely not as tasty as pcp smoke which I've loved from day one. In this respect it is actually somewhere between those two chemicals, but leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth due to condensating there. It also stings my throat quite a bit, much moreso than strong unfiltered tobacco smoke would. Overall I'd say this ROA is pretty unpleasant, I just wanted to get it over with while I was at it. 


Effects wise there seems to be some slight dissociation, but nothing worth writing home about. I can form sentences pretty well, sound is minimally distorted, my mouth and fingers are a little numb. 


This isn't for me, but it was worth a try and no harm came off it. My earlier experiments with this ROA failed because the mentioned solid diphenidine clogged up the (tiny) pipe I was using. I used to be very fond of smoking pcp (even hcl), much less so mxe freebase, but ketamine was a massive failure. In my book this ranks somewhere between smoked ketamine and smoked mxe, so pretty shitty.


Don't get me wrong though, I wouldn't be surprised if some more people other than aminophilous enjoy this ROA, especially those who find oral diphenidine too intense.

Hey crook I'm surprised you gave it a go. This is obviously another case of YMMV. Very good description of the experience. I want to add that when you get to that clear brownish residue the secret is to evaporate it slowly. Start applying heat, then when vapor comes out start inhaling slowly, then put it off the heat while you're still inhaling because it will continue to evaporate.


I want to also add that I find it hard to smoke chemicals out of a tin foil. I think it's a wasteful method. What I do is first light a candle (helps cut down on your use of lighters) and then use a glass pipe.

So still have this crystal rock diph, m8 had 50mg of his said he felt nout but was smoking bud also, i really wanna try it, duartion cooks orally? I guess the rock form be good to vaporise but i smelt it and it was foul !!! No other smell like it is there! That was when heat was directly applied tho :/ 


so u think 70mg oral of this rock crystal diph will give me a good tester as to whether i got the real deal?

Won't be a profound experience, but should be a very good dose to have a good guess at what you got, but for that you should have ideally had actual diphenidine before imho. If the stuff was for some reason heated when it was in powder form it does form large translucent chunks. I wouldn't really call them crystals.


The powder rock form should most certainly be much easier and quicker to vaporise than the rock because of the larger surface area. That being said, it does smell quite foul. I've always loved the taste of pcp which many consider nasty, but I personally cannot believe aminophilous actually enjoys the taste of this (which admittedly has some similarity to pcp).

Man i still aint plucked up the courage, got like 900mg of this stuff here (a few vendors are stocking the crystal rock now) how long does it take orally, i habe had a long hard day and have had 6mg of etiz which did nothing (tolerance) safe to say im fine anyways, so weigh out 70mg and take this and see what happens? Its 5am nearly and i wanna sleep but i know that aint happening, i jus want some relaxation/ loss of inhibition and really want to see how it compares to mxe as i have never tried pcp

Full moon.


No seriously, you just sounded like you were rushing it and looking for a way to get high quickly which is definitely not the way to approach this chemical. Start at 80mg to get a feel what you are in for. Take a break for a week or so, try 110mg. If you still like it, you can go for a full dose which seems to be around 150mg. I'd strongly advise having someone with you while you, at least when you go for the higher doses.

Guys, vapourised diphenidine is a stimulant and euphoriant and probably a neuroprotective at low doses.

I have a feeling it might cause epileptic seizures at very high doses due to neuronal over-excitation, if you're an a-hole and overdoit. LD50 is unknown as usual...

Also K-like gradual bladder damage might be possible. Definitely a diuretic. It is a tricky substance. 

Personally I'm fine, no worries. These are just theories. Do your research guys. Take care.

Like all things, it's a [double-edged sword](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv8d_ry-u-Q).


peace

Apologies if this has been covered elsewhere, but searching wasn't coming up with what i was looking for and I didn't fancy trailing through all 20 pages of the big and dandy. I am interested in trying vapourising diphenidine, since it has had glowing endorsments in a few online reports.  However, I don't own a base pipe, and have never chased anything off of foil before (in fact, I don't think I even own foil!)  I was wondering if sandwich method in a bong would work?  To elaborate, my thoughts were to pack a dose of diphenidine (I have some tolerance, but probably around 20mg for a first dose) in between some layers of finely ground herb (I was thinking of using mullien).  I would then light the top layer of mullien so that the heat from the burning herb vapes the diphenidine below it.  This is a method which is commonly used for vaping DMT, and I have a good deal of practice doing this.  However, I was wondering if perhaps diphenidine vapourises at a completely different temperature (thus making the sandwhich method unsuitable), or whether there were any other reasons that this should not be attempted.  For instance, should I forego adding water to the bong, like I usually do?  Also, are the diphenidine fumes likely to stink out my bong?  I only own one and would rather keep it herbal fresh if you catch my drift ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


Thanks in advance for anyone who has any input on this

I would just take a pipe, put a screen in, then layer some ash over top, like cigarette ash or weed ash whatever you have on hand aha.. then just just sprinkle the diph on top, light up inhale and hold for about 10 seconds. this stuff can be very addictive, weigh it out first, like 5mg to start... you can always add more, which I'm sure you will probably end up doing, re-dosing seems to be an inevitability. You do not want to use water, and I would suggest using a separate pipe from whatever other pipe you have, as it will ruin the taste forever, don't use this on your everyday weed smoking pipe for example..


Having re-read your post, I would just suggest taking some rubbing alcohol to clean out the pipe afterwards if you do not want to purchase another pipe.. at the very least just take the stem out of the bong, and use that as a pipe, because I do not know if you have a glass or plastic bong, but it would be very tedious to clean it out, if you have a metal stem, its very easy to clean with rubbing alcohol.

FYI at some point in the past I had written a summary of useful info covered here:


[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads...ine-Thread?p=12342888&viewfull=1#post12342888](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/668291-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Diphenidine-Thread?p=12342888&viewfull=1#post12342888)


This is a very old summary, now we know a lot more about diphenidine. Perhaps you could read from that point on, or at least read that one post.


Your method will probably work, I've never tried it. Make sure you know that smoking and eating diphenidine are two completely different things. Smoking 20mg might actually be a lot. Personally I don't find its smell unpleasant or too strong and I don't think it will stink your bong.


Take care and be safe. Don't overdo it first time.

I'm trying to decide how ancient Greeks would spell diphenidine if they had access to it.


Possibly "δί εἶναι εὐ φαίν ἡδύν", or maybe even "δοι ἔὐ φαίν ειδεῖν". Who knows?


Hope you guys have good unicode support on your systems.

Thanks for the replies.  It is just a cheap acryllic bong I have but I do use it religiously for weed so may hold off on this experiment until i can find something more expendable.

I do have a metal stem.... but it would probably be just as cheap/economical in the long run to buy a spare cheap bong or some other piece which would work well for this purpose rather than buying rubbing alcohol, which i don't have much other use for at the moment and it would just be extra weight to carry when I move soon.

Hmm... all I have to hand is gin (lol), would it be a safe assumption that gin would work inthe same way?  I'm testing the waters in a minute with a very small sprinkle of Diphenidine, will report back if there is indeed anything worth reporting back!

Yep definately got a good effect from that 20mg with the sandwich bong method I described above.   Has a more recreational feel than my oral eximents.


EDIT: sorry, being lazy. To elaborate, it is more potent by dose so definately start small.  I can see how it may have potential as an ROA.  To me it seems to be more of a pleasant buzz in low dose type thing, as opposed to the full out near-amnesiac state that oral dosing seems to bring.  Not much of a trip though, and doesn't have much in common with the dissociatives most people will be familiar with via this ROA (i.e. ketamine, methoxetamine etc.)

good to hear that it worked out, gin should work haha… perhaps because you combined it with cannabis the effect was different, try it on its own next time, and i can tell u for a fact, that if you continue to smoke, and up the dose as you go, you will definitely reach that level of total amnesia, can't say that its too much fun though. An hour could pass and you just realize what the fuck just happened where have I been for the past hour lol… anyways good luck its not the same as ketamine or mxe, but definitely has potential as a real mind fuck trip.

vaporised requires much less.

Be careful vaping.  I did not use a scale (battery was dead 8() and went into a fully dissociated state and smashed a few things. . . everything is ok but it was pretty stupid and could have been worse.

haha duly noted. Going to vaping again with a larger dose (or consecutive doses).  Will report with results.


Ideally I would like to be able to sleep by about 3 or 4 at the latest tonight though, if there is anybody online to tell me I'm being stupid then please do!  I have some diclazapam but benzos have minimal success at knocking me out at close to theraputic dosages.


EDIT: forgot to say it is about quarter to one at my location.

Since this thread is disappearing think I'll comment,


Low dose diph(<50mg.) with low dose dxm+low dose kratom tea=exactly as that trip report calls itself----"floating in a soft liquid"

                                                                                                                                         "floating among the clouds"


My wrist from it being broken bothers me a bit and this helped greatly with the nagging pain of it......so yes there are analgesic and anesthetic qualities from it, as from mxe and dxm also....haven't sampled 3meo yet.


Weed helped and stepped it up nicely in combination also.....wouldn't think of doing this w/0 weed.


It was also during the week and I didn't want to push it...


EDIT: In the interest of HR use in smaller dosages and use weed to get where you want to go, thus avoiding amnesic problems......the floating is a soft feeling, both mentally and physically....weed also brings a psychedelic quality into play.

I'd be wary of AMT due to its reported (but methinks very light) MAOI properties.  Still, given how incredibly unresearched diphenidine is, I'd tread carefully.  I'd feel safer combining with another serotonergic that isn't possibly an MAOI.

I've mixed diphenidine with 5-EAPB a couple of times. The doses of diphenidine and the 5-EAPB were both at the lower end of the scale. Resulted in a mildly euphoric, relaxing and nostalgic trip, talking about good times and listening to music which sounded great. Conversations didn't always get very far though as the diphenidine amnesiac properties popped up occasionally. Both times were fun but not earth shatteringly amazing or anything (like mixing ket and MD for example which was the inspiration for this combo. Maybe MD instead of the 5-EAPB would have resulted in a more powerful experience, have no plans to mix them so may never know). As for serotonergic psychedelics, I've combined diph with 5-Meo-DALT and 25b-NBOMe (separately). Really liked the DALT combo though again usually tried to keep doses low, at higher doses stuff could get very weird and probably not very safe. Great fun with lower amounts though. Should note here that I've seen someone react very badly psychologically to a combo of diphenidine and 5-Meo-DALT, was his first time ever trying a dissociative let alone one mixed with a psychedelic and it took him to quite a dark place. No lasting negative effects once the drugs wore off thank god but thought I should mention that for the sake of harm reduction, things can go wrong. 


Diphenidine and NBOMe was an insane combo, in the literal sense of the word, we felt like we were going insane throughout but not in a good way. Can vividly remember one of my mates curled up on the sofa in his own world with no idea what was going on, my other mate staring at the wall and quietly saying "I hate to say this, but I think I'm getting The Fear", never heard him admit to being scared on a drug trip before ever so must have been pretty intense. Was difficult to help either of them as I was lying on the floor unable to move, laughing hysterically at nothing. Was one of the few drug experiences I genuinely thought that I might have permanently damaged myself and broken my brain, luckily this didn't seem to be the case though we were very shaken the next day and it took us a week or so to fully recover. Was incredibly stupid and feel very embarrassed in retrospect to have been so silly, we all started out extremely drunk as well which was why it seemed like a good idea at the time which was even worse. Would very much advise against this combo, especially not whilst drunk! Very unsafe.

also there was a point at that trip just like the "we did it" report when i was in a classical k-hole and feeling internaly one with the universe and all that jazz when apparantly from what my girlfriend told me later(i have no memory from that, it seems that it was my physical body doing the talking) when i was screaming "help im dying sombody help me" so yeah diphenidine is some serious mk-801 shit, if your going to do it do it with extreeme care and a tripsitter is a must !

For me it usually takes me about an hour to start feeling diphenidine, about two hours for the trip to reach it's most intense level which can last for an hour or two, and then a few hours slowly back towards baseline, so I'd say 6 to 8 hours overall (this is for around 80mg to 100mg, much larger doses or dosing more will most likely extend the time of the trip, though tbh if you dose much higher than that without tolerance then you won't know what time is for a while). Because the peak of the experience can be so intense and strange, once you begin to come down from it you can feel a lot more sober than you actually are for a while, so be careful. I don't have as much experience with sniffing it but in my experience you'll get a faster onset (around half an hour to start feeling it properly) and a slightly shorter trip, burns like fuck though and oral seems stronger. MXP times are similar except that usually I'll feel it coming on a bit earlier and it seems to last a bit longer. I've seen it effect people faster or slower before, could be to do with differing metabolisms, body mass etc, so be careful.

I'm not sure about the eye thingy....your dose of diph seems too high....but I think possibly diph may have been influencing me days after. I forgot about an appointment with a client of mine friday,(did the diph wensday,remember) and this happened  before with me getting upset that I forgot. This time however I felt rather "disassociated" from myself ,with the event feeling "distant".Start inception soundtrack now(lol), but it was weird. Maybe just coincidence though.....also seemed to reverse- tolerance to alcohol days after....again maybe just a out-of-control imagination.

EDIT:what I was trying to describe was it promoted a state of detachment from emotional reflexes.

IV use can be done, it just needs several shots to get the dose in.


I'll be buying more tomorrow, I've looked forward to it throughout the past week, after trying it (IV) for the first time last weekend, when I managed to get through a little over 3g of the stuff. INSANELY visual and immersive, after shooting 350mg or thereabouts it hit like a truck, stayed in a hole more or less, having a couple of bongs of herb every time I emerged from the full-on dissociation enough to figure out how to open the bag![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Recently received (and consumed a small amount of lol) some diphenidine crystal, are there any differences between the crystal and the powder in terms of effects? Only had a very small crushed up bit to test the waters and seems to be working well so far. Seems to have hit a bit faster but have bombed a small amount and sniffed a bit (don't do this, fucking hurts) so could be the reason. Is there any reason to prefer the crystal over the powder? Does the diphenidine change in the crystalisation process or is it just so it looks nicer? Definitely don't sniff crystal diphenidine however well crushed up it is though burns like fuck lol.

I tested a small amount of the diphenidine, around 20mg, vaporized. It is quite sweet, and left my tongue numb. Not entirely sure what I feel like at the moment, its my first ever Dissociative haha. Ill probably do a larger dose vaporized soon. I have nothing to compare it to but its a very nice feeling.

1:40: Took 70mg in a bomb and sniffed ca. 10-15mg. Burns, really. MXP is much smoother. Music feels more real.

2:20: Think it hits faster than MXP. Feels a bit more speedy and less dreamy.

7:02: Meanwhile I was sleeping. Woke up, everything was surreal. Remembered that I took diphenidine and am high. lol. It's energizing and chilling at the same time. Floating in bed makes fun. Can not sleep though and don't feel the need to do so. Laughing about my room mate who seems to be fucked up to. Diphenidine seems to be more mellow than MXP. I'm not that numb and just feel relaxed and great. Still thinking it was a stupid idea taking this as a sleeping pill LOL. But everything is great, so it's fine. And it counteracts against the annoying hangover of the MXP.

Black Moth Super Rainbow (greatest band name ever) describes the feeling very good :D

I don't know how the peak felt, because I wasn't awake, but diphenidine seems more recreational and less exhausting/spiritual than MXP.

Mixing it with alcohol is a no go too, I know, but sometimes I'm like

Don't follow my roads, kids. They could lead to a highway, though.

Yeah thats a bad idea, I made the mistake of combining it with Benzodiazepines once, GABAergics definitely potentiate Diphenidine.


Once again, do NOT combine Diphenidine with alcohol or benzos. Bad idea.

I agree that it's a bad combo but for me my experience was the opposite, alcohol and benzodiazepines + Diphenidine or it's 2-methoxylated derivative (Methoxphenidine) led to much weaker less interesting and overall just unenjoyable experiences when compared to how much I loved Diphen and Methoxphen on their own.

Has anyone here fallen asleep on diphenidine? I did some last night and didn't feel much effects so went to bed and my dreams felt way more real than usual, they were all lucid dreams so I knew I was dreaming, thats why I was freaking out a bit because dreams usually feel a bit different to real life. I lucid dreamed the whole night, I kept having false awakenings and waking up in a room full of children every time. I couldn't get any straight answers from them, I was trying to figure out where I was supposed to be but the little bastards kept answering me in riddles so I'd go out the door and be in a city which was perfect for rampaging in. I'd get about 5 minutes of rampaging in then have another false awakening. It wasn't really a false awakening though cuz I knew I was still dreaming. I was right back in that same house full of children. 


Side question: Whats the consensus on vaping diphenidine? Does it work?

norm4n: I hear ya. Did that combo last week.  I was the only one that was on dissociatives too, everyone else was just drunk. I noticed my uncle was speaking a bit aggressively so I decided I was going to subvert his ego. Not in a malicious way, I meant to help him but I went about it in a fairly insane way, I wasn't listening to a word he was saying, I was just staring at him observing his reactions and using that to guage how successful I was at subverting his ego. I was talking in this arrogantly calm voice about how it was inevitible I would subvert his ego that night.

Take er easy. I nearly died a few times by overdoing it with noids whilst on dissos, so I just go much more cautiously with the noids these days. Haven't found myself paralysed on the floor pouring cold sweats in a few months at least lol.

foolsgold: Jesus, I thought I was in a hardcore place, sounds like your really roughing it. What I mean is that to have the balls to drive yourself to these extremes you need to have little to cling to, my everyday drug free state right now is harsh, my dopamine levels are so low due to years of amphetamine use that I'm relatively fearless about mind alteration these days and this fearlessness gets me into some right messes sometimes. The noids thing is exactly like you said too, if done right. I suppose thats how it goes with everything. I mixed iboga with dissos one night, didn't know if I was gonna die or not but I ended up having a great experience.


Bare_head: Just do it:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9J27RaDr5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9J27RaDr5M)

If you wanna be cautious, just start with a low dose like 20mg and get a feel for it. Its only when the dose gets high enough that things get proper warped. On low doses I'm completely functional, I can go about day to day activities even better than I normally can.

Everyone was connected to me through the internet and I was live on sky news. There was this big count down, I can remember this huge event where every one would aquire my knowledge, and it would lead to a dawning of a new era. . . it was like something from a Phillip k Dick novel, , , there was this build up like a 15 second pre cum orgasm but 10 times better, lots of special effects and CGI and BANG it was over, , ,by 9pm i was concious again, Looking back it was a religious experiance for a man who has no religion, a man like me, , , not at anytime did i feel bad, it was all good , , , its been 10 months now and i have just orderd another 2 grams of Diphenidine , , Ha Ha

how by blacking out and ending up on the floor drooling and frothing at the mouth made me have a fit didn't leave any after affects luckily 


just got something called serenity i know fucking branded stuffs is a real no no normally but it was only £10 a gram and i was expecting a stim benzo mix but i found out that it was this stuff so had an interesting afternoon but for some reason it was like a one shot wonder ive tried re dosing  but to no luck


well for the maybe the second time only i have flushed a baggie down the plug hole couldn't get anything but bad vibes off it after the first hit


who would off guessed slipping into that blackness on this stuff that fucked me up so badly at the begin of the year was just what i needed ? 


as you may of gathered i od  and i mean i stopped i really did it this time just took some getting my head around what happen this afternoon and then again this evening heart slowly stopping and everything just to go what the fuck like i had fallen a sleep but it wasn't no sleep  i fucking died earlier today sodding amazing i died i really did and no one helped me back no doctors or anything i died alone in my bed room just let go slipped away happily was at peace with it did even panic just went then bang back just to do the same thing again with a little bit of  BAD TRIP to boot feels like ive been away for awhile but i am who i use to be but not sort of replicated myself as with out doing it if you get what i mean 


sorry but fuck me i did what ive been trying to do for months i offed myself and this time it worked and fuck do i feel good for it

> I dosed 50mg orally at 9:30 PM and watched the finale of Justified on the way up. Mild to moderate feelings of dissociation made the plot slightly confusing towards the end. After that I conducted a phone conversation with a friend with no real difficulty although I had the distinct feeling I was experiencing things from a third person perceptive. At 11:30, feeling quite wonky but not trashed by any means I redosed 70mg oral. Between then and now I have no idea what happened subjectively, or rather, I can tell you that there was *nothing* going on subjectively. I feel that I was fully conscious  but my mind was a complete blank. I'm pretty sure I've just been sat on my bed staring at my banjo in the corner of the room without a single identifiable thought for over an hour. At some point I felt hot so I stripped to the waist and lay flat on my back breathing deeply and evenly with my mind still completely blank. It was about the most relaxed I've ever felt in my life. I guess it could be considered a hole but very different from a hexylamine hole. It was like a zen-like state of non existence. It wasn't good, it wasn't bad, it wasn't anything at all. Worthwhile? I'm not sure I can answer that. It was like being pure form without content. It was either the most boring or most fascinating experience of my life. Or maybe both at the same time.

> EDIT: Reading back the above, I'm pretty sure what I've written is a really poor attempt to put into words what the experience was like. But minute by minute, all memory of the subjective effects of the drug seem to be fading away, like trying to remember a dream. I feel that this stuff has very profound and strange effects on memory. I'm not sure how recreational it is but it's pretty fascinating in my opinion.

What. Oh my god. 

If I'm allowed to ask this- was it brought from a reputable legal site or street? How much and how did you take it?

I haven't bought much.

I'll take all of your advice. I haven't taken ANYthing except k (ketamine) in 10 years. 

Who knows, it might not even arrive- but if it does I'll be keeping you guys close during.

That really sucks, and sounds extreme...!


What happened? Did your heart stop while you were in the hospital, or did it stop according to you and after that you were hospitalized? I'm very curious and hope you are doing okay. Perhaps your info can help others avoid something like that from happening...

I only tried it once and it didn't sit right with me.


Unfortunately people will keep taking this, so considering your reactions including yours, foolsgold, hopefully we can set up a good warning. Sorry that happened to you, however we can't stop trying to add some HR any way we can.


londonkidd - even if you bought diphenidine, know that in my opinion it is not really that much like ketamine... and the way you get 'lost' or removed from yourself is much less safe than with ketamine I think. You don't have to take it just cause you bought it. First just read up some more, it's not as simple as just buying the next dissociative just to replace K.

hospital is still a blur both times it induced amnesia so i am making a guess as to what fully happened to me plus ive abused the benzo since then that the last year is a blur but i was found fitting on both this and mxp around that time at doses of around 100mg which with tolerance is not to great i would say 


now Thursday is another matter  i felt it stop then i slipped away without any panic i was alone at home at this point it wasn't the typical thing ive been through when ive tried taking my life ive normally just  blacked out this time was different still trying to understand it all did it twice first i didn't really click as to what i had do just came round like in dream like stage no real grasp till later that night after i got my head around the second time when i had a bad trip as well which sort of kept me with it for longer 


but like ive said ive been trying hard just lately to end things and this was just that but by accident was not expecting it to happen this just fade way then the is gap then i sort of zombie out


sorry i can't give you a more medical proof but when something like this happens you know 


this is a good side to it as its helped with my split personality problems and seems to of reset my things like mxe and ket can do its cleaned my receptors

It sounds like floodlight may have an allergic response to these types of drugs. Or taken too much? 

I've heard horror stories from others about k but to me its rainbows and cotton wool, everyone takes to toxins very differently.

I don't think there is a direct ketamine alternative but I've waited for months for it to return, it's not happening and when it does its awful. It's more anxiety, cravings and a runny nose from what is 'k' now. Very few rainbows.

So I think I'd rather know what I'm putting in my body and take the safest precautions I can.

I am nervous though, I'll update x

Just to add- it's the escape I want the most. Nothing like acid (I know I mentioned rainbows!) I want the feeling of all the stress going away and taking me somewhere else.

Most uppers made me feel horrendous, even weed makes me 'too high'

I know most feel k is major, but I just find it relaxing and close to perfect- until I go to far continuously and then it's dangerous and painful.

Moderation! (she says...)

Be careful jumping from 80mg to 120mg, the dose/response curve of this drug is very strange and once you reach around 100mg and above it becomes much more weird and intense than such a seemingly small increase in dose would suggest. Won't be the same for everyone due to differing tolerance/metabolism etc but definitely worth bearing in mind, weirdly small difference from feeling relaxed and slightly dissociated to being utterly unable to process life around you or how to react to it. The dissociation tends to come on very suddenly without warning as well so can be difficult to prepare for. If you get the dose/situation right it can be very pleasant but cos the difference between mild effects and full on mindfuck is so small it might take a couple of goes to find out the right dose for you. Sorry to hear about your loss, diphenidine probably isn't gonna help not gonna lie but I'm sure you already know that and this advice is pretty hypocritical coming from me. Take care.


While on the subject of diphenidine I've been seriously considering getting rid of the rest of mine (throwing it away, not taking it all in a blaze of glory lol). Out of every drug I've tried it's probably the only one where I've had more shit times on it than good ones, and some of the worse and most traumatic trips I've had have been whilst under the influence of diphenidine or MXP. The scariest thing for me is despite this happening I've still continued to get them in now and again, and even talking about it now makes me think about it a lot... It can be almost like an abusive relationship lol, even when it fucks you over hard theres something about it that keeps you coming back... Definitely one of the most fascinating drugs I've done but I don't think it's had any lasting positive effect on my life and god knows what the future side effects could be like. Amazing that in the UK literally any moron with a credit card can get as much of this as they like off the internet whereas something like K is nowhere to be found...

It is my understanding that dissoc. anaesthetics like diphenidine/MXP are rarely addictive per se. (Deleriants like DXM even less so due to the prevalence of foul hallucinations). 

Anyway, up-up-dosing or 'chasing', or compulsive use of Diphenidine is unwise. 


Ket, mxe, diphenidine & pcp antagonize NMDA, complicating memory & learning.

Do dissociative anaesthetics cause brain insult with chronic use? Who really knows yet.


I get pleasantly polished with vaping around 30mg Diphenidine..  185lb. male, 30's, with seldom/occasional DXM use. Plus some real trippy RC shit analogues back in the day (2012).

Vaping the 30mg I found 'indicated' by a trusted U.K. vendor. No pain. Why/how would you do it otherwise?


Anything can become addictive. Just don't order more if you feel you're jumping the rails. It's not like quitting opiates after all.

Vaporizing Diphenidine is pretty good. Dosage is much lower.

Hopefully Ill be getting more on Monday along with some Methoxphenidine ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Gave this one a spin yesterday. It was my first dissociative in about a year or so, picked it up along with some MXE. First I took a cap of 75mg which kicked in surprisingly fast and left me in a very laid-back, yet definitely dissociated state within less than an hour. The effects were very mellow and non-manic compared to MXE or 3-meo-pcp, and felt a little on the "softer" or "jellier" side, akin to how I might describe a medium dose of K. My speech was barely impaired at all, but I definitely started to get the fuzzy 'amnesic' effects which others describe. At around the 90-minute mark I vaped roughly 25mg which definitely kicked the trip back up a notch, but only really served to extend the peak slightly at that point.


After about 2-3 hours I felt myself getting pretty close to baseline (which was very quick compared to MXE, though in retrospect I'm not sure how close to baseline I really was...) and felt safe to bump an equal dose of MXE. This rapidly led to the confused, couch-locked state I'm all too familiar with, and in general left me as a bit of a blob. I was still somewhat lucid, it just required all of my effort to think straight. In the future I probably won't combine these substances, and am not sure why I did in the first place. I guess I'm just seasoned enough with dissociatives that I felt fairly safe doing so, and at no point did I feel at all in danger or psychotic, but still it was a bit much.


To me it felt very "clean" or benign, almost moreso than MXE or 3-meo-pcp. I have minimal experience with dxm, which always felt very "dirty" to me, so I'm not sure where all the comparisons to that come from. Perhaps it's just that warm jelly feeling. All in all, from what I remember, diphenidine seems like a very worthwhile substance. I found it much more warm, easy-going and "chill" than nearly any other dissociative I've tried, and will definitely be repeating the experiment with a similar dose sometime soon.

Somehow vaped Methoxphenidine doesn't feel the same as Diphenidine... But I'm still surprised people are eating it instead of just vaping in a glass pipe.


EDIT: scratch that, mxp is just as badass as diph when vaped ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Just start small and increase dosage gradually till you're there.

Diphenidine (at least for me) works sometimes below your conscious level at least 3 days after dosing. I got giggly, laughter(enjoyably so) whereas usually lately I haven't felt so for a long time and it was a change. Other times it is different, but be aware in the days after when you think it was over, it's not. Unlike mxe and dxm in this regard.

I vaporized a crystal of this and I feel great. Nothing like MXE. Clear vision, euphoria, it feels caustic inhaled but it can be an aquired taste. 


I ran through 10g of MXE freebase. I wanted to order more MXE but found I had a few grams of diphenidine so I vaped it and felt fantastic. I'm vaping more now and will report back on the experience. 


Do you guys freebase this or vape the hcl?

FYI about MXE vaped... in my experience it's fun but it doesn't even come CLOSE to being as good of an experience as oral dosing.  Oral dosing of MXE is my favrite by a good margin of any ROA I have tried (snorted, oral, smoked, rectal).  Smoked comes in third place, behind nasal... it's fun but it's not deep at all and you end up using a shitload more than with oral dosing.

Got a gram on Friday (only ordered half but the vendor sent 1 full gram)


Shared with a friend over the course of from about 4pm Friday until 7am Saturday,  all snorted


started off with a small line which I was only doing an allergy test and within about 10-15 minutes I was nice and floaty, feeling nice listening to music


the next few lines were more or less the same, really chilled out, happy, dissociated


as the night went on I started getting more and more fucked


I turned my tv off at about 1 am and tried to sleep but I was more fucked than I thought and I went into a weird dream like state although I was still awake


felt really tired and groggy the next day


overall, a decent experience but at times I was really out of it


I have done it before but never had it off this vendor and this stuff felt stronger


I'm extremely experienced with Ketamine and this sort of felt similar (at times)

Hi guys new here reading this thread just prompted me to post.

Reminded me of this one time floating through the stars it was like I just got parked inside the middle of this orange gas giant. Right in its core. I swore I was supposed decipher or inscribe some ancients texts right on its core or something. Eyes closes eyes open all I see is orange and its like if I don't do it this planet wont get made or something. So I stick around trying but its just orange. Think im done for cos I never quite made it. Think I worry a little for the familiy maybe take maself to hospital increase my chances. However next thing I remember however many hours later is just head up room check everything is ok straight back to norm! And that was just one time!

I am not usually a reckless drug user. I use meth/heroin 2-3 per months max, and have for years. I work 40 hours a week as a fitness consultant. Its not normal behavior for me to redose like I did.


I am suffering from severe anxiety still. Alchool and Seroquel does not seem to help at all. Which is odd. Slept 5 hours in the last 48h.

I took over a gram. My GF told me i did not look like I was having fun.. but was compulsively redosing.


Starting dose was 80mg oral. I had over a gram within a 5h period.. which i dont remember.. I have 60h of video recording of the experience. I look like i have severe respiratory distress.

Wow, that's intense man, and scary.  When a substance can make you black out and you still want to redose... that's dangerous.


That's impressive you can use heroin and meth 2-3 times per month and maintain that... I have met very few people who don't spiral out of control on heroin/opiates.

The tales of blacking out with continued redosing and severe amnesia reminds me of the release of Phenazepam...

I did that with phenazepam... I ordered 100mg of it along with 3 grams of methylone... I took some methylone, had a great time, felt stimulated, took a bit of phenazepam... took more methylone, took more phenazepam... next thing I know, it's 3 days later and I have only smatterings of memory, and I can't find the phenazepam bag (never did), and the methylone was 100% gone... don't know how much phenazepam I took, but it was pretty scary.

Sounds fairly typical, I'm glad I never used it.

I'd sworn off benzos at the time of its release. 

A lot of the horror stories seemed to come from completely careless dosing - no scales, no volumetric dosing, just sticking fingertips/toothpicks in the bag or emptying out a 1,000,000mcg bag and trying to eyeball 500-1,000mcg from it....

Dont get me wrong here. I had times during the last 8 years using meth for months and heroin/poppy tea continuously for a year over.. but the amount of money i have saved during the last 3 years from using with moderation is great. I also compete in powerlifting, so drug usage can really fuck you over with training and nutrition.


It been 4 days now since my last dose of diphenidine and I still feel intense anxiety. I also seem to have now paradoxal reaction with a bunch of drugs. Benadryl give me intense anxiety. my tolerance to morphine is back to when i first started and is the only thing that seem to help with the feeling i have. Caffeine make me very jittery at 30mg. memantine at 20mg seem to reduce anxiety, so does smoking. I do not normally smoke.

A lot of NMDA antagonists can lower the tolerance to certain stimulants, opioids and probably drugs from a number of other classes. So that thing about your morphine tolerance is to be expected. I would assume the anxiety will pass within the next week, like most post acute dissociative effects. Some get manic, for some it just attenuates or entirely relieves their depression, you seem to become anxious. Don't worry, it'll pass.


As far as accurate scales go, they won't save you from the urge to redose this drug. Despite being very experienced with otehr dissociatives (Ketamine and PCP mostly, but also MXE, DXM and some PCP analogues, most of these intravenously), I do not recognize myself when under the influence of (oral!) diphenidine which is very scary. I have made firm plans to not redose, hung up notes on my scale etc, yet I tend to redose even higher than my initial dose until I lay on my bed as if I was braindead.

I've been using a scale with 30ug precision, but that doesn't really help at all... Obviously. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Sure why wouldn't it? Our minds are very resilient, it can recover from even the most severe psychotic episodes (depending on many factors though). But yeah, I would expect 2 weeks of these after effects max. Just try to stay off drugs for a few days (especially pot if you are an occasional user), keep lifting heavy ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) and soon it won't be more than a memory. At least that's my prognosis.

I woke up feeling much better today. My first 4 night after the incident, I was not able to sleep more than 3 hours in a row.. feeling wired but tired in the morning and night.. but could not fall asleep. I have used morphine pre-bed yesterday and got the best 12 hours of sleep ever.. anxiety is much lower now.. Sleep and food/vitamins are a great tool for speeding recovery.


Edit: 90% back to normal!

Might have been said already but if you're looking for something like Ketamine or MXE, diphenidine is not that thing. Seems to me like its just a pure dissociative and that's it. Not very recreational more of just physical effects, no mind fucks for me. Gave me a disheveled feeling and quite uncomfortable. I have a feeling they are similar to Methoxphenidine or Methoxmetamine.. Lame ass drugs not even worth wasting money man..

It is similar to methoxphenidine, and quite related chemically... methoxmetamine (MXM) on the other hand is quite different from what I understand, and a worthwhile drug somewhere between ketamine and MXE.  Haven't tried it yet myself though.

I just want to add that this drug should not be used if you have epilepsy. I had quite a few seizures on it because i never remember my epileptic attacks. Besides that i find this a great drug. I wouldnt know which dissociative to compare it the most. Ive had D holes on this and that were my greatest trips on this. After a while i was never able to reach this anymore. I always dosed orally because sniffing it is so painfull.

When i swallow a dose it takes mostly many hours before it starts working. It seems to metabolise very slowly for me. And then i get an enjoyable buzz for quite a while. I been through about 35gr of this stuff. I think methoxphenidine is a very different substance. The highest dose of diphenidine ive used must be about a gram, perhaps more. But ive got strong tolerance for most drugs so dont be surprised. The vendor i got it from also called it 2MEO Ketamine. Is this also a correct name for this stuff? Im looking forward to trying MXM but it wont be for a long while. And for people worried about my high doses, saying it is irresponsable, do not forget that i am immortal untill my task on earth is done. 


Peace, bluelight.

Haha hell no, look at the structures. Unless he was referring to 2-MeO-Diphenidine and accidentally said Ketamine instead of Diphenidine, it's time to find a new source. People like that don't give a fuck if you live or die. Probably one of those greedy ass chinese pieces of shit. They're a disease but there's no way around them if you want good prices, be it legal or illegal products and not jsut drugs either - Everything. No racist.

^ I wouldn't be too quick to assume you've been working with Diphenidine itself if the vendor is capable of getting the *name* mixed up with 2-MeO-Ketamine then god knows what the product itself actually is ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Are you sure you aren't thinking of Methoxphenidine? For that can also be called 2-MeO-Diphenidine (but *not* 2-MeO-Ketamine)?


2-MeO-Ketamine and Diphenidine are completely very structurally different, and very different in effects and dosage too.

Diphenidine is a strange drug. It was the second dissociative I have ever tried, DXM being the first. first tried diphenidine in mid-December of 2014. At the time, I had a scale waiting to dose this particular chemical. After an allergy test the day I received it- that night I weighted out 80mg of the substance as my first oral dose. 


I ingested it in a gel capsule, and about 30 minutes later I joined my family for dinner. After a fulfilling meal,and  about 45 minutes after ingestion, I began to watch TV while waiting for the effects to kick in. It was about this time that I realized I was heavily under the influence and experiencing novel effects. I first felt a beautifully warm, vibrating sensation throughout my body as I sit on the couch watching tv. It is this initial feeling I've grown to love diphenidine for.


It is now, nearly 4 months later, that I post my first report of the substance. Just yesterday I had received my 3rd shipment of the chemical since my first. First 2 were 1g orders. This was 500mg. I am now heavily under the influence as I type this for you bluelighters, my first post on here. I have learned vaporization is my preferred method of use. Although, this substance now lacks the euphoria I associated it with in my past use. Therefore, I will discontinue my use for a short while. I am dissociated, but there are no interesting qualities to this drug that would motivate me to use it in the future. 


I wish I had access to alternative dissociatives to compare them to, but I do not. Although I have tried a gram of quality mxe recently, and I must say, it was much more enjoyable visually. Then again, much more physically, and mentally impairing. I believe that this new piperidine group of dissociatives have much potential, but mxp and diphenidine are not "it". 


I will also like to introduce myself, as I have been what you may a consider a "lurker" for quite some time. My name is Ledbetterp3, I enjoy researching drugs both through experience and through reading. I am particularly fascinated by hallucinogens. I love science of any topic. I tend to hoard information from forums and fail to give my contributions so I do apologize to for that. I would like to post more, but I may fail to become a regular simply because I am much to lazy... Maybe bluelight will be the first forum I shall become a part of? 


Maybe not...

It's nice to forumally meet you guys too ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) It seems you are new yourself, Dalai, but thanks. I have to note that my future posts shall be more sequential as long as I'm not intoxicated haha.. But I'll keep that one the way it is. 


In order to contribute to the forum, I'd like to note that someone in drugs-forum is warning of impurities in recent diphenidine batches being distributed from a, as I quote, ""big" RC distributor".

I'm not in the loop on this one but I would guess leftover possibly toxic precursors and such. Seems like it's been a problem with previous diphenidine batches IIRC.

Hi! I just registered (after years of lurking, of course!) for warning you all about this substance! I'm an experienced disociatives user, having lot of experience with ketamine and MXE (On the past abusing them on a daily basis for two years). I've also tried 3-MeO-PCP and DXM on the past, and never got a problem with disociatives like the one I had on diphenidine. 


Prior to this bad experience, I had about 4 experiences with diphenidine (same batch, and analyzed by Energy Control) and had not a problem with it. I found it less ejoyable than MXE, ketamine or 3-MeO-PCP, but still giving a good disociative chilling effect. This weekend I dosed arround 100mg. Two hours on it I was enjoying myself so much that I redosed with arround 50mg. Next thing I remember is waking up on hospital. Aparently, I have been arround the house like a zombie, talking incoherent stuff, cooking and lefting the electric fryer turned on... And aparently, I keep redosing until finishing all the bag (Arround 500mg that I had left). I managed to reach my parents bedroom, ask for help and told them I overdosed on diphenidine, and after that just collapsed on the floor. They called the ambulance and they took me to the hospital, where I recovered without any problems.


But it could be worse. Instead of entering my parents bedroom I could exit the house and take the car, or something worse... I can asure you that blacking out, but still beeing able, somehow, to move arround and do things without beeing conscious of yourself is scary as fuck!!!! Huge amnesia from that night.


So be careful! I won't try it again.

Hi all. First post after lurking on this awesome forum...


Since the big Ket drought I've decided to try the RC route. I used K on and off over a year. Nothing to serious but grew to love this drug solo, to vibrate to the hidden dimension with audio and visual stimuli.


Had a bit of a Google session and having missed the boat on MXE, (gutted) came to the decision that Diphenidine and Methoxphenidine is the route to explore. So ordered 500mg of both online along with some .01 scales.


As long as its been since I stepped off and as much as I'd like to go for it, thanks to the Info on this forum I decided to take it easy. Haven't eaten for 5 hours...


Male. 6ft. 180lbs.


DAY 1. 5mg allergy test sublingual.

T+00.30 Feel no different. Maybe slight indigestion. Probably psychosomatic. Weigh out 50mg and bomb.

T+01.30 Watching TV on couch and listening to some electronica. Music is sounding slightly better, nothing else to report.

T+02.00 Put on some trippy visuals in HD, everything seems sharp and my head is super clear. No feelings of disassociation to report of.

T+03.00. No real change. Feel quite content but this is far as it's going to go. Would like to redose but made conscious decision prior not to.

T+04.00 Decide to call it a night. Go to bed, fall asleep instantly. Vivid dreams.


Woke up after decent sleep. Felt fine. No afterglow or anything else.


Day 2. 110mg bombed on empty stomach. TV on. Chilling with dog.

T+01.00 Nothing going on. 

T+02.00 Miniscule wave of vibrations up and down body. TV seems further away. Something's happening for sure.

T+02.30 Put on discovery programming about space. Remember thinking the people on the show are really cool. Some cool space graphics make me start to feel like I'm being pulled gently in the direction of travel. Quite fun. Remember seeing the sun on TV and actually feeling it's warmth.

T+04.15 Have been pretty motionless in a slight disso bubble. Felt very chill and content. Similar to an oxy buzz. No visual to speak of. Think i watched same space show over. Not quite sure. Slight amsesia. Refrigerator hum was annoying. Went to get stuff to weigh out a 50mg redose, slightly confusing while doing it. Decided against it although I wanted to ramp it up. 

T+05.00 In bed listening to beats. Cannot sleep. Feel stimmed up. Surfing smart phone for few hours. Phone size seems massive then really small. Very sharp and bright display compared to normal. Close eyes and see like a grey static. No interesting CEV to report. Fire up an astral projection YouTube video, float around a bit which was interesting then crashed out.


Had about 6 hours sleep. At least three realistic, vivid dreams. Slight fuzzy head cured by a cup of coffee otherwise fine.


I may try again in a week or 2. And will do a 150mg Max solo dose. Has some slight feelings of K at times but, for now, not something I'm really fussed about.


Will try the Methoxphenidine next week sometime.


Cheers.

I think it's really pretty good - but your always going to get mixed opinion given this families unforgiving nature.

As for impurities - are we talking about the necrosis guy? Had been on a total bender with anything he could find and some impurity was theorised but nothing ever turned up even after some was sent for testing. That isn't to say there couldn't be impurities but that's been true of many things; even without we don't know th safety of this or MXP which seems to have had a lot of side effects listed. This stuff always been good for me; there is certainly caution needed though; a lot of people have fallen foul of it blacking out: titration is needed - doesn't look like redosing, incautious use, large jumps in dose is good at all with these things; that seems to have been the main mistake with these phenidine things - you can't casually overstep the mark.

Best way to get an opinion on that is to read the thread, and look for trip reports.

Dosed this orally a few nights ago forthe first time (done it snorted a hand full of times) and was completely out of it. Near death experience / out of body experience  (I wasn't actually close to death just tripping that I was 'being upgraded'.


Wasn't a nice experience, won't be having again.

> Sure you can combine the drug with any other drug. Nobody here would be bold enough to tell you it is safe though. Generally speaking, dissociatives have successfully be combined with empathogens and psychedelics, especially ketamine. However we know next to nothing about the two substances you plan to combine. Tread very lightly.

Hey everybody, long time lurker but this will be my first post since there isnt that much info on this chem and I've been having quite a lot of fun with it.

So I've tried it at a different dosages, that is 90mgs, 110, 120 and 130 + 140 after peak (all doses oral and measured). In between the 90mg dose and 120 I wanted to point out that there was a signifiant increase in the strength of the high ( time elation, visual and mental activity...) and when I dosed 140 after the peak from 130 it was just plain ridiculous, it definitely felt like an overdose but I didnt really black out like others have reported, simply feel like I've been living for ages in the space of 15 minutes hahah. Was fine afterwards. There's one thing that has been bothering me; I get asthma during spring and after the peak it always seems to hit me. Now I'm not sure if it's just a coincidence or if the drug kinda triggers it, or perhaps this is what people call "respiratory depression"? It is an opiod analog afterall. Also wanted to point out that caffeine during the trip is a bad idea because it seems to affect me 10x and the over stimulation is sort of uncomfortable during dissociation.

Does anybody else like the comedown very much? I think it's amazing, there's this kind of animalistic idgaf attitude that comes with a very euphoric, pleaseant aggressiveness. Well, thats pretty much it for my input. One last thing, Alfred f*cking Hitchcock movies are THE SHIT on this drug, seem to fit perfectly with the experience.

I was just smoking bowls with dashes of diphenidine, no problem. Small, 10-20 miligram hits mixed with cannabis. Felt fine, though I was baseline. Maybe 5 of them today.


And then I went to cook some potstickers for myself. Sprayed the pan, poured in oil, started cooking. Took a piss. Then this weird imbalance took over me, like too much alcohol. Then darkness, and I woke up on the floor making strange, gibbering sounds til I got a hold of myself.


What happened?

I had long since bypassed the subjective peak, and at least felt, near baseline. It was sudden blackness, then back to normal, albeit on the floor. It had been at least an hour or two since I'd smoked.

Yikes, me and my friends have also been smoking some of this stuff this weekend mixed with some weed. Doses around 20 mgs split between a couple of guys. Nobody had any trouble though. How were you smoking it? We used a vape, could be when the chemical is actually burned say in a regular pipe it gets more toxic ?

Smoking it out of a bubbler, just a bit sandwiched between flower. I was thinking that burning as opposed to vaping could affect it. It could also be that I'd still smoked it multiple times during the day. I'd say, no matter the case, exercise caution.


It's worth noting that I've never fainted before.

I was alone. That could be the case. To try and put the way I felt into words.


I was making food, but I suddenly lost my appetite. I moved to turn off the stove, and I felt a distinct and powerful dizziness take me, then darkness. My eyes opened and I became aware of shapes, though I did not immediately associate them with the objects around me. I then gained sense and was back to normal.


If that helps to shed any light. Upon more research and reflection, it in fact seems likely that what occurred was a seizure. How terrifying

And the urge to smoke more is still there. This is some shit, indeed...

well, it sounds like smoking diphenidine is a bad idea in general, but even then i think you smoked too much.  Dark Nepenthe above reports being okay smoking 20mg split between two people.  you say you smoked 10-20mg 5 times in a day.  are you eyeballing?

I was eyeballing, don't worry about it. Seeing what happened, it's only sensible to be buzzkilly. Henceforward I will stick to safe and sane oral doses.

That is odd. Nobody can tell you. Dissociatives are supposed to knock your ass out, but not at those doses. Go see a neurologist if this happens again. That's not normal.

No kidding though, be careful with that substance if you had such a reaction. My advice: Flush it all.


EDIT: Come to think of it, sure it wasn't just a regular syncope? Have you ever had those before? You were sitting down. Got up, blood rushes to your legs. Swoosh good night. Happened over 100 times to me. Still, no one can tell you what happened for sure.

postural orthostatic hypotension!


also known as the cause of so many cannabis freakouts/fainting spells. anything that lowers blood pressure will increase the potential for this kind of stuff.


like you probably found out, if you don't interpret the signs and symptoms pretty quick, you wake up on the floor wondering what happened. best to sit down wherever you happen to be in future.

I considered that, especially because correlation does not always equal causation, but I'd been standing up the whole time. It's possible the diphenidine caused some blood-pressure mischief and that's what knocked me out. Without someone seeing me I guess it's hard to tell. 


Thanks for the assistance and speculation no less, I've not dosed since and there's no urge to, but I hate the idea of wasting good drugs.


As much as I hate dying though? ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

Probably late to the party, regardless my experience if not a bit  muddled. Started taking this the other night after having been out for  two quick beers. Must have taken about 250mg spread over the course of 4  hours in 50mg bombs eyeballed. This was all combined with some weed,  beer and a skip full of food. Can't say I noticed a lot over these hours  other than body lightness and a non descript numbing of  senses. Was only watching tele and playing video games. Really noticed the effects though afterwards when I went to bed.  Lay down watching space videos on my laptop when I suddenly felt a  feeling that can only be described as a strong vibration pulsing through  my body. Felt like I was lying on the wing of a plane as it was being  sucked into a deep vortex. My whole room seemed like it was swirling.  Felt for what was perceived as the slightest moment complete darkness  and loss of any directional axis whatsoever. Blissful. Came back up  quickly and had a look at the time on my laptop. Had only been away for a  half hour or so. No sleep for the rest of the night as it felt like I  was flipping whenever I closed my eyes. At no point did I feel overly  concerned whatsoever. Overall I would say this produced a very cold  experience comparable to mxp without the manic tendencies. Enjoyable if  you just let it wash over you. Had the same comedown today as you would  mxp, fuzzy elation with gorgeous auditory enhancement. That is all, hope  it helps.

Tried  diphenidine at 30 mg plus 45 mg an hour later (orally).

Enjoyable to communicate, be at party and listen to music, similar to average between alcohol and weed (I don't use either, tho). Memory gaps are real, half an hour can pass in an instant, like in a dream, and you vaguely remember what happened. I will maybe repeat it, but second part was taken too early/too much. 30 mg enough to relax and have a little fun. Made me pretty manic and confident, too (nice thing in party, because I have social anxiety among a lot of people I do not know well).


Note, I seem to be pretty sensitive to alcohol and dissotiatives (totally contrary to psychedelics)

I have extensive experience with Diphenidine but all of it has been vaporizing and smoking the stuff (in crystal, powder form and varying doses)—About 15 minutes ago I ingested 162 mg of Diphenidine HCl orally followed by a cup of water on an empty stomach.


Rolling some tobacco and there is 100mcg of Clonidine and a little bit of alcohol in my system to mitigate some of the neurotoxicity of this compound (if any, at this dose, with my tolerance, ...) 


If the amnesia isn't strong, I'll come back and report my findings. I love you folks!

well, I don't know if smoking diphenidine is a bad idea. Sorry, let me clarify: Smoking anything is a bad idea, and we're talking vaporizing not smoking right? anyway, the thing with vaporizing the stuff is that you can titerate your dosage up before you're too messed up to know any better. I would say to hide the bag and pipe if you go this route, or any route, because this compound does cause memory loss and amnesia and you may "wake up" finding that hours went by and you're only aware of this fact because the bag is empty and the drug is out of your system.


Diphenidine DOES cause slurred speech, impaired motor skills and heavy blows to short term/episodic memory. This is something to be taken seriously. After months of vaporizing this stuff on and off I feel that my tolerance and general knowledge of this substance have been helping me stay safe with regard to the slurred speech that's OBVIOUS to anyone you attempt talking to (they'll know you're fucked up beyond belief and it's a very worrying image, like the Ether binge scene(s) in Fear and Loathing..), memory issues which I take care of with copious amounts of Clonidine before/during/after, a healthy diet and sleep schedule. Of course, the fact that I can take a few tokes of this and not feel retarded is alarmingly. My friends will take a toke and babble nonsense for hours and have amnesia afterwards, while I can hit the pipe continuously for hours on end with no adverse effects (and no real insight either, I do it because the stuff makes me feel relaxed.)


There is a tendency for mania to be triggered at ANY INTENSITY at ANY POINT of the experience, with ANY DOSE and ANY ROA. I have NOT been able to get my head around what causes the mania and to what degree but combined with the memory/motor impairment this can be damn dangerous. Careful!

Sorry, let me clarify: Smoking anything is a bad idea, and we're talking vaporizing not smoking right? anyway, the thing with vaporizing the stuff is that you can titerate your dosage up before you're too messed up to know any better. I would say to hide the bag and pipe if you go this route, or any route, because this compound does cause memory loss and amnesia and you may "wake up" finding that hours went by and you're only aware of this fact because the bag is empty and the drug is out of your system.

I had two women in my life and after using about 400mg of diphenidine over several hours I looked at the clock and it said 7:24 I immediately thought I missed dinner plans with this one chick so I called insane got in my car and then called the other girl to tell her she was a jerk for not texting me back all day. Crazy shit. Seriously I use mxe like a fucking lot and this shit just made me question myself for a second

SWIM bought three grams of Diphenidine powder from an online UK vendor. SWIM had read that nasally, this chemical was not a wise choice.


So the person who is definately not me decided to inhale a small line anyways, it hurt that person like hell and the sting/burn lasted quite a regrettably long time, but that didnt deter him/her, SWIM sniffed another couple of lines (roughly 0.1g each) to no avail, no effects after 45 mins whatsoever so decided to bomb 0.2g in a rizla paper bomb.


Twenty minutes later, after a bout of absence of patience...ended up bombing another 0.5g ...  and then another .3g shortly after as SWIM though this chemical was inactive (and not worrying too hard because he or she was pretty tolerant to ketamine, MXE and opiates...still a big mistake).


Around half an hour after the last dose SWIM started feeling tingly and dizzy, very much dissociated but with a darker twinge to it, after that SWIM cannot remember anything apart from what his girlfriend at the time had told him.


Apparantly SWIM had managed to crawl to the kitchen in a hole, and returned to the room with a large kitchen knife in one hand and a melon in the other, crying... babbling the words "can you help me cut this please?".


SWIM came round in the arms of his girlfriend completely oblivious, his skin felt kind of stretchy and almost damp..with a painless pins and needles and it took around an hour for the effects to wear off. watch out when taken orally and dont be a nob about it, SWIM was very much taken by surprise and went to a distant land only to return confused and fuzzy.


Definately dissociative, Definately blanks you out and definately should be done in moderation.


SWIM should not have taken a gram orally in under an hour. 2 gs left over were left well alone for at least a week until he repeated almost the same dosage again. SWIM dosent know why but he kept going back until it was gone even though he lost a few long moments of his or her life.

Ahh! How is the whole "SWIM" thing still going on? Don't use it anymore, everyone knows it was you who ate and snorted the diphenidine. 

Also, why did you continue to dose once you thought the substance was inactive? Especially without giving sufficient time for the drug to onset? That's extremely dangerous and could have had much more severe consequences. Please be more careful in the future, no one wants to hear another heartbreaking story like the young man who stabbed his mother to death on methoxphenidine.

Wow man, yeah, a gram of diphenidine was incredibly reckless, did you read about dosage levels beforehand, and how it takes quite a while to come on?


And also, yes, SWIMing is against the rules here, though I do realize it's required on some forums.  We don't allow it here because it doesn't do anything to protect you whatsoever, and it makes posts more annoying to read.


Anyway I'm glad you're okay, but you should do more research in the future before trying something new, or you could end up in serious trouble or dead.

Hello Crook,, Sorry but I may as well start this with someone who sounds like he knows how to communicate in a style that I respect.... OK,, so the 3-flurophen stuff's a decent stim but I'm not bothered and rebel against the drug itself. Played that extended mix of Clair de lune on that, Diphen it is then - but I see the bar as trying to shadowbox in a robo-K-wonk 'ole. Regards Crook

Hello Crook, you may not know me, but I don't know you. 


Wait, I mean we don't know each other at all, but I have read many of your posts over the couple months. Specifically in this thread, since I found myself to be interested in diphenidine quite awhile ago and I noticed that you seemed to be one of the very few who actually enjoyed it at the time. So awhile ago, I had some very crazy time binging on this stuff and slowly ruining my social life - thanks to you.. 


Ha, just kidding! I definitely enjoyed it. Anyway, I haven't noticed you posting in Bluelight's Ephenidine thread which leads me to believe that you may have not had the honor to sample this substance as of yet. If that's the case, I'd highly recommend it and I invite you to post your contribution over to the corresponding thread in order to fill in it's gaps of lacking information. Having enjoyed Diphenidine, I must say that Ephenidine blows it out of deep waters. This, of course is my subjective opinion, but I have hopes that you may agree once you are able to try this beautiful drug. You know, because it's always great to discover a new dissociative that you really enjoy.


Anyway, I will be expecting you to join me in my lonely adventures with the chemical in time. Whenever you are ready. 

Much love and dissociation,

Led

I'm gonna agree with Dark Nepenthe, the comedown is stunning to watch films on... I recently took 55mg IM seconds before watching The Matrix, and the whole "re-birth" sequence totally blew my mind as I peaked. I found myself linking my own life to that film in so many ways, and end up afterwards just sitting there contemplating my life, in a very pleasant way. Also agree with the Asthma thing, my throat always feels a tiny bit strange on it, and I'm not even asthmatic. I'd almost say it feels like I'd imagine bronchodialation to feel like (and I know Ketamine is much loved medically for this effect), but it does feel weird.

‎

Personally, I'm very fond of it in moderation! Much over 60mg IM and I "hole", but that hole is totally wiped from my brain, so I don't bother! Looking forward to some other dissociatives in my life too! Everything in moderation ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ‎


I also find that every few doses (I probably take MXP or DPD twice a month) I end up feeling INSANELY happy and motivated the next day, ultra-functional! Lovely little bonus to it!‎

It's hard to take this drug in the slightest bit seriously after first dabbles. 

I'm gonna try again but first impressions reminded me of an anti-psychotic that just turns your mind to slurry so you don't have thoughts that may sit uncomfortably with other psychiatric inpatients who are also zoned out on this dip-shit nit-wit mongoloid sherbet.

I believe someone said pretty much everyone here was part of some hideous cabal whereby we've all been ass-raped by diphenidine.

Here I go again. Any further insights above this being the R.C version of Risperidone / Stellazine I'll let you know - but my prediction is the 2 grams of this shit is pretty much the only R.C I leave to gather dust. 

Thanks

OK - around 400mg snorted . Easily controllable for me if you're used to doing things semi challenging whilst on this horse-shit, I showered and exercised easily. Less zombifying than initially suspected. Not enough to lump it in with the anti-psychotics but certainly not a patch on very heavy doses of the 3 PcMO stuff if you like K-holes but basically twaddle.

I do think for me a major key to controlling your trip on these longer lasting 'so-called' dissociatives is being able to talk yourself around if you find you're starting to get crazy. I'm forever arguing back to myself with thoughts and don't really see this coping mechanism as multiple personality-esque as much as constantly affirming that you're still in the drivers seat,, your doing the drug rather than the drug taking over. I don't think I'd be able to do the quantities I do if I was with others and din't have the opportunity to mutter to myself quite frankly - that's just an observation but I sincerely think context and confidence is crucial particularly with these sorts of drugs.  

A BIG FINAL AND in conclusion,  I was fine with the burn and drip of the snort but still had a bloody nose in the shower hours after insufflation.

Not great imho.

Right - final thoughts on this garbage,, it's just a wrong'un. I hadn't read the thread by mental Kenny about diphenidine but PLEASE DO READ THAT.


Last night I bombed a further 400mg of diphenidene out of boredom primarily because I'd been awake in bed all night having ran out of my medicated Mirtazipine.

 So I parachute it,, watch most of Naked Lunch perfectly fine still in bed then nod off for half an hour. I presume something happened more than just sleeping but can't remember any particular issues more than sleep then wake.

Around 6 hours after having consumed it I'm awake and just typing away feeling a quite sludgy,, kinda 'sandy' feeling which I apologise is a hopelessly bad description of the feeling but pretty compus mentus nontheless. 

Then from literally out of nowhere I have something resembling a semi-psychotic hole'ish experience relating to my computer and said device vibrating and morphing. Not so much dissociative as a psychotic break really. But crucially,, just for like,, maybe 20 minutes out of nowhere.


Anyway,, having just read mental Kenny's experience that's it for me regarding this shit. 

The thing about K is you snort it and I knew what was coming on pretty dang soon. This shit is hell to pay with the sinuses and it's random effects at any given time for me at least really aren't worth it. 

From an initial experience with it feeling more like a brain sludge anti-psychotic to the evil nosebleed 2nd time to the totally out of the blue 20 minute weirdness 6 hours in I just think this drug is fucking crap and not worth your curiosity. 

To have the gall to call it a dissociative comparable in any way to Ketamine is a fucking insult to that wonderful substance imho.

Even MXE,, meh - to be honest having done that quite a bit years back I fucking hated the longer come up and the tendency toward just insanity rather than dissociative K-holes but this stuff's way beyond that style of ludicrous.

Read mental Kenny's report (which fair play has a load of dodgy R.C's attached to it) but for me I simply think anyone that's even thinking about dabbling with this shit that isn't used to tried and trusted K holes with a watcher should steer WELL CLEAR. And I'd say the same for anyone quite frankly.

I must say I've had comparitively better effects off of the Methoxphenidine but even then it's clearly not a classic dissociative and much of the positive to it as I recall was about having a spring in my step the next day but of these 3 new (to me) so called 'dissociatives' I'd only consider buying 3-PCMO again and even then only if it were cheaper as I found I needed quite a bit to get something like a K < MXE experience.

None of them come close to tried and trusted Ketamine for me (in controlled circumstances obviously). 

It's just a sad shame that I took that drug to the limit whereby I was pissing razorblades on half gram lines and once you've been there I've found my tolerance levels never really came down again that much.

Sorry for sounding a bit snarky in this final report but I seriously wouldn't bother with this one whatsoever and I've been around these types of drugs too much,, and this one in particular just seems to take the piss in annoying but possibly VERY dangerous and unexpected ways especially if you were out and about.

I basically had a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to hearing about a blanket ban on psychoactive substances in the U.K and having got fairly bored by now with all the usual 'head-shop' stims and incenses I thought what the hell and bought quantities of diphen, methoxphen and 3-PcMO and can really only conclude that none of these new novel dissociatives in any way break the mould and the longer onsets really dampen the classic Ketamine which in the area I now live in is virtually impossible to get unless going to dark-web territory which quite frankly is a bit too risky for me. Anyway I think I've learned my lesson. Stay safe guys. 

Thanks.

Did 400mg recently, just felt like head trauma. Almost felt like I was losing control of my actions, and strange feelings like I was missing limbs/completely insane.


Low doses are ok, definitely not a great drug though (and I like dissociatives.)

best drug in the world when smoking it. seriously it takes about 70-80mg to get me in the hole. i first weigh out on scales 70-80 then drop tobacco over it and mix it all up then roll it up using small silver rizzler then smoke it. i usually put headphones on and listen to music when smoking, the music sort of reminds me that im still with reality when blacking out and in that trance like state. it has definitly helped me figure out what the good things in my life are and also how to deal with the bad things. people try this method!

Lucky me, I’ve been given .5g of diphenidine. Would anyone who has taken this fascinatingly weird sounding chemical care to shed some light on the side effects they have noticed regarding personality, mental state, social skills etc? I’m talking days, weeks, months after your experience? As an example of what I’m looking for, I vaguely recall in my robotripping days that after a strong trip I’d have difficulty with conversation and memory, part of a general 'mind fog', for 3-4, maybe even 5 days, and manic/depressive for x amount of time after a more mild trip. I was more naïve in those days, though, and didn’t really focus or even particularly care how my brain was affected by my ‘experiements’, these days I’m a wee bit more cautious…

I was just curious if anyone has used Diphenidine to a similar effect? I just love the way you get sucked into the film and can feel your body morphing and what feels like it melting into the bed. With a tolerance like mine im expecting i'll probably have to dose about 150mg if it is even possible to achieve a similar sort of effect?

I just snorted roughly 90mg and am watching Sword Art Online II, this is my first time giving it a try and I'm already feeling it after only 5-10 minutes, been looking forward to giving this a try and so far I'm not disappointed, stung like he'll though heh. I think sword art online is a very fitting anime to watch while taking a dissociative like this, if you know the anime and dissociative then im sure you get it. Finding it difficult to put things into words properly lol but I'll try and keep an update of my experience ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

what the hell is it with you people those doses are massive anything over 200 mg is nuts not very pleasant. I think this shines around 90-130 mg.

Dissociating yourself into oblivion, that's your prerogative ... but just in case it's MXP or another drug that is more potent, I'd recommend taking a small test first. Anyway this is more than a week overdue..


Really messed up shit has happened with people taking way too much PCP-analogues or diphenidines. I get self-destructive behavior, taking high doses knowingly but at the very least take a few precautionary measures. I'm not sure to hope from what side that door is locked..


And Obi Wan is a Wanna-be, even says so in his passport.

Curious about carcinogen via pyrolysis (smoking diph) and dealing with tolerance. 


After I (not SWIM, but me, the guy writing this post) moved from insufflating the HCl to smoking freebase cocaine, vaping meth etc, I found this ROA to be ideal and addicting in its own nature. The convenience, near instant onset, safety profile compared IV (though for K, MXE salt and 2C-* I may IM sometimes) but most likely the ritual of loading a pipe and getting the perfect hit. Insufflation is "slow release" and oral is simply out of the question due to time of onset, higher dosage required, but I may give it a try with diphenidine. But I bring this up because I began freebasing (or smoking straight) anything I had. MPA, freebase MDPV, 5-MeO-MiPT, 4-AcO-DMT, etc. When I ran out of things to smoke, which at the time was 10 grams of freebase MXE crystals, I only had a 1-2g bag of diphenidine crystals sitting beneath my now empty drug collection. I had never given this substance a chance because after a few small trials, MXE and K blew this stuff out of the water, at least for the experiences I was seeking at the time. 


I read that pyrolysis may result in carcinogenic byproducts. How sure are we of this? 


and also, what other ways can I use to reduce my tolerance to the point where Diphenidine is effective again. I miss the mania, finding profound interest and curiosity in otherwise mundane things, the return of pleasure I normally felt from things I enjoyed doing. This drug helped my depression big time. It's just beginning to lose its efficacy and I can't keep pushing the dosage up not knowing the consequences.


I've never developed such a strong affection for a drug. A real addiction. Except for K, 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCMo and MXE but I have to let those go for now, due to lack of available vendors, high prices given my tolerance or any other reason.

I did a few grams of diph last year and it really wasn't that bad. Between snorting/oral/sublingual the best ROA for me was probably oral because sublingual would fuck my taste buds up so bad I couldn't taste right for days. Low doses were actually pretty cool and showed glimpses of the magic of MXE and DXM. The first time I took a high dose (sub-hole) it was really crazy though. That was probably the most confused I've ever been in my life and definitely the most scared I've ever been on a dissociative (and I've plugged ridiculous doses of 3-MeO and MXE). I actually ended up having to call someone over to watch me until I came down. I just got a little more of this, pretty excited to try it again for the novelty and old times sake. Oh yeah, the antidepressant properties were great as well. It lends to some physical discomfort when pushed so I definitely wouldn't use it like MXE or even 3-MeO.

I've got through 2g of diphenidine in the last couple of weeks combined with things like MPA and 3FPM.  Intially I did this orally, but the come up takes forever.  So I switched to my fave ROA, intravenous.


Initially a bit of a shitter because it doesn't dissolve in water and ended up clogging up 30 gauge needles, so I found that adding a minimal amount of VitC (what you would use to dissolve heroin) and applying small amounts of heat lets it dissolve quite efficiently.


Intravenously it's quite nice.  The onset is quick, at larger doses, combined with 3FPM (nice) or MPA (dirty but okay) it hits like a train so you have to be prepared for your journey, this might start before you've finished your shot and before removing the needle, so make sure if you do experiment by this route you have the mental ability to remove the needle and if you can't replace the cap in time at least put the syringe somewhere you're not going to harm yourself or someone else.  If you're thinking of listening to music, then you probably need your earphones in or whatever before you start to push the plunger.


Via IV the journey is over more quickly and much more powerful, time passes quickly, it's not an unpleasant but you need to prepare for slurred speech and balance and coordination issues afterwards.  Have water nearby (a bottle with a top will help to stop you throwing it over yourself).


Lower doses via IV certainly help business conference calls when working from home pass by nicely.


I'm not sure I'll be buying any more diphen.  Mixing small amounts with your fave amphetamine helps to give you a nice weirdness, if that's what you're after.

Wow, I'm sorry about your friend if he's been diagnosed, my uncle had that and it's one of the worst you can get. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  Unfortunately I'm not sure if it's really known.  I will say that smoking chemicals introduces additional risks because of pyrolysis and that I'd be really leery of smoking these new things, especially the phenidines.

Yea, Marauder, with this anecdote you've contributed more than you're hoping to find out from others. Until there is a confirmed link, no one can know for sure, and I think that regardless of whether it is carcinogenic or not, the chances of a confirmed link ever being discovered are remote. In other words, you're taking a chance.


Then again, we're all taking chances with these little used chemicals, but it seems reasonable to believe that vaporizing will have a potentially higher risk than oral use. Is there some reason to believe that diphendine is particularly risky in that regard? I'll leave that to the chemists here, but it's still just going to be an educated guess.

.300mg clonidine 2 hours prior to smoking a cigarette. Vaped diphenidine and experienced symptoms of increased cranial pressure (ICP), but this is subjective. 


Perhaps it's best not to mix vasoconstrictors, blood pressure medication and diphenidine without being extra careful.


My very limited search on ICP and NMDARs.. Ketamine has been shown to decrease ICP but MK-801 does not decrease ICP. don't quote me on this. This is a serious and potentially fatal side effect of messing with these compounds. Stay safe.


The internet is no authority on this and one should not take this into your own hands. Any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure is a serious life threatening emergency.

I wish I'd seen that last post prior to insufflating 30mg on top of 90mg oral; oh dear. 


This is, without a doubt, the most disgusting powder I have ever put up my nose. In HCl form, it refuses to form nice lines, it feels like snorting sawdust, it has a bizarre taste immeasurably worse than 3F-PM, EPD, ketamine, MDMA, or...anything, actually. 

Crikey, I found a substance I hate more than DXM


I normally pride myself on writin-

Yeah, no, trip report tomorrow; apologies, this stuff is suddenly kicking my ass. Welp. Farcry 3 seemed like a good idea /prior/ to ingestion.


Oh boy.

Brief TR summary:


Dosing schedule-


T=70mg, oral

T+0.5h= 20mg, oral (changed mind on dosage, decided to up it)

T+1.5h= 20mg, insufflated (was feeling zero effects, it seemed like a good idea at the ti-...yeah, bad idea.

T+2h= 30mg, oral


That was...strange. Not quite as strange as MXE (which induced an 'android' state for 45 minutes), but strange nonetheless. It felt as equally intoxicating as DXM (though with slightly more confidence in completing tasks requiring any modicum of fine motor skill), but with...something else. Another dimension, added on. Not an entirely pleasant one; I was restless, and after trying video games, music, and a movie (none held my interest), I, for whatever reason, opened up Minecraft (something I played years ago, but haven't given a second thought since 2013.)


I had a brief episode of euphoria after building some sort of bizarre geometric monument and watching as artificial snow drifted down the screen, but there was such an overwhelming element of confusion that it was shortlived and rather unabsorbing.


Gave up, hopped in the shower, experienced auditory hallucinations...at this point (T+4.5h) I entered into a brief period of pleasant effects, strangely enough. Excellent body buzz ('buzz' in the literal sense of the word), pleasant, ketamine-like dissociation. Tried to sleep, and was convinced my ex girlfriend was in the bed with me until I rolled over to check. Minor, manageable delerium (much less intense than what I experience on MXE) ; lots of thought devoted to introspection pertaining to death and drug abuse. Eventually fell asleep at T+5.5h.


While the very tail end of the experience was pleasant, the road to get there was in no way worth it, and for most of the experience I was wishing I was sober and contemplating dumping my supply.

Amnesia was present, to a degree (though it *could* be overcome, with a little effort), and the urge to redose (despite the unpleasantry) was definitely there.


A strange, interesting, unique compound; not my cup of tea, especially when taking some of the aforementioned health risks into consideration.


PS- apologies for dropping this into the middle of an existing conversation; I know it can be bothersome when a new member inerjects with an amateur report, but the experience was mostly unpleasant and disoreinting and writing it down here is somewhat cathartic.


All the best~

has anyone experienced this? 


Diphenidine taken shortly before bed causes convulsions or many some sort of seizures during sleep. I have been experimenting with this compound in various doses and settings for close to a year and I noticed that I'll be completely healthy for weeks but upon a single dose now, maybe an hour before bed, I wake up with what looks and feels like carpet burns on my arms and legs, as if I've been having involuntary moving my limbs fast against my bedsheets.


My ROA is strictly vaping the stuff and this seems to happen even in miniscule doses now. It didn't in the past. Knowing that diphenidine can be fatal, especially smoked (DO NOT smoke tobacco with diphenidine or close together! I wrote a thread on how this caused a terrifying experience that ended up with me calling 911 in another thread), please be very careful with this substance.


I shouldn't use it at all but I have been using it again in very small doses, still vaped, but with a full breath of air in between tokes and in very slow moderation. I no longer pack the pipe and take monster hits.

Insufflation is definitely not the way to go with this one. What I've found with a lot of RC Dissociatives is that they're excellent vaped or (my ROA of choice in most cases) plugged. Quick and very nice onset. Packs a punch. Today I'm using the last of my recreational RC stash and decided that with a clear schedule and an empty house I would try "B2 Ultra" again, which is a combination of 3-FFM and diphenidine (I honestly don't know what I was thinking when I first made that decision, since the idea of combining these two would never have occurred to me, but as it so happens this stuff is pretty good. I spent several hours working on some writing and it put me in a great zone for it. 


Part of the title of a book comes to mind when describing the state: beginner's mind. It's extremely conducive to creativity and abstract thinking.


Be well.

Careful with this. Prolonged/high dose or mixing with depressants increases chance of blacking out. The retrograde amnesia and short term memory loss associated with this compound go without say. It's probably part of the experience.


but again, please be careful with this stuff. Best case scenario you find yourself awake having vaped your entire stash and wanting more.


Please try to have a sober sitter with you.

I tried some Diphenidine poweder for the first time due to the crystal being out and well i've vaped over 100 mgs with little to no effets. I Ived about 100mg..... I did use 3fpm during the day and ate a bunch of pyrazolam to relax... Will these counteract Diphenidine?


I feel something but not much.... I thought i'd be in a hole after IVing a decent amount but nope... hmmm weird... Vendor is legit but i know crystal is always better it seems but it shouldn'tbe thisbad.  


Any thoughts?

Appearance says nothing, and 'legit vendors' are no guarantee either.


I don't exactly know what the explanation is for your lack of effect, but I wanna strongly remind you of how people here (including experienced knowledgeable figures) have wrecked themselves with this material. It's not enough nuance to say that nobody should ever take compounds like diphenidine, but rather that there is very little tolerance, basically no room for errors or problems.

There is so much reckless drug use that there will be too many users that lack proper preparation and precaution.


My point is, that if you are having unexpected effects, you should either stop trying to take this altogether or if you must try again start again LOW without any other drugs involved, no nootropics or medication if possible if its such a waste to throw what you currently have away. But its less unwise to get another batch from another vendor, or leave it alone altogether.


I don't think pyrazolam has a big amnesia component, so for a benzo thats probably sort of okay, but as a rule taking benzos with it is a bad idea - since they tend to blunt psychedelic effect which causes people to compensate by taking more of the dissociative... and the risk of having an amnesia blackout gets that much higher.

Is this stuff active nasally in the way that ketamine is? Are any of these "novel dissociatives"?

> Diphenidine taken shortly before bed causes convulsions or many some sort of seizures during sleep. I have been experimenting with this compound in various doses and settings for close to a year and I noticed that I'll be completely healthy for weeks but upon a single dose now, maybe an hour before bed, I wake up with what looks and feels like carpet burns on my arms and legs, as if I've been having involuntary moving my limbs fast against my bedsheets.

Yes! I wondered if anyone else had experienced something like this. I have had two confirmed seizures under the influence of Diphenidine (A&E, whole situation, etc...) But because I'm an idiot I've continued to use it (if somewhat more carefully...!) 


Basically, sometimes if I take it and then go to sleep, I wake up the next morning with extremely stiff muscles and sweating. These are things I associate from past experience from having recently had a minor seizure or convulsions of some kind.

To my knowledge, this hasn't been confirmed. But as I'm sure many people here will tell you, you don't want to try insufflating this (or MXP, or Ephenidine). The irritation is quite extreme and at best ruins the experience of the drug, and at worst is likely to be quite damaging to nose tissue. I made the mistake of sniffing it when it first became available and nobody knew what to do with it. Never again. *Edit* To compare, think along the lines of sniffing 2C's. If you've done that you'll know what I mean.

For me diphenidine was very dirty on the body, I experienced shakes and unconfortable tremors on my whole body every time I took it, really hard bodyload. I flushed down the toilet all my diphenidine months ago after OD and going to hospital on about 300-500mg, and will never came back to that shit again. The high was really interesting and unique though, but the amnesia makes it really hard to recall anything about the experience.

Somebody could have at least told me this tastes a bit like a doctors surgery/dentists?


*60mg insufflated


Fuck me

Sorry, I should probably check for replies before sniffing stuff. Thanks for attempting to warn me. Give me 2c-x over this shit any day.


That said, I fucking love it.


11:22am: **40mg orally** = very slight something but not sure what. Barely perceivable. So later on that night:


22:32pm: **60mg insufflated** = tastes exactly like doctors/dentists buildings but I feel very energised and happy.

12:57pm: (4.30 hours later, Insuflated line no longer apparent) = **70mg orally**.  50 minutes on and music is sounding incredibly crisp. I love this a lot. I feel like low doses of dissociatives remind of maybe a low dose of 2CX phenethylamine substance. It has a nice stimulating body high and it makes me happy. I'd love a line of ketamine.


Edit: Didn't really feel the 70mg as much as the 60mg insufflated. I wish I could just sniff this without it tasting like a dental surgery. It certainly gives music clarity though.


Edit 2: Four hours after the 70mg orally I felt quite disassociated. But just purely physical anesthetic effects and no stimulation and happiness. Very blank. It's like somebody said earlier about just sitting around in the psych ward on your meds. Nothing was particularly pleasant. I just ate food then wanting to go to bed, felt very heavy and couldn't sleep for ages.

I really want to experience the stimulation of yesterday without snorting it.


Is the insufflated dose roughly the same as the oral dose?


I can't decide whether to take 60, or 70mg orally. I really don't want to feel dissociated. And I don't want to taste like a dental surgery. But I guess I will. 


Edit: Went for: **19:00 pm - 66mg orally consumed**


Its been an hour and I'm not feeling much.


Fuck it. Tasting like the dentists it probably is. Little 10mg bumps. And something strong and edible.


**20:10pm -  feeling little so 12mg line and going for food to try to eliminate that drip, if required.**

Be extra careful with insufflating and especially oral doses as the amnesia and confusion from can be prolonged to dangerous levels if the chem is taken via those routes. One of the few chems where I would certainly want an experienced sober sitter present in person for the entirety of the experience.

Totally. norm4n essentially went to the lab, Experimented, and reported back his findings like a  scientist should. His results reinforced what had already been hypothesized and added more data to pool. You can't have enough data.

Hehe that was like 2 years ago though ;p


You wanted to bump the thread for more 'data points'?

Unfortunately I can only add that I took this once, orally, and felt like a metric fuckton of static, but without the whistles and bells of arylcyclohexylamines... more like a generic fading sensation, with a tinge of dysphoria.


Also I'm not really that pleased with the weak potency, which is never helpful with unknown toxicologies... if you must ingest unstudies compounds, and all other factors are equal, take as few mg as possible..


Feel free to share your own 'point'.. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Well i see this thread has become old, probably due to this not being an easy chem to dose recreationally.


My experiences include:

 single 60mg dose (considered effective, mild effects but boring)

Single 70mg dose ( interesting, but what actually happened? I know i was high but i dont really remember during)

60mg base dose plus added 15mg, then 30 mg. This resulted in same as above but slightly more confusion AND i left my weighing instrument out in the lounge... clearly i wasnt very switched on.

Most recent attempt, 70mg plus 15mg. 

More of the same, confusion whether i was actually doing anything,  other than being confused!


Sure, i can sit on my tablet and play a game and watch tv, however, in the last experiment, the power went out briefly. I then asked my sleeping partner if she noticed and she did as she was feeding our young son.

This sent me questioning, whether the confusion and paranoia around whether my confusion is apparent,  is worth it for a high?


Not really, but its interesting nonetheless.


I think best approach is single dose.... dont bother redosing it only adds to the confusion!

For me, best dose is probably 65mg. This will introduce the state without it getting annoying!

Im sure a higher start dose will be fun too, such as 95 or slightly higher... but the reward seems pointless as doses increase.


I think i can use it like this at around 65mg and find it willl pass as a recreational drug, but not in any other context or usage pattern.


All doses were oral after reading many, many other unpleasant experiences. 

Thanks for reading.


One final note: this was approached after reading a lot of other experiences, including the posts in this thread. 

Please treat this drug with extreme caution and understand it isnt a fun chemical to explore. Only one for hard heads.

Also, as others have noted, redosing can get.. well.. you wont have a fking clue whether you have dosed and what amount.


Plan your dose or doses and lock the rest away!

Crook, what advantages did you find in your higher, and clearly more enjoyable doses????

So no other reports?


It is clear that using diphenidine leads to:

Confusion

Amnesia 

Serious discombobulation


But what ive  understood from the doses i have tried below:


65mg leads to a state of confusion with some clarity as to how one arrived there

90mg leads to a state of confusion including some disassociative but real ideas... i say this because:

I enjoyed some grandiose thoughts usually only seen on 3meopcp... real tangilble ideas... not just confusion. 

Does any dosing of this achieve anything interesting beyond this?


I think this simply passes time but one doesnt actually get anything from the time passed

 What is odd is, upping the doses doesnt change anything ... how can it only increase discombobulation but not have any other effect?? 

What happens if one orally doses 150mg????

Lol,

Very interestingly but pointless....


The unremarkable nature of diphenidine must add some merit to any and every other disassociate!

Or said differently, the ideas produced on other dissociatives are actually of some logical merit.... but not those from diphenidine!

Clearly im the only one still posting about this chem.

Ive tried this chem about 5 or 6 times over last month.


Tolerance also builds so 70mg plus 20mg 40min later has not much effect now.


Slight slight disassociation but very minor. The whoosh at the start is gone too.

Think this only has some fun in first few goes, and using lowish doses to even appreciate  it.

Wow, you really are lol. Yeah, I never heard of very many people being blown away by diphenidine.... Seems to have had its go before people moved on to the other options out there, which to be fair often seem to be more well-received and also have slightly better understood safety profiles. I have to say, it doesn't sound that fun either based on your descriptions, haha.... Confused, amnesiac, and boring after a few runs.... I'll probably end up saving my money for something else!

It isnt worth seeking in all honesty. I have tried a few different rcs in my years and this is all i have in stock currently so ive explored it wholeheartedly and as pragmatically as i can.


It aint a great drug. It is a drug. Thats the point i guess lol

I actually enjoy diphendine: ( [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/819706-Diphenidine-experiences-(low-dosage)](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/819706-Diphenidine-experiences-(low-dosage)) )


I also did higher dosages now, 70 and 90mg. I still need to write a report of it.  I somehow really enjoyed it. It isn't a wild ride, just a peaceful blankness with those dosages. Little thoughts. Really dreamy, easy to lose time. The world is utterly alien. You just sit or wobble a bit, while the scenery becomes chopped up and pixelated. It goes well with small amount of opiates. Then you will sit in a warm void.  


For some reason I made on both instances a cup of coffee with milk and lots of sugar in it. That went really well together. It was a hassle though to do, but it makes the experience clearer. 


I cannot explain why I like this drug. I just really enjoy it. It is not even that moreish. I never redose.   I would like to try a bit higher, say 120mg. But need to wait to bring the tolerance down again. NMDA-antagonists take a bit of time to lower again. 


Another thing: On low dosages it is really effective of suppressing opiate withdrawals. 10/20 mg is enough, you can still function normally. It just stops the RLS, however your mood will be quite gloomy. (But still better than plain withdrawing). 


It really reminds me of the the trip reports of mk-801. I know, that it is difficult to bring over mental states by words. But from what I read it is close, just shorter. It is not as creepy as it sound though. The whole experience is serene on the gloomy side. Like being utterly alone in the universe, but somehow enjoying it. It has a dark edge, but still  I really like this stuff.

Diphenidine was great at 200mg, sounds a bit much but was perfect for me. I believe I had pure stuff from one of the first shops that sold it in the uk. It seems to have vanished by now, only the methoxy version is sold which is crap. I believe ephenidine is somewhat similar to diphenidine but haven’t tested it yet.

I checked the synthesis and IDDC is made from 1,2-diphenylethylamine which is the same chemical used for [Diphenidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenidine) synthesis.

How long would you guess it takes for a full tolerance reset?
