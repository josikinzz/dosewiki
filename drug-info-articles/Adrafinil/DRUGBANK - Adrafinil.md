## Overview

### Background

Adrafinil is a mild central nervous system stimulating drug typically employed to relieve excessive sleepiness and inattention in geriatric patients. It is also been used off-label to prevent fatigue or falling asleep for extended periods of time. Adrafinil does not currently have FDA approval and is thus unregulated in the United States. It was marketed in France and elsewhere in Europe under the trade name Olmifon until September 2011 when France's FDA equivalent reassessed the drug and withdrew marketing permission. Adrafinil is metabolized to
modafinil
.

### Indication

Used to relieve excessive sleepiness and inattention in elderly patients.

### Pharmacodynamics

Adrafinil is a prodrug; it is primarily metabolized in vivo to modafinil, resulting in nearly identical pharmacological effects. Unlike modafinil, the active metabolite must accumulate before the drug is able to act. Oral adrafinil without food usually begins to act within 45 minutes to 1 hour.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Acebutolol
The therapeutic efficacy of Adrafinil can be decreased when used in combination with Acebutolol.
Aceclofenac
The risk or severity of hypertension can be increased when Aceclofenac is combined with Adrafinil.
Acemetacin
The risk or severity of hypertension can be increased when Adrafinil is combined with Acemetacin.
Acetylsalicylic acid
The risk or severity of hypertension can be increased when Acetylsalicylic acid is combined with Adrafinil.
Aclidinium
The risk or severity of Tachycardia can be increased when Aclidinium is combined with Adrafinil.
