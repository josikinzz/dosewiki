**5-(2-methylaminopropyl)benzofuran** (abbreviated **5-MAPB** ) is a synthetic [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) of the substituted [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) class of chemicals, which are known to produce [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) , [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and mildly [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) effects. These include such [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) -inspired substances as [5-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-APB) , [6-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/6-APB) and [5-EAPB](/w/index.php?title=5-EAPB&action=edit&redlink=1) , among others. 5-MAPB is the N-methylated form of [5-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-APB) , analogously to how [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) is the N-methylated form of [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) .

This compound is known for its [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) , [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects that is capable of acting a quasi-substitute for [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) proper, which has resulted in its rise in popularity as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) that is easily accessible through the use of online vendors. It has been sold as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) since 2010.

5-MAPB is commonly found as the succinate and hydrochloride salt. The hydrochloride salt is 36% more potent by mass so doses should be adjusted accordingly. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Chemistry

5-(2-methylaminopropyl)benzofuran, or 5-MAPB, is a substituted [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) and [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) . It is comprised of an N-methylated ethylamine chain and a furan ring attached to a central benzene ring. It can also be classified as a derivative of methamphetamine because the N-methylated ethylamine chain is alpha methylated in an analagous manner. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . The oxygen atom in the furan ring is placed at the 5 position, which generally constitutes more stimulating effects than when the oxygen is placed at the 6 position, which usually renders it more [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) in effect.

## Pharmacology

5-MAPB is a triple [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) for the [monoamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamines) [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) as well as being an [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) for the [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) and [5-HT2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . It has also been speculated that 5-MAPB acts as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) for the previously mentioned [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) .

As a result, releasing agents such as 5-MAPB may exert their activity by effectively boosting the levels of the serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally clear and reuptake those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within various reward and cognition-related areas in the brain, resulting in [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, 5-MAPB is commonly regarded as significantly less stimulating and energizing than MDMA, while still retaining its core entactogenic effects. Unlike MDMA, which encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing in a way that makes it a popular choice for musical events such as festivals and raves, the distinct style of stimulation which 5-MAPB presents can be described as mildly to moderately forced, trending more towards sedation and relaxation. This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily body shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control, though to a far lesser degree than with MDMA.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nystagmus](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nystagmus)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 5-MAPB are mostly comparable to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , but missing the physical and mental stimulation that would be associated. Instead, it focuses mostly on serotonergic activity, leading to more pronounced feelings of empathy, euphoria and a general relaxed state of mind. At higher dosages, this becomes less apparent as physical and cognitive side effects appear which can result in states of confusion and restlessness perhaps more severe than with MDMA. It also shares many of its effects with [5-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-APB) .

- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 5-MAPB use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 5-MAPB has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 5-MAPB within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

5-MAPB's notable agonism at the serotonin-2b (5-HT2b) receptor (which has been associated with cardiovalvulopathy) suggests that it would be cardiotoxic with long-term use, as seen in other 5-HT2B agonists such as [fenfluramine](/w/index.php?title=Fenfluramine&action=edit&redlink=1) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of 5-MAPB can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 5-MAPB develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MAPB presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MAPB all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the amphetamine chemical class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with 5-MAPB should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - 5-MAPB may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**
