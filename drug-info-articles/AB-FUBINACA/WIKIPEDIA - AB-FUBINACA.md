AB-FUBINACA (AMB-FUBINACA) is a psychoactive drug that acts as a potent agonist for the cannabinoid receptors, with Ki values of 0.9 nM at CB1 and 23.2 nM at CB2 and EC50 values of 1.8 nM at CB1 and 3.2 nM at CB2. It was originally developed by Pfizer in 2009 as an analgesic medication but was never pursued for human use. In 2012, it was discovered as an ingredient in synthetic cannabinoid blends in Japan, along with a related compound AB-PINACA, which had not previously been reported.
Its use has been linked to hospitalizations and deaths.

## Mass overdoses due to adulterated K2

On August 15, 2018, 70 people within the city of New Haven, Connecticut, started overdosing near Yale University campus. By the end of the week, the total number of overdosed had risen to over 100 people needing transport to local emergency rooms. Three men were arrested, charged as drug dealers selling synthetic cannabis which contained AB-FUBINACA.  First responders concluded that the overdoses were caused by opiate adulterants, as victims responded to Narcan.   Almost all of the overdoses occurred on the New Haven Green, a large downtown park that is heavily traveled and very popular with the homeless population.  There have been no deaths associated with these overdoses; however, several victims were in critical or life-threatening condition for a period of time.
