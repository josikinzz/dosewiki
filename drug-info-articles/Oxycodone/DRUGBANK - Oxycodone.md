# Oxycodone
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00497*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenanthrenes and derivatives. These are polycyclic compounds containing a phenanthrene moiety, which is a tricyclic aromatic compound with three non-linearly fused benzene.

### Background

Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine in Germany in 1917.
3
It is currently indicated as an immediate release product for moderate to severe pain and as an extended release product for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.
Label
The first oxycodone containing product, Percodan, was approved by the FDA on April 12, 1950.

### Indication

Oxycodone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.
Label
There is also an extended release formulation indicated for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.
Label

### Pharmacodynamics

Oxycodone acts directly on a number of tissues not related to its analgesic effect. These tissues include the respiratory centre in the brain stem, the cough centre in the medulla, muscles of the pupils, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and immune system.
Label
Oxycodone's effect on the respiratory centre is dose dependant respiratory depression.
Label
The action on the cough centre is suppression of the cough reflex.
Label
Pupils become miopic or decrease in size, peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract slows, and muscle tone in the colon may increase causing constipation.
Label
In the cardiovascular system histamine may be released leading to pruritis, red eyes, flushing, sweating, and decreased blood pressure.
Label
Endocrine effects may include increased prolactin, decreased cortisol, and decreased testosterone.
Label
It is not yet known if the effects of opioids on the immune system are clinically significant.

### Absorption

Oxycodone has an oral bioavailability of 60% to 87% that is unaffected by food.
Label
The area under the curve is 135ng/mL*hr, maximum plasma concentration is 11.5ng/mL, and time to maximum concentration is 5.11hr in patients given a 10mg oral immediate release dose of oxycodone.
Label

### Metabolism

Oxycodone's hepatic metabolism is extensive and completed by 4 main reactions. CYP3A4 and 3A5 perform N-demethylation, CYP2D6 performs O-demethylation, unknown enzymes perform 6-keto-reduction, and unknown enzymes perform conjugation.
1
Oxycodone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 to noroxycodone and then by CYP2D6 to noroxymorphone.
1
Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the primary circulating metabolites.
Label
Noroxycodone can also be 6-keto-reduced to alpha or beta noroxycodol.
1
Oxycodone can be metabolized by CYP2D6 to oxymorphone and then by CYP3A4 to noroxymorphone.
1
Oxymorphone can also be 6-keto-reduced to alpha or beta oxymorphol.
1
Oxycodone can also be 6-keto-reduced to alpha and beta oxycodol.
1
The active metabolites noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone can all be conjugated before elimination.

### Half-life

The apparent elimination half life of oxycodone is 3.2 hours for immediate release formulations and 4.5 hours for extended release formulations.
Label
Noroxycodone has a half life of 5.8 hours, oxymorphone has a half life of 8.8 hours, noroxymorphone has a half life of 9 hours.

### Toxicity

Patients experiencing an overdose may present with respiratory depression, sleepiness, stupor, coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold sweat, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death.
Label
Overdose should be treated by maintaining  airway, ventilation, and oxygenation.
Label
Oxygen and vasopressor treatment may be necessary to treat circulatory shock and pulmonary edema and defibrillation may be required for cardiac arrest of arrhythmia.
Label
Naloxone
,
nalmefene
, or
naltrexone
may be used to counteract the effects of opioids but patients should be monitored in case further doses are required.
Label
The intraperitoneal LD50 in mice is 320mg/kg, the oral LD50 is 426mg/kg.
MSDS
The oral lowest dose causing toxic effects in humans is 0.14mg/kg and subcutaneously in rats it is 1.53mg/kg.
MSDS
Oxycodone is pregnancy category B according to the FDA.
Label
There is a paucity of data regarding oxycodone use in pregnancy, though animal studies show no teratogenic effects.
Label
Rats given oxycodone during lactation showed smaller offspring, though after lactation, they recovered to normal size.
Label
Oxycodone is excreted in breast milk and so patients should not breastfeed while taking oxycodone due to risk of sedation and respiratory depression in infants.
Label
No studies on the carcinogenicity of oxycodone have been performed.
Label
Oxycodone was genotoxic at 50mcg/mL with metabolic activation and at 400mcg/mL without.
Label
It was also clastogenic with metabolic activation at ≥1250mcg/mL.
Label
Oxycodone was not found to be genotoxic in other tests.
Label
Oxycodone does not affect reproduction and fertility in rats at doses of up to 8mg/kg/day.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Oxycodone is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Oxycodone can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Oxycodone can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Oxycodone can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.
Acalabrutinib
The metabolism of Oxycodone can be decreased when combined with Acalabrutinib.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with or without food. Food does not significantly affect absorption.

### Mechanism of action

The full mechanism of oxycodone is not known.
Label
Under conditions of inflammation or hyperalgesia, opioid receptors in the heart, lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive system are upregulated and transported to nerve terminals.
3
Oxycodone and its active metabolites, noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone are opioid agonists.
1
These compounds passively diffuse across the blood brain barrier or may be actively transported across by an unknown mechanism.
3
Oxycodone and its active metabolites can selectively bind to the mu opioid receptor, but also the kappa and delta opioid receptors in the central nervous system and periphery, and induce a G protein coupled receptor signalling pathway.
3
Activation of mu opioid receptors inhibits N-type voltage operated calcium channels, inhibiting responses to pain.

Label

### Protein binding

45%.
Label
Oxycodone is primarily bound to serum albumin and to a lesser degree alpha1-acid glycoprotein.

### Route of elimination

Oxycodone and its metabolites are eliminated in the urine.
Label
Unbound noroxycodone makes up 23% of the dose recovered in urine and oxymorphone makes up <1%.
Label
Conjugated oxymorphone makes up 10% of the recovered dose.
Label
Free and conjugated oxycodone makes up 8.9% of the recovered dose, noroxymorphone makes up 14%, and reduced metabolites make up 18%.
