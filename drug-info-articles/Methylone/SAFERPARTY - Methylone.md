## Effects
Compared to MDMA, methylone has a stronger stimulating and less empathogenic effect. The effect is more constant, the "hangover" less than with MDMA.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Short-term side effects are increased body temperature and heartbeat, dilated pupils and tightening of the jaw. The side effects and the (long-term) risks of methylone have hardly been researched yet.

## Safer Use
- Refrain from re-throwing: This does not intensify or prolong the flash with methylone.
- Be sure to drink enough water during the effect.
- Do not combine methylone with alcohol and other drugs, especially MAO inhibitors.
- Do not use methylone if you have heart or circulatory problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, epilepsy or mental health problems.
