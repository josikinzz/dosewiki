## Effects
Restoration of erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis, lowering blood pressure.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Do not use Viagra® if you have low blood pressure. Do not take Viagra with blood pressure lowering substances. The combination with poppers or other nitrites (often present in medicines against angina pectoris, e.g. glycerine) is life-threatening, as severe blood pressure reductions can occur! Viagra combined with cocaine or other performance-enhancing substances leads to high cardiovascular stress, which can result in overheating or a heart attack.
