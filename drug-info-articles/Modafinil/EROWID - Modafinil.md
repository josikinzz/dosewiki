**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Modafinil**
- REGULATED: Yes

Modafinil is Schedule IV in the United States. This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription.

Argentina #
 
We have been told that Modafinil is regulated, but that lack of familiarity means pharmacists will sell it without a prescription. (unconfirmed) (last updated Oct 2007)
