**2C-T-2** (**2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine**) is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story. This particular substance is part of the so-called “magical half-dozen” which refers to Shulgin’s self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except mescaline he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of PIHKAL, and are as follows: Mescaline, DOM, 2C-B, 2C-E, **2C-T-2** and 2C-T-7.

2C-T-2 is a highly dose sensitive psychedelic known for its strong visuals and very intense body load. Many reports also indicate that the physical effects are too severe for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics or suffer from pre-existing physical conditions, as it is known to cause powerful nausea and general bodily discomfort.

In terms of its chemistry, 2C-T-2 is a synthetic, substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups attached to carbons R2 and R5 as well as a sulfide chain attached to carbon R4. 2C-T-2 is nearly identical in structure to 2C-T-7. The two molecules differ in the length of their sulfide chain; 2C-T-7 contains a propyl thioether group while 2C-T-2 contains a ethyl thioether group.

In terms of its pharmacology, the mechanism of action that produces 2C-T-2’s hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been established in scientific literature, however its primary psychedelic effects are more than likely a result from its efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. This mechanism of action is shared by many other psychedelic phenethylamines and tryptamines.

Athough no established scientific experiments have been preformed to establish MAO-A inbihition of 2C-T-2, phenethylamine derivatives substituted with an alkylthio group at the 4 position (such as 2C-T-7, 4-MTA, and the 2,5-desmethoxy derivative of 2C-T-7) are known to act as selective monoamine oxidase A inhibitors. Therefore, this substance may likewise have MAOI effects.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-T-2 can be broken down into eight components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The body high of 2C-T-2 can be described as very intense and uncomfortable in comparison to 2C-E or 2C-B. In high doses, it’s capable of causing painful cramping. It is similar yet distinct from the body high experienced on 2C-T-7, but is considered much more unpleasant. The sensation itself can be described as intense and may manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 2C-T-2 is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of other phenethylamines such as 2C-B, 2C-E and 2C-P.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Although this component is capable of manifesting itself in a distinct and noticeable fashion for most users, it does not generally seem to be as apparent or intense as the same component found within LSD and 2C-B.
- **[Tactile enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Extreme nausea is commonly reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in. It can be described as very painful and violent in comparison to 2C-T-7 or 2C-E.
- **[Stomach cramps](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Temperature regulation loss](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_loss)**

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of 2C-T-2 is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **[Current mind state enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Current_mind_state_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Feelings of fascination, importance and awe](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_fascination,_importance_and_awe)**
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and is outrospection dominant.
- **[Personal bias suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)**
- **[Thought loops](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)**
- **[Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

**Visual effects:**

#### Enhancements

2C-T-2 presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Visual acuity enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**

#### Distortions

2C-T-2 presents a full and complete array of possible visual distortions which generally includes:

- **[Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *([Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting), [Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing), [Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#_morphing))* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and extremely realistic in style but with a subtle digital/cartoonish form.
- **[Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**

#### Geometry

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of Ayahuasca, Psilocin, and 4-ACO-DMT, with mystical and shamanic undertones which combine with synthetic digital undertones reminiscent of LSD or 2C-E. 2C-T-2’s geometry can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic but somewhat synthetic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, rounded in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, mostly angular in corners, immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a contradictory “natural” and “synthetic” feel to them which is reminiscent of DOC or 2C-P. Higher dosages are more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry, but may also lead into [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry (as with 2C-T-7).

#### Hallucinatory states

2C-T-2 produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **[Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[External hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations)** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as Ayahuasca, 2C-T-2 is very high in external hallucinations. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact manifested as dense solidified geometric matter or physical objects of imagined concepts. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, 2C-T-2 is very high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-T-2 are more common in their occurrence than many more commonly used psychedelics and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 2C-T-2 use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2C-T-2 is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 2C-T-2 within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is no current data for the LD50 of 2C-T-2, but it is thought to be high.

2C-T-2 does not seem to be physically addictive and many users experience a self-regulating quality, especially due to the physical manifestations of its effects. There seems to be a tolerance build up when used consecutively multiple days in a row which requires one to double their dosage each time to achieve the same effects.

If 2C-T-2 does have MAOI effects, this could indicate that 2C-T-2 is more likely to induce serotonin syndrome, especially at high dosages, than other serotonergic hallucinogens. This may make it dangerous to combine with certain substances such as MDMA, AMT, Ayahuasca or any substance which releases neurotransmitters such serotonin or those with similar pharmacological effects.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, 2C-T-2 offers incredible depth and a full spectrum of deep psychedelic effects with a cognitive head space that’s closer to a tryptamine psychedelic than many other phenylethylamines. The nausea and physical body load is very intense in proportion to 2C-T-7 and other phenylethylamines, which may be very undesirable to some, however it is still completely worthy of its position within the magical half dozen.
