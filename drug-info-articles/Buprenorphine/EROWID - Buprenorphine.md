- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled

Buprenorphine (Temgesic, Subutex, Buprenex, Suboxone) is Schedule III in the U.S. This means it is illegal to sell without a license and illegal to possess without a valid license or prescription. 
 
 Buprenorphine was rescheduled in 2002 by the DEA from Schedule V to Schedule III. For more information on this, see [DEA's Final Ruling on Rescheduling Buprenorphine, 2002.](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/sched_actions/2002/fr1007.htm) 
 
 On May 22, 2008, the DEA issued a Final Rule in the Federal Register increasing the number of patients a clinic can prescribe controlled substances (such as buprenorphine) to for the purposes of "maintenance or detoxification". Prior to this new rule, the maximum number of patients was 30 and was raised to 100. Drug treatment practitioners must notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services in order to qualify under this rule. See [Federal Register: May 22, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 100)](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/E8-11471.htm) . 
 
 In 2016, SAMHSA increased the number of patients an addiction practitioner can treat with buprenorphine to 275 patients.
