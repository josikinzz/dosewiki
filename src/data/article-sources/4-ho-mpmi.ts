## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The affinity (Ki) of 4-HO-MPMI for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor has been found to be 13 nM. It produces psychedelic-appropriate responding in animal tests with similar potency as DOI. The drug has two enantiomers, with only the (R)-enantiomer being active.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-HO-MPMI include MPMI, 5-MeO-MPMI, 5F-MPMI, CP-135,807, 4-HO-McPeT, 4-HO-pyr-T, and SN-22, among others.

## History

4-HO-MPMI was developed by the team led by David E. Nichols from Purdue University in the late 1990s.
