## Interactions

### ⚠️ Dangerous
- **alcohol**: There is a high risk of memory loss, vomiting and severe ataxia from this combination.
- **amt**
- **ghb/gbl**: Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the individual falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **opioids**: This combination can potentiate the effects of the opioid
- **tramadol**

### ⚡ Caution
- **2c-t-x**
- **amphetamines**: Risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states
- **benzodiazepines**: Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place the affected individual in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess.
- **cocaine**: Stimulants taken with MXE can lead to hypermanic states much more easily, especially if sleep is avoided.
- **dox**: As an NMDA antagonist MXE potentiates DOx which can be unpleasantly intense
- **mdma**: There have been reports of risky serotonergic interactions when the two are taken at the same time, but MXE taken to the end of an MDMA experience does not appear to cause the same issues.
- **nbomes**: As an NMDA antagonist MXE potentiates NBOMes which can be unpleasantly intense
- **pcp**: There are no reports available about this combination
- **ssris**: Depending on the SSRI this combination can be unpredictable

### ✓ Low Risk & Synergy
- **2c-x**
- **5-meo-xxt**: Little information exists about this combination.
- **cannabis**
- **dmt**
- **ketamine**
- **lsd**
- **mescaline**
- **mushrooms**
- **nitrous**

### ✓ Low Risk & No Synergy
- **caffeine**: No likely interactions

### Other
- **dextromethorphan**: There is a risk of serotonin syndrome when combining DXM with MXE, due to DXM and MXE both being SRI’s. MXE and DXM having notable affinities for the serotonin transporter. (Unsafe)
- **maois**: MAO-B inhibitors appear to increase the potency of MXE. MAO-A inhbitors have some negative reports associated with the combination but there isn't much information available (Unsafe)
