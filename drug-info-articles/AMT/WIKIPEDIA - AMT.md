*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91-Methyltryptamine*

a-Methyltryptamine (aMT, AMT) is a psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogen drug of the tryptamine and a-alkyltryptamine families. It was originally developed as an antidepressant at Upjohn in the 1960s, and was used briefly as an antidepressant in the Soviet Union under the brand name Indopan or Indopane before being discontinued.
Side effects of aMT include agitation, restlessness, confusion, lethargy, pupil dilation, jaw clenching, and rapid heart rate, among others. aMT acts as a releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, as a serotonin receptor agonist, and as a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor. aMT is a substituted tryptamine and is closely related to a-ethyltryptamine (aET) and other a-alkylated tryptamines.
aMT appears to have first been described by at least 1929. It started being more studied in the late 1950s and was briefly used as an antidepressant in the Soviet Union in the 1960s. The drug started being used recreationally in the 1960s, with use increasing in the 1990s, and cases of death have been reported. aMT is a controlled substance in various countries, including the United States.

## Use and effects

Under the brand name Indopan or Indopane, aMT at doses of 5 to 10 mg was used for an antidepressant effect.
At a dose of 20 mg, it produces euphoria, while doses above 30 mg result in strong hallucinogenic effects. At doses over 30 mg, the compound may cause several side effects, including anxiety, muscle tightness, vomiting, and hyperthermia. A dose exceeding 40 mg is generally considered strong. In rare cases or extreme doses, the duration of effects might exceed 24 hours. Users report that aMT in freebase form is smoked, with doses between and 2 and 5 mg.
A dose of 20 mg of aMT is said to be equivalent to 50 μg of LSD. However, its onset of action is delayed, with effects appearing after only 3 to 4 hours, and it is longer-lasting. In addition, aMT is described as unpleasant compared to LSD, with symptoms of nervousness, irritability, restlessness, and inability to relax. It is also said to not have prominent visual effects.

## Side effects

Neurologic side effects of aMT include agitation, restlessness, confusion, and lethargy. Physical manifestations including vomiting, mydriasis (pupillary dilation), jaw clenching, tachycardia, salivation, diaphoresis (sweating), and elevations in blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate.
Side effects self-reported by recreational users include anxiety, muscle tension, jaw tightness, pupil dilation, tachycardia, headaches, nausea, and vomiting, as well as psychedelic effects including visual hallucinations and an altered state of mind.
aMT is capable of causing life-threatening side effects including hyperthermia, hypertension, and tachycardia. Fatalities have been reported in association with high doses or concomitant use of other drugs. 
Fatalities verified with toxicology and autopsy include those of a 22-year-old man in Miami-Dade County, Florida and a British teenager, both of whom died after consuming 1 g of aMT.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

aMT acts as a relatively balanced reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of the main three monoamines; serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist. It has relatively weak psychedelic-like effects in animals compared to other psychedelic substituted tryptamines, for instance in terms of the head-twitch response in rodents.

#### Monoamine oxidase inhibition

aMT has been shown as a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) in vitro and in vivo. In rats, the potency of aMT as an MAO-A inhibitor in the brain was approximately equal to that of harmaline at equimolar doses. Dextroamphetamine did not enhance the 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced rise of serotonin at any level. The IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration of aMT for inhibition of MAO-A has been found to be 380 nM. This is similar to that of agents like para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) and 4-methylthioamphetamine (4-MTA).

#### Serotonergic neurotoxicity

A close analogue of aMT, a-ethyltryptamine (aET), is known to be a serotonergic neurotoxin similarly to MDMA and para-chloroamphetamine (PCA).

### Pharmacokinetics

2-Oxo-aMT, 6-hydroxy-aMT, 7-hydroxy-aMT, and 1′-hydroxy-aMT were detected as metabolites of aMT in male Wistar rats.

## Chemistry

aMT is a synthetic substituted tryptamine with a methyl substituent at the alpha carbon. This alpha substitution makes it a relatively poor substrate for monoamine oxidase A, thereby prolonging aMT's half-life, allowing it to reach the brain and enter the central nervous system. Its chemical relation to tryptamine is analogous to that of amphetamine to phenethylamine, amphetamine being a-methylphenethylamine. aMT is closely related to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) which partially explains its mechanism of action.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of aMT has been described. Its synthesis can be accomplished through several different routes, there's two "common" routes mainly via the Henry reaction aka Nitroadol condensation between indole-3-carboxaldehyde and nitroethane under amine salt or ionic liquid catalysis which produces 1-(3-indolyl)-2-nitropropene-1, 1-(3-indolyl)-2-nitropropene-1  can subsequently be reduced via a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride The alternative synthesis is the condensation between indole-3-acetone and hydroxylamine, followed by reduction of the obtained ketoxime with lithium aluminum hydride.

### Analogues

Many analogues of aMT are known, including a-ethyltryptamine (aET), a-propyltryptamine (aPT), 4-methyl-aMT, 5-chloro-aMT (PAL-542), 5-fluoro-aMT (PAL-544), 5-fluoro-aET (PAL-545), 5-methoxy-aMT (5-MeO-aMT), a,N-dimethyltryptamine (a,N-DMT; N-methyl-aMT), a,N,N-trimethyltryptamine (a,N,N-TMT; N-dimethyl-aMT), a-methylserotonin (a-methyl-5-HT; 5-hydroxy-aMT), and indolylpropylaminopentane (IPAP; a,N-dipropyltryptamine or a,N-DPT), among others. Another analogue of aMT is the β-keto and N-methylated derivative BK-NM-AMT.
a-Methyltryptophan, a prodrug of a-methylserotonin, also metabolizes into aMT, but only in small amounts.
There are seven possible positional isomers of aminopropylindole (API; IT), wherein the side chain is located at different positions of the indole ring system. These positional isomers include 1-API (a-methylisotryptamine; isoAMT; PAL-569), 2-API, 3-API (3-IT; a-methyltryptamine; AMT; PAL-17), 4-API, 5-API (5-IT; 3,4-pyrrolo[b]amphetamine; PAL-571), 6-API, and 7-API. 3-API or AMT is an a-alkyltryptamine, 1-API or isoAMT is an isotryptamine, and 4-API, 5-API, 6-API, and 7-API are all amphetamines.
The analogue of AMT without the benzene part of the indole ring is 3-pyrrolylpropylamine.

## History

aMT has been said to have been first synthesized in 1947, alongside a-ethyltryptamine (aET). However, other sources suggest that aMT was first described in the scientific literature by at least 1929. It was specifically described as an antagonist of ergotamine at this time.
aMT started to be more intensively studied, along with aET, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was researched by Upjohn (code name U-14,164E) and Sandoz (code name IT-290) as a possible pharmaceutical drug and was simultaneously marketed in the Soviet Union as an antidepressant under the brand name Indopan or Indopane in the 1960s. However, the drug was used clinically for only a short period of time before being withdrawn.
aMT started being used as a recreational drug in the 1960s and use as a designer drug increased in the 1990s. It became a controlled substance in the United States in 2003.

## Society and culture

### Names

aMT never received a formal generic name. In the scientific literature, it has been referred to as a-methyltryptamine or alpha-methyltryptamine (abbreviated as a-MT, aMT, or AMT). aMT has also been referred to by developmental code names including IT-290 (Sandoz), NSC-97069, PAL-17, Ro 3-0926, and U-14,164E (Upjohn). In the Soviet Union, the drug was merely referred to by its brand name Indopan or Indopane. Other synonyms of aMT include 3-(2-aminopropyl)indole and 3-IT. (+)-aMT has been referred to by the code name IT-403.
