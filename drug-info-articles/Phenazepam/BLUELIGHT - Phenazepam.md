Triazolam is a nice hypnotic but short lasting.  It's a hit or miss for many people, it sounds like it's nothing special for you.  


Flurazepam is decent, but 30mg is an insanely high dose of it.  It's only a partial agonist, and there are much better hypnotics than these.  


Temazepam, midazolam, and loprazolam all are markedly more euphoric than flurazepam.

Agreed with temazepam (but a high dose is required for a decent high), & loprazolam is good too. Not tried the other 2


Personally its good ole diazepam for me these days. Very controllable, 30mg goes nicely with a couple of drinks, or to help me sleep...higher doses (60mg upwards) give a lovely benzo buzz, & blackouts don't seem to happen.

ok.. bringing this thread back to life..

so my kpin taper ended a few days ago and i stopped at too high of a dosage (didn't taper low enough, but it's my dr's fault, it was his choice not mine,, i woulda went down to .25mg/day but he stopped me at 1mg/day started @ 5mg kpin/day and around 10mg phenazepam/day been tapering for about a year) 

So i have a few grams of phenazepam that i obtained a while ago and just took some and feel great (its only been 20min) maybe it's just the thought of that i took a benzo and relief will be coming that is making me feel better? because it usually takes me around an hour to feel it, but then again i was never in w/d's when i would take it and would have kpins in my system already.. I just needed to vent.. these might be benzo ramblings tho. so if anyone notices me doing it a lot tell me i am and that i am most likely blacked out and to go chill before i do something stupid like DRIVE and get another DWI on phenazepam lol.. i will believe it if it comes from someone i can trust and isn't just fucking with me..

anyways.. /rambling

Interaction between gabapentin and any benzo is strong potentiation.  Be careful with this mix!

^I know... not exactly contributing much to the discussion there!


Phenazepam carries unique risks due to the duration and way people often improperly dose (or are unaware of the potency of what they have), but accounting for these factors its about as poisonous as other benzos.

My pal got 100mg phenazepam.


took a pen top and licked the end so some stuck to it, no way was it one percent of the bag so under a mg. consumed.


Felt a bit drowsy.  5 hours later repeated.


good sleep that night , in fact did 12 hours.


felt Ok, no massive effect. Seemed easy to socialise.


Next night slept well again.


So, first time around, no benzo history at all, and it seemed OK.


Would it be possible to do this every week or is that heading for disaster/addiction.

**Phenazepam Two Thumbs Up!**


I don't see what all he hyperbole about this one is all about. It's mild; generally smooth and has a nice light buzz that is easily appreciated or neglected. I've not yet blacked out and retain all memories information accumulated since the experience was commenced. The only thing slightly bothersome about this, is slight ataxia and lack of articulation. I can't understand why there is so much horror stoy hyperbole about the chem. Seems like a smooth calm derivative ala clonazepam, wih a hint of the alprazolam stupor/euphoria. 4/5 as far as I can tell from this isolated experiment.

We need more positive objective reports here. Please feel free to post opinions and experiences! 8)

Phenazepam **is** a great benzo, in my experience.  It is mild, and the decently long half life make it great for day-time anxiety/social anxiety.  Also good for sleep.  


All the horrors revolve around the fact that it is incredibly easy to buy grams of pure powder via the internet, and people who don't know what they are doing and don't have a miligram scale will without a doubt end up dosing too much and blacking out, or worse.  Since the dosage is relative to clonazepam in my experience, 1mg extra could make the difference between feeling good, and blacked out.  1mg is VERY difficult to even see, much less eyeball with any degree of efficacy.  The only way to accurately dose it without a very accurate scale is to make a solution of phenazepam/propylethylene glycol.  Even so it is still tough to get it to dissolve fully, and errors in accuracy are still very possible.


The compound itself is not the problem, it is just the same old story as with any other RC's that are active in the MG range, and add un-educated people/improper tools/scales/stupidity, and bad things are bound to happen..

Would it be within board regulations to post the type/model of my scale for a comparison to others? I just don't understand how it is so hard to accurately measure mg with quility anylytical balances.

^Yeah I don't have any problem with mentioning the type/model of scale you use.  If one **has** the proper and accurate measuring devices, it is not difficult at all to measure out doses.  It is when people start trying to eyeball shit and licking pen caps and whatnot that the doses are not accurate and consistent.  This is why I recommend weighing out exactly 1 gram, or 100mg or whatever and diluting it with a known amount of PEG.  This way you could get a solution of say 1mg/ml, for example.  Dosin' made eazzzzzy.

**Phenazepam**


Why do you have to dose 2-3 times a day if the half life is 60 hours? ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

I just needed to vent.. these might be benzo ramblings tho. so if anyone notices me doing it a lot tell me i am and that i am most likely blacked out and to go chill before i do something stupid like DRIVE and get another DWI on phenazepam lol.. i will believe it if it comes from someone i can trust and isn't just fucking with me..

anyways.. /rambling

My pal got 100mg phenazepam.


took a pen top and licked the end so some stuck to it, no way was it one percent of the bag so under a mg. consumed.


Felt a bit drowsy.  5 hours later repeated.


good sleep that night , in fact did 12 hours.


felt Ok, no massive effect. Seemed easy to socialise.


Next night slept well again.


So, first time around, no benzo history at all, and it seemed OK.


Would it be possible to do this every week or is that heading for disaster/addiction.

**Phenazepam Two Thumbs Up!**


I don't see what all he hyperbole about this one is all about. It's mild; generally smooth and has a nice light buzz that is easily appreciated or neglected. I've not yet blacked out and retain all memories information accumulated since the experience was commenced. The only thing slightly bothersome about this, is slight ataxia and lack of articulation. I can't understand why there is so much horror stoy hyperbole about the chem. Seems like a smooth calm derivative ala clonazepam, wih a hint of the alprazolam stupor/euphoria. 4/5 as far as I can tell from this isolated experiment.

Phenazepam **is** a great benzo, in my experience.  It is mild, and the decently long half life make it great for day-time anxiety/social anxiety.  Also good for sleep.  


All the horrors revolve around the fact that it is incredibly easy to buy grams of pure powder via the internet, and people who don't know what they are doing and don't have a miligram scale will without a doubt end up dosing too much and blacking out, or worse.  Since the dosage is relative to clonazepam in my experience, 1mg extra could make the difference between feeling good, and blacked out.  1mg is VERY difficult to even see, much less eyeball with any degree of efficacy.  The only way to accurately dose it without a very accurate scale is to make a solution of phenazepam/propylethylene glycol.  Even so it is still tough to get it to dissolve fully, and errors in accuracy are still very possible.


The compound itself is not the problem, it is just the same old story as with any other RC's that are active in the MG range, and add un-educated people/improper tools/scales/stupidity, and bad things are bound to happen..

^Yeah I don't have any problem with mentioning the type/model of scale you use.  If one **has** the proper and accurate measuring devices, it is not difficult at all to measure out doses.  It is when people start trying to eyeball shit and licking pen caps and whatnot that the doses are not accurate and consistent.  This is why I recommend weighing out exactly 1 gram, or 100mg or whatever and diluting it with a known amount of PEG.  This way you could get a solution of say 1mg/ml, for example.  Dosin' made eazzzzzy.

Triazolam is a nice hypnotic but short lasting.  It's a hit or miss for many people, it sounds like it's nothing special for you.  


Flurazepam is decent, but 30mg is an insanely high dose of it.  It's only a partial agonist, and there are much better hypnotics than these.  


Temazepam, midazolam, and loprazolam all are markedly more euphoric than flurazepam.

Agreed with temazepam (but a high dose is required for a decent high), & loprazolam is good too. Not tried the other 2


Personally its good ole diazepam for me these days. Very controllable, 30mg goes nicely with a couple of drinks, or to help me sleep...higher doses (60mg upwards) give a lovely benzo buzz, & blackouts don't seem to happen.

This is why I recommend weighing out exactly 1 gram, or 100mg or whatever and diluting it with a known amount of PEG.  This way you could get a solution of say 1mg/ml, for example.  Dosin' made eazzzzzy.

**Phenazepam**


Why do you have to dose 2-3 times a day if the half life is 60 hours? ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

For therapeutic use, I'm not talking about getting stoned on benzos.

Because the half-life has nothing to do with the duration of the drug.
