## Subjective Experience

2C-B-FLY was first synthesised in 1996 by Aaron P. Monte, and by 2005 it had
become sufficiently popular to merit its own Erowid vault. However, its popularity
waned when a couple of deaths were erroneously linked to it, circa 2009. The
chemical involved in these incidents was actually Bromo-DragonFly, which has a far
lower threshold and a much higher toxicity. This had been mislabelled as 2C-B-FLY.

Notwithstanding this confusion, 2C-B-FLY made a comeback at the start of 2016,
when it was released online by Lizard Labs. It was one of the few working
psychedelics readily and legally available on the open market at the time of the
generic UK ban in May of that year.

Prior to this date, I sampled this on a number of occasions, usually orally, and largely
in the 10mg-15mg range.

Whilst it lacked the depth of 1p-LSD (which was similarly available), it was shorter
lasting, and came with entactogenic body tingles and its own feel.

I didn’t find the headspace to be as clear or rewarding as that provided by
lysergamides: despite a change in perception, it induced less insight, and less of a
feeling of oneness and spirituality. This is not to say that these were totally absent.

It was fun in its own right, and was perhaps a twist on 2C-B. Visually, it created a
light sheen and enhanced colouration, but there was little in the way of serious OEVs
or CEVs. It is possible, or perhaps probable, that these may manifest with higher
doses.

Insufflation was agony. I experimented with this RoA on several occasions, and each
came with at least 24 hours of subsequent discomfort, which at times seemed to be
bordering on the edge of a nasally driven head cold. As would be expected via this
route, the onset was much faster and the duration was shorter, but the physical cost
was higher and the trip itself was consequently less comfortable. Nasally, I usually
dosed at around the 8mg level.

Overall 2C-B-FLY produced a decent ride, providing a more frivolous and physical
contrast to my preferred psychedelics. The shorter duration was certainly an
attraction, and with expectation set appropriately, it provided for an interesting trip.
