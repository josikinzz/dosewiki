## Effects
Like all opiates, buprenorphine has analgesic and cough-irritant effects. However, its euphoric and sedative properties are less pronounced than those of other opioids, which is why it is also used for substitution treatment. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist. This means that, for safety reasons, only a submaximal effect is elicited. After a certain dose, a saturation effect (ceiling effect) occurs, which prevents a further increase in the effect. This makes the active ingredient so relevant for substitution treatments, as withdrawal symptoms can be alleviated and overdoses avoided.

## Dosage
From 16 mg, the saturation effect (ceiling effect) takes effect and no more effect enhancement is felt.
When consuming for the first time, low doses should be used, as the risk of respiratory arrest is increased.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The side effects are less pronounced than with other opioids. Nevertheless, fatigue, constipation, drowsiness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, insomnia and irritability may occur. Buprenorphine has a lower risk of respiratory depression, which is why it is considered comparatively safe.
Overdoses with buprenorphine are difficult to treat with the opioid antagonist naloxone due to its high binding to the μ-opioid receptor. Therefore, agents from the group of respiratory stimulants (such as doxapram) are used.

### Long-term Risks
Unlike other opioids, the active ingredient floods on slowly, which is why the risk of dependence is considered lower.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.
