DOSAGE SUMMARY #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
DIPT is primarily considered an auditory hallucinogen due to its "pitch-shifting" effects, though some people report significant visual effects, particularly at strong doses. DIPT may produce widely varying intensity of effects at each dose ranges; some users report overpowering effects at 50 mg, while others report feeling grounded at 100 mg. It can be taken orally or insufflated, or is sometimes smoked/vaporized (rare).
 
**DIPT Dosages**
**Oral**
- Threshold: 15 mg
- Light: 15 - 30 mg
- Common: 30 - 75 mg
- Strong: 50 - 150 mg
- Heavy: 120+ mg
