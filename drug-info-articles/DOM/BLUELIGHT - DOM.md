Original post:


there is not much to find about the dosing DOM/STP. any suggestions?


Shulgin writes 3-10 mg.


But there are first time reports with much higher dosage. irresponsible?

DOM is the infamous "STP" of the 60s that sent 100s of hippies who were VERY USED to LSD to the hospital in panic.  This drug is so infamous because of overdosages so I think it is nothing short of absolute stupidity to approach this with a big head.  Stick within the Shulgin dosages because this drug WILL last a LONG time and is notorious for causing panic and fear.  That you would ask such a question leaves me to believe you have not read very much about its history.

I know the history, but i was hoping for first hand reports.


the doses sold in san francisco in 1967 were about 15 mg, btw., and many took several dosages because of the longer onset of DOM compared to LSD. so the reason for the fear among hippies were high overdoses.

The DOM Nick Sand pressed was originally 15-20mg and then in later series 10mg.  He approached dosing them too much like LSD (one dose of his acid was usually around 200-300mcg, plenty enough to blow most people out of the water).


5mg should be plenty enough for a +3 in most people.  Keep in mind the two carbon monologue (2c-d), most people dose within 20-60mg, but some people push it into three digits.

My experience with DOM (not much, only 4 or 5 times if you count my initial 1mg dose) is that 5mg is easily enough for ypu to find out everything that makes DOM different to the other DOx compounds. Above 10mg and you've got an amphetamine like rush to deal with on top of the onset of a serious psychedelic - def not good for first time with it (well 8mg had me very worried for a while with how fast everything was changing in my mind).


If amphetamine makes you nervous, it might be better to start with 3mg and take the other 2mg at about the 90 minute mark

you should always start low to see how it effects you.I would say 3mg would be a decent starting dose if you've had DO* compounds before, if not I'd start even lower.Plenty of time to work your way up.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I've heard anecdotal reports that 3 mg is sufficient to provide insights and a comfortable experience, and that 4-5 mg is the sweet spot.  I've also heard that 10 mg is too fast and out of control.  Then again, I've read reports of greater than 10 mg that were not overly intense.  


For a first time, I think I'd start with a max of 5 mg and work your way up from there.

Indeed. I feel it is especially important to start low with the DOx series. If you mess up and take too much, damn, what a commitment you just made. If you way overdo it, you can be seriously out of it for a day and then need another day for recovery.


I'd rather have a first trip that didn't meet my expectations than have a day long trainwreck. 


Be safe guys. Don't be a stat.

I think that 10mg+ is the sort of thing best left to experienced tripper who don't have problemms with stimulant type effects. The 8mg dose was reminiscent of what combining amphetamine & LSD feels like - at times I felt like it took my breath away - I couldn'y get comfortable (mentally or physically) for a good 45mins although after getting over thatm DOM is easully the best DOx compound I've tried by a long way (although I have very high hopes for DOT/aleph-1 if I ever get to try it)

I've heard a variety of conflicting reports.  Some say that the low range of 3-5mg is plenty.  Some say that 10mg is a great strong dose.  Still others have claimed that 15mg was disappointing.


Personally, I've tried a 7mg dose, which produced a powerful and ominous lucid psychedelic dream but while I was awake it wasn't particularly strong.  Physically it was as easy as LSD except with less anxiety.  But then, I had some phenethylamine tolerance, so that may not apply to you at all.


I plan to take 12-14mg my next time based on the strength of my last experience and my experience with DOC.  Plus, I enjoy the amphetamine high a great deal and have tripped many, many times.  But definitely, definitely start low.  You do NOT want to be stuck in a DOX trip that's too strong for you to handle.


FYI, the overdoses in the sixties happened, as someone mentioned, primarily because the distributed doses were ~15mg, and people were only used to LSD.  DOM comes on much slower than LSD, however, so these people redosed, sometimes more than once, thinking that one was not enough.  I doubt a 15mg dose would cause any serious problems for anyone other than potentially mental issues from it being too intense.  But I would not start anywhere near that high.

^^^^


I wouldn't assume that.  I dunno, I just feel EXTRA caution is warrented with something that lasts this long.  You can take too much 2C-B or miprocin...no big deal as you will be done before you know it.  Not so with DOM, DOB, etc.  I just really encourage everyone to start below 10mg.


Xor, you can definitely assume your regular tripping is part of the reason why 7mg wasn't overwhelming to you.  Yes, there may be no real physical tolerance but there is 'mental' tolerance, as I know you already know.  Those reading Xor's report, please consider that and do not assume that because 7mg was good for him, that 14mg will be right for you.


Personally, I am going to start at no more than 5mg.  Probably 4mg since I wanted to start with 3mg, but then wanted 5mg.  So 4mg seems a good compromise.

5-6mgs ought to be enough providing you are used to psychedelics , mind it can have a manic edge!Or perhaps that's just indicative of my character!

On testing with a number of doses, I found my ideal dosage to be 0.  I found the body load to be very heavy on me. God forbid we find an analog of Desoxy with DOM-like activity!

Oh, I definitely agree with you... I didn't mean to imply recommending starting off large with this.  By no means start out large.  Having now had two experiences with DOM, the second at 13mg, I can definitely say that it has a very fast, manic, dark edge to it and can be pretty overwhelming.  Its ability to alter your perception of what's real is just unparallelled.  It was kind of a fine line between delusion and revelation for the majority of the experience.  I'm starting to work on a report but it's difficult to start.

Excited preview though!  I feel like I have some insight into this speedy, mentally manic state.  I once intentionally overdosed on 2C-T-7 (at 70mg) and experienced quite a lot of that.  ANd T7 is usually a very clear, easy material for me.  *usually*

would xanax work to "abort mission" with DOx compounds, or the 2-Cx's for that matter, like it does with LSD?  I've found that xanax really helps when the trip's ended and I want to sleep.  It also helped me deal with the freakout of having my first out-of-body-space travel-being directed through space by aliens-experience (2 hits needlepoint lsd and 3 No2 charges in one balloon).  Though a wonderful experience, I had that "I'm going crazy" thing going through my mind, and the trip took a stressful turn.  Some xanax helped dissolve the anxiety and mellow the trip out.  I got wonderful sleep and 8 hours later I woke up feeling better than I could ever remember, ready to start my last semester of college and kick ass.  


Does anyone have any experience with using xanax to end the longevity of DOx compounds?  I'd like to try it sometime, but if I didn't like it I wouldn't want to deal with it for such a long time....Pete Townsend said he HATED it(DOM).  he did take it on a plane though haha

^^

The right amount of Xanax will not abort a trip, but it will make you care-free and probably able to sleep. Don't over-do it, Xanax works on top of anything, DOM is not exempt.

I'm going to start working on a report of this latest DOM dose, but the only problem is that I'm going to have to meditate and try to recreate my mental state a bit, because it was so powerful that it's hard to remember specifically what happened.

listen to this man.  He knows what he is talking about 99.9%.  (I say this because you're a scientist ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png), or at least have the knowledge of one.)  I have NO idea really what my DOM dosage was when I OD'd on it and went psychotic, ending up in the hospital.  But shit, before I took way too much, and the trip was at a steady +1.75-2, compared to all the other DOx drugs, (I have plenty of experience with all of them.  'Cept DON, which I dug up all the info I could on it, and then on DOM, and came to a decisive conclusion, based off research and "field experiments" ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) ,  that I had DOM..and let me tell you.. If you dose it "just right", you are in for one smooth LSD-like trip, only your headspace feels even more open...more lucid, if that makes sense, then LSD.  


Like FB said, anything above 10mg(ish), based off body composition, etc...will give you a very strong amphetamine-like not really rush, but like an inescapable energy, that feels like you hit your funny bone ALL OVER YOUR BODY, like a pot of water boiling over the top with all that foam.  Trust me...and other's advice on here...stick to a low(er) dose.  There's no reason to psychedelicly dicksize yourself on here about how much you took, or to do this in real life with your friends.  Your sanity is worth a jillion times more then, just another trip.


Then again it's all based on dosage, purity, body chemistry/composition, experience with psychedelics, personal opinions/tastes, and personal/unique reactions in each individual.  


If I was to talk about the whole spectrum of DOM though, I'd say, dose low...wait at least 5 hours before dosing another SMALL dose..trust me on this.  Better safe then sorry.


Good luck, be safe, and good speed.

Yep, DOM is no joke at all.  It may be the most powerful and reality-bending mind space I've been in.  It also exposes dark corners very strongly, at least at my 13mg dose (a high one to be sure).  Talk about a roller coaster!  I agree with Dexter that at higher doses there is a very strong amphetamine component.  Although I didn't find it uncomfortable necessarily, it led a very manic and sometimes frantic edge to the trip which caused some of the trip to be white-knuckled.  Overall it was a great trip, but it's ther first time a psychedelic has really shaken me up in many months.  This one is far, far more speedy than DOC.  DOC is actually damn calm for its intensity.  DOM is not!  However, my 7mg dose last time was quite calm and zen-like.

It’s nice to hear that DOM is around.

 I tried this only once many years ago. I suppose the dose was 5, 10 mg, this was in 1970 (San Francisco). I loved it' All I remember is how wonderfully visual it was.

^^ Nice post.  And yes, I found that DOM has tremendous capacity for producing ego loss.  Strong, strong ego loss.  It's not gentle by any means, but I was less emotionally attached to my ego than with most psychedelics, a characteristic which I've found in common with some other DOXs.


EDIT:  I Big and Dandified this thread.  Contributions, please!

If you want a sort of comparison of where you end up with DOM, compare thr 4-halogen 2C compounds (2C-C/B/I) with the 4-alkyl 2C compounds (2C-D/E/P). Now take the intensity if 2C-B up to that of DOB and apply that same sort of increase in intensity to say 2C-E (I know it should be 2C-D, but that is unusually benign in comparison with DOM) and you''ve got an approx idea of what sort of beast you're dealing with. Don't be fooled by how easy it is to handle a 3mg dose of DOM as like with 2C-E, beyond thet point there's an exponential increse ib intesity vs dose/


Xorkoth, I don't know how you dealt with 13mg; the energy that I'd need to release from that would require me to run around like the Tazmainian devil from the Bugs Bunny cartoons, but on speed! If you don't find a way to release the nervous energy, it turns on you and can make going up extremely uncomfortable, both mentally & physically.


While it's possible to have an utterly serene plateau on DOM, I've never heard fom anybody who's had anything but a 'driven' onset & climb to the plateau. One other thing, antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine are effective in negating DOM unlike what some people think. This urban myth started due to people misidentifying PCP for DOM in the late 60's/early 70's; PCP does not respond well to phenothiazines, in fact it increases the anticholinergic/sense of unreality effects.

Can anyone report on what feel are the qualitive differences between DOM and the other common dox's (DOI, DOC or DOB?)

A quick reply is that DOM (& I imagine DOET and DOPR) have more of a 'shaking you loose from reality' feel to them. DOM in the climb to the plateau stage imparts much more physical energy and a subsequent need to do something with it than DOC/B/I. 


The other things are more akin to the differences between the 4-halo 2C-x's and the 4-alkyl 2C-x's.


Somebody else might be able to put it into better words than I can at the moment as I'm quite tired at the moment

DOM is a strong stimulant.  It's much more psychological than DOC and DOI, at least (haven't tried DOB or the others), and like F&B said, it seems to remove you from reality quite effectively.  I find that DOM sneaks into my brain and without realizing it I'll go somewhere else entirely, not becoming aware that I'm hallucinating until after I come out of it.  DOM's visuals are also thicker and more profound than the others I've tried.  It definitely creates a very strong "visual soup" effect.  DOM feels more transparent on my body than DOC and especially DOI.  it produces a lot of amphetamine stimulation but there is very little actual body load.  The long plateau stage is very pleasant.


Basically, DOM is much more psychedelic.  A +4 exprience would be very possible with it, whereas DOC and DOI, I've found, aren't quite at the same level.

Well, I had a difficult time here and there, definitely.  I was releasing my energy through rapid leg movements and by focusing on expelling it from my solar plexus, which produced euphoria.  I was also totally removed my reality for hours... my memories of that period of time involve dark forest, lots of swirling images, and death/evil imagery.  Yet I wasn't scared of it.  The trip was incredibly symbolic.


The other reason I could handle it is because I've been tripping more often than I should, and I have tolerance.  My next experience will be without tolerance at 10mg, I think.  I may divide into two trips at 5mg each, but I really enjoy verys trong DOX trips.

When I was tripping as frequently as you are (perhaps less often even), I'd say it took the better part of a year before I lost all my tolerance. It is the psychological adjustment to the psychedelic state that is more of an issue IMO, rather than just the physical tolerance. That is always gone in a few days or so. But when you experience something like that so often, you get really accustomed to it. I'd bet serious money if you stopped totally for 6 months or so and ate that same amount you'd get slapped around.


Think about smoking pot... and how it probably totally wrecked you when you started. Now, you can probably carry on like normal while high as fuck.


My very frequent use of psychs was limited to mushrooms for the most part, but it got to where I could eat 4-5 grams of very good mushrooms and almost carry on like normal. A year later, I had a very hard time operating on 2g of the same.


I know thats not DOM-related, but important to mention nevertheless I think.

I agree with every word.  A few years ago, I was tripping at least once a week.   These past three years, it has been three times a year at most.  There is DEFINITELY a huge difference in the impact from even very familiar substances.

But yeah, as I said before, I never had any desire to try DOx things, but DOM is the exception simply because 2C-D and TMA-2 are my favourite phenethylamines...


p.s. Did you find that DOM made you feel particularly kinky? ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) (those who read the first half of PiHKAL know what I'm refering to ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png))

Actually, DOM is more similar to LSD than anything else I've tried.  Moreso than DOC, for sure.


Kinky?  No, not in the slightest.  I was too busy phasing out of existence and being assaulted by death imagery.  But in the right setting I think I could have been made to feel sexual.  The chemical did not seem to affect my body's functioning at all.  Many phenethylamines cause me to be pretty much physically unable to have sex, but DOM was an exception.  Also, to be fair, tripping usually makes sex about the farthest thing from my mind.

It gets old fast.  Wait until you have a good half-dozen teens a week emailing you saying how your reports have changed their lives, and influenced them to seek obscure drugs to take them...because you wrote a report and they want to emulate it.  It then becomes somewhat creepy.

I know you were joking, but I never put you into that bracket.  I've actually 'met' a number of wonderful people this way, including my girlfriend.  Nevertheless, it is creepy when a 17 y/o stranger knows intimate details about your life.  Granted I published these details in my reports, but I never expected anyone to sit around and 'study' them to the point of knowing my about my own exploits than I do.  Anyway, enough about me.

How long does DOM take to produce first alerts? What about the peak?

For me, it went (estimations):


First alerts - T+1:00


Peak begins - T+3:00


Peak peaks - ?? (too psychological at this point to know what's really happening, at least on 13mg)


Peak ends - T+8:00


I find the plateau to be very long but more comfortable than DOC's plateau.  But less comfortable than AMT's.

I actually used my last dose, about 10mg, last weekend (third experience).  I had underestimated my reduction in tolerance though and it was so strong I was nearly unable to function in any way.  I also was extremely stimulated, not in heartrate fortunately, but with this crawling energy that would not let me sit still.  It was quite physically uncomfortable and confusing as well, although nothing that I couldn't make do with and handle.  Sexual activity was the only thing that made me feel better.  Morning came (T+8) and it calmed down, I had some kratom, and the entire day was spent in euphoria and energy, a really great day in which I watched the arts channel and saw some amazing videos/performances (including a cartoon of a kid eating mushrooms to some song from *A Midsummer Night's Dream*).  Later in the day I went to Greek Fest at my town, which was also great and my appetite was unaffected.  In fact, I overstuffed myself to such an extent that I felt drunk and passed out uncontrollably later on.


So again, I found the plateau to be more comfortable than DOC's, but the actual peak state was very difficult to deal with.  Large portions of time are missing, lost in a swirl of blue and red fractal patterns.  I listened to a CD I'd never heard before and I'm hoping that listening to it again will bring enough back to warrant an actual trip report.


Next time I would take 5-6mg without tolerance buildup.  I hope I can find another dose or so... I really want to have a proper experience with this.

Sounds mighty incredible. I'll admit that I have a lingering curiosity about the DOx compounds... But its no matter since they're not available anymore anyway.


DOM, Ayahuasca, DXM, AMT, and 2C-T-7 were the first things that I was ever interested in doing... way back in 2000 when I stumbled on sites like Erowid... I'd never even done a drug...


Unfortunately, even now, I've only gotten to do two of those substances (AMT and DXM) and outside of the huasca, its not looking good for being able to do any of the others.


Maybe its for the best. Substances such as DOM are best left alone until they appear out of nowhere. Then and only then, is it time.

I'm also interesting in how DOM compares to DOC. So far I've only have ~1.8mg of DOC and found it uncomfortably stimulating so I haven't yet gone further. According to PIHKAL the duration is listed as shorter with DOM, but I wonder about the stimulation?

All this talk of over stimulation makes me wonder if DOM would be good for a rave situation? If you ever feel to energized just jump into the crowd and jump about for a bit! :D'


I reckon I would need to get used to it in a controlled setting first, though.

thus far DOI has been the most stimulating to me and it doesnt matter how much you jump around, you'll still feel mentaly stimulated (cracked out). 


How odes DOM compair to DOB? DOB has by far been the best out of DOC and DOI. It actualy is like a realy long more deeply psychedelic 2c-b.

I bet a long time but thats only going on the fact that people had DOM gel tabs laying around for a LONG time back in the 60s. Its a PEA so its probably good to go for awhile...but better would be to make a stronger concentration (with a GOOD scale) and drop them on something to evap the liquid...or get a few glass dishes and drop the liquid on them and evap the liquid, scrape the powder up and capsule the powder for storage.

I got to test this (gonna dose higher though next) and wow, the body feeling is REALLY GOOD.  I didnt think about it til another day but the 'body fry' reminds me most of LSD's 'body fry', ...meaning, felt really great.. 


It felt smoother tahn DOC (or DOB, DOI) to me, shorter duration, the nice vibrant colors reminded me of 2C-D also.  


.. i actually felt the body buzz felt so good it kinda felt good to lay down and enjoy it (not much else to say ill have to increase the dose)

1) I never tried DOM nut DOC mixed fine with mdma, ketamine and valium. i never tried cp 55, 940 but i did smoke plenty of ganja while on DOC and didnt notice any adverse effects. In fact it lowered my nausea and intensified the visuals and mental trip.

Dont know how it would mix with GBL but i dont see why there should be a problem. Just dont take all of these at once and i think you'll be ok.


2) i dont know, i never felt an urge to take DOx's often due to the duration. I suspect its like most other psychedelics though and 5-7 days should be plenty.

It seems like a lot o people compare/contrast DOM with acid. Would 3-5 mg of DOM be soluble in a visine drop sized drop of water? If so I wonder ow common it is that people sell DOM as liquid lsd or blotters at festivals? Also, can an overdose of DOM be harmful or fatal? If so, at what dosage approximately?

1. Probably not very common as the other DO-*x*'s seem to be much more available than DOM is. Also, the typical dosage is a bit higher and would likely be more difficult for people to get it onto blotters if that's they way they wanted to go with it.


2. Depends on the extent of the overdose. The DO-*x* series seems to have vasoconstrictive properties at higher dosages.


3. I believe at the Human Be-In in San Fransisco during the summer of 1967, 10mg tablets of DOM were circulated (already a solid dose), and when the effects didn't kick in within an hour the hippies took one or more additional hits. So with 30 mg there were some freak-outs and stories of trips lasting 3 days, but I don't believe there were any deaths or serious health consequences.


PIHKAL has a story of a girl snorting an unknown quantity of DOB thinking it was MDA, so the range might have been anywhere from 70 - 150 mg. She died and her partner who did the same was in a coma for weeks.


There are other reports of DOB deaths as well, so I have no doubt that all of the DO-*x*'s have therapeutic indexes that are much, much lower than that of LSD, thus the danger of them being represented as that drug.

Someone told me 1.5mg was quite the empathogenic dose, a good socialiser. Though it made the person rather horny as well.


Another followed this recommendation in order to get similar fx, but they took 2mg and they found it to be not very empathogenic. On the come-up yes, but then not any more. More like threshold psychedelic for hours.


Anyone else have any experience with low doses in social settings?

I really can't stand the fact that people will advocate Research chemicals as LSD. I really want to tell everyone to shoot whoever is doing that in the head, but that's bad:]


Has everyone experienced the negative emotions from DOM? People mention that, but I was a really joy filled person after all trials with it.

Merged in a thread about DOM stability.


It is far more stable than LSD.  In fact from what I've heard and read it seems like the DOX class of chemicals is quite stable indeed.

If you take it with any regularity you will probably slowly (or quickly) build up tolerance.  Tolerance to DOXs seems to last longer than with most other psychedelics.  But primarily in my opinion you need to worry about mental tolerance.  If you trip every week, after a while it'll start to become routine.

So I ran into an undisclosed amount of 99.8% pure DOM. I am a fairly experienced psychedelics user with about 35 trips under my belt. This will be my first experience with a psychedelic amphetamine and was looking for suggestions to two of my questions:


1. I used to be a habitual Adderall user, although I have not tweaked in 9 months, is it possible that DOM could provoke extremely negative physical reactions, or have a tolerance, considering amphetamine tolerance lasts indefinetly.


2. What would a good starting dose be?

I plan to be working with DOM sometime in the next month, it is a positively fascinating substance both historically and chemically. i have only taken DOC once at 2mg but it was a minor underdose  (im guessing 2.5-3 will be the sweet spot) im tempted to take 5mg DOM to begin but perhaps 4mg would be wiser![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) 


I also stumbled upon a book in a used book store that had about a page of interesting info on DOM (what the original pills looked like etc.) ill transcribe it and post it here if anyones interested!:D

**Dom Information**


This book really has a treasure trove of unexpected info, transcribed for you reading pleasure![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


> Drugs from A to Z: A Dictionary
> 
> By Richard R. Lingeman (1969)
> 
> 
> 
> 	STP [DOM (4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxy-a-methylphenethylamine), Dow Chemical Company; probably from the brand name of a motor oil additive, “scientifically treated petroleum,” which promises added power] a synthetic hallucinogenic drug chemically related to Amphetamine and Mescaline, STP achieved notoriety in the summer of 1967, when hospitals began receiving cases marked by psychotic reactions to the drug. Ten such cases were admitted in eleven days in San Francisco; one chronic psychosis and a possible death were also reported. It was believed that several thousand capsules containing the drug had been distributed free at San Francisco be-in in April or May. The capsules were described by police as white with blue spots (later a New York biweekly described them as orange).
> 
> 
> 
> 	Use of the initials was variously attributed to members of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang (the motor-oil additive) and to Timothy Leary (“serenity, tranquility, and peace”). At any rate, the drug was undoubtedly real, and its effects were said to be both more dramatic and longer lasting than those of LSD, three to four days as opposed to eight to twelve hours, although it was less potent on a weight for weight basis.
> 
> 
> 
> 	The tranquilizing drug Chlorpromazine, frequently administered to calm an LSD taker who has had a panic psychotic reaction, was found to intensify and worsen adverse reactions to STP, leading some doctors to believe that STP like Chlorpromazine, resembled Atropine and hence one potentiated the other. Another report called the drug BZ, a top secret “nerve-gas” being experimented on by the army. When at last the Food and Drug Administration Bureau of Drug Abuse Control obtained samples and analyzed them, they announced it was a mescaline derivative (and hence subject to the Drug Abuse Control Amendment of 1965)
> 
> 
> 
> 	A BDAC chemist then noticed the similarity of the drug’s formula to that of an experimental drug, DOM, upon which Dow Chemical had applied for a patent. A check with the company revealed that the formulas were in fact identical. Whether STP represented the theft of Dow’s formula, a leak of supplies of the actual drug (it had been sent to some scientific investigators and was being proposed for use in mental illness), or the independent discovery of some underground chemist, could not be determined. Although some experienced users of Hallucinogens praise it, others say that it carries more risk of a psychotic reaction than any other drugs; one writer said the odds were sixty forty against a good trip.
> 
> 
> 
> 	Another writer, close to the drug underground reported that the “manufacturer” was distributing the drug free of charge. All veterans concur on the overwhelming power of STP. They speak of a maelstrom of relentless energy. “A feeling.” Said [Richard] Alpert “that its going to do it to you whether you like it or not.” The energy seems to manifest itself physically. “You feel like your body is a conductor for tens of thousands of volts,” said a user. “I was desperate for a ground.” People tripping on STP physically tremble with the energy sensation. It is a stretching, quivering, shaking experience. Many have emerged from STP with a sudden concern for physical health. “We have the need to be strong,” said one. “We need protein. The macrobiotic diet is bad news.”
> 
> 
> 
> 	The relentless rush of energy is often a frightening experience. “Acid is like being let out of a cage,” explained one user. “STP is like being shot out of a gun. There’s no slowing down or backing up. You feel like your breaks have given out.”…
> 
> 
> 
> 	A key to survival in the STP experience seems to be an ability to surrender to the energy flow of the drug. Resisting the rush or holding it back can lead, many reports, to an incredibly frustrating up-tight experience.
> 
> 
> 
> 		STP seems to lack the disorientation of acid. Although the audio and visual hallucination are vivid. A girl explained, “Everything looks like it does when your straight. Its like being on the other side of a glass wall.”  There also seems to be less identity confusion than under LSD. “You know who you are,” she said. Many have found that they could easily function—make telephone calls, find cabs,--shortly after the peak of the STP experience. These things can be difficult to do after an intense LSD experience. 
> 
> 
> 
> 	Another recurring report about STP is a sensation of timelessness. Alpert calls it “a totally NOW orientation.” Past and future seem to dissolve in an electric present. As time was lost, Alpert recalled, “I felt that I had lost something human. I felt that I had lost my humanity.” But the most enticing, and clearly the most disturbing aspect of STP is that, unlike LSD, it seems to have a cumulative effect. It is a long trip to begin with. The direct effects last about 14 hours, and a stoned aftermath may continue until sleep.
> 
> 
> 
> 	The next morning, many STP initiates have discovered that they still felt high, or at least “different.” It is a mild feeling, but a persistent one. Generally rated a “good” feeling it seems to last indefinitely…
> 
> 
> 
> 	Some people claim to have discovered intense telepathic powers in STP. Another curious aspect of STP, a user explained, is that at the peak of the experience you tend to think that everyone has taken the drug. He described his experience:
> 
> 
> 
> 	“I got out of the cab on St. Mark’s Place. It was three in the morning and the street was full of people, standing around. The sky was glowing, like it was flaming. I thought it was the second coming or something. I was absolutely convinced that it had just happened or would happen in seconds. And I thought everyone else knew it. How do you react when you’re convinced? I was completely stoned.”

A couple things to take note of:

A fatal DOM overdose MAY have occurred?

Anticholinergics make DOM intoxication more severe? 

Its interesting nobody knew Shulgin was responsible for the drugs invention (although not for its distribution which seems to have been done primarily by Owsley).

And that DOM was being considered for use to treat mental illness (I suppose many psychedelics were at that point).

Does anyone have any information about Leary taking DOM? I collect psychedelic literature so i just eat this stuff up :D

It varies from person to person, but my crew found that 7mg DOM was approximately equivalent to 3mg DOC.

I miss that book (Drugs A_Z).  That book, and "Chocolate to Morphine" are literally what got me started.  Remember kids, some of us came of age before the Web was widely available (the period of time I refer to is early '90s.)  I hope you kids treasure how easily information gets to you!!!

**Thoughts by DOM.**


Done a semi-trip report in my Journal, for anyone who fancies a nosey:

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/journal.php?do=showjournal&j=1402](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/journal.php?do=showjournal&j=1402)

Thumbs up in general, but a price to pay.

im so annoyed, i set aside this entire day to work with DOM at 5mg and barely got to a +1 either the material is inactive, degraded, or i botched the dilution (and im almost positive i did not). weird.

Tolerance an issue at all?  When I had general built-up tolerance 7mg was pretty weak.  DOXs produce a lot of tolerance to other DOXs, in particular.


Yeah, DOM's been tricky so far for me... I have yet to get it right.  It's either too strong and overwhelms me to where I can't utilize it effectively, or it's too weak to provide a fully psychedelic experience.

no significant tolerance, its been about two weeks since i used a psych, and months and months since a DOx. my question is if i wait 48 hrs i could try again at 10mg and see if the material is to blame, hopefully the minute effect it DID have will not produce tolerance. 


I also took idebenone and magnesium, for the oxidative stress and stimulation respectively

I've also had trouble "getting it to work".  It does something at 5 and 7mg, however not on the level that it should.  I suspect I located an expensive 2c-x (This is my personal experience, not saying we have the same material.)  


Disappointing, I don't think any other chemical has had me this worked up for the initial test.  I'll stay on it, my day will come![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

the 2c-x switcheroo did cross my mind, but the source seems to be providing satisfactory material for other researches, thus i am at a loss. i have a feeling 10 or 15mg will shake something off the branch and maybe the duration will clue me into what sort of fruit i am tasting. perhaps some people are insensitive and this is why the original tablets were 20mg...


5mg will be insufflated in order to get a more immediate sense of the materials potency and then small boosts will be added as necessary.

5-7mg will get you a decent experience,make no doubt.If not,you have tolerance or the material is not okay.Waiting 48hr's will not be enough if you've already taken 5mg.


Wait a month,prepare yourself for this,and only for this experience,and then take 7-10mg and enjoy the ride.This is not a compound leaving you guessing if its active,no fucking way!I promise!

This is often repeated, but incorrect piece of information. DOM responmds to antipsychotic phenothiazines in a similar manner as LSD. psilocybin etc. This bit of misinformation occurred as it was confused with PCP, which also made it's appearance on the underground drug scene in 1967 - take chlorpromazine on top of PCP and things will get worse due to PCP's anticholinergic activity

i think the mystery has been solved the syringe i was using to measure has two different increments (cc and m) i drew the liquid up to 5m which is a little more than .3 cc. if 1cc =1ml it would seem i ingested about 350ug of DOM, its amazing that this had an effect but it did. now i wonder if their would be tolerance from 1/15th a psychedelic dose? i may attempt 5mg tomorrow. btw i have no idea what the 'm' increment i used stands for.

thanks everybody

Never found the ride that distressing, but then again I have an unhealthy liking for stimulants. That said, I've never gone over a 5mg dose - I imagine coming up on 10mg would be a bit of a white knuckle ride, especially if you didn't do something to dissapate the energy it gives you.


The depth of experience it provides though is quite incredible (at 5mg) - the only other phenethylamine I've had that even comes close in that aspect is 2C-E

I get to be played by Ice T? Not bad (pretty cool in fact); I'd have gone with Hugh Laurie or George Clooney (if I was feeling particularly vain!).


Hugh Laurie (House) is the only one with any chance of getting the accent right - well short of somebody actually from NE England who already has a geordie accent, but I don't even want to think about being played by Jimmy Nail (Oz in 'Auf Weidersehn Pet)... ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

No placebo effect,hamhurricane is right.I tried DOB down to the miniscule amounts,200ug clearly gave effects,I suspect even 100ug might be felt.This 200-400ug btw resulted in very good spirits on a otherwise boring working day,I liked it.It might work with DOM similarly.

You know, that reminds me of my low-dose DOC trials.  I have taken DOC at 400-500mcg several times and it produces definite effects.  Granted, DOC (and DOB) are more potent than DOM, but still, the DOXs are some damn potent chemicals.  This is why they work on blotter.


Like hugo's experiments with DOB, I found low-dose DOC to be an excellent day enhancer, although I like it at 1-1.5mg better for this.

Xorky, how high have you taken DOC, w/o significant tolerance?


And given DOB, DOC, and DOM (and having never tried them) in what order would you take 'em on separate trips?

Without tolerance, the highest I have taken it was 4.5mg with a 1mg redose later on.  My best trip on it was at 3.5mg though.  With tolerance I have taken it up to 8mg.  At that level I got very significant vasoconstriction to the point that it scared me.  At the lower levels I get some definite vasoconstriction but not enough to really bother me at all.  I did not used to get vasoconstriction from it and I feel like it may have started due to my overuse of it at one point.


I prefer DOC over every DOX I have tried (DOB, DOC, DOI, DOM).  That said, I have not had a proper trip on DOI or DOB.  I find DOC to be the most euphoric and quite psychedelic indeed, although DOM is certainly more psychedelic (and probably DOB as well).  DOC has some wonderful qualities... it doesn't cause much anxiety and the bodyload is generally quite pleasant.  And then after the peak, the plateau stage is absolutely wonderful for me... it produces a state of euphoria that lasts for about 16-24 more hours which is absolutely priceless... it's one of my favorite feelings in the world.  None of the other DOXs produce this plateau stage for me, including DOM.  DOM, however, produces a more intensely psychedelic state, and has a lot of force, like LSD can.


All of the DOXs have a lot of force, though, including DOC.  All of them take you over pretty completely and create a fully immersive psychedelic state that you cannot ignore.  I find them all extremely visual and they're not to be taken lightly (I'm sure you already realize this however).


So to order them, I'd do:


DOC, DOM, DOB, DOI


And if I were looking for the most psychedelic trip possible, I would put DOM first.  All things considered I definitely enjoy DOC the most of the 4.


Oh, and I've also tried DOT... I have not yet had a full dose but I found it to produce a "Beth state" at 3.5mg; that is, it was kind of generic, not pleasant, not unpleasant.  It was kind of weird and... bleh.  It may turn into something worthwhile at a higher dose.

Yeah I found 250ug of DOB to be ideal for a sunny day wandering around my home city visting friends one weekend. Made me irritating good natured and full of *joie de vive* - not to dissimilar to 2C-B, but without the confusion.

DOM is a true werido, never has a chem been farther from my expectations. with little/no tolerance at 5mg i had almost no hallucinations, mild psychedelic thought patterning, and an almost unbearable body load. it felt like my jaw muscles were undergoing ECT for 10 straight hours. i went swimming in public pool with a bunch of friends also on DOM and had no trouble whatsoever doing laps. it did not bring my group of friends together in fact if anything the trip emphasized our differences and we spent a lot of time being irritated by one another. DOC is a lot more 'fun' and classically psychedelic for me (more visual too) but perhaps DOM is more therapeutic.


DOM should be noted for its extreme emotional latitude, if there ever was a drug with neutral push it is DOM, i could feel despair and joy with equal facility. and even though i was at a +3 the entire time, it almost felt like i wasent tripping at all...if you catch my drift.

Wow, that's interesting.  I've been wanting time to try DOM and that's not what I would have expected either.  So your trip felt like mostly body load?  What kind of body load?


It's interesting that you didn't find it incredibly psychedelic.  You should write up a tiny trip report if you have the time.  There's not too much information on DOM.

extreme muscle tension, even after taking a large dose of magnesium and about 3mg of valium. most of the tension was centered in my jaw. while riding the subway there were moments where i started to get a type of hallucination PEAs sometimes give at low dose, where the ground or ceiling starts to produce a network of shifting cracks. other than that everything was visual enhancement with an attractive sparkle but nothing too far from what my sober eyes would have seen. 


DOM did have a disporportionately strong auditory component for me and two other friends. sometimes i would hear a friend say something and turn to them to see that their mouth was closed and they had not said a word. i could hear breezy phantom murmering like the sounds of a distant party on and off throughout the trip. at one point i tried talking to a friend and he said my words floated away from my mouth and he could not hear them, he could only see my mouth moving.


of the five friends on 5mg only one had a great time and the rest were either thumbs sideways or thumbs down. i think in the future i will either have to up the dose to 7 or 8mg so that its hallucinatory effects will be more prominent and bare the body load, or i will take 2 or 3mg as a launching pad and then take 20mg of 4-aco-dmt on top. or as i stated earlier 350mcg enhanced my day like you would not believe!

How stable is DOM?


I had a collection of various rcs sitting in a closet that got pretty hot during two summers.  Some of the chemicals definitely were degraded.  For instance, there was some 2c-e in there, and 35mg is now comparable to about 25mg.


I was wondering if DOM is more stable of a chemical.  I have a friend who told me DOX compounds are very stable, and even in unfavorable conditions, they will last a very long time.  I have the chems stored in a much better place now, so no worries in the future.  Just wondering about the stability of DOM and if I should be expecting to see some degradation....i read over the thread and it looks like it will probably be good to go.

This chemical, by all accounts, sounds amazing.  I cannot wait to give it a whirl.


hamhurricane, could you compare the body load of DOM to any other chemical you have taken?

All of the phenethylamines and amphetamines should be incredibly stable.  I have not actually heard of anyone ever having 2C-E degrade.  Are you sure that your tolerance and expectations are not higher for the 2C-E?  Or your measuring is different this time or something?


DOM should be okay for your whole life, I wouldn't worry.

It also exposes dark corners very strongly, at least at my 13mg dose (a high one to be sure).  Talk about a roller coaster!  I agree with Dexter that at higher doses there is a very strong amphetamine component.  Although I didn't find it uncomfortable necessarily, it led a very manic and sometimes frantic edge to the trip which caused some of the trip to be white-knuckled.  Overall it was a great trip, but it's ther first time a psychedelic has really shaken me up in many months.  This one is far, far more speedy than DOC.  DOC is actually damn calm for its intensity.  DOM is not!  However, my 7mg dose last time was quite calm and zen-like.

I had two friends take it and according to their reports, it was weaker than it should have been.  One friend took 24mg for his fist time and he tripped, but it wasn't anywhere near the intensity it should have been.  Another friend took ~36mg and he was fucked up, but not as high as 36mg should have gotten him.  


Maybe the 2c-e was a little weak to begin with.  Hopefully my few tryptamines didn't degrade too much.  I think they are probably okay, maybe slightly degraded.  Good to hear about the DOM, I have heard it is incredibly stable so I'm sure it is as potent as ever.

There is really nothing else like it.  Having extensive experience with DOI (not DOM, I realize, but a friendly member of the DOX series nonetheless), it just doesn't have that glorious mental clarity that accompanies the ergoloids.

I took 3mg of DOM last Saturday.  Usually it's really easy to write about an experience for me, but boy that was quite different from what I was expecting.


For some reason I kind of expected it to be like a 2C-E trip that's been kicked up a notch, but it wasn't like that at all for me.  First off, I've never taken something that made the world seem so alien.  There weren't really many visuals, but it was hard to figure out where I was sometimes, even in familiar places.  It was also very self analytical for me.  A lot of questioning of life and the purpose of anything.  That kind of stuff.


I also did not expect it to last as long as it did.  I always thought that 16 hours  of tripping would be awesome.  I never have enough time to do everything I want to do in a trip, and I figured I'd finally be able to do it all.  I don't know if I'm sensitive to DOM more than others, but with 3mg the trippy effects lasted at least 17 hours, and then the stimulation lasted for about 29 hours.  I was expecting to be out in about 14-15.  Very very wrong.  I was sooo tired, but my legs were doing that cramping thing.  I've never taken a benzo before, but I may actually do that it I plan on taking DOM again.


I guess I feel that DOM should be taken far more seriously than the happy go lucky phenethylamines I've tried before.  It has a lot of bite to it.  It was almost a slightly unpleasant healing experience, kind of like ayahuasca (but not at all like ayahuasca effects wise).  One of those experiences you aren't sure about while it's happening, but as you integrate it, you feel better about your life and things get sorted out.  Could of been my set too, who knows.


I'll probably try 5mg next time, but that probably won't be for a while ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

As an analogy, DOM is like a psychic enema compared to the mild laxitive effects of the phenethylamines. Of all the phenethylamine derivatives I've tried, it's the one I have the most respect for as it's an unstoppable T-34 tank of a psychedelic one it gets going. Although different to the way LSD can take you, I find DOM can be more relentless in its psychedelia, probably due to the fact that it has a noticable stimulant component (in the way LSD taken together with amphetamine can be)

Yeah, I definitely will prepare for it better next time.  I wasn't expecting it to go for so long.  28 hours before being able to actually sleep is rough when you're really tired.  Plus I went hiking and dancing that whole day, which exhausted me a lot and made it rougher when I couldn't sleep.


Do you (or anyone else) almost find it haunting near the end?  Maybe it was just my mood, but after the 12 hour point the world almost seemed kind of scary.  I was kind of lost outside, even though I knew where I was.  I actually worried a little bit about being able to find my way back home, even though I know that's completely irrational (I knew the area I was in well).  Insane stuff.

**Here's Grace. . .**


In my copy of this months MOJO magazine, there is an interview with Grace Jones. She discusses her upbringing and background, along with her albums and collaborations. Anyway, she seemed quite happy to admit consumption of several drugs, from Quaaludes to coke. Also she mentions STP (Which shesays stood for Super Trip Pill. Here's the words:


**At 12 your family moves from Jamaica to upstate New York. One of your report cards from Grant Junior High School declared you to be 'Socially sick'. In what sense?**


*Well, I was very shy. Because of the whole religious thing and growing up in Jamaica, only surrounded by a small group of people, I was not allowed to really socialise. So when I came to America, I would just stay by myself*


**So how did you go from being this painfully shy character to . . .**


(Cuts in)*I took a lot of acid!*(Gales of laughter)*Its the truth*


**At what age did you first pop a tab then?**


*About 15. It was enlightenening. And I think about the third time, they were experimenting with what was called STP, the Super Trip Pill. I took it with a doctor and I just wanted to come down because I stayed there for about three days on it. STP, darling. Talk to Timothy Leary, he'd know about that one.*

**A bad experience then?**


*No. It was just too long. I lost patience. I thought, 'Enough, now. OK. I see. I see. Now can I come down, thankyou?' After that I didn't need any more for the rest of my life.*


Atta girl! Sounds like she had a classic peak experience with life changing realisations etc. She still seems a fairly intimidating chick, but there's proof that its more than just an image. Respect to her.

Later in the article she seems to admit to hitting the coke a bit during a low period in her career (in the 90's) but has cleaned up these days.  She sounds like she still enjoys a smoke though, God bless her.


Just had to report admitted DOM usage in the media. Next time you are stuck in the middle of an extended dose of the Brown Acid, just remember, Grace has been there, and she's not barking mad now, is she? (?)

I can't understand all the comments about no visuals with DOM. For me it is very visual, but more to the point, the colours are so much deeper & richer than with any other psychedelic (including LSD). The sheer intensity of the blues, greens, purples etc are enough to induce a deep & peaceful euphoria; when you add on the mindset and smooth onset of the psychedelia (even if the stimulant component makes it a tad rough), it makes DOM a very special psychedelic for me.

I'd say 5-6mg is easily enough if you've little experience with it and no tolerance. Any more will become physically uncomfortable (5mg has me lying on the ground, twitching with the release of internal energy), which might go on to produce an uncomfortable mental state (and you really don't want that to happen with something like DOM)

Yeah, I didn't have any real interesting visuals on 3mg.  I must admit the world did seem way different, but not really in a visual sense that I could put my finger on.  The mental effects were definitely pretty strong at those levels though.  


Anyone else find DOM not visual at 3mg, but it opened up at a higher dose?  I don't have a tolerance when I trip by the way.

I still have yet to find the time (in the proper set & setting) to experiment with this one. Burning a hole in my pocket it is. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) I haven't decided between taking 3 and 5mg as my first dose; my DOC sweet spot is probably around 5 and I hear that DOM is like, half the potency? I am not trying to overdo it with this material though ...

I've had DOM once at 10 mg, and it created the most sizzling, perspective-warping, thickest multilayered psychedelic soup me eyeballs have ever slogged through... but then again that was 10 mg! (i.e., way, WAY TOO MUCH!!!) 8(

In terms of depth, DOC doesn't come near the equivalent dose 9of DOM; 1.5mg of DOC may be equated with 3mg of DOM, but the DOM will shake your foundations much more - weird stuff

With racemic DOM I would start at around five or six mgs - so yeah what Xorky said.


Propyl Power - 10mgs that would have been a ride & a half - and an extended comedown period at a guess ?

68 hours ago, a friend accidently ingested 30 mg of DOM. About 3 hours after ingestion I was called, and told by this person that he took 30 mg of 2c-d, and that he was panicking and felt that he was suffering from a psychotic reaction. I came over to his place, and immediately gave him 4 mg clonazepam. After that, I inspected his drug collection, and it was clear that he accidently took DOM instead of 2c-d. The person also suspected that his 2c-d was actually DOM before it was known that he had actually taken DOM. After that, I immediately gave him an additional 6 mg of clonazepam (this was about 20-30 minutes after the first 4 mg of clonazepam). After that, the person tried to sleep, but was unable to; luckily the feelings of extreme anxiety and fear had dissipated, but the effects were still very strong. About 3h's after the clonazepam, the person could sleep in periods of about 10-20 minutes, occasionally waking up to say something or to urinate (although it was hard to get to the bedroom with the motoric impairment of the clonazepam, this was possible). At first, breathing was very fast when sleeping, but as time progressed, this effect lessened. About 7h's after the clonazepam I had to leave, because I had an appointment that I could not cancel. My friend later reported to me that he slept all day, and that he went to work for a short time the following day, but only for a short time, because he was somewhat dizzy(probably from the clonazepam), and also still somewhat detached from realited. The day after that, the person could go to work without problems, and said that his remaining symptoms were mostly like mild HPPD. All in all, the person appears to be fine, and will probably completely recover. Also some more acute effects: before the clonazepam, the person had extreme headaches, and felt like he was slipping in and out of different realities. Throughout the night, heartbeat was strongly elevated. I measured it twice: once at about 4h after intake and once at about 6h after intake. At the moment I though it was 80 bpm (both times), but I now realised I measured incorrectly, and it was 160 bpm. I guess it was probably reassuring to the friend that I accidently said it was 80, though. I will probably post more info later...

30mg holy cow!Must be like the famous overdoses in the sixties,but its not lethal at that dose luckily.I suspect that the heartbeat came mostly from the panic/fear reaction as I at 10mg couldn't detect any raise in PR and BP.The push and speed though was for me a bit harsh unlike the typical high doses of 2C's and acid.I think he will recover fine without any aftereffects.In my 10mg or so DOB I spent hours in an unconscious violent Jesus-coming-to earth-apocalyptic epiphanie.But I recovered without any negative aftereffects.The Clonazepam probably kept him from doing very bad shit which he certainly had regretted.

30mg? ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) that'll last for fuckin' ages (like expect to still be flying for 3 days). It lingers a long, long time and at the peak it's every bit LSD's equal.

^ That's putting it mildly :D As well, the CEVs on DOM are so intensely coloured that they seem to warm your soul (nothing else sounds close to describing it!). DOM has an intrinsic beauty to it that I've never found in any other psychedelic other than mescaline, but it has a bit of a physical edge in that at times it almost felt like I was vibrating with excess energy. All very worthwhile though. Def the best psychedelic amphetamine for my money that I've tried

Me, a person always ambitious to try a psychedelic. I have only done shrooms once, LSD once, and 2CB a handful of times. I had myself I convinced i was ready for the real thing. DOM. I decided to do it with my buddy, who has only done shrooms once. The person I got these two capsules from, I first told him 7mg-8mg per capsule. But he insisted on giving me these ones he had predosed to 10mg right now so he didnt have to run back home. I figured, what to hell.


Well, first of all, lemme just say, my friend felt, next to nothing. As for me, here is a tale of meeting God, living in Hell, living my life, and a horrifying next day. 


I dosed with my friend at 1:00 in the afternoon on an empty stomach. Ate some food 1 hour after dosing and about 1 hour after that the 'magic' began. 


The come up was very, weird. I felt very misplaced. Like I wasnt supposed to be here. So me and my friend went for a walk and called someone to drive us around. As we are walking, we feel, like giants compared to all these houses around us. Everything felt very 2D. Our friend gets here and we hop in the car, I smoke a cig and it hits me. And the come up was fast. We get to a hotel, and I get out of the car, and I feel like there are about 10 bricks on my chest. It is very tough to breathe, must just be anxiety. Everything looked as if it were flickering colors really fast. When we get inside I run to the couch and just say down to take a breather, everything is getting overly intense wayyy to fast. I take a drink of my Dragonfruit Vitamin Water and BOOM! Red, splashes across my vision. Im seeing what Im tasting. This is a first. I run to look in the mirror, to find out I am made up of pink, yellow and white glitter. I though, wow, this is the most beautiful drug I have ever done. i could rub my hands together and watch the glitter fall to the ground. But on the ground, is this small detailed holographic design spread across yet 1 inch off the entire carpet. 


We get back into the car, and lay in back and pop in the headphones. Angels and Airwaves are playing, I close my eyes and let it take me away. "I held your hand as I left the ground" is the first line in the song, and as he sang that, my closed eye visuals took me away, envisioning me, first person, flying through the skies, the window was cracked so i could feel the breeze. But these visuals, were the CLEAREST I have ever seen in my life. They were amazingly vivid and wild. We get to a friends house and everything is getting so damn intense and not slowing down. I was started to panic. And as I panicked, my consciousness shut down.


The last I remember from then, was my laying on the couch, asking a sober friend to make sure my heart is beating and my breathing is okay.


This next part, I do not remember. But this is what my friend experienced out of me. He said we went to the car, back to my house, he wasnt feeling anything so he just played World of Warcraft, but I was bouncing off the walls. Running around. I finally laid in bed.


Now this, I remember, but all this, I didnt think was real. At all. I thought I was just in a dream. It felt, like a dream. I laid in my bed and closed my eyes, which was the WORST thing I could have done. I mumbled things, I started to say something, then would stop. I couldnt get out a full sentence. 


A lot of this may not be in order, I do not know the exact times. But this is when the living dreams happened. My parents were holding me down, because I guess i was trying to jump through the window. 


What amazes me is what the brain and perceive. Its amazingly scary. i was in this dream, (this is really hard for me to put into words, but ill try my best) When we live our lives, all we have to do, is just let everything happen. But in my dream, I kept trying, and trying to get things to work. But because of that, it was slowing me down. It showed me all my fears, all I had to do is let them go, but I kept TRYING. And trying was slowing me down and making me fail. I watched as everyone watched me fail. And it was miserable. 


Then BOOM! I quickly snap back into reality, and my dad has me by the arm and I have my fist up like Im about to hit him, then 'WOOM' back into this dream. I kept fading in and out of reality. Ending up throughout my house doing different things. 


Then blackness, all I perceive is darkness, yet voices are getting louder, I hear my dad, my mom, my uncle all bickering. Then I open my eyes, I am lying on my bed, I scoot back to the wall fast, because this loud LOUD uplifting music is coming through my roofless room from the sky. (my uncle and parents were really in front of me, but was envisioning the roofless ceiling) My parents are saying this is my time to go, and this uplifting music takes me soaring through the skies, as I get to heaven, God, himself puts his hand on my shoulder, and says "sure is beautiful from up here isnt it?" This all felt, more than real. Then this turns into a hellish nightmare. My moms face quickly appears and she looks demonic and asks loudly and firmly  "WHADYA TAKE!?!?" And I quickly plummet back down from heaven into my room, its black everywhere with vibrant colors dripping from the ceiling and demons chanting around my room trying to stab me. I just laid face down and screamed. I open my eyes to see find my dad in my room vacuuming my bed(really happened), I am standing staring at him, and he looks pissed. All this happened, but through my eyes, it seemed, so dream like, everything was very wavy, colors didnt seem right, seemed too prominent and sharp, yet dull and wavy. My dad, as hes vacuuming, he gets closer, with the vacuum, if he gets too close, I can see the particles from my hand get sucked into the vacuum. 


Next thing I remember, I wake up, in my room, everything very very white, standing in front of my bed. I look down, again, everything looks very dream like. I shake my hand slowly and I see blood trickle out of my pours. As I shake faster more and more comes out. i stand in front of the mirror and paint my room with my own blood (fake of course)


As the drug wore off, I was still caught in my dream, everything that happened, went quickly in reverse, everything that REALLY happened, I saw, in reverse. Then it showed me, it showed the DOM in my brain, and I envisioned myself permanently fucked from this drug. It showed my life, and my life, was one big downward spiral into nothing.


That night, after somehow finally getting sleep, I had the most vivid long lasting dreams I have ever had. I felt as if I was dreaming for over a week. After waking up, I feel as if I am not in my body, like, I appeared here, from a dream, and was quickly reassembled into this body that didnt have a brain or any vital organs. I walk up stairs and find my parents to tell them I am not in my own body. And I need to find mine. My mom says "jesus christ, this is gonna be another long day" After I finally ate some food, I started to feel better. 


My lips are chapped and I put on chapstick, my lips are mushy. My body is mushy. My normal prominent veins are gone. I look in the mirror, and I have... no veins. This is real life too. I tell my mom, she says she doesnt know whats wrong. I go on with my day as normal. 


That night my heart rate was so slow. I am a tiny guy and my heart wasnt beating fast, my veins were nonexistent, I lost all feeling throughout my body.


So now, its about 2 months after this trip, I feel great, but... I wish that I could put together everything that happened, in words, or even in my own brain. Its there, yet... I cant piece it together, I feel like its tryign to tell me something, like I need to not try in life. i need to let shit happen, but there is so much more that happened that... I just cant put into words. Or into thoughts. Yet its there. Frustrating.


One thing that did scare me, it took 3 days till my heart rate was normal, and I could see veins and I had feeling back. Is DOM bad for your cardiovascular system?

At a dose of 10mg id say DOM wont cause much danger for your cardiovascular system, though I know someone that overdosed and that did cause complications...


This is a great trip report. DOM is very powerful, ive been able to enjoy it quite a few times, though ive never gotten to a trip of this intensity! Sorry your trip was pretty rough.  Thanks for the report ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Don't try to draw a message from RC's like DOM/DOC/DOI/DOB.


It's like an amp-trip through hell with a schizophrenic mind.


Not quite mind manifesting.....not truly psychedelic.

Haha, the first time I had DOM was at 10 mgs, I can empathize with your shock. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) As implied, you certainly didn't have enough experience under your belt to go messing with this one. Lesson learned, eh?


Don't know where you're coming from killo, to me DOM is a psychedelic far more powerful than say, LSD.

Don't be stupid. Plenty of people have had enlightening and learning experiences on psychedelic amphetamines.

Now guys, say if I wanted to try the DOC, is that as amphetamine like? my friend says the DOCtor is in and I can try it. A good dose of DOM is 7-8mg, what would be a DOC equivalent? My friend tried it, and she said she didnt take much, all she felt was anxiety and said it felt like a really really dirty drug. hm.

I realize you don't like them, but lots of people do.  I've most definitely had fantastic and enlightening experiences on DOC and DOM.  Do you mean to suggest that I was imagining such experiences, as well as the rest of us who have had good experiences?


It's been said over and over, but I'll say it again: we're all effected differently.  What works on you doesn't work on everyone else, and vice versa.

**DOM Potentcy???**


Ok after extensive research into the matter I believe the potentcy of DOM is not correctly given in most of all liturature and over these very forums as well. I have found it to be every bit as potent as DOC but it takes longer to kick in and is much more visual for sure. Also it has alot more dark qualitys as well but I absolutely love it other then its long duration.


Everyone else i've had try this batch of DOM has said the same, not any DOC, DOI or DOB but just as potent as these??? Could it be not DOM but it has such similar effects maybe another DOx compound??? Or is it that maybe DOM is more powerful then credit given??? It tests positive for DOM using the marquis testing method although that does'nt mean alot I know.

DOM is potent - it will be active at 2 milligrams ( I'm surmising this) & is certainly active at higher dosages. IME it is not equipotent with DOB/DOC but is somewhat less potent.


There is an isomerised version of DOM available which is about twice as potent as racemic DOM.

I agree - I find it somewhat less potent but certainly more potent than much older literature says.  I believe the idea that it requires ~10-15mg to trip comes from when it was circulated as STP, in the 60's I believe, and it was produced as 15mg doses.  I took 10mg my first real trial with it and was totally overwhelmed... I was fine but couldn't make use of it... it was too chaotic, with memory loss.


Merging with the DOM thread... this could be a good discussion.

I got an amount of DOM a while ago.


It isn't something I dose regularly at all -- I save it for festivals and stuff.


Yeah - if it's your first time, dont take more than 7mg.  But for people who like to trip VERY HARD, 15mg **can** be quite an experience.


The dose is 3-15mg, I would say.  15mg is a HIGH dose, probably equal in intensity to 800-900mcg of LSD, but it lasts much longer and does not feel like LSD.

ive said it previously in this thread but you can get distinct threshold effects at 350mcg of DOM, that said im really looking foreword to my first high(er) dose DOM trip. i think ill take about 7mg and pretreat with methaqualone or oral ketamine to lesson the muscle tension...

At higher dosages of DOM ketamine does absolutely fuck all to ease anything, so I'm informed anyway !


If you're gonna take DOM at proper psychedelic dosages stick a handful of benzos in your poket - just in case ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I just sampled ~10mg DOM the other day for my first time with the substance. I've tripped many times on a number of substances, and I also am a little less sensitive than the average person to phenethylamines (or so it seems).


 Given those things, this dose was right where I wanted to be. It was strong, and there were a few moments where I had to grab a hold of my mind when I was first hitting the peak, but overall it was great. The closed eye visuals were fantastic, the open eye were pretty good, and it induced a lot of thinking about meaningful and also humorous things (which I appreciate a lot in tripping). 


The main downside was that my body was never quite comfortable. I didn't have the shitty, nauseous come-up that often happens with 2c-e and other phens, but I also didn't achieve physical pleasure or comfort for any of the trip. I could feel the amphetamine component of the drug the way others have described from higher doses, and this manifested as an elevated pulse rate and as a somewhat manic mindset, with thoughts and sensations going fast and intense. Though the pulse seemed like not a very a good sign, I wasn't ever worried outright about my well being, and the manic mindset was mostly fine or good (not radically different from the way acid can be kind of manic)


As for similar chems, I've used 2c-e a good deal, also 2c-i, 2c-b, 2c-t-7, DOC. Of all substances used I found DOM to most resemble 2c-e, though it also reminded me of acid too. In fact, a good way to describe DOM might be as somewhere between 2c-e and acid, but stretched out in duration a bit.

DOM to 2C-E is a good comparison to make; DOM being alpha-methyl-2C-E.

Not sure I'd give it a go at a Rave, unless it was my absolute only option. having said that, its duration suits that situation. And there will be something to do with all the energy that it causes - ie dancing. I'd maybe try a 5mg dose if I were in your shoes. Your mileage may vary. Have a good dance - Pipp.

I probably wouldn't mix it with anything, because the DOM will last for a very long time.  The MDMA will wear off 14 hours before your DOM is done, leaving you with the comedown from MDMA, plus a long (probably slightly boring because your DOM dose is low because you mixed it) stimulated tail end where sleep is impossible.

Please do not take DOM at a rave, at any dose. This one requires much more focus and humility than you can provide in a party situation. It is *fucking serious.* And it takes great delight in punishing careless psychonauts...

I've been experimenting with DOM a good bit recently, having stumbled upon a bit of it.  I'm finding even 3-4mg to be quite psychedelic indeed, and quite comfortable at that dose.  One of these days I'll try to push it a good bit higher.  I've actually had 13mg before but at the time I was using way too many psychedelics and didn't yet have the feel for DOM... it was far too intense to make any use of and I basically sat there all day lost in swirls and emotions.

Woah, shit. After reading some of these trip reports I start to see why some of my experiences weren't exactly picture perfect. I've probably done DOM between 5-10 times orally and the lowest dose I ever took was 17mg, with the highest being 24 mg (done twice with varied results) and the standard dose I used was 20 mg. I want to write my crazy 24 mg trip report but I don't really want leave out any good details so I'm going to sit on it for a bit, though it sounds strangely similar to what skyline142 said. I know for one thing that I was outwardly unconscious, though my mind was still going, for quite a while and unable to speak for even longer. All I'll say for now is that DOM is not for the faint scrotumed, as even the tiniest little thing can turn a happy time into the darkest most evil experience ever.

That was pretty much the average dose people were taking of DOM when we had it. I tripped with two people different people when I took 20mg, one of them had only done salvia and he took 18mg, was fine, while the other took 16 mg and he freaked out, because regular fraternity weekend nights are too sketch when youre on DOM. I always felt like we were going to get in so much trouble for all the bullshit that happened. Another brother in my house took DOM on 4 seperate occasions reducing the dose each time and every time he ended up with no shirt, locked in his room, and listening to hallucinogen and other music. 


Sometimes I was pretty functional whilst on DOM, even on 24 mg with tolerance from my first time doing it ever with 20 mg two days before, I was able to play a paddle game, probably due to the fact that I saw the entire flight path of the ping pong ball in trails. The best part being looking down a cup of beer and drinking it. Beer foam looks fucking sick on DOM. It was the next time I did 24mg with no tolerance that I completely passed out.

My opinion:DOM is not a true psychedelic.


Sure it's psychedelic in ways, but it's not mind expanding like mushrooms, LSD or peyote.


It's like an amphetamine high with mediocre visuals, even at high doses it's still mediocre. the visuals are the same but they move faster, i fucking hate this drug ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)

Whats a high dose of DOM to you? Personally I don't know quite what what you mean by mind expanding, could you explain that specific quality in more detail? I for one have not found a hallucinogen or any drug with more powerful influence over my mental state, and I've done a reasonable variety of them. Not only that, nothing even came close to the visual symphony I would get with DOM. I clearly remember that when on 20 mg, the visuals were so intense that I could barely discern the between the background image and my friend standing 10-15 feet away. The only reason I knew he was there was because of the white/gray plaid pattern on his hoodie, he was nothing but a small portion of floating hoodie. If I looked at the same spot for a bit, the depth perception disappeared completely and it looked like i was living in a photograph of reality, that was ridiculously distorted in almost strictly vertical and horizontal lines. Not only that but red and purple hues seemed to appear in everything. It was two in the morning and the auditory hallucinations made it seem like i was standing next to a freeway, next to planes taking off, and that every light buzzed intensely. In a negative sense, I also felt methed out. It was weird to watch people move because it seemed like my eyes would drop frames, so any quick minor displacements resulted in what looked like instantaneous travel. Cats for example, which seem to only move that way, are absolutely intense, their meows, their walk, everything. Large displacement result in discrete trails where I would see a perfect series of images instead of a smooth blur. Everything also appeared to take on a satin like wet appearance, which would at first appear on all surfaces, but like I said, looking at the same spot kind of just caused the image to glaze over in 2D, appearing picture like. As for mental effects, I'll go into that later. But I don't see how you can consider DOM to not be a true psychedelic with those sorts of effects. Maybe it just doesn't work for you, but for me, its a deep down and dirty feeling trip that so far remains unapproached in intensity by other things.

The doses you are talking about seem ridiculously high, Prox. All the reports I've read - from very experienced trippers - have been of *extremely* intense (even overwhelming) effects from single digit mg doses. Are you sure it was DOM? A dodgy batch or heavily cut, perhaps?

Indeed, 17mg would probably have you tripping for about 3 days (in the psych ward). Either you're missing a decimal point, your DOM was ridiculously adulterated, or you're superhuman.

From reading what people have said on this board, I feel that yes, it's weird that I was able to take those kinds of doses and I considered the possibility it was cut down, but the friend who I referred to earlier who took decreasingly large doses over time got all the way down to 2 mg and still had ended up shirtless in bed listening to music, a person who has blown 28 mg of 2c-b at once, and can obviously handle a hard trip. Because of its potency at those low levels I have hard time believing it was cut. I am also practically best friends with my source, we're in the same fraternity and I know for a fact it was not adulterated by him. Finally, my other friend(frat brother) who weighs much more than me said 12 mg lasted 24 hours for him, where as I always stopped having noticeable visuals at 12-14 hours after ingestion, though the stimulant effect was 16-18 hours for me. Perhaps it just hits me differently than other people. I mean, I can't really say with 100% certainty that it was DOM, I should sneakily get an NMR of it in Orgo lab, but from most trip reports I've read my experience seems to match up pretty well.


I'm going to put write my 24mg in the post and you guys can read about the experience and come to your own conclusions about it. Either way, this was orders of magnitude above 2c's and 5-meO-DMT.


I have to write this from more than 1 years memory, but I guess since I've discussed it so many times with the people who were there, it could be considered more fresh in my mind than that. What's odd about this trip is that I have very little memory of actual visuals, except when I came up, for the rest of the time I was either completely unresponsive, or stuck in what I thought was not reality. Either way I was completely unable to talk for from probably 1.5 hours in to 4-5 hours in.


Some key facts:


Dosage: DOM 24mg +-1mg oral weighed out with a highly accurate mg scale. I remember stealing mg weights from my college physics labs and the scale was never off by more than 1 mg from the labeled value and usually dead on.


My previous usage was at least 2 weeks earlier so I feel that any tolerance I may have built up was gone.


So I ate my 24mg dose, parachuted in a piece of tissue paper and prepared for a long ride, but it would turn out to not be anything like 24mg I done 2-3 weeks earlier. 


**Upstairs on third floor of the house and in my room**


Probably about an hour later, nausea got the best of me and I threw up, which seemed to be a pretty standard occurrence for me. I'm not sure of how long it takes for DOM to fully leave the stomach but I feel confident that I lost very little of my dose's potency. I was already having pretty intense visuals at this point so I decided to look off the 3rd floor fire escape of our fraternity. I remember opening the door and seeing a car drive by with multiple car length of trails behind it, and the sound of it was intensely distorted, like the visuals it like portions of it were cut out. At least I perceived the effects as sounding like they were digitally reproduced at shitty quality, even worse than itunes downloads. I simply remember thinking, "ohhhhhh shhhhhiiiiiiiitttt", as this was just the beginning of the come up. The next vivid memory I have, which probably was preceded by insignificant events like getting some water, was being in my room, in intense discomfort, wanting a bowl but not really wanting to leave my room. I was in there for a short period, at which my friend who never had a good DOM experience knocks on my door, which I interpreted as a little frantic. He had taken 17mg at approximately the same time as me, and I think it was his first DOM experience and my 3rd or 4th. I opened the door and immediately I was taken aback by his lack of shirt and blank, yet concerned look on his face. He then sent my entire trip into meltdown, though I would have ended up incapacitated anyhow, by simply asking me, "What is going on?", and every quality of the way he said seemed to imply that something was going on, and he was totally lost as to what it was. Again, oh shit, crossed my mind.


**Downstairs**


Some of the downstairs events may not be in exact chronological order but are events that I remember all happening after leaving my room to investigate my shirtless friend's claims.


After seeing my clueless and semi-clothed friend that I began to interpret every single bit of information as the absolute worst possible thing that could possibly be happening. It was also at this point that I think my recollection of things might be out be slightly out of order due to intense discrepancies in time that I was experience,  I deduced this from things usually having constant periodic noise that had anything but, speeding up and slowing down. In any case I'm pretty I spent a decent amount of time wandering the first floor. Still in the front of my mind was my shirtless friend and his puzzling statement. It seemed like everyone I saw was sketched out by my presence, subtly sad, and hiding something from me. I'm pretty sure this led to my first very poor interpretation, that I was being set up for a crime I wasn't sure I had committed. I remember just observing some people and then losing them, which I interpreted as them not wanting to be around me for the eventual bust, kind of like in blow when the main character gets hosed by his associates in his last drug deal and they walk out on him, one by one if I remember correctly. I was getting really fucking scared at this point as to me it seemed like I was about to go to jail in the hardest trip of my life. Having been to jail already for making m-80's with things bought off the internet, this was not cool. Another important event would be seeing two prospective pledges for our house show up, except I thought they were M.E.R.T.'s, our schools version of e.m.t's because the first thing they asked was:


Assumed merts: Are you okay?

Me: Yeah, I'm fine

AM(seemingly hostile): You do not look okay.

AM(hostile): What are you on? We know youre on something? Who did you get it from?

Me: From a guy (not wanting to expose my source)

AM: Who is the guy? What is his name?

Me: I don't know, I'm fine(frantic)


I don't know how that conversation ended but I think I just walked away. In retrospect those are normal questions inquisitive friends would ask someone obviously tripping balls. I'm sure their tone was also unhostile. But the weird thing is neither of them claimed to be at the house that day. 


Continuing my downstairs experience, still in semi-chronological order.


I know at some point I was on the back porch of our house and I remember seeing my good friend on the porch talking to his girlfriend who was standing on the grass below. I remember them talking, and I immediately interpreted their conversation as extremely hostile toward each other, as if everything they said was an insult and a veiled "fuck you". My memory of the the conversation is spotty but I do remember feeling extremely hurt because his girlfriend was also one of my best friends and we had tripped on 2C-B(2C-thursdays) in large groups and had so many really fun times together and I thought that it was coming to an end right before my eyes. I also just don't like seeing two people just destroy a loving relationship, but more so considering how much I cared for them.


So I'm certain at this point I was extremely confused as to the events going on around me. I must have been thinking "why is everyone so filled with hate, and why do they all hate me too?"


As a little background, about a year before this, I got drunk one night and through an unknown turn of events I ended up falling off a 34 foot balcony, [See Picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/22236140@N06/2432595885/sizes/l/). Thankfully I missed those stairs and that tree and landed in the dirt and only broke 5 ribs, 4 vertebrae, my right hip, and punctured/collapsed my right lung. I also ruptured my right ear drum. I still don't know if it was an accident, all I know is that I was probably really depressed about school and life, and it may have been purposeful on my part, because it's almost like I chose that perfect, tiny, landing spot. I have no memory of the incident and that day as I was put into an induced coma for a couple days after. Either way, every single injury I had completely healed as if absolutely nothing bad had ever happened, but for a nicked sized scar on my side where they put a chest tube in.


I don't quite remember how it happened, but at some point I started believing that I was not truly with my actual self anymore, that I was a sort of specter at that point and that my other self, bear with me, was somewhere else. Then I remembered looking off the fire escape earlier, and I immediately had that horrible sinking feeling throughout my body, the kind you get when you're sleeping and roll over but it feels like you're falling. I started thinking about what was happening and I think I remember seeing myself on the fire escape and people telling my not to jump, and then jumping off. Regardless of whether or not that part is correct, I started believing that I had fallen off the fire escape and that when I hit the ground I had left my body. Though I wasn't dead, I was severely injured in my mind and all I could see was myself bleeding, dying on the ground, fucked up as hell. From then on every single detail of every occurrence was warped and perceived by my mind as to fit this horrible scenario. I remember being around people and then they would be gone, kind of like in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind when Joel was having his memories erased, and somehow everything that had happened fit into the idea that I was dying. I remember seeing to brothers playing a house drinking game, and they seemed to be in complete shock, like everything was over for them. I remember them being like, "fuck it, everything is done now" and them saying "I'd really done it this time." I remember hearing voices, though I don't remember the source, start asking me what seemed like riddles as to what was actually happening. "You took a lot of DOM, you can't remember anything from before, people are disappearing around you, trying to get away from you. What do you think happened?" This voice kept talking to me asking the same questions in different ways, "time is running out for you, what do you do now?. At some point I remember very clearly that I heard people saying "He was high, he was drunk" in a sing songy sort of voice and I thought I saw people talking to police about what happened to me as I lay dying on the ground. I imagined that there were emt's standing around me asking what I wanted, in a way that implied I was going to be around much longer. I was really standing in our kitchen and other brothers were confused as to what was going on with me and asking me what I needed. I also remember that I thought I remembered seeing emt's around me and they were saying that I had stopped breathing, and they were getting the defibrillator. I remember hearing them shock me and then I looked around down stairs and there was no one around me. Being sort of scientifically minded, I remember thinking, what happens when someone dies and people think they might be responsible for it, well they do everything they can to maximize(take the derivative, find the zero) their distance from you, which explained why everyone was disappearing around me. 


I'm still confused exactly as to how I ended up in a room upstairs, either way, I thought I was still downstairs, and that now I was dead for sure. This is probably when to the observer I appeared to be unconscious. I know that my friends were trying to get me up the stairs but I wouldn't respond and went limp. The voice started talking to me again, and it was basically asking/telling me in so many ways that "I had fallen off the roof, you watched yourself die, are you convinced now that you're dead?" "Where is everyone then, they're all gone, they left you, youuuuuuurrrr deeeeaaaadddd!" I would keep answering him "No..... No ...... NO!!!!". I thought that it was so cruel that dying was like this, that it told you fucking riddles to convince of you what was going on, I thought that it was the most cruel thing imaginable.


Stepping back for a second, "I was definitely passed out in my friends room, and they were listening to music, keeping an eye on me. I said nothing but the occasional series of NO's for quite a while


There is still more writing to be done about after I regained consciousness but thought I was still dead, and stuck in a nightmare state where I thought I was going to be for the rest of eternity. I realize now that a lot of the memories are vague but they still happened even if I recall them out of order.

Hmm... interesting what you say about still being effective at more "normal" doses. The kinda dose you mention (20+ mg) did a lot of damage to a lot of folks when it was mistakenly distributed at such high dosages as "STP" in the 60s. Given the vast magority of people find it to be *extremely* potent in the 3-5mg kinda range I would strongly advise others to not even consider trying doses so high. These things certainly vary amongst individuals but 20+ mg of DOM ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

I strongly agree with Shambles on his recommendation for not doing anywhere near that amount, I do remember reading the accounts from shulgin himself if I'm not mistaken, that the long come up and relative lack of knowledge led to overdoses, that were seriously harmful. My guess is that my 24mg experience was something like that of those people who were seriously damaged by it. For me it completely cut my conscious self off from the world as if the receptors and areas of my brain responsible for any sort of sensory perceptions, movement, and communication were completely overloaded, and simply shut down. Fortunately, after the heaviest part of the trip I was totally fine, as if I had taken a non paralyzing  20 mg dose, which is still not recommended, as i'll never be absolutely sure my drug was the same DOM everyone else gets. I tend to dodge a lot of bullets, not every one, but this I got lucky on, had i been alone i may have killed myself, or at least been arrested. From my experience, try and do DOM where at least there one sober person who knows whats going on and can comfort you. DOM is like walking on a tight rope between two mountains, once you fall off its a long way before you come down. My experience was by far the most terrified ive ever been, like sleep paralysis but for hours and hours. Yet I would say it was extremely interesting and for some reason i wish i could get there again, but i'm not really looking to fry my brain, and im sure i would feel otherwise upon returning. It was like being a blind, 95% deaf(responses to music, ie I said "no" more rapidly), quadriplegic who was also tripping balls.

It comes in two "flavours" I believe - the isomerised version being around twice as potent as the more common racemic version (I think?!? my knowledge of chemistry is sorely lacking ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif))


I have a small sample of the more potent form that's been burning a hole in my stash for some time now. I was initially told that around 7mg would be a good dose - that was rapidly downgraded to a recommended 3mg dose after a couple of folks tried it though ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

My chemistry is also lacking but a quick review brought me back up up to speed on the different stereoisomers of DOM. All studies seem to to indicate that the R-DOM isomer is more potent than S-DOM. Being stereoisomers means that they have same molecular arrangement but are different in 3D space. Basically, if your left and right hand were molecules, they would be stereoisomers because their mirror images are non super imposable, ie they never line up in the same exact orientation, no matter how you move your hands. A racemic mixture is simply a 1:1 combination of the two compounds, my guess is that that would be a middle ground in terms of psychoactivity.


I definitely recommend DOM, as it has powerful effect mentally and on all the senses. But I also stress the fact that you should be ready to have your idea of tripping significantly expanded.

For me DOM didn't cause the type of things that I generally find desirable in other "traditional psychedelics".


Mushrooms and LSD are different in ways but they have that magic factor. The trip can be good or bad as well.


With DOM I find that if you take too much it's still impossible to be completely comfortable with the experience. I see it as simply an artificial enhancing...sure it hits some receptors that make things seem like other psychedelics. But visuals IMo don't make it psychedelic, the mindset of DOM for me is very amphetamine-like. I wouldn't consider DOM's mindset very psychedelic if that makes sense.


I always get a paranoid, misanthrope feeling at higher doses of most DOX. I find lower doses are better cause you get less body load/pain/aches. That's another thing I hate about DOM. I am not doubting DOM is dark, there's NO DOUBT. I remember on high doses the visuals were creeping me the fuck out, they were crawling and they weren't particulary pretty at anytime. It was like everything was so detail that it looked alive and I almost "felt" the visuals on my body. I had OCD thoughts, so weird.


LSD is just better, for everything. Laughing, music, meditating, fun visuals, just going with the flow.


DOM doesn't offer anything but sensory overload, paranoia, aches, artificial forced high with no magic.

(R)-DOM requires HALF the dose than racemic DOM ! That means 1.5mg to 5mg.

> I considered the possibility it was cut down, but the friend who I referred to earlier who took decreasingly large doses over time got all the way down to 2 mg and still had ended up shirtless in bed listening to music, a person who has blown 28 mg of 2c-b at once, and can obviously handle a hard trip.

Now I noticed this and have to say whilst it's not an unreasonable dose of 2CB it isn't exactly massive either - the implication that because one can snort 28mgs of 2CB somehow equates to taking what amount, IMO to very high doses of DOM seems somehow flawed.

Eh? IMO DOM is the most psychedelic of the ring substituted amphetamines (well that I've tried & I've had a few) - in the same league as LSD for producing moments of insight. |Also the CEV are possibly the most beuatiful I've ever expierienced with DOM - the depth & richness of colour was just breathtaking

Well, keep in mind that everyone is affected differently, and killo has been on quite the campaign in PD to badmouth the DOXs, since for him they provide a bad trip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  But that doesn't mean this is true for all, or even most.  Of all the people I've heard of who've tried DOM, I can't think of anyone but him who has said that it's not truly psychedelic, even if they didn't like it.


For me, DOM certainly has the magic effect, although I agree that mushrooms are more "magical".  But for me, DOM (and DOC) beat out any experience I've ever had with LSD.


So everyone should be aware that killo finds the effects of the psychedelic amphetamines to be negative, at least in his limited number of experiences.  So although you should consider what he says, you should not read his post and then automatically assume that it represents the average person's experience with this drug and its relatives.

Very true - 28mg of 2C-B is a high dose snorted, but not as much higher than a normal dose than 24mg of DOM is to a normal dose of DOM.  And their dose-response curves are not proportional either.  24mg of DOM is an extremely high dose, dangerously high, whereas 28mg of 2C-B is a pretty high dose but is certainly not anywhere near the highest people have taken.

I in no way meant to equate 28 mg of snorted 2c-b with the ability to take such high doses of DOM and I agree that one making that point would be using flawed logic. This person took 17mg DOM at most, the day I took 24 mg with no established tolerance, he took less and less ever since and not once did he enjoy it. I guess I should have been more clear but the point I was trying to make was that he was no newb to the psychedelic experience, so as to show that it wasn't his lack of experience that caused him not to enjoy it, but simply just something that didn't jive well with his brain.


I also agree that 24mg DOM would be the equivalent of an amazingly large dose of 2C-B, much higher than 28mg snorted.


"DOM doesn't offer anything but sensory overload, paranoia, aches, artificial forced high with no magic."


You sound like my shirtless friend describing it. Maybe its just because some people don't find the side effects to be worth the trip. I honestly found DOM to be so mind blowing and stunningly beautiful that I'm willing to deal with that stimulant feeling for the trip.


I am going to try and be as clear as possible with my posts because I don't want someone dying because they though 20-24mg was an average dose.

My trips were always in the 12-14 hour range, from 24 mg to 17mg. Thats from the moment of ingestion to the end of visuals. I was stimulated for another 4 hours though usually. One my much larger friends said he tripped for  around 24 hours though, from the same bag of DOM. Which sounds more like what happens to people on here. The first 6 hours were usually mindblowing where the last 6-8 hours were like a 2C-B trip of 30 mg orally.

DOM was definetly stimulating, mind fucking and body fucking(for that matter). But for me LSD kicks DOM's ass out of the water.


Things are much more beautiful on LSD, LSD has a much smoother body feeling and LSD is just way more mind expanding and has more potential to be spiritual and just amazing.


I am shocked when I hear people say they think DOB or DOM is better than LSD....sounds like you guys haven't ever taken good/strong LSD.


DOM is like speed psychosis.....sleep deprivation produces similar visuals. That's not very psychedelic to me.


DOM sucks, it's a euphoric stimulant with wannabe psychedelic effects that don't go anywhere. AND YES, I have taken huge and small doses....the drug was never good on a high dose I find DOx is better as a simple go-about-your-day stimulant on small doses so it's easier on the body.


I have never ever felt like I was on a journey on ANY RC(DOx, 2c-X). 


LSD and mushrooms are definitely journeys.

So, courtesy of a series of altogether fortunate events, I've managed to procure a single dose of 5 mg of DOM.  Now, I have a great deal of experience with this substance (50+ trips marked off on the old bedpost), and I happen to know that my optimal dose is generally between 10-12 mg of racemic DOM.  Thus my question is as follows:  does anyone have experience administering DOM (or any DOx, for that matter) rectally, and if so, is there a significant potency increase produced by doing so (a la 2C-X)?  I'm hoping that by hurrying this dose through the backdoor I can hit my DOM sweet spot, but if anyone can definitively tell me that DOx's show no real increase in potency via RA, or should not be put in one's bum for some other reason, then I'll probably just neck the fucker and try to enjoy what I do get out of it.  Thanks guys! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^^^

although the only ROA i have tried is oral, i am reasonably certain that nasal or rectal DOM will be 2-3x as potent (as is seen in other PEAs.) I have read DOC reports which confirm this, saying 1/2 the oral dose is needed nasally. good luck!


p.s. 50+ trips on DOM, wow, thats a lot! youve got to be in the 99th percentile of DOM users on BL.

So I recently decided I wanted to try some hallucinogens, and being somewhat new at the whole drug scene (I've done weed a handful of times, but not much else) I asked my friends what was out there these days. One of them suggested DOM.


I got a hold of 10mg of DOM and tried it. About 1.5-2 hours later I felt a definite body buzz but had no noticeable hallucinations. This continued for 7-8 hours and went away. I told my friend about my lack of experience, he said he felt bad for me, and it sounded like I had a tolerance. This seemed odd to me because I have not done any hallucinogens before in my life. 2 weeks later (to let any residual tolerance from my initial dose wear off) his supplier and I got together.


He opened up his personals and said he was going to sit me. He handed me 20mg of 2C-B and 30mg of DOM. I took them together, orally. No, that is not a typo.


I did have hallucinations, sometimes even what I would consider decently strong. I would see colors bleed and I remember every sound echoing for a short while, however the sitter was still massively impressed at my ability to remain cogent. I could still hold a conversation although I would lose track of it occasionally. I remember the strongest feeling being one of disjointedness.


I was wondering what could cause my, to quote the supplier, "hard headed-ness" and being a "titan of sobriety". Because from what I read here, and with the other people I have seen doing the same stuff I did, HALF the dose I took will have most people writhing around on the floor unable to speak.

There are lots of different human isoforms of the 5HT2A and 5HT2C receptors.  It's likely you just have an isoform with some kind of loss of function activity, which is very common and would necessitate you taking higher doses to achieve similar effects.  This is a guess, but the 2c-b may actually lessen the activity of DOM due to competition at the site of activity and the only partially agonizing activity of 2c-b.


I would recommend trying a rectal dose of maybe 15-20mg or so, if that didn't seem that strong.

I'd say it is just your state of mind or general approach to life.  


My friend Alex had a similar experience on DOC.  He took a pretty massive dose and felt nothing, then for his second he felt what I would call regular effects.


On his third dose, he must have paid attention differently and he literally fell down a couple times he was tripping so hard. (In many trips afterwards with higher doses I've never seen him so high.)


I feel like we can direct our attention to the trip in different ways, like people use their minds differently while sober.  


For example, some people re-analyze every little thing while others surf moments without a second thought- how do *you* think?  Try relaxing and allowing yourself to think about different possibilities or death or something- maybe your head will blow up so violently you won't even be able to process visual stimuli.


(Of course, the variation in effects may be due to something other than your state of mind.  That is only my hypothesis.)

Yeah, it could be that, too.  One of my first experiences was with 4-HO-DET freebase at around 40mg and I didn't get very high or experience all too many hallucinations, in fact barely any as I recall.  Years later, I took 14mg 4-AcO-DET freebase and got floored by it, so psychedelics can be very unpredictable as to their effect.

wat? seriously? I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that...


As to my state of mind or approach to life, I can certainly see how that might affect how the trip works. I suppose I dont think like most other people. I have a very analytical and scientific mind when compared to most people. I am a reasonably strong chess player to the point of playing and doing well in (although not winning) chess tournaments. 


I suppose I didnt mention that while I did have some anticipation going into it, every effort was made to distract me into doing something else during the come-up period. There were people to talk to, we went out and got something to eat, played some games, and generally attempted to distract me.


As to my mindset during the trip, there was still plenty to do and plenty going on around me. I did feel comfortable and relaxed (as much as I could be anyway) and I dont really feel like I was "fighting the high" but I am relatively inexperienced so I could be doing something wrong mentally I suppose. What sorts of things do people do while waiting for a come up?


All in all, it was still fun, if perhaps cost prohibitive. I'm all ears to suggestions.

Rectal is nice because it comes on in a couple minutes and tends to produce less of any body load and wastes less material.  It's easy to do, get a 10cc syringe and some small tubing, solvate the material and then put the hose into your rear with a little lube and inject the contents.  You can then add some more water/air to the syringe and inject and you'll get the remaining amount in the tubing into your rectum.  It sounds bizarre but it's ideal for some compounds (eg, 2c's or other phenethylamines that produce that horse kick feeling to the face when you sniff them).


While I'm coming up I like to put on some music and lay back and close my eyes.  Actually that's what I enjoy doing throughout most of the trip.  When I was younger I'd go out and do stupid stuff but I realized later that there's much more to be experienced at home if you just relax and go inside your head or listen to some music or watch some nature-observing documentaries.  The benefit of rectal is that there's pretty much no come up period other, within 5-10 minutes you're at the peak and I start feeling it as soon as I put the syringe down, it's even faster than intranasal for me.

Out of all the plugging threads I've read I've not read this. Great idea. Beats trying to do it without the tube and having trouble because you're laughing at the absurdity of it all.

For me, rectal admin of DOM was no more potent that via the oral route, it just meant that it came on a bit quicker (not that much quicker, truth be told). That's fine & dandy for lower doses, but at higher doses I don't think I'd want to administer it rectally as the need to dissipate the energy from oral dosing is bad enough...

ok so i am gettin some dom.  i want to dip my dom to blotter and i have a standard size quarter piece of a hoffman on a bicycle.  so if i was to suspend my dom in everclear how many mgs/mls would i put in the solution to dip 25 standard blotter hits if i was putting 2mgs on each hit?  I know for this solution i would need 50 mgs but how many ml of everclear would i put it in to soak the 25 hits?

Contrary to many peoples idea of DOM having a 'dark edge' to it, I find it to actually hold up to its nick name, (serenity tranquility and peace) In my experience I've found doses around 7 or 8 mg bring me to a wonderfully peaceful and surprisingly stable and grounded mind state. Although I trip very very often and have a strong psychological tolerance. I find the slow onset lends itself to a peaceful mindset, as opposed to quick onset which usually throws me into a more chaotic place, especially emotionally. DOM is great for long hikes, walks or bike rides, the steady movement becomes meditative, although remember to drink alot of water and eat some healthy snacks to keep your body happy!

I didn't find DOM to have a dark edge to it at all, I found the whole experience to be a fairly upbeat 18 hours..... 


sure in that sort of timeframe the whole thing has its ups and downs but as a whole, i considered it to be a good experience....


Its definitly a drug to do outside, very visual compound, and indeed one of the only ones that has induced visual/auditory synesthesia.... I was at a festival and the bass from the speakers was sending ripples through reality like shockwaves. 


I found myself running out of things to do, so for what must have been 5 hours i chilled in a tent, we started smoking weed.... A stripper, an older hippie, a younger hippie girl, her boyfriend, a friend of mine and myself.... Hillarity was had. eventually i laid down under a teddy gram blanket and the sun was shining through it illuminating the shillohets of thousands of adorable little bears staring back at me and i just had to giggle.... I would close my eyes and open them some time later to all these bears and it was marvelously entertaining....


When i noticed the sun finally went down i ventured outside to a green, purple, and blue sky with more stars than im used to on psychs due to being way out in the country with a harvest moon comming up over the hill.... it was beautiful. 


My only complaint is the speedy twitchyness of it, any reccomended sedatives that will ease the amphetamine nature of this drug with minimal impact on the visual or mental nature of it?

Nothing wrong with putting it on blotter as long as nobody eats it under the impression that it is anything but what it is.


I may have done this in the past for the sake of my own convenience and certainly felt no shame.

There's nothing wrong with putting your DOM on blotter for the sake of convenience, but I don't think its a good idea (at all) to put DOM onto "Hofmann blotters." Blotters depicting Albert Hofmann are supposed to contain LSD, and it would be exceedingly easy for someone to take the DOM unsuspectingly thinking its in fact LSD. Just go to the art supply store and buy some thick watercolor paper and lay it onto that.


If you wanted to go above and beyond the call of duty, you could get a sheet custom-printed to say DOM on each quarter inch square. :D

Woohoo, so I officially have quite a bit of DOM on the way.

Im very excited to try this chem out, and will be doing many trials with this chem in the up and coming months!


Was thinking 5mg for my first trial (after a 1mg alergy test of course)

Does this sound reasonable for a first timer with DOM?

yep, sounds about right.


unless you have the "super potent european isomer" or something.


But with the regular ol' DOM i think you got, 5mg is a good starting dose and 8mg is the ideal dose according to most of my friends.

Well...it is coming from europe...i'll PM the vendor and see what's up.


Ill start with 2mg to be safe as I should do an alergy test beforehand anyways.


How does one dose out using liquid? (i.e. how can I do the 1mg/ml thing that's so common when dosing out .001 doses?) Ive never dosed out powdered DOx chems before, just had them on pre-laid blotter.


The scale im using currently is a .01 scale ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


I can dose out 10mg, so then I stick in a 10ml vial of water and from there it's already dosed out to 1mg/ml?

a 01. scale is not accurate to 10mg, despite what the scale says

i think it could be anywhere from 5mg to 14mg.


you can do the exact same thing you planned but with 100mg for a more accurate dosage with the scale you're using.

Sounds reasonable. 


Only problem is that it might be months or even years before I finish those 100mgs! How long do you think it'll be good for in the fridge?


Ive read that DOM is very stable, but one can never be too sure.....


Im going to try to find someone with a .001 scale, or maybe try to find a cheap one. It'd be a hell of a lot easier to deal with.


Either that or im going to have to lay down some blotter.

DOM will outlive you.


What you can do to make it easier on yourself is dissolve 100mg in 10ml.


Dose out a 5, 8, 10 (whatever) mg doses and let the rest of the sollution evaporate.


So if you made four 5mg doses from your 100mg. you can let the other 8ml evaporate and that will leave you with 80mg dry powder for when you're ready top use it.


justr make sure to mark it 80mg or better yet invest in a scale. They are cheap enough these days.

Ahhh I see, thank you for your help.


Would it be possible to do both your method and mine?

Dissolve 100mg in 10ml water, then evaporate 10ml (10mg) and rehydrate it to dose out .001 doses?


If so, what would be the best method of dehydration? Simple air dry?


as for the scale, im already breaking the bank buying these thems (the deal was so amazing I just couldnt pass it up [2C-B and DOM at a fair price?! Sock 'em to me!]) Can you link me to a relatively cheap .001 scale?

you would need to evap 1ml to get 10mg if you dissolve 100mg in 10ml.

air dry or a small fan blowing over the solution to speed it up a bit.

Would air dry in a closed dark cabinent work? Ive only air dried ketamine before and that was before I had a cat so I was able to do it out in the open. 


If not, how would I go about using a fan? Same route with ketamine probably, but just want to make sure as I wouldnt want to waste the rarity that is DOM, even though ill be getting a gram. lol

Ya DOM sounds like the perfect festival drug.


So ive decided to just use your method delsyd, as I cannot afford a proper scale right now.

I plan on calibrating my scale to the T before use (as I know people who have calibration weights) and from there plan on diluting 100mg in 10ml. From there I plan on dehydrating 10ml which should roughly equal 10mg. From there I will re-dilute the substance in 10ml water (or maybe 20ml water just to be safe?) and dose as needed. My first trial will be with 2ml (i.e. 2mg for 10ml, and 1mg for 20ml). This will be my basic allergy test and dosing test to see just how A.) potent my batch is B.) how accurate my dosing is and C.) if im allergic or not (which I doubt I am but you can never be too safe).

if you dehydrate 10ml you will get your original weight that you dissolved (100mg)


to get 10mg you need to dehydrate 1ml (if you dissolve 100mg in 10ml)


gotta get this math proper. You dont want to go dosing yourself with 100mg thinking its 10mg.


ive had a friend dose himelf with 2=3g of dxm thinking its 300mg.


these things do happen.

Sorry, I keep making typos with this.


I know 100mg/10ml = 10mg/1ml

Bomboclat....be careful making such strong solutions for liquid measurement.  


Making overly concentrated solutions kind of defeats the purpose of liquid measurement....well maybe not defeats the purpose, but it is my understanding that one of the biggest reasons to liquid measure the super potent psychedelics is so that you don't accidentally take a triple overdose.


I'm just saying, make DAMN sure you don't accidentally let two drops fall out of that dropper instead of one drop, because I reckon you really don't want to take 20 mgs of DOM.


If I was you, I would make each drop of DOM like 5 mgs....max.  Just my two cents though.   I've heard other members mention this though.

Has anyone ever seen this compound in the UK? 


I've been lusting after it for a good couple of years now... Beginning to wonder if i'll ever get to taste it. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)


Has anyone taken both DOM and 2C-P (at different times, as i'm interested in comparisons here). Is anyone able to compare the effects of the 2 chemicals? I kind of have this theory that DOM will be kinda similar in terms of mental depth, but be on a whole new level, visually. I have tried DOC before, and it is probably, by quite a wide margin, the most visually rich chemical I've ever taken. It does kind of feel like a very clean, more transparent version of 2C-P, but way more visual (the next level up, at least), and a fair bit more euphoric. 


For some reason, I imagine DOM to be even crazier than DOC (which is crazy insane!).

So I finally managed to get my hands on some DOM. The reports of a serene and peaceful experience have me very excited, although my DOC experiences leave me open to the possibility that this will be a physical gauntlet.


In the event that I get through the come up but am suffering a grueling body load, I would like to take the edge off. In the past I've used benzos for this purpose but they tend to rob my trips of most of their beauty.


What about a little oxycontin or hydrocodone, even a small bump of heroin perhaps, if the physical stimulation is too intense? Anyone had experience in this area? I've never combined opiates with DOx compounds and I'm not sure if they will synergize as oxys and amphetamine do, or if the opiates will blunt the experience.

^That will work, just find your thing really IMO. I'm lucky enough that benzos rarely do much to my trips(though I always, always take short duration ones, like half life of 4-8 hours short, so if you took DOM, but preloaded with 1mg Alp a bit before, it cannot dull your trip except by your mind thinking its dulled, atleast thats my opinion and has always been the case for me, whenever the BZD wears off i'm full tripping again), in fact sometimes they make it a bit more wacky considering i'm more relaxed and open. I only really use low doses as well unless its an emergency situation where i'm literally panicking, than I might take a higher than standard anxiolytic dose but even than not much, I always try to keep things at a minimum especially for new or special trips. Oddly though while I find opi's add much to a trip, I find they distract far far more than benzos do. They make everything more relaxed and dreamy but less psychedelic IMO. I would most definitely use the heroin if I were you, well if its a know potency, or your have old formula OC's because that way you can bump a tiny amount and see what it does for you and well if you like it go further. That way theres no resentment if you go to far, though most people tend to love opi's plus psyches because of the outrageous euphoria. Either way, a small bump of heroin will never blunt the trip to much and that way you'll find for yourself if you feel synergy and want to keep it going. Lastly have fun, wanted to get my hands on ol'DOM for the longest!

^in reply to jbrandons question, DOM has a nice body high but you can get some nasty back/neck/head aches on it. Id suggest getting at least some excersize on it, go for a long walk or something, releasing the excess energy helps. Also I think opiates will blunt the psychological depth, Ive found phenibut to be perfect to take the physical edge off trips like this. It adds a bit to the euphoria and keeps your muscles relaxed.It also lasts forever so it will still be working for the whole DOM trip, for me the comedown is when the aches start.

Also managed to procure a small amount of this a while back. What would you recommend as a starting dose? I've read conflicting reports. Some seem to think 5mg is enough whilst others say it doesn't come into it's own unto 8-10mg.

DOM - ALIEN HEALING AND BIOHOLOGRAFISM


Hey


Me and girlfriend took some alice in wonderland blotters, backside picture a buddha, so tasty!


Amazing experience that he relates to DOM:


7 pm : ingestion


7:30 pm: mild effects


8 pm: tripping, feeling dizzy, bodyload, back hurts


9:30 pm: went to other room to lay on bad, feeling shit, ..than, a alien appeared showing and explaining to me how orgon (REICH corporal psychology) of human behavior and emotions can affect deeply human body structure - freezing the scene myself screaming and about to fight or flight some danger, it zooms on inside the body, showing how orgon can (DE)formate the body structure and create a characterological armoring: repetead flashes of myself about to fight or flight were tickling in his brain, and felt the pressure of being not flexible - felt the characterological armoring all along over back solving and muscles / bones been healed by nanobiological robots that could realignate the matter.


Than, alien told me the importance of not being so wild, neither so political-simbolic-artifact manipulator - the secret is to follow the traditions: mystical, magical and spiritual conceptions of knowledge - the alien exaulted the importance of yoga and posture to maintain a healing optimization my dog was about to receive


and suddently entered in alien holographic fractals domains, everything was so technological - than a alien metal voice talked to myself announcing the beggining of the alien healing optimization:  after 1 min rolling over explosion of holographic fractals that were like a magnetic ressonance machine, felt renewed and went back to other room to anouce him girldog all the space travel! no more back hurts as before.


9pm to 0am: Was experience loads of dialogues coming from a telepatic comunication with the metal voice alien tolding things about universe nature and about my dog girldog. He understood the falsification of neural reality to designate form to cells (the little arranged process of storms of eletrons and biochemestry that leary talks about and neuro atomic brain).


0am to 05am: reality melting - girlfriend emotional expressions were leaking all over the holographic sustainable lines that order the neuroatomic reality of body: storm of eletrons were spreading and melting with bad emotions, showing a psychotic vision of the wickness and degeneration of girlfriend downward emotional pattern - the worm of reciclation (appearing alchemycal ouroboros) turn in devouring all the rot of throughout the entire (would aleister crowley name it choronzon? maybe). I was talking things I´m barelly knows, with property - and prophesied girlfriend thought she was reluctant to talk about: she has a mission in live and its write a book - she told me she knew it and was impressed how I could know it


nothing is coicidence. like said caibalion, its a name given to something occured by unnapointed laws and principles.


5am to 9am: considerations, vislumbrations, made awesome touchy sex, logical analitical thinking to ponder and catalogue OVERWHELMING experience, still on the feeling til other day.


Felt a headache, too!


16 h of AMAZING TRIP!

Thanks for the report, but we don't allow talk about 'SWIM' or 'my dog' or anything like that because it doesn't protect you or the forum.


If you provide a title for the report, it can be moved over to the trip reports section, but we will keep a link to it here. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have DOM powder stored away and am very happy to have acquired it, but I need it to be the right time for trying it out. Luckily it should be quite stable for years to come. I wonder about a low dose some time though...

A low dose can be quite nice as a simulant for socializing with friends. Subpsychedelic it's mostly a "warm" stimulant for me, without a notable crash.

Seems like kind of a waste of such a rare, coveted psychedelic to me. I mean, most psychedelics provide a nice, warm stimulation with increased sociability and creativity at very low doses. I would use something a little more common for that purpose, and if duration is what you want, DOC will do that well too. But, it's your stash and obviously should do whatever you want with it. I'm just jealous because the only time I got to try DOM it wasn't strong enough on its own and it was kind of a letdown. I either needed a higher dose, or the product wasn't pure (took 7.5mg and was very underwhelmed, had not taken any psychs for 2 months).

I'm not sure if DOM would be similar but I know with DOB and DOC I found that at lighter doses there was a unique underlying energy that was stimulating but yet unique and unlike other stimulating psychedelics (e.g. the 2C-xs) and unlike regular stimulants. I could definitely justify taking lower doses for this state of being, something I've only experienced with the DOx series.


I think low dose experiences are underrated, especially with the phenethylamine psychedelics. I've often found them much more rewarding than higher doses. 


That said though, I'm sure his decision for trying a low dose first is more likely to be that he has enough to repeat it again at a higher dose once he's dipped in the shallows. Always the best way to taste a substance imo ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Can anyone comment on the equivalent dosages between DOM and DOC? PiHKAL isnt much help here as the stated dosage ranges of DOM are so much broader than those of DOC.


I'm looking for something along the lines of "DOC is x times more potent than DOM" or "x milligams of DOM is equivalent to x milligrams of DOC". I know that this is obviously a subjective judgment rather than an imperically provable observation but I consider the two substances to be similar enough that the comparison can be made with some level of accuracy.

Low dose experiences are VASTLY underrated, I agree completely. This is especially the case with the Psychedelic Phens & combinations using them. Since first trying 2c-e at the standard 15mg & being completely floored by it, & after combining it with MDMA & Methylone (on seperate occassions) I have been consistently REDUCING my doses to find a comfortable place. With DOC I've been working my way up the dosage scale, with 2c-e I'm working my way down Lol


Low doses of the Psychedelic Phenethylamines have useful effects but this does not seem to translate to the Psychedelic Tryptamines. It seems that doses of the 4-sub-trypts that are too low to produce trip effects are still high enough to produce nausea & tension & these side-effects aren't counter-acted by the enjoyable tripping effects & also seem to last longer. In other words, low doses of 4-substituted Tryptamines produce only the negative side effects that linger, & none of the pleasant effects, at least in my experience!


PS DOM sounds interesting. After a few tries on DOC I have become more interested in DOC's Phenethylamine cousins depite the less than positive reviews these compounds sometimes seem to engender.

Dose: 4mg DOM

Taken at 8:30am.

Fell asleep at 3:00am the next morning.  Duration.....14-18hr.


I am writing a report but I had to make a comment.  Wow, DOM is no joke.  I weighted out 8mg, then (thankfully) divided the dose in half and ate 4mg.  Man, DOM is STRONG.  It has a PUSH.  Most of the time I sat imagining how TERRIBLE it would have been to have taken 5X the amount I did...I am pretty sure I would have lost my mind too if I thought it was LSD.  And (as the literature suggests) it takes a good 4-5hr to build up to a peak.  Also the term psychotomimetic came to mind...to be honest this word more approximated my state of mind that 'psychedelic.'  My state of mind is good, the setting was perfect but at the end of the day...I can honestly comment that I would never take DOM again.  Visually, it can't compare to 2C-T-7...mentally LSD has it beat, I was also sick to my stomach most of the day...it upset my belly in the typical PEA fashion but the insights, visuals, body feeling, etc never made it worthwhile.  It really reminded me of 2C-E the most...in that it was SUPER intense but mostly neutral in emotion with a tendency to go to the negative/scary.  2C-E really felt like DOM condensed down to about 3/4 the length of time.  And the PUSH I mentioned earlier...yup this was speedy.  Ibogaine was never speedy, LSD is never really speedy, but STP has me cranked on max.


Glad to try the infamous "STP" but never again for me...at least with the racemate...I have a couple mg of the (-)-DOM isomer which I hear is far less speedy.

I'll be taking 5mgs of apparently chemically pure DOM this weekend and i'll report back.. I don't know whether I should be apprehensive about the dose. Reports conflict on whether that is ultra intense or not. I have found that I tend to need to take twice as much of any phenethylamine as my friends to achieve the effect I want. (40mg 2c-i, 60mg 2c-b, 40mg 2c-e) I don't know if DOM will fit with that. I suppose I'll find out.

I don't recommend dosages to people but you can take up to 10mg.  It is an ultra intense psychedelic.  Even at 4mg (what I took), and even only hovering between ++ and +++ the entire time...the power of DOM was undeniable.  Completely penetrating into every aspect of the psyche in a very LSD-like way...but the DOM trip is 'slower' than LSD...developing over 4-5 hours and fading around 16 hr.  So no rocket-like launch to the peak more like a helicopter side up to the peak.  Strong peak either way.

Would anyone reccomend it for a first phenethylamine (aside from the APBs, MDMA, methylone)?

at somewhere round 3mg per os, hiking in his all time childhood favourite mushroom picking woodlands?  Its a place I'm familiar tripping in. Tranquillizers, and strong fucking bastards at that, chlormethiazole (an oldschool hypnotic/sedative/anxiolytic, barb like in action, packs one hell of a whallop) and alpha2 adrenoreceptor agonists (clonidine, intravenous or sublingual, tizanidine orally/per rectum) are available ad libitum, oral morphine/codeine are purchasable OTC also, and enough oxy 80s to flatten a bull elephant, as well as antinauseants (an antimuscarinic, but a quat, scopolamine butylbromide. It cannot pass the BBB to produce central effects, so is limited to being a spasmolytic, antinauseant/antiemetic, and lowering sweating.  I take this already as a prescription med, fuckin heavy metal exposure, Cd, Hg, Pb, Cu. Mostly better now though. 


Also, without going too much into synth discussion. Is the product of the most widely used route (nitroalkene reduction) racemic? 


From the sound of it, the single isomers are worth looking at. A chiral resolution, is not something I have done before, but it is not beyond my capability to do so either. 


I have the ability to get hold of more or less as much as I could wish of either 2C-D, DOM, or 2C-D-nBOMe. Not an either-or choice. The 2C-D is a foregone conclusion, already one step behind in the bag. The identity of the compounds is certain, beyond reproach. 


Do 2C-D and DOM complement each other well? how about herb/'noids ?   Really quite looking forward to trying these two, they have been on my list for a while.

No, DOM pretty much sucks.  It gets high praise because it was one of the first synthetic PEAs.  It's a legend because of all the "STP" stories from the 60s.  Once the reputation is stripped and you eat the stuff....there are too many WAY better ones than to get stuck on 16hr speedy as hell....in a not so good way, material.


The racemate is all I've known to exist commercially but the (-) isomer is apparently not too hard to make and some BLers do have some in small private stocks.  I'm sure one day at least one report on the (-) isomer few will surface.  Not sure if I will ever take it but I got a good friend who loves to try all these things more than I do and doesn't seem to mind long trips either...I'll make sure one get written if he was to take it....heh maybe he will even talk me into it.

MGS. Are you sure it's not just psychedelic amphetamines you don't like? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


DOM and DOC are supposedly the least stimulating of the DOx.

I love DOC but with DOM, 8mg separated into two doses 3 hours apart brought me little apart from body load and general speedy trippy fuckedness. I wasn't impressed at all.

Well I love AMPHETAMINE (script, just 5mg-10mg when needed), and even have learned to enjoy amphetamine on sacrements if the day works out that way (I don't intentionally combine but days I was on the script became trip nights and my body is at peace with it).


DOM is the only psychedelic amphetamine I've tried outside MDA, MMDA, MDMA, etc (love all those too)....but based upon the writings of others I trust and know.....DOM has a pretty intense body element, it's noted throughout the Shulgin lab notes too.  Whether it's less stimulating or more stimulating than DOB, I am not sure of.  DOB seems like a somewhat more 'accessible' psychedelic compared to DOM once you excuse how long they both last....from reading I suspect DOB is a bit more visual and perhaps even has some of the 2C-Bish feelings to it...DOM has none of that...it's visual but not insanely so...at least not till higher levels that I will never go to.

Swallowed 7mg then vaped 12mg about 30-50 minutes later. Surprisingly less intense than I Imagined, I'm a huge fan of vaporizing chems for reduced duration and increased intensity. While the experience was visual it's nothing like what I imagine 20mg oral would be. Also vaporization results in a more amphetamine like high.


Has anyone combined DOM qith the nbome series? Getting my hands on 25g,c,i soon. Already tried 25c vaporized and taken 25i sublingual as well as intranasal, but not 25i,g. Vaporizing nbome on a 7-15mg oral dose of dom would be amazing I imagine. Will most likely vape 25g, alone or with either 25c, or 25i, before mixing with DOM, really look forward to 25g, it's my little treasure especially since 2c-g's are impossible to find

Not a huge 'phet fan myself. In light to moderate doses I do find some stimulants tolerable, and in some cases, even useful/enjoyable.


My usage is light though, very light. Typically no more than at most, one day/night, or two nights and the intervening day, I'll often smoke a bit of MPA while I wait for the doc's surgery to open to collect my prescription meds (which includes sedatives, A2Ar agonists, opioids etc. but no stimulants)

**What's DOM like?**


just got a tab of it and was wondering if anyone had any experience with it, is it a light psychedelic like Nbome, 2cb or aMT? or is it more like acid or shrooms in it's intensity?


I thought 25i-NBOME was too shallow, it was pure visuals and no real head trip. Will DOM be better?


considering it's so rare it was ridiculously cheap.

I had an unknown dosage with DOM on one occasion. I had it in a solution in a breath mints bottle, but trying to safely distribute it like that kinda went out the window when I puddled myself. It had a slight discomfort feeling on the come up, but it wasn't at all comparable to a lot of the RC's I had done or Mescaline for that matter. I thought I noticed something rather soon after taking it, but it wasn't anything but expectation. I sat there watching some stupid Martin Lawrence movie after a good period of waiting. I started noticing I was actually coming up when I started noticed a deep reasoning for the idiotic movie I was watching. I ended up deciding to go outside, still having the slightly poisoned feeling, but I sat on my front porch for the next 8 hours+ straight. I sat looking in pretty much the same direction talking to someone on a lower dose of it than I was. It was rather extravagantly colorful. Visuals like it was a beautiful sunny day in some psychedelic green house at 2AM. I remember looking at a street light, and the rainbow halo that was around the light seemed to be spinning around in endless colors. It was seeming like there were more colors that I had ever learned about being displayed. After a while of this, I decided to lay in bed and see what my head could really do with it.


I remember lying in my bed, trying to project myself outwards, but nothing was happening at all when I closed my eyes. After a short period of total relaxation I had this weird sensation like I was getting pulled at the end of my bed to underneath it, or it was like I was melting from my feet. It was an incredibly weird sensation. I ended up not going to sleep and stayed up for the next day with slight graffiti pattern visuals.


I had no real euphoric experience, but I really enjoyed it. The feelings I had during the time on it were completely neutral in every aspect. No anxiety and no real profound thought discovery. It was a great substance to have done with someone else. I was extremely talkative on DOM, unlike most psychedelics I've done.

It's exactly like mescaline. Unless you dose insanely high you'll feel a very gentle bodyhigh and some light enhancement of colours. Beautiful drug but very gentle. 


Any idea what dosage the blotter is?

> The tranquilizing drug Chlorpromazine, frequently administered to calm an LSD taker who has had a panic psychotic reaction, was found to intensify and worsen adverse reactions to STP, leading some doctors to believe that STP like Chlorpromazine, resembled Atropine and hence one potentiated the other. Another report called the drug BZ, a top secret “nerve-gas” being experimented on by the army. When at last the Food and Drug Administration Bureau of Drug Abuse Control obtained samples and analyzed them, they announced it was a mescaline derivative (and hence subject to the Drug Abuse Control Amendment of 1965)

Combining this with the reports of a speedy uncomfortable feeling on DOM and the conclusion is clear: it is probably a potent 5-ht2c agonist! I am not surprised so many people react badly. LSD meanwhile has much lower 5-ht2c affinity (but higher 5-ht1a/5-ht6 affinity).


edit: yup. [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02246074](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02246074)


DOx will, for better or for worse, probably be remembered as "those drugs that weren't so great", even this erstwhile sought-after ligand.

My dose of DOC is 4mg + it's an amazing psychedelic... I like it much better then DOM at 10mg.. DOM is boring to me... & on a side note; DOC and DMT together, at it's peek, is spectacular!

Just got some tabs of DOM and I am very excited to try it. I have had some experience with DOB (very small dose) and DOC (~4mg) and I absolutely loved DOC so I'm looking forward to trying the patriarch of the DOx family. I have a prescription for adderall that I take daily so my body is pretty used to amphetamines and I'm hoping this will cut off the speedy edge people here seem to be talking about. Wish me luck!

Seems like of all the DOx phens out there, that DOC and DOM seem to be the most popular and liked. DOC in particular seems to be a particular favorite of many DOx lovers.


Of all the folks here who have tried both DOM and DOC, which would you prefer more and why? Which one tends to be the more euphoric one for you? Which one would you say resembles a candyflip the most?

DOC is relatively euphoric. DOM also. But I wouldn't think of either when I think of euphoric chemicals. If you really want something euphoric, especially something resembling candyflipping, I would point you towards the higher doses of 2C-B.

Interesting. I've often wondered which would be considered the best 'euphoric' psychedelic chem class between the DOxs (mainly DOC or DOM), 2C-xs (mainly 2c-b and 2c-i), and AMT & all its analogues.


I've also thought about just the DOxs vs the 2C-xs as well. I reasoned that the DOxs would be more euphoric and such since that class of phens are basically the amphetamine versions of the 2C family. Would you say that despite the DOxs being the speedy versions of the 2C family, they still don't effect euphoria and monamine release more so?

I didn't really find DOB more euphoric and pleasurable than the 2C-X compounds that I've tried. It was only 'ok'. But I've heard that DOC is very euphoric and good.

Never had DOM yet. 

I don't find 2C-T-X compounds euphoric in the same way as 2C-D. I find the alkyls more stable and neutral emotionally but 2C-D was pleasant / euphoric in a stimmy sort of way. More like dopamine reuptake inhibition maybe (which would also explain nootropic potential). With 2C-T's it felt much more warm, glowing and mellow like serotonergic effects. I am just mentioning this to illustrate the contrast.

Anyway I personally would not expect DOM to be warm and empathogenic but instead pleasant in the 2C-D way I just described, only with more pronounced amphetaminergic effects of course.


(This is borderline off-topic, if you want to take it further I would ask of you to use that 'favorite empathogenic psychedelic' thread of yours for the comparison you'd like to investigate)

I merely would like to note that even at 5 milligrams i found DOM to be a thoroughly psyche-scrubbing experience. It would be fair to say I got my ass kicked. DOM has the intense visual acuity and ultra-fast hallucinogenic framerate of LSD compounded with the confusing, recursive mindfuck and somatic heaviness of tryptamines. It is indeed a ferociously powerful and beautiful chemical. I say 5 milligrams is too aggressive a starting dose as someone who prefers psilocybe cyanescens at 3.5 grams dried or more. Start low.

I'm gonna have to try DOM again now that I don't have a tolerance that resides in the stratosphere.  Even at the time that I tried it a number of times, I could still get extremely powerful DOC trips, but my DOM trips (even up to 10mg) were all pretty underwhelming.

It's exactly the cognitive effects of DOM that typify the elements of the psychedelic experience I gain tolerance to the fastest. Highly lucid and visual phenethylamines like DOC can still have most of their effect after multiweekly use, but the strongly cognitive, "mind-manifesting on mind-manifesting" chemicals like 2C-E, 4-HO-DMT, and DOM require breaks of a month or more for me to get the full spectrum. Whether because this partly depends on a psychological sense of novelty, or on receptor systems other than central 5-HT2a which might have less elasticity, I can't say.

That makes sense, its true that a lot of DOC's effect for me comes from the visuals and even moreso the emotions, rather than the cognitive aspects.

turns out 3-meo-PCP binds pretty well at the D4 receptor. LSD is a full agonist at the D4 receptor, I wonder how crazy that combo would be.

Holy crabapple I suspect I will be doing this tonight, since Fatima (my mysterious and beautiful cousin from the Arabian Empty Quarter) is bringing some acid and DMT, and my best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with the girl who can get the 3meopcp so some crazy cousin fantasy's are gonna happen I know it!


Re: earlier posts by VoiceoftheTurtle...yeah man.  4mg DOM was  only ++ at the peak but even at that level I understood for the first time in over 20 years of trippin' what a psychotomimetic drug was.  DOM was that.  Never again for me.

LSD and 3-MeO-PCP was pretty puerile insanity to the point it where everything seems mashed together and the only sane thought you could have would be about how insane you currently were. Though they sparkle BRIGHT as fuck on low doses of each or a moderate LSD dose with a low dose 3-MeO-PCP. 


Will be waiting for the report eagerly, brother! DOM is one of the few things I actively seek so getting an MGS report, as well as a Xork report. I hate to say that I know DOM and I would play well together but after using DOC without problems, I figure DOM shouldn't be that much more classically stimulating than DOC was, though psychedelic stimulation is a difficult one(im the sort that crawls the walls with caffeine though...).


Edit: Proceed with absolute caution, this combo caused a strange "blackout" where I wasn't...."in control" of what I was doing or choosing to do. For instance, I know I hopped about on my bed for fifteen or maybe thirty minutes as I can't remember it exactly but I had some delusion that jumping up and down on my bed was causing or doing something. Was obviously totally worthless and I'm god damn lucky the craziest thing I did was chose to hop on my bed. Shit tired me out too as I'm pretty sure the power of the jump was important to whatever crazed theory I was telling myself. I have done combos of four different psychedelics in tune with MXE or DMT or n2o, but the addition, alone as well, of a pin heads worth of powder almost caused some real trouble!

DOM is actually lighter on the body than DOC is... maybe more stimulating, but clean-feeling.  DOC is rather relaxing but has something of a bodyload.  DOM felt very light indeed on my body.

I've heard this said but I seem to interpret effects, especially of things like psychedelics a bit differently. Like I hear most people use the word "agony" to describe 2c-E's bodily sensations.....,me? Ecstasy, bliss, sexy, are the sort of words I'd use to describe it. Of course at times passing 50mgs, yes it was a bit uncomfortable, but nothing like the word agony(though for psyches that is almost a taboo word for me, considering it could always be worse....well then with psyches....![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)).


That's good to hear though, I really was surprised by DOC, maybe it's because I always feel more..."knowledgable" when I've used the corresponding 2c, but with DOC, it was nothing like I expected, in fact DOC may well have been the mentally but not physically stimulating chemical that I know of. I can still picture it, all ready for a long walk, the woods, a dog/etc. Then once I felt the effects enough I grabbed my iPod/phones, put them in, and honestly before this I felt like this heavily before(obviously the JWH-122 kicked in the couch lock much more but it was barely even a hit the way I was going at the time since my pipes contained so much material that it actually took a few seconds of heating with a torch before it began to vape). I remember though the thought line "Explore the woods?", "Later!", "Walk the dog?", "LATER!". At that moment all I wanted to do was sink into my chair, get stoned, and listen to music. That's never how it is with the truly stimulating ones like  2c-I. At least in the beginning portion. 


So the conclusion to this shit ramble? I'm nearly positive I'll like it now which is exciting as DOM, DOC, and DOEF were the DOx's I really wanted so that is nice!

Oh DOM how I loved thee.....I had read stories for so long, STP, etc....took me ages and a helluva lotta work to have my first DOM experience in maybe 1997....and then many more after....as well as saturating my circle and getting all sorts of hilarious reports back. It's a goldy. My fav DOX, with DOET a close second, followed by DOC..


DOM is a helluva ride...Shulgin described it well! Haven't taken it in years...some day, when I am happier and more mentally stable!

Funny thing, the last time I tripped on DOC, during the peak I had the strong feeling that a dose of smoked DMT would have been incredible, peak, breakthrough.  I felt like they would have combined absolutely perfectly.  Glad to hear an anecdotal report of that being true, perhaps I will try that sometime in the future.

DOM has what I believe is the creepiest trip report in PIHKAL: "If on this page I shall have expressed it to you then it is true that DOM has the glory and the doom sealed up in it. All that's needed to unseal it is to surround it with a warm living human for a few hours. For that human for those hours all the dark things are made clear."

The DOxs actually don't interact appreciably with monoamine transporters.  Well, DOM would, but the dosage necessary for significant monoamine release would put you beyond overdose territory.

It's funny, I was just talking about that PiKHAL report with my friend. One of my favorites, aside from the DPT one where the user met God in a synagogue. 

Also, likely it does not "sound" really much like DOET audials - mostly because it seems like Coil tried to recreate the tactile as well as audial aspects of psilocybin. Still has always made me want to try DOET too though.

Well that makes more sense than what I was thinking...The 5-MeO-DMT track always reminds me of the substance in a weird way, even though I've never literally heard a high-pitched twisty drone on any of my trips.


I suppose they picked DOET for this album partly for its alternate name, Hecate.

So how come DOX compounds are so stimulating? I found DOB to be very stimmy, giving me clammy hands and so many more stimulant effects. Dopaminergic agonism?

I'm thinking it's broad-spectrum 5ht2 agonism and direct adrenergic agonism.

I like DOC better by quite a bit.  Except that DOM is much crisper and clearer.  DOC is dreamy, kind of like a close cousin of LSD and mescaline.

I always feel like everything is hanging in the balance with any mis-step in my micro-movements leading to collapse, on DOM. Like whatever effect mushrooms has on your DLPFC it seems to drop goal-oriented information and disrupt Working Memory. You get all sorts of pleasantness and free-association. DOM , on the other hand, locks your DLPFC onto every last bit of Adrenaline processing. I feel like a fighter pilot sometimes with all the Status/Competition/Fear processing that happens in highly social situations, on DOM. Also, whatever thermogenic effects it has creates an extreme sensitivity to thirst and humidity. Sweat, anxiety, skin galvanic responses you gain hyper-awareness to it all. Anyways, my preference is definitely towards higher complexity and higher tension. Sometimes I like to do the hippy thing and just create a serene aura, but usually I prefer to strategically attain peace via high information throughput that has me anticipating beneficial next-moves.

I think it causes everyone hypervigilance (adrenergic agonism) and tension (vaso-constriction). Processing excessive Adrenaline activates goal-oriented brain networks, not the default/idling networks that would allow for non-strategic thinking. The tension (changing regional blood flow) creates an extensional/active movement pattern to sustain dilation and normalize blood pressure. I have always experimented with greater than 12mg, whereas the highest dose reported in Pihkal is 12mg. The pleasantness comes from having to earn your reward processing instead of being thrown into a euphoric mindset from the get-go. I am not prone to anxiety, my cognitive style does give me a unique perspective on contingency-planning mechanisms within the brain though. I am more oriented towards explaining and modeling psychedelic mindstates in line with James Kent's "Psychedelic Information Theory) and others.

Tried DOM today with 10mg. WARNING  I am very insensitive to psychs, don't extrapolate to yourself.


First effects T +1

Hard to act sober T+ 2

peak at T +3-5

From T+ 5 to T+11 hard to communicate etc, but then very social


Overall pretty stimulating, I cycled 80+ km without feeling very tired. Not much headfuck, maybe some at peak, but overall I was able to navigate and use GPS. With 4 mg DOC that was almost not possible, but I did not had this perma-tolerance to psychs back then.


Trip was nice, but overall nothing amazing, would not say it is must try etc. Have some "mystic", "violet-black" feeling to it, though. CEVs are of darker colors.

Stupidly, I ate a lot of yoghurt at T +3 and then had some gastric disturbance. Food at T +10 felt very nice and w/o problems. 


On peak, it was pretty sedating/dreamy in some way, felt nice just to lie there listening to music, watching nature around me. Music on DOM sounds great, spacey and detailed, electronic and pop alike.


This is probably worthy compound, but long acting time makes it suitable more for festival setting. I need to try 15mg at a festival to verify that.

Right now I'm thinking DOC is a bit deeper, but my fav is still AL-LAD

Hi everyone!

I'm about to have my first DOM experience.

I've tried already coke and MDMA.

There will be only two of us (me and a girl, that'll be her first experience too), we will start it in the morning/noon, weather, most likely, will be very hot.

Any recommendations how to spend our time? Indoor or outdoor, if outdoor then crowded places or no, some kind of seaside?

Also what about sexual activity?


Thanks in advance.

Hey welcome to PD / bluelight,


Maybe too late now, but it would have been smart if you had done your homework on DOM on forehand..


I'm not sure that experience with coke or MDMA matters that much, and DOM can apparently be pretty serious, deep, relentless and long lasting. Not something I'd recommend for a first trip.

But of course it can work out very nicely, especially if you know the potency of your DOM product and keep the dose on the low side.


I'd start out indoor at home where you are safe to have the come-up. When the trip settles in and you are ready to 'explore', going outside can be wonderful although I would avoid crowded places. Also don't drive under the influence and be careful venturing out into places that are not easy to return from.


It's stimulating so I'm guessing sex would be rather great, that is unless you are tripping so hard that things become weird. Again, it may be different for a first timer compared to someone who is used to tripping.


Have only had DOB myself.

24.5mg at a bodyweight of 212 pounds. I want to experience the original freak-out dose that made this famous. Are there online tripsitters? I want to try this, right now.

Online tripsitters are imaginary... no one can sit for you while not being there.  People can help to talk you down, perhaps, but it's far from sufficient to be a trip sitter.  Can you find a real trip sitter, at some point?  No need to get impatient, there's plenty of time to embark on serious psychedelic journeys besides right now.

I didn't puss out, lol. I am going to wait until after I come back from Burning Man to post all the epicness. I can't believe it's only the 6th of August there is so much time compression and unforgettable moments happening for me. Shulgin passing away and me speaking with memorial attendees has added a spiritual element to this compound that has been out of this world. So blessed for his discovery.

Planning on taking DOM tonight for the first time, 5mg tab each for me and a friend.

Is it okay to swallow right away like LSD? Not a fan of the chemical taste most RCs have.


Also, thinking of adding a dose of 4-ho-MiPT if we're underwhelmed after 5-7 hours. Worth it or would tolerance set in by then?

I've never tried DOM, but all DOx's are orally bioavailable. I've drank/eaten DOC and DOB multiple times. Only done sublingual once. As for tolerance, I've added new psychedelics at multiple different intervals in my previous DOx experiences, and have never run into problems with it, so I think you'd be good to go on adding 4-HO-MIPT at the 5-7 hour point.


Enjoy and POST! (If you want to)

Yeah the DOXs are quite orally bioavailable, actually I don't even find food in my stomach to affect absorption of DOC much (the one I have by far the most experience with - also it's the best of the bunch in my opinion, though DOM is good too).

Yeah, I've always had DOC in powder form but just wanted to make sure since I only had two blots of DOM (with my friend and I consuming one each). 


It ended up being a spectacular trip, and the Miprocin was not necessary.

Welcome to BL / PD and thanks for the quick description.... I'm very curious to try it but I hardly ever felt like I had an occasion for the kinda long-ish duration even when I wasn't so busy.


Do you have experience with other DOX? I found 25D-NBOMe to be very calm and serene and I really felt like it matched a hell of a lot of DOM descriptions I've read before. I don't care for NBOMe's in general though.

I find DOM to be quite serene at times, but at other times it can be sharp-edged and hectic.  I find DOC to be much friendlier... DOM seems to have a neutral character and a nature that can very quickly turn on you.  DOM is crisper though.  I prefer DOC by a wide margin.

A 7.5mg dose had me in a horribly uncomfortable position for the majority of the trip where I really did feel like if I didn't control my thoughts I could have done some real mental damage. It made me horribly restless and in a state of mental 'pain'. Definitely plan to go back there but with a dose starting at 2.5. Really be careful with this one!

Yeah the few times i did DOM back around 2008-2009 , I could never find a sweet spot for it. All my trips on it were intense whether it was 4mg or 7mg or 9mg. The crazienest of the trips were all equal just about. It is definitely a full ranged psych that doesnt lack anything. The only thing its lacks is the ability to be easy. Very intense stuff here. Beautiful visuals and very stimulating the times i did it.

Took 8mg DOM last Saturday morning (my first time using this stuff). It reminded me somewhat of a ~25mg dose of 2C-E - colorful and clear-headed, but much speedier. I ended up going to the gym and had a great session, felt very confident.

It's not always gentle... in general I have more serene trips on DOC than DOM, but DOM is lighter on the body.  However on the mind it can be pretty pointy sometimes.  For me anyway.  Interesting that you have said you find 2C-E to be euphoric and easygoing, as well as DOM, and I find both to be sometimes quite the opposite.  Though for me 2C-E is much more intense (though I haven't taken DOM above 12mg and that was with tolerance).


I'd love to try DOM again... I got a gram of it years ago and tripped on it a handful of times and then my ex made me throw away my stash and I lost the vast majority of it. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

It really surprises me because 2C-E and DOM were the psychedelics I was most afraid of taking.

In doses of 30mg or less, 2C-E for me is a very euphoric sedative with nice visual effects. I always take it with an antihistamine though (normally cyclizine) otherwise it gives me a minor body load.


This is my second experience with DOM. Best phrase I can use to describe this stuff is 'silly speed'. The overall feeling is reminiscent of low-dose oral meth, with powerful 2C-E-like visuals and a very mild mindfuck. There is no hint of any body load whatsoever - it feels gentler than LSD even.

This drug has helped me hit new PBs in the gym (a 440lbs deadlift and a 220lbs bench). It makes me feel super strong and aggressive.

Yeah it sucked. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  By the way that is a killer deadlift, I just started deadlifting recently and I can do 195... I guess I could maybe do more but I don't want to hurt myself so I'm working up slowly.


But yeah, DOM has some of the least bodyload of anything I've ever tried, I think only AL-LAD had less for me so far (that one feels absolutely nothing but awesome from the come-up onwards).  I found it to be a bit jagged in the mind though sometimes... it can turn quickly.  My favorite is DOC.  It can have some bodyload on the come-up/early peak but the trip is so nice, like a cross between mescaline and LSD, and the plateau stage feels incredible, one of the best states I can think of, like zen-dex-amphetamine.  It feels super euphoric and warm in the body.  I've had euphoria better than MDMA on it.

Thanks man. I only weigh 150 so I was pretty pleased with it. Doing powerlifting on psychedelics is a blast.


Confidence is key here... unless you're recovering from a back injury or something, you shouldn't be afraid to go heavy. Statistically you're more likely to injure yourself bench pressing than deadlifting. As long as you're able to keep your lower back straight when you lift, you have nothing to worry about (upper back rounding is normal and not a problem).

Oh, and always lift raw - you don't need to wear a belt, gloves, straps or anything like that. All you need is a bit of chalk to keep your palms dry (liquid chalk is the best).

I want to try some more DOx - I'm thinking maybe DOC or DOB next.

I need to try AL-LAD as well - it sounds badass. I've heard nothing but good things about that stuff.

Are we talking strength training or psychedelics? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Just kidding, I really need to try lifting on psychs soon. Anyway, reports on this stuff are so inconsistent though. Some people seem to absolutely love it and others hate it. I think I'll grab a small amount here soon, but yeah DOC is starting to appeal to me more and more over this. Unfortunately, the smallest amount of that I can obtain is 1 gram so it may be a while before I push that button. Perhaps DOM for long periods of introspection and DOC for lighthearted fun.

Haha, both dude! If you really want to get familiar with psychedelics you gotta get out and do stuff... fuck monging out on the couch the whole time listening to Pink Floyd and contemplating the meaning of life. Go to the gym, play sports, go cycling... everything becomes more enjoyable.

Take it at home and wait for it to peak before you leave the house so you know you can handle your shit (Trust me: you don't want to be out in public during a psychedelic come up).

DOM is great in the gym. I was getting loads of visuals but it doesn't cause me much in the way of tactile hallucinations, so physically it didn't feel too much different to lifting sober. The aggressive mentality it gave me was just great.

Lifting on LSD is trippy as fuck. The LSD experience is highly sensual - the feeling of your muscles contracting and relaxing while lifting heavy weights is amazing. It's been a while since I last took LSD before the gym but I remember feeling a very powerful mind-muscle connection and having a really good session, although I found it hard to keep count of my reps! LSD is extremely distracting which was actually good in a way because it affected my perception of fatigue.

I know. I was scared of it at first - the idea of a psychedelic amphetamine just seemed so wrong. I was very pleasantly surprised. People say it's super long-lasting but I've always been able to sleep easy after about 8 hours.

2C-E is another drug that I was scared of initially - it tends to get quite a bad rep. For me it's just a highly euphoric and relaxing sedative-anxiolytic with cool visuals and synesthesia.

2C-E is more euphoric; DOM is smoother and slightly less spacey.

Haha that stuff sounds appealing to me while tripping the problem is all my friends just wanna sit on the couch! I think more of my trips might just be solo going forward.

2C-E has been on my to do list for a while. It definitely seems to be the crown jewel of the 2c-x series of which I've only tried 2cb. 

Hopefully our tastes are similar and I enjoy DOM and 2C-E as much as yourself. I would love to uncover the "glory and doom" that phikal speaks of.

It's definitely worth a try. The creator of LSD used to enjoy riding his bike after taking it.

 Tripping with friends is great but sometimes they can hold you back.

The downside to 2C-E is it does have a very steep dose response curve and it can get pretty manic in high doses. It's not something I like to get totally blitzed on (unlike LSD and DPT where more is always better).

You need to play around with it and find your ideal dose. For me it's 25-30mg. I would also recommend taking an antihistamine at the same time. 2C-E does have a little body load - I don't find it too bad but it's still something I'd rather do without.

I was finally able to acquire DOM, now I just have to find the time to take it. I'm torn between trying a threshold dose as a day enhancer or taking 3-4 mg (leaning towards 3) to start with. I have a decent amount so I'm not worried about running out before getting up to the higher doses. 


Honestly, after reading this thread through again I can't say I see myself pushing this above 7-8 mg. I say that despite loving amphetamines and taking them rather often. In the past I have even combined other phenethylamines with my usual dose of lisdexamphetamine to decent success so the speedy mindset is not too intimidating to me at lower doses. It just seems that DOM reveals it's whole character at doses of 7-8 mg and even lower, so it doesn't seem necessary to push higher and risk the side-effects for very little marginal gain.


Trying DOM, regardless of how I end up feeling about it, will surely expedite my search for DOC. Which for some reason I suspect will remind me of AL-LAD which I absolutely adore. Perhaps it's because DOC has a reputation for a remarkable body buzz and mostly lacking in body load. Perhaps that is not a good comparison though, as DOC can probably get heavy much quicker than AL-LAD.

Anyone know what's the cross tolerance like for LSD and DOM?

Reason I'm asking for is I've ordered plenty of both for my summer tripping (and MXE but that's a whole nother biz) and I was wondering how to space the trips out so that tolerance doesn't affect them significantly. First time doing DOM too btw, so hype!

Don't quote me on this, but I think the DOx chems produce a huge tolerance for many others that hit the 5ht2a receptors.


I think about a week, more or less a day or two, should be good.  Of course, though it doesn't seem to be that popular here, smoking some herb should help for those off days and also for increasing the strength of the trips.  They're nice boosters imo.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Heh, well that's why I said to not quote me on it.  I've only tried one particular DOx, but that bit of info was from me asking Xorkoth.  However, I might have good memory but I don't have photographic memory in the slightest, so I think that's what he said.  I definitely remember the part where he said that usually 3 days is what it takes for tolerance to go down all the way.  So to play it safe for others, I just recommended about a week since I haven't tried taking it that often either (sadly I don't have enough material for that).


The huge tolerance bit at the 5ht2a receptor, idk who posted that one but that was also from passing memory.  And honestly, I'm too lazy/tired to check that right now.

Could you link me to a paper that shows DOM does not behave at all like an amphetamine in vivo? It just seems counterintuitive that it wouldn't in addition to all the anecdotal reports on here seeming to paint the picture that it has many subjective similarities to non-psychedelic amphetamines. A good amphetamine buzz fills me with a sense of contentment and gives me a clear head. If I'm speeding I took too much, at least that's how I feel.

Hi,


Ive got 50  5mg DOM tabs. I have experience with LSD,Mescaline,2c-b,2c-e,DMT,NBome25i/c but mainly LSD. I got them for a great price so grabbed a load after reading about how good it is. I have tried DOB once but only at 750mg (half a 1.5mg tab) and it gave me pretty bad stomach cramp so I never bothered taking anymore only got a couple of hits anyway. Is DOM likely to have the same effect? Its likely ill try a quarter tab 1.25mg first anyway just to ensure no adverse reaction. Then ill probably give a half a tab a go 2.5mg. This sound like a good plan? Ive always been weary of the DOx family purely because the stimulating effect always worries me, Even though ive took 25i/c mixed blotters at 1200ug about 20 times with no negative effects. Im probably just been far too cautious but I can afford to be with many tabs. I normally take LSD at around 225ug (confirmed with sending a tab of for testing to EC .150ug hits)


Thanks

I wouldn't expect stomach cramps to be a side-effect that is typical for DOX compounds on your body. The come-up of DOB and DOC were not 100% comfortable for me, but nothing that bad really.

750 µg of DOB is a low dose, probably not enough to really know what it is like.


Starting low like you are planning is smart, just stick to that. If it still does happen to be so that your stomach is sensitive to DOX you will find out that way. You might be able to avoid it with the use of ondansetron, but since I don't hear you complaining about those other psychedelics you mention, it just really sounds like an idiosyncratic reaction.


Not sure what exactly worries you about the stimulation, just stay hydrated and manage your food intake, rest, and energy well by planning your trip properly. Good luck!


I have DOM but unfortunately I don't expect to have opportunities to trip on just about anything for a while. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Hi,


Yes I know 750 µg is a low low dose, it was my tester dose to ensure no adverse reaction. It gave me about 8-9 hours if mild stimulation and boadline visuals Id guess I would need 1mg to actually get any visuals. It was the fact I got pretty bad stomach cramps that stopped me taking anymore. Ive always been weary of stimulants for some reason, I just envision a rapid heartbeat for hours. Im sure this isnt the case, Ive used MDMA 30+ times and never really noticed an increase in heart rate but then again its not really a typical stim. Would it increase heartrate moreso than MDMA do you think?


Thanks

Hello everyone

I got my hands on one 5mg tab of DOM. I've tried LSD twice, Mandy 10+ times, 4 aco 3 times. I've read too much on DOM and I'm nervous to give it a try. I was thinking of doing just half the tab to start off with since I'm very unsure. What do you guys recommend? Thanks!

2.5mg of DOM is a very low dose, I wouldn't expect anything too intense from 5mg even (but it should be a nice introductory trip).  I think it you only take half you'll be disappointed.  If you had more I'd say give the lower dose a try because it certainly couldn't hurt, but if you only have the one tab I'd take the whole thing.


DOM is quite forgiving in my experience, it has virtually no bodyload.  it does last a long time but I think the intensity of it was a bit overstated simply because when it came out first in the 60s as "STP", the tabs were dosed at 20mg, which is insane, and people were taking more than one in many cases, so were just taking way too much.

I found 8 to 10 mg to be quite a decent dose..

I found 5mg to be very pleasant, and not overwhelming at all. Although there was the classic point in the trip where I was like, okay, this is it, I'm going to be tripping forever. But that thought rolls around in my mind almost every time I take a DOx x) ~

I am going to try DOM tomorrow by first time, on a party on the beach. I plan to try 3,75mg, planning to combine it with a tryptamine like 4-AcO-DMT to potentiate psychedelic effects.


Is there any experience combining it with a tryptamine?


From the dosage I plan to take, I am not expecting a very intense experience (no more than 16 hours I guess?). I think it could be definitively interesting to build a table describing the dose/duration curve for DOM, since it seems like duration of the experience is greatly affected by the dosage, like happens with the rest of psychedelic amphetamines..

Personally I wouldn't do a combo the first time you try it! You want to get a taste for its unique flavor before mixing and matching!

I plan to do it after the peak of the DOM, probably after 6-7 hours of taking it, since I guess it's not going to be an experience so intense at all. I was also thinking just sticking to the DOM and increase the dose, but I am not sure about how I am going to feel in regards with the body load. Also, I don't want to redose to prevent a very prolonged experience.


My idea is to use DOM as a gateway for the other tryptamine, keeping a low dose to see how I personally react to it. Some people reports DOM as sometimes being psychedelically 'neutral', I remember MGS reported negatively about it (about the stimulation), that's why I would like to start low (as well because it's my first time with DOM). He was comparing it to 2C-E but with an extended duration and negative psychotomimetic effects. I personally enjoy 2C-E and don't notice the body load, but I know plenty of users that feel exactly the opposite.


I remember some anecdotical reports of combination of DOx with other tryptamines, but I am not able to find them now. I thought about a small dosage of 4-AcO-DMT afterwards because its potency and lack of negative effects on me, together with the positive/serene-like feeling it generally provides. I am limiting the scope to tryptamines because phenethylamines could also potentiate the stimulation side of DOM.


Combinations should be always taken very seriously, since not always end up in a good experience. Sometimes can be even, fatal. It's not this case but, my question is more related to how the psychedelic "headspace" is going to be. I already know from others that DOM can be dark/weird by itself, but in low dosages it should not be that much I guess.


If anybody had any experience combining DOM (or other compound from the DOx family) with other non-stimulant psychedelic, please post your comments.

I find DOC to be a pretty good "gateway" for tryptamines.  Last weekend I had one of the most wonderful trips I've ever had when I had taken 2mg of DOC earlier in the day (like 7 hours prior) and then I had 30mg of 4-HO-MiPT on top of it... they really combined nicely.  The tryptamine was more grounded and the trip was very focused on my life, as is always the case with DOC.  But it had that wonderful flowing tryptamine character too.  If you're well post-peak and you really feel it, I'd say it would be okay, could be great.  But definitely get post-peak first so you get to experience DOM on its own.

Indeed, perhaps it's best this be taken to its own discussion thread.  I'll grab the posts from here about it and put it in its own thread.

As long as you know your shit, DOM is nothing to worry about. The OD threshold isn't *that *low... nothing like NBOMe anyway.

Just realize that it takes a **long **time to kick in (over 90 minutes). It got a bad rep back in the 60s because people would think they hadn't taken enough and redose way too soon.


I used to take 5-10mg at a time (I had a bunch of 5mg blotters). If I could sum up DOM in one phrase it would be "2C-E lite"... it's very similar to 2C-E but watered down. More clear-headed, less euphoric, less 'flooring' and NO body load. Visually it's nice but I never got synesthesia off it like I do with more 'heavy duty' psychs (2C-E, LSD, shrooms/4-AcO-DMT).

It should work well for that.  The one time I took DOM (the time you mention below, the dose was 4mg) I took some pure psilocin at the tail end of it, and it made for a good launchpoint.  Hopefully you react better to DOM than I did, the bodyload for me was severe...far worse than the few hours of 'body kink' I get from 2C-E.  As you note, it varies from person to person as seemingly all the shulgin psychedelics do.

Anyone have an idea of how long the tolerance lasts? 3 weeks ago I took 10mg, about 4 days later I took 15mg and it felt very weak. It's been 2 weeks since the 15mg dose, would it be fine to take it again or should I wait another week?

I agree, LSD and DOM was a beautiful, warm and relaxed trip for me. Ive always been underwhelmed by DOM alone, my highest dose was 15mg and I barely got anything from it, equivalent to half of one of the LSD blotter I have right now.

Hey fellas, I've read this entire thread + Erowid + reddit, but to be honest it doesn't tell me that much about DOM's visuals or headspace. If someone who's got some experience with DOM could describe it a bit more? Obviously with psychedelics there's really only so much you can say, but if anybody has anything to add I'd love to hear it.

DOM's headspace = psychotomimetic

DOM's visuals = crappier version of 2C-E.


Of course I only tried it the one time.

Really, you guys were underwhelmed by DOM? I had a fairly strong, beautiful experience from 5mg (tabs marked as such). 


Clear, peaceful headspace, similar to LSD. Visuals involved a lot of pattern overlays. My favorite visual from the experience was when my friend and I were walking around a neighborhood late at night, and were about to turn down a street... when we both saw a HUGE, complex spiderweb. Literally covered the entire entrance to that block, and tall too. We both saw it. We didn't walk up close to it... we turned around and walked down a different street.

I mean, to be fair, it could have been real, but I doubt it.

hi, bluelight noob here, thanks for the long dom thread.


I did 5mg of dom for the first time last night and had a great time. For me it was similar to a sub 100mic acid trip in terms of body high and visuals, but with a much clearer, happier and speedier headspace. Never thought I'd say it but I think I like this stuff better than acid. Dom might become my new weekly psychedelic.


I have a couple questions though which don't seem to have been mentioned in this thread. First, I've never done amps, partly because I'm worried I'd like them too much. So how does dom compare to an amp?


2nd, I dropped a 1mg xanny at about the 10 hour mark (no end in sight) to try to end it gently. With some weed this worked beautifully to make a calm blissed out state till I got to sleep about the 12 hour mark. So my question is what about using xanax as a regular thing to end a dom trip? I'd be looking at doing this once a week on average. Thanks for any help.

I would not suggest taking DOM weekly. I'm pretty sure it creates more tolerance than regular psychedelics because it's longer lasting. 


In regards to Xanax, I would avoid taking any DOx chems without benzos on hand. But then again, I get really bad insomnia from stimulating psychedelics.

I jut bought some DOM tabs and am wondering if the psychedelic PEA's deplete serotonin the way MDMA and methamphetamine do?


I just want to be careful with anything that creates a "hole" that needs filling later...hence the depression following some PEA's.


If not, then I may try using it on a semi-regular basis a little like Xorkoth does with DOC.


The DOM I have are 2.5mg blotters so dosing will be much easier than with DOC I think.


Sol? Xor? anybody?

The DOX drugs shouldn't cause noticeable depletion of neurotransmiters. They are pharmacologically distinct from other amphetamines. The pharmacological profile of DOX drugs resembles 25X-NBOME drugs. Most DOX and 25X-NBOMe groups of drug bind with hyper selectively with 5HT2 receptors. Be careful and stay safe.

They're known to have significant affinity for serotonin transporters, and though most studies only quantify them in terms of IC50 (thus measuring only reuptake inhibition), they're also known to be TAAR1 agonists and so likely act as serotonin releasers to some extent--though I suspect their high lipophilicity trends them more towards blocking over releasing--similarly to mephedrone) This being said, the active dosage here is extremely relevant: Even though DOx compounds are probably at least as strong if not stronger as serotonin reuptake inhibitor/releasers than their relatives (parachloroamphetamine, paramethylamphetamine, parabromoamphetamine) they're dosed at an order of magnitude below the psychoactive dose of those compounds.


There's also evidence of 5ht2a-receptor-associated neurotoxicity in animal studies with DOI. 


I don't know how you define semi-regular, but I don't think Xorkoth uses it all that often. He used to use it frequently when he was abusing psychedelics. 


Although I've taken a break from tripping, I was probably the second most prolific user of DOC on this forum, after him, though I tended to use it in lower doses. I would even occasionally redose it at sub-milligram quantities for many days at a time--just using it as a stimulant. 


I'm going to go ahead and say that that sort of behavior is extremely unhealthy: sleep disturbance, bio-accumulation, chronic 5ht2b agonism, etc. And subjectively, DOC certainly feels hard on the body. But at the same time there's no compelling evidence in favor of enforcing mandatory 3 month waiting periods between trips, or anything like that. 


I will say this: as Shulgin said, DOX are dyed-in-the-wool psychedelics. They're deep, they're visual, they're long, they're physical, and they're harrowing. if you abuse them, you *notice*. 


On the other hand, I've found that DOC is sufficiently powerful that you can trip on it the day after tripping on another psychedelic, with almost no change in intensity of effect. You can even trip two day consecutively, with "relatively" little dosage escalation. Not that I'm recommending that behavior, of course.

I did used to use DOC quite often when I was abusing psychedelics, in fact one week I was on vacation at the lake house, spending my days hanging out with family and (partying) cousins and a friend I brought with, swimming, tubing, waterskiing, exploring the forest, having bonfires, etc, and I took it every one of the 7 days I was there.  Afterwards I felt really exhausted for about a week but all things considered, MUCH better than I would have been after taking a serotonin releaser or even some other non-releaser psychedelics I can think of for that many days in a row.  And of course I always kept my dosage reasonable... the first day it was 3mg, and I think the last day I had 7mg left and took that, but it wasn't as strong as my initial 3mg dose because of tolerance.


These days I take DOC maybe once a month at most.  Last summer I took it almost every week, one day during the weekend that I always devoted to spending the day hiking in the mountains, because DOC is the best hiking enhancer.  I find this rate of usage to be very sustainable for me, but I still don't really recommend tripping weekly for very long, if at all.  This year my psychedelic usage is more like twice a month.

OK. I remember reading that DOM, in particular, was used to measure?,  track?, 5HT2 receptors. Which, until now, didn't mean anything.

It's not a quote. It's a paraphrase. 


"DOC is clearly a long-lasting, dyed-in-the-wool psychedelic." 

And 

"This is what I might call an archetypal psychedelic. Everything is there in spades, with few if any of the subtle graces..." 


I think you very well know where it came from.

^Why does me disagreeing with an idea make me biased? Furthermore why attack me rather than my argument. The evidence supports my belief DOX chemicals have much less safety than LSD. My only goals are protecting novice psychedelic users from potential risks and protecting the reputation of psychedelic medicines.

No, it's just way it's gone about that's a bit wonky. Your much better at it than Steamboat, honestly. It's just perpetually obvious that the DOx's are clearly more dangerous than LSD or psilo, anyone who can't realize that by quite simple/easy observations doesn't have any business working with these chemicals in the first place, IMO. Your comparing DOx's though with two of the safest psychedelic chemicals known to man, which is fairly unfair. Realistically though a fair majority of psychedelics are relatively safe(DOx included), as long as there used with proper  basic safety protocols... Comparing them to other drugs, surviving 120 or so mgs when an active dose nicely active dose can be one....could just be luck or could be a curve showing a pretty damn fair margin of safety. Even though it was spread out and tolerance was at play, you'd have to have serious eye problems to mistake 50mgs for something like five, as there's a pretty clear difference there(so as long as you use the right equipment, stay rational, and don't have unfortunate things like blacking out on benzos during consumption...you'll be safe, though obviously anything can happen at anytime...). Yes it's sad that everyone and their mothers have acess to these compounds, but that's just reality. Like how some people will never use any compound safely because they have no care for themselves or others. These people die, be it from mischance, misfortune, bad luck, stupidity, Darwinism, or whatever you would choose to call it....


I truly respect the spreading of a proper message on safety, but there's a time, and place! I apologize for that post, I had misread trying to speed read your post. I thought you were debatibg the safety again(not a bad thing but do it in the right thread, not that you didn't!). I find it proper to debate these things, but in the proper channels...so sorry for off topic junk!


PN, if you have a chance, it'd be awesome if you could write a brief summary about your experience with DOM or a TR! Thanks!

I've already quoted a post that you made, wherein you (seemingly) deliberately misrepresented what someone else said in an effort to further what you already believe to be the case; namely, that DOx drugs are dangerous. Unsurprisingly, you didn't reply to that post.


That post, by the way, was contained in this topic: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/763639-130mg-of-DOC-alongside-high-doses-of-other-psychedelics](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/763639-130mg-of-DOC-alongside-high-doses-of-other-psychedelics)


In this topic, you said that someone experienced worrying symptoms from an "estimated" dose of 4mg. This was complete bullshit, as the user which you shamefully paraphrased and misrepresented specifically said, and I quote, "don't even try and eyeball DOC. I did."


That is basically one of the most blatant demonstrations of bias I could imagine. Misrepresenting what other people say, publicly, in order to further a narrative is being biased. 


And by the way, no one disagrees with your "goal;" we all try to arbitrate harm reduction. But making comparisons to NBOMe drugs is simply *not* backed by any sort of evidence, and reeks of hysterics. 


People have had limbs amputated at massive overdoses. Some people have died. This is not really surprising. We've witnessed this happen with 2c-e, 2c-t-7, and various other phenethylamine psychedelics. What we haven't seen is people dying randomly from normal doses of DOC, or DOM. I'm confident that you are unable to provide me with documentation of multiple cases of this happening. Until you can (which, again, I'm fairly confident you can't) comparing this class of drugs to the NBOMEs is deliberately incorrect. If it's not deliberate, then you're just ignorant and/or stupid. Sorry, that's just how I see it.

Can anyone make comparision of DOM vs DOC? I was, on the past, a DOChead. I would take 2-3mg every week, some weeks more than once. I choosed it over LSD everytime! But there have passed some years since I took my last dose of DOC. Now I've got a job, and a lot of respect for the substance, and can't find a fucking weekend to spare so many hours in psychedelicland. But I've got some suposed 5mg DOM labelled tabs that I want to try on a festival next month, and I was wandering how would DOM compare to DOC, since I already know DOC very well!

I find DOM to be more transparent in the body than DOC.  DOC has that wonderful warm glow that reminds me of mescaline kind of, and I found this lacking in DOM.  DOM felt good, but much lighter in the body (also less bodyload/potential for negative body feelings).  DOC is more euphoric by a lot (for me in my experiences anyway), and also more visual.  DOM is shorter in duration.  Also I find that DOC produces a plateau stage after the strongest effects that is uniquely wonderful and euphoric, which I have not found in any of the other DOXs, including DOM.


I prefer DOC but DOM is a nice drug too.  I want to try it again to get a better impression, because I just did it a handful of times during a period of intense psychedelic (ab)use, so I had a lot of tolerance, but I was also using DOC during that time period so I can make a direct comparison still.

Thanks for the summary Xorkoth. I too love DOC, but have just got my hands on some DOM and having read your previous posts regarding DOC I fully trust your judgement!

Just a quick question: you mention a shorter duration; how much are we talking? I find that with DOC I can easily spend 16 hours just enjoying everything it has to offer; would DOM be closer to 12 hours or so in your experience? I do tend to extend the trips with quite a bit of weed once I'm over the peak.

Yeah I think DOM's duration is closer to mescaline, probably a little longer.  Longer than LSD still, but by hour 12 is was pretty much down, if I recall.  With DOC, 16 hours in and I'm still well within the plateau stage, sometimes I can't sleep for 24 hours.

Sounds good. No need to arise at 7am in order to prepare for dosing on DOM then! Much as I love DOC, you really have to have 2 full clear days in order to really enjoy the experience and recover. As I reach middle-age, money isn't the problem any more, and time has become invaluable.

Yeah DOC certainly is a time commitment.  I assume I won't sleep that night unless I wake up early and take it, and even then, I don't get much.  Amazing drug though.  I prefer it to DOM for sure, but they're both good.  DOM is lighter on the system.

Then Shuglin actually didn't say most of those words. Most of those words didn't sound the same as Shuglin.  Please let me explain my thinking on this issue.


The DOX chemicals were nearly the earliest chemicals Shuglin researched (~1960s). Eventually Shulgin learned the 2C-X group of chemicals were both safer and had much shorter durations of action. With this observation Shuglin transitioned from researching the DOX chemicals and began researching 2C-X chemicals. This direct quote explains this here:


> Alexander Shulgin said:

> 			The obvious step to go was take off the methyl group and get away from the amphetamine chain. So I took the methyl group off and that gave 2C-B and then 2C-I, a host of other materials in the same ilk, that was just a beautiful rich collection of compounds. Many of them not as potent as the amphetamines but shorter lived and much more benign and much more friendly than the corresponding amphetamines.

In 1991 the Shulgins published [PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story](https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml) documenting this reseach.

This focus on tryptamines continued.  At the end of his life Shulgin was working on N-allylated tryptamines including 5-MeO-DALT and 5-MeO-MALT as was mentioned in this [link](http://www.vice.com/read/the-last-interview-with-alexander-shulgin-423-v17n5).

Thus, my perspective is the result of the fact Shuglin stopped researching DOX chemicals decades ago because of the duration and excessive risks associated with DOX chemicals' use.

You make a fair point about InterestingFACT's paraphrasing not being an accurate quote and then go on to try and prove your point by using exactly the same method! You can contend all you like by trying to read into words what is not actually there!

My contention would be that Shulgin simply loved exploring different chemicals as evidenced by his Extensions and Commentary sections. Yes, he moved on to other chemicals, but I've always read it as him being incredibly hungry to explore pyschedelic possibilities rather than writing off any particular group. Reading PiHKAL and TiHKAL it is clear which substances he doesn't bother with (the inactive) and those that are genuinely unpleasant. He was a scientist through and through and it was a logical extension to explore the Triptamines having already explored a huge amount of Phens. 


Either way, it's all beside the point. I get that you had a bad experience on DOX at some point. I also get the fact that some guy had some toes removed following a huge overdose (in combination with a huge quantity of other drugs). I read what is out there and weigh up the evidence; I'm happy taking DOC and am happy to take DOM. Not to bothered about the others in the DOX group, but not because there is anything that scares me, rather I think I'll stick to the two I know I like. 


On the other hand, I wouldn't touch the nBomes with a barge pole. There is genuine danger in those as evidenced by the deaths on normal recreational doses even taken in isolation. I'd like to think that I won't go into a benzo blackout and down over 100mg of DOC, but if I did then I would expect there to be serious consequences.

> The DOX chemicals were nearly the earliest chemicals Shuglin researched (~1960s). Eventually Shulgin learned the 2C-X group of chemicals were both safer and had much shorter durations of action. With this observation Shuglin transitioned from researching the DOX chemicals and began researching 2C-X chemicals. This direct quote explains this here:

I suspected you were going for the "gotcha." 


The paraphrase was one clause, included in the same sentence as the attribution. That paraphrase was accurate, and in fact quite nearly word-for-word, despite coming from memory. 


Your attempt to insinuate otherwise is immature at best. Please move on to substantive issues. 


Speaking of which, your claims about Shulgin's "evolution" towards phenethylamines have been discussed and widely discredited in the past--the typical issue with your posts thus rears its ugly head once more. As I and others have previously stated, Shulgin was a *chemist* first: it was the "obvious step" to remove the a-methyl group because of the open question of activity and potency conferred by presence or absence of that group. It was thus a chemically logical substitution to manipulate. 


And all of this has no bearing on the patently obvious truth that, as a rule, alpha-desmethyl phenethylamines are less harsh on the body than their alpha-methylated homologues. This statement does not render alpha-methyl homologues valueless or even inherently dangerous, as you suggest. Need I remind you that Pihkal was published at once, as a single volume? Obviously he believed that the many amphetamine compounds he worked with were worthy of the praise that he heaped upon them--and a preference, if in fact such a preference even existed, for 2c-X compounds does not discredit this praise. 


In fact, it's worth mentioning that DOM specifically was one of Shulgin's "magical half dozen."

Shulgin's preference for 2C-B was noted in the article. However, it is a subjective preference and doesn't lend any weight to the theory that he specifically moved on to the tryptamines due to issues with the phens; quite the contrary in fact. It's personal taste and I find 2C-B to be interesting but far from a favourite. I much prefer the evil DOC!

Please elaborate on the "why" you prefer DOC to DOM. I liked DOC fine, but dosing it is a bitch..IMO. I know, get better scales so i don't have to weigh a quarter gram to use for my volumetric dosing. 

All that said, I recently purchased 300 2.5mg blotters of DOM and have yet to try any...so, Xorkoth, why the preference for DOC? I greatly respect your opinions in these matters...and am very curious to hear it.

DOM is "lighter on the body"...enlighten me.

I prefer DOC for a variety of reasons.  I find it more fully engrossing than DOM.  It produces a certain amount of enhanced sociability and empathogenesis that DOM does not.  It feels very nice in the body, except for occasionally during the come-up (DOM is gentler but much more transparent on the body).  DOC's visuals are colorful and beautiful, the whole thing reminds me fairly strongly of a cross between mescaline and LSD.  To me it combines some of the best aspects of different psychedelic states into one and produces a very full and satisfying trip.  Each time I tried DOM I felt it lacked something compared to DOC.  Finally, out of all the DOXs I've tried (DOB, DOC, DOI, DOM, DOT, DOET, DOPr), only DOC has this magical plateau stage that I have often talked about, where about 9 to 10 hours into the trip, it shifts gears into a comfy, stimulated, euphoric, good-humored state where I feel like I'm firing on all cylinders, one of the most perfect states of mind I've encountered.  And it's very reliable, it does this every time for me.  I have learned how to maximize DOC's effects, and when I choose to do a DOC day, it always numbers among the days I think back on the most fondly.  No other psychedelic has been so consistently good and full in its effects for me.

Indeed, as was DOB.  It is beyond argument that Shulgin loved both DOM and DOB more than almost all of his other creations.  If he had decided against them he wouldn't have stated them as part of his magical half dozen when he published his work.

I interpret the quote I gave earlier in this thread differently considering DOX chemicals caused fatalities and I think the quote was from after the publication of PiHKAL. In either situation I accept and appreciate your different opinion. I appreciate you're being kind.

Had 10mg of this today.


What a lovely, floaty trip.


Easy on the body load, nice pattern visuals and colour enhancement. Music is great, amazing mood.


Come up and come down are very smooth.


Peak was about 5-6 hours long, but it's hard to tell because the comedown is a smooth gradual process, not like LSD where you suddenly know it's over.


Also - not speedy, as a lot of people tend to believe.

I'm in a bit of a quandary over DOM. I will be in Scotland next week enjoying the midsummer twilight and was considering trying out my DOM stash. However, I really love DOC and am sorely tempted to go for 4.5mg and enjoy the ride. Tough decisions! Of course, I could still trip on DOM a few days later, but then tolerance will be an issue and I really want to experience it cleanly for the first time.

Im off to a mini festival this weekend and want to give DOM a go (I've got 20mg in 2.5mg tabs).


Id say Im an experienced tripper having taken acid 40 times and 4aco 33 times as well as various other 2c family drugs and tryptamines. 


Ive taken some very high doses of 4aco (biggest was 420mg [not a typo] with maoi moclobemide) and have gone as high as 20 hits with acid, and 100mg with 2cb


So I reckon Im a heavy tripper (although i also enjoy low doses) BUT all the advice on here says to exercise caution with DOM therefore Im going to be cautious and take 5mg ... however to avoid an underwhelming experience


Can I not take 5mg wait 3 hours then redose with 5mg more? Or does redosing not work?


If redosing isn't a possibility I could throw some 4aco or lsd into the mix perhaps?

Do you think 10mg would be an ok first time dose of this?

Was there a lot of stimulation, euphoria, visuals?

Was the comeup anxious at all?

Headspace was...?

Do you have experience with other DOXs, phuckingnutz?  10mg seems high for a first time, particularly for a DOX which has more potential to go badly wrong.  It depends on if you have experience with others, and what doses you take of those.

Had a couple grams DOC and did several 5-10 mg runs with that, but ended up selling it to get something else.

I didn't like having something so potent around the house. I have kids and animals. I know DOM is also potent, but this is on blotter so it's easier/safer to deal with.

Yeah DOM is quite a bit less potent than DOC, if you were doing 5-10mg, I think 10mg of DOM is not as strong as 5mg of DOC.

I took 4mg of DOC on Wednesday (I was debating whether to take DOM, but wanted something I knew). I was blown away! I've taken 4.5mg before but that was with some tolerance. I live the way DOC comes on slowly. The visuals were extreme: at one point all the icons on my laptop left the screen and started flying around. 

Anyway, I digress. I'm going to go for DOM on Sunday or Monday. Not an ideal period of time since the last trip, but time constraints mean it's the only chance I'll get for a few months. I'd assume that 7.5mg would be ok?

Yeah 7.5mg should be fine.  Probably weaker than 4mg of DOC.


DOC is my favorite DOX out of DOB, DOC, DOI, DOM, DOPr, DOET and DOT.

Well, I went for the 7.5mg dose.

Interesting.

A few comparisons with DOC (the only other DOX I've tried).


1. Come up time seems a bit longer. Looking at my trip notes, I was experiencing fairly intense visuals by the 2 hour mark on 4mg of DOC. On DOM I had first alerts at about 30 minutes (similar to DOC), but it took a long time to progress.

2. Stimulation. I didn't notice much more stimulation on DOM as compared to DOC during the come up. However, it was different during the Peak (more on that in a bit).

3. Mental effects. DOM seems to drag you I  a bit deeper. It's easier to get lost in thought than on DOC.

4. Visuals. A marked difference between the two. On 4mg of DOC, objects would dissolve in psychedelic dust, and then shift around. As an example, I had a shirt hanging on the wall: almost as soon as I looked at it, the writing on the front would pixellate into a sort of neon yellow dust and float off to the right. It was impossible to stop this happening so at one point I was laying flat out almost drooling (sounds very flattering I know). 

On DOM, once the visuals really kicked in, they were more like time lapse films (think of videos showing plants growing as an example), but I was fully aware of the frames changing. This would start with a sort of twitching in my left eye after which the right eye would join in and the next few minutes would be like uncontrollable blinking. Every blink changed the perception of what I was seeing. The shirt on the wall would change position, it would change shape, the writing would move etc. However, it was not smooth like DOC. I guess this is caused by the increased stimulation of DOM? In summary, DOM is IMHO every bit as visual as DOC, but in a different and again, IMHO, not such a good way.


The twitching visuals lasted for about 3 hours, becoming regular and lasting longer during the Peak (I'd say between about hour 6 and hour 9) before tapering off.


5. Bodyload. I’ve never encountered bodyload issues on any psychedelic drug. I find myself having to perform more bowel evacuations than usual, but it is not really an issue. I have never suffered from sickness. DOM and DOC are no exception to this. The only negative bodyload is some jitteriness during the come up phase. I went for a walk for the first two hours when I took DOM and I think this helped a lot. After the initial two hour period there were not any noticeable negative effects for me.


6. Duration. It has been said that DOC is longer lasting than DOM. I think that in terms of the peak effects, they are of similar duration; on both substances I’d say that the real peak has passed after twelve hours. The extra few hours on DOC is more of an afterglow effect where there is some residual stimulation which can either be enhanced by using another substance, or just enjoyed for what it is.  DOM seems to taper more quickly. Having said that, I’ve been able to sleep after twelve hours on both substances.


In summary, I definitely prefer DOC to DOM; it seems a much smoother ride. Having said that, DOM (at these doses anyway – 4mg DOC v 7.5mg DOM) appears to have the ability to take you deeper. When on DOC I am able to just sit back and take the ride. In some of my notes I wrote after a particularly intense period of visuals that “things are just doing their own shit”. On DOM I found myself questioning what I was seeing a lot more; as Xorkoth says, DOM seems to have something of a delerient effect that isn’t there in other substances such as DOC). Anyway, I still have 7.5mg of DOM left to play with and I will take it when I have less tolerance as this test was performed just five days following my 4.5mg DOC trip.

Great synopsis, thanks for that!  I pretty much agree with everything you said.  It's been quite a long time since I've had DOM, so this actually reminded me of my experiences a bit.

So you agree that DOM is more stimulating than DOC? I thought the other way until I read this last post :S

Oh I guess not that part, I felt a little less stimulated on DOM.  But I'm not sure how it would be now that I am not overusing psychedelics.  I really hope I get a chance to try out DOM again.

Indeed. I noticed that during the initial stages that there was no real difference in terms of stimulation. The key difference was during the visual stage. I've had stop frame visuals before, albeit briefly when mixing miprocin and metocin, but this was much more intense, more frequent and longer lasting. It wasn't completely unpleasant, but I prefer the DOC style of visuals. Has anyone else experienced this on DOM? Is it a feature of the drug or was it purely personal?

I knew the cat who built this critter  myself and there is nothing fast and out of control about it aside from an increased heart rate. The visuals are beautiful and full of motion. The eyes closed imagery is infinite. 10mg is perfect but very intense. After you take it make sure you eat something that is nice to puke up.

People sure have radically different responses from hyper-selective 5HT2A agonist such as most DOX and 25X-NBOMe drugs. I noticed the same variance with 25I-NBOMe. Even low doses caused extreme nausea, strong negative effects, and strong bitter taste in me. Other people didn't experience those negatives.


With any drug some people react differently. This appears especially true with these drugs. Start with an allergy test and stay safe.

Indeed. Everyone reacts differently. I appear to have the stomach of an ox and virtually nothing gives me nausea (except maybe olives☺).

It's true.  However I think it's fair to point out that the same variance is true of other classes of psychedelics as well.  I know people who get really bad stomach gas and even someone who gets bad nausea from LSD.  Many people experience bad nausea from the 2C-Xs too, though I do not (but I used to, strangely).

Tried this one yesterday at 5mg with 15mg of 3-meo-pcp and still feeling it at +16h, I feel better than I had felt in a long time. Compared to DOC, this one seeems to be less stimulating and visual, but it feels gentler on the body, and the awesome intense euphoria from the combo was a lot of fun![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I remember sometimes having a weirdly flattened emotional affect from this one, which I also experienced from 2C-E. Anyone else get that? The other DOx-compounds could go up or down for me, but didn't really flatten that I can recall.

I've actually never mixed DOXs, I'd think though that it would be okay, and just blend the characteristics of them together, so long as you make sure to dose them both lower so it will add up to one total dose and you don't take too much.

That's a pretty high dose, a full dose of each.  I'm thinking you went too high.  Also DOB seems to cause  more vasoconstriction for me than either DOM or DOC, and DOC causes more than DOM.

I used to get nausea on LSD a lot more and unless there is an underlying gastric issue I think it's mostly induced psychologically, in some cases a form of anxiety. I had read that while the 2cs would affect nausea receptors, LSD doesn't. Anyone who studies chemistry able to expand?

I think you may be on to something.  When I started taking psychedelics, I always got nausea and body malaise, and I also always had intense, anxious come-ups.  I remember the first time I took 2C-I, for example, I threw up probably 10 times.  Nowadays, I rarely get any sort of discomfort at all on the come-up of any psychedelics... I can take 2C-I and never feel even the slightest twinge of nausea.  I think it boils down to experience and the resulting comfort and lack of anxiety.

I've often felt that way except in certain circumstances. In those it seems like certain psyches are nausea prone and I've always believed it to be a mixture of psychosomatic and receptor binding. 2c-E and mescaline are good examples. LSD which I've done so many times has never caused me nausea.

For me I have puked the majority of the time when I take DOB or DOM,  and so I have something that's been perplexing me a close friend of mine took 3 hits of DOB (1.4mg tabs)  and felt EXTREMELY sick he said he felt like he was going to die and it was more than nausea it was a LOT of vasoconstriction like within 3-4 hours after he took it we drank some shroom tea and he said after he drank that shroom tea he stopped coming up and tripped less hard than the 3 past times we have done it so then he decided to see what might happen if he took one more and he never got more than very light visuals.  For me, I took some every time he did and last night when I took 6 hits (2.5mg per tab) mixing the shrooms was great for me I tripped balls but he just stopped coming up it doesn't make any sense to me

Hey guys I'm new i recently aquired 8 tabs of DOM @ 2.5mgs per tab. Friday I took one and I waited and nothing happened but minor stimulation. I decided to take one and a half tabs yesterday and I had the exact same experience, no psychadelic mindset at all I felt completely sober just a bit tense and anxious. 2 of my friends tried 1 tab and they both tripped really hard and had a massively positive experience so atm I am perplexed.

@FindingEmoe:

Although a bit a late answer, and it is my first here. But at first sight I could only imagine 3 reasons:

1) Tolerance: Did you do other substances recently?

2) Psychological: IMHO especially on DOM  when the trip is lower dose, one has the capability to prevent the trip and remain in a "sober" condition simply by concentrating on other stuff. But as soon as you then let go (in a psychological sense) the trip comes on fully... 

3) Metabolism: By reading this thread I get the strong impression that DOM is the kinda substance where personal metabolism plays a big role. E.g. the effect differences with same dosages seem to wary quite strongly.

AFAIR Shulgin made some experiments with radioactive marked  DOXs (I think it was DOB), where they could look where the stuff goes after ingestion. Strangely it seemed that first everything went into the lungs. There it got metabolized into some different substance, which then went to the brain. This route is quite different to most other substances which usually go directly to the brain. This could also explain the longer onset needed for the DOX compounds as they first have to be metabolized in the lungs before they can become active.

So if people have at this point a different metabolism, this could explain the strong differences in effects and also the strong differences in the duration of the trip. E.g. since some time I'm microdosing DOM (about 0.4mg) and although the dose is so low, for my metabolism this means, that it is impossible to sleep until 14-16h after ingestion. 

BTW: IMHO DOM is just awesome for microdosing (a guaranteed smile for the whole day ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I had taken a threshold pharmahuasca dose the week before taking the DOM, but the thing is i was able to sleep at +8 hours both times of trying it.

I have a few 2.5mg DOM blotters. I plan on taking 1 and a half of the other. What am I looking at as for as effect go? I think 2.5mg is too little and my only other DOX chemical was DOC at 2.5 and it was pretty underwhelming. I do have 100-100ug lsd laid blotters, but would rather try DOM on its own.

If 2.5mg of DOC was underwhelming, I'd say 1.5 of these blotters is likely to be underwhelming too.  DOC is at least twice as potent as DOM.  If you have plenty of them, I'd start with 1.5 like you said, but if you don't have much to go with, I'd try 2.

I have only tried DOM once at 5 mg. I have probably 100 trips or so under my belt including acid, most 2C's, plenty tryptamines, but that was the only trip that I've had that was a bad trip through and through. Messed me up for quite a few days afterwords and i was having visuals 54 Hours in. This means I must be more sensitive than most when it comes to psychedelic amphetamines. My plan was to try it next time at the dose you were thinking. That is merely my experience, YMMV

Are you sure they are exactly 2,5 mg? Are you 100% sure it's DOM, and maybe not DOB/I/C misrepresented as DOM? Do you know someone who tried them already maybe?


Seems to me a little reckless to jump right in at the deep end, with what sounds like basically unknown blotters.


How many do you have, btw? Best would be to titrate the dose, of cause.

Yeah I had a 5mg DOC blotter split in half and shared with a buddy. It had a nice push to it with a small headspace and slightest visuals. Was enjoyable to say the least.  I only have 4 DOM blotters at the moment.

I am with out a doubt that these are 2.5mg DOM blotters as they are labeled as such and come from god himself.  


I am looking for all and any info. I've read all this thread and most of what errowid has on DOM/STP. Any other links would be helpful. I only have a handful of times a year to trip ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Also if 1.5 blotters is underwhelming when would be best to to take 100-110ug LSD blotter? I was thinking at the 4-5 hour mark after ingesting. 


Thanks

Adding LSD should be fine if you're experienced (which it sounds like you are).  But yeah the psychedelic amphetamines take a number of hours to fully develop, so I'd wait for 4-5 hours like you said.  For me 5mg of DOM is not a strong dose, but for some it certainly may be.  The DOXs are just in general really powerful drugs.  Like I said, if you had plenty I'd start lower but given you know what they are for sure (it's nice that there are things available that have the dose and molecules printed on them these days), and that you've done DOC at a comparable dose and had a pleasant experience with no adverse reactions, I feel good about recommending you to jump in at 5mg (which for most is not the "deep end" of DOM, when it was released in the 60s as "STP" they had 15 or 20mg doses, can't remember which - which were certainly way too high, granted, but it does speak favorably for 5mg being a perfectly safe dose).


Back when I managed to get 500mg of DOM, in 2007 I think, I took 5mg and didn't even fully trip.  Of course I had some significant tolerance at the time but during that same time I could take 3mg of DOC and still trip hard.

Yes, there probably won't come any harm from you ingesting 1.5 of those DOM blotters. For what ever it's worth, 3 mg of DOM was for me a perfect dose. (I dissolved the powder in alcohol myself, so I'm 100% sure of the dose) But people are different, and you might need more like Xorkoth.


I actually have done the DOM+LSD combo. It's awesome ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) No worries. Back when I was a noob, I bought a very thick green blotter, sold to me as mescaline. The story was that they came from Switzerland, which they probably did, because it was a Swiss guy selling them IIRC. I took it at a rave and an hour later I was completely underwhelmed, so I took a Hieronymus Bosch LSD blotter as well. I spent the rest of the morning and all of the day tripping balls. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I later found out that it actually hadn't been mescaline, but actually DOM in these green blotters. lol. 


Anyway, I agree that 1.5 of those DOM blotters sounds like a great plan. If it's underwhelming, top up with acid for that day, and then the next time you have time trip, you can take a 2-3 blotters for the full DOM experience.

Hey guys!


I've acquired some DOM and I have a couple of questions:


1. My tabs are 2.5mg and I am a very experienced user of psychedelics of all kinds and shapes, but have never tried DOM. I want to experience it in full beauty. So I was thinking about taking 1 blotter and later in, if I feel like, to take one more. Do you have any experience with topping up later in the trip and how does it work or is it worth taking it like that at all? Or better just 5mg straight ahead? I never had a bad trip in my life but on DOC/DOI I felt some peripheral body discomfort/uneasiness so I want to be more careful. I am also quite used to stimulants.

2. What would be the pefect situation for experiencing DOM's effects? I mean, I only have 4 tabs of 2.5mg and I was thinking about taking it myself and cruising around the Old Town then some meditation in my room with some quality music with art making ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't have enough to share with a circle of friends. But I was thinking about sharing an experience with my girlfriend. The thing is she's not experienced in psychedelics as much as I am, she tried mushrooms and LSD and ayahuasca a couple of times though.

What about taking DOM on a psychedelic trance party? Would that dim the effects or would perhaps the stimmmy feel add some extra spice to the party? ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Cheers!

In my experience, 2.5mg is quite a light dose of DOM.  I'd go for 5, considering your experience.  Actually what might be best is to take 2.5, and then 2 hours in, take another 2.5, just to make sure you don't have an unusual reaction.  And 2 hours in isn't too much time for the second dose to not be effective, although it would be slightly more effective to take it all at once.  I'd say that DOM is about half as potent as DOC, or even a little less.


I find DOC and DOM to be pretty pro-social, so taking it at a psychedelic party could be a really nice setting.  I mostly have experience with DOC, I've only done DOM a few times, but on DOC I feel that socializing and being involved in things doesn't diminish the effects at all, in fact, it brings out some of the better effects.  It's not really the type of drug that is best to take by yourself, for me anyway.


I'd think if your girlfriend has tried and enjoyed mushrooms, LSD and ayahuasca, she'd be fine to handle DOM.  The only thing about DOM is it lasts longer, but it's not nearly as intense as mushrooms or ayahuasca, at normal dosages.

I found 4mg DOM quite intense for my liking....i never hit a +++ with it, but i got enough to be satisfied as to the fact that i then understood the infamous STP...and that Id probably never take it again.


Where as DOC was fluffy and joyous, DOM was a heavy wet blanket.


If it were me, Id probably take 1 and the other a few hours later....or bite the big one and take 5mg at once.


Cant say I recommend DOM but it has its fans.

So I've tried meth and other amphetamines and they barely do anything if anything at all, mdma is the closest thing to an amphet that works. Do you think this could be why dom didn't have an effect on me?

Dont let the "amphetamine" part throw you off.  All of these amphetamine drugs have very different effects in the CNS.  They are related to each other only by way of chemistry, and to the best of my knowledge...cross tolerance between the three drugs in question does not occur.


What dose of DOM did you take?  Cross tolerance between DOM and other psychedelics will occur...are you taking a lot of psychedelic drugs?

yes. and the whole ego-deeply-dissolved-in-the-universe state. 


eth-lad and 4-aco-dpt have been the strongest in that regard, i could feel that a higher dose of san-pedro juice may have brought it out, and my first heavy acid trip years ago brought it out but for only short bursts. and a mystery DOx (tested as dob) helped my get more psychically in tune with my dog, but i think thats just something that can happen on any drug. 


dom sounds pretty awesome, just wondering if its roll around in the ether with a significant other type material, or is it strictly an amble around, thinking a lot type material?

I probably should not judge DOM from my limited (one) but probably all psychedelics can meet both properties in different people.  On the other hand...it varies from person to person.  I didn't care for DOM but others are very fond.  For me, psychotomimetic more approximated what 4 mg DOM did for me.  Alas, I have only tried the one time...should I go back I'd probably opt for the active isomer form which may be a different animal.

I think DOM can be used very well with a significant other although I have yet to do so.  I've experienced sheer awe while listening to music and watching my visuals (dragon spiraling into a supermassive galaxy, people descending from a massive fortress, being swallowed alive by a dragon beast thing like the green dragon thing in Full Metal Alchemist).  But, I also read this lecture by Stephen Hawking called The Beginning of Time on this drug and it blew my mind.  It's a psychedelic but even during the peak of a very intense experience I felt cognizant; psychedelic amphetamine is a good description.  It feels functional and recreational!


I think 10 mg is the sweet spot for this drug, as with 12.5 it was more intense but it felt too stimulating.  


In comparison to DOC, I like DOM more as DOC caused an unpleasant taste and smell of plastic to linger for the duration of the trip.  It was a very strange and overbearing smell and taste.  However, I had a spectacular time taking 7.7 mg of DOC and at the 8th hour, 960 mcg of LSD.  It was incredible, but at the 24th hour I stopped tripping from the acid but tripped on the DOC for a total of 36 hours!  By the end I had amphetamine psychosis like visuals with shadow people creeping in the corners of my vision.  Nonetheless, it was one of my best psychedelic trips.  High doses of DOx seem to be worthwhile once in a while, but they must be very taxing on your body.

I took 7.7 mg because I had taken LSD just the day before so I assumed my psychedelic tolerance would play a big factor.  It did not!  I saw blue lightning shooting down my arms around hour 5; it was very pretty!  I took the acid because I got a little bored.  I even went to Burger King around hour 30 or so.  

I gotta say, I'm on ~2500 mcg 25i-NBOH, 900 mg DXM, and lots of weed right now.

Right?  I feel like 7.7mg of DOC would be extremely uncomfortable.  I took DOC 5 days in a row once back in the day when I was dosing psychedelics 3 or 4 times a week... the last day I took 6mg.  Generally when I take DOC, 2mg is where I go to.  3mg if I want a strong trip.


Sounds like you like to take extreme doses though... which isn't my thing so much except every so often.  If you're regularly taking such big doses you probably have an insane permatolerance.

not gonna lie, the whole "psychotomimetic" thing plus the word "manic" being tossed around wets my chops for this compound. 


although im not a stim person (60mg vyvanse is a two-day hell for me), i do prefer stimmy-psychedelics for their literal mind-manifestations. i like to get super thinky... especially if the thoughts are novel, exciting, and pretty far out-there. 


the more i read, the more it sounds like stp is the new subject of my ever-changing holy grail quest. oh well, perhaps someday. 


royal blue has come up in my head a lot upon reading the TRs... is dark, deep blue a thing with DOM? or am i grabbing for minnows here?

I like DOC a lot more than DOM but both are good.  They hit a similar thin but DOC does it a lot better, for me anyway.  DOC is more euphoric, more stimulating, more psychedelic, and more enabling.

I'm not sure I can connect with that.  For me, memory suggests a more washed out/faded blue with red specks.  My summary from 

[MGS's STP report](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/679676-DOM-4mg-First-Time-My-Day-With-The-Infamous-STP) says...


> Visually, it can't compare to 2C-T-7...mentally LSD has it beat, I was also sick to my stomach most of the day...it upset my belly in the typical PEA fashion but the insights, visuals, body feeling, etc never made it worthwhile. It really reminded me of 2C-E the most...in that it was SUPER intense but mostly neutral in emotion with a tendency to go to the negative/scary. 2C-E really felt like DOM condensed down to about 3/4 the length of time.
> 		
> Click to expand...


I'm sure there is a sharp dose/response curve so if I had taken 8mg as originally planned...I could very well have a different take.  At the time I wrote the report, I obviously was reminded of 2ce...but all these years later I don't think it was very 2ce like at all.  The experience was difficult to put into words and I was really just reaching for something to compare it to.  It was probably more like 2cd visuals or could be apples to cucumbers.

Interesting... That was not my experience.  I've had DOC at 1mg, 1.5mg (with LSD) and 2mg and it was very comfortable for me...where as 4mg of DOM was intensely stimulating in a not comfortable way.  Low dose DOC levels out after 12 hr into an adderall-like feeling... i did not experience that with DOM.  Maybe I'll try again Allah willing.

This is hard for me to type out but I feel it necessary

About 7 years ago, whilst at university, I and a friend took a dose of what we were lead to believe was LSD.

The events that followed were intense to a high degree, but never seemed to me to fit the common descriptions of LSD, as I will propound.

Residual effects and meditation have lead me back to researching chemicals sold as LSD and the best fit seems to be DOM.

Hence why I am here.


It was my first time taking """LSD""", and my friend convinced me that we should go for a decent dose - so that we would definately feel it.

Well... I definately felt it.

A brief background, I was experienced in taking a pharmacopia of drugs but inexperienced with hallucinogens, having tried Mushrooms, salvia and maybe others, as well as 'the usual suspects' of party drugs.

I had also had intense revelatory experiences and believe[d] myself to be somewhat enlightened - outside of artificial influence.

Now to the experience.


We took 3 tabs each, of unknown dosage, in my friends flat

After sitting around and doing very little for about 2 hours, I began to feel uncomfortable.

Unable to assuage the feeling, I felt like returning to my flat - in the same building. I remember leaving the room and feeling strange, the elevator ride was definately different to normal, and the carpets were intriguing both in colour and texture.

At my flat, I had a sense of unspent energy, that I should be doing something, moreover I should be providing entertainment for my friend who was mostly silent.

I eventually started playing Halo, whilst he watched, at this point I was having some visual hallucinations, blurring and skipping of the eyes.


[Those of a sensitive disposition, or who don't want to read about bad trips look away now]


Within the game, I became distressed that people were killing me and relishing it, why would they want to kill me?

Furthermore, I was losing the ability to control my character, and kept walking off a tower, then respawning at the top of the tower, just to see my virtual body fall and crumple in a heap, whilst a war raged around me. [don't play violent video games on a mega-trip].

Then the question rose in my mind, Why do I keep falling off the tower / why do I keep killing myself?

We laughed about it, I somewhat more nervously than him, and our conversation was very fractured, becoming increasingly incoherent.

At around this point, the feelings of social anxiety, physical uncomfortableness took over. I wasn't having such a groovy time.

I said to my friend that I think it would be best if he left. I felt I needed to be in my own headspace. This was somewhat misguided.

I was now alone and still the sensations were heightening, I remember looking around my room, seeing an empty crisp packet on the floor and it revealing some deep anguish with my 'state of affairs', living in a percieved squalor.

I also remember a great sense of fear at looking in the mirror, at what I might see, I can't recall what I did see, but I later remember seeing no 'me' in the reflection at all (I presume visual hallucination pertaining to ego death)

Some hours into this anguished state of pacing around my room, feeling as if my body/soul were jumping out of my skin, unable to settle at all and slipping in and out of perception and darkness, I decidedto take a shower.

It didn't really help, although it distracted my body somewhat. 

Within the shower cubicle, sat on the floor, the previous experience from the video game came to haunt me. I was having dark imagery, dark thoughts, and in particular a conviction that I was having a bad trip.

I was worried that, due to my bad trip, I would somehow, "slip" from my consciousness, whilst still aware, and "accidently" climb up to the top floor of my tower block, "accidently" find the trapdoor in the roof, climb out and fall off.

The harder I tried to escape this paranoia, the tighter it gripped until it was a strong visualisation, the route from my flat, up the stairs and so on. I was in control of myself, but felt like that control was a mere wisp from slipping away from me, somewhat like my mind had engendered a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It was no fun. I remained in my room (thank goodness), and turned on a Religious themed Drum and Bass album, lots of choirs, screeching basslines and quotes from the requiem mass. At this point my grasp of reality had gone far West and I could do little but sit on my deskchair twitching, agitated beyond description mentally, trying to both battle and ignore the overwhelming sense I was going to run up to the roof and ...

I listened to the album a few times through, smoked a number of joints - which barely hit the sides, I could hardly feel the inhale or effects, but it was something to do, I was quite amazed I could still roll in my state.

At this point I had been awake for about 24+something hours, I can't quantify, but I was extremely sleep-deprived and had headaches, muscle aches and so on. I knew I had to sleep, that I could be able to wake up the next day and be better, I think I'd passed the peak.

It took many hours of clutching my head, curled in bed, alone, dark and afraid, focussing on meditation towards sleep - something that doesn't happen if you try too hard. It was here that I had the most intense auditory halluciations. 

A hangover from the intense music, every single noise, or percieved noise, rattled off into a filigree of vibrations, stretching to infinity. As it was becoming daytime, streetnoises were present and each was its own chaotic disharmonic symphony, with religious undertones.

I eventually managed to get to sleep, starving but not hungry.

My only memory of the next day was sitting on the kitchen counter, barely able to speak to my housemates, barely dressed.


Now I come to the real reason for posting here.

I never had vertigo or mental issues before. I'd had depression but very generalised (mainly due to society & school).

Since this trip, I have gained an intense sense of vertigo when I go near high edges, and on planes. I've gained a great fear that I might throw myself off high places, especially when sleep deprived it manifests a lot more strongly. I needn't be close to an edge for my mind to wander back to the paranoia that I might unconsciously seek out the high place/edge, and my instinct to quell the thought again reinforces it.

It has been 7 years, and that side effect has only weakend slightly. I have gained coping mechanisms, mainly avoiding high places, and meditation strategies.

However, I took truffles (the 'legal' derivative of psylocibin mushrooms vended in Amsterdam), and aside from the fractal geometry and one-ness, had the same feeling, the same vertiginous side effects.

This has sworn me off hallucinogens for good, for fear of reactivating the effect, I feel I'm slowly getting better without them, and really strongly do not wish to take any strong trip again.


I feel that, having read through the reams of experience accounts and information, that what we took was DOM.

This was due to the lack of strong visual hallucinations, beyond blurs and jitters (I'm lead to believe that LSD has fractal tie-dye effects), as well as the death imagery, the physical symptoms and so on.

It's possible I took something else in the DOx family, but it definately wasn't LSD.


The reason I posted here was because I see a lot of people saying things along the lines of

>"Such an intense account really makes me want to try it"

I would seriously advise against it, unless you are a seasoned mind traveller and have accurate means of dosing.

I have been left with permanent side effects in the category of vertigo as well as an inability to take hallucinogens. Furthermore, nothing was 'revealed' to me that I had not already come by through meditation and reading etc.


Thanks for reading, I hope I haven't spooked anybody, remember, you'll eventually wake up and be alright! Make sure to let others know around you what you're up to. And for the love of all that is good, don't play violent video games whilst taking high doses of unknown hallucinogens!

I read through this B&D and it was nice ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


First off, the amount of people taking like 30mg of 2C-E and more is quite disturbing.

I always thought that you should go quite high with DOM, but it appears that 5mg can already be very strong, it made me reevaluate my plans for a first dose.

I really wonder how it is, I read what people say but I'll only know once I try it. I say this because DOB to me was more than just experiencing effects, there was a purpose and higher level to it. That's what I hope to find in DOM, I really hope I do but reports are so conflicting that I can't be sure.

People seem to react widely to DOM.  I have not managed to get anything too special or profound at up to 10mg, but when I took 10mg I had a lot of tolerance.  More recently, I took it at 5mg, and 7.5mg another tim,e and both were pleasant but nothing of the magic of DOC or DOPr.  It felt insubstantial in a way, like it never fully materialized, which makes me think I just need more.  But I have also read of people tripping solidly at 2.5mg, and having strong trips at 5mg.

Apparently you took 13mg though ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)  but I see what you're saying.

The varied effects are bizarre, it's not only dosage, it's also the 'quality' of effects. There are some people that say it's such a special drug, and it was in Shulgin's magic half dozen of course, that gives me hope. It's also not that people that don't like DOM as much don't like DOx in general, all very confusing to me. It'll get cleared up once I try it most likely ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hi trippers, is Xanax ok to use as a trip cancel or as sleep aid for a DOM trip? I've never done benzos before, what doses are safe? Seems like it's a good idea to get a plan b for a DOM trip.

Yes, definitely.  Benzos like xanax are the ideal way to come down at the end.  However they don't just straight up cancel a trip.  Taking xanax will reduce the intensity of a trip and is good at pulling you out of an anxiety loop but you'll still be tripping.  The best use of it is to kill the residual stimulation and fall asleep at the end of the trip, when you're done with the main trip but you're still unable to sleep and feeling residual effects.


If you've never taken a benzo before, 1mg of xanax would be a good place to start.  But xanax is quite safe (you won't overdose), so if it's not enough, taking another 1mg isn't going ti hurt you.  But best to start with the minimum amount that will work.

So the expected result of taking a xanax during a dom trip would be sedation and calming of mind, right? Still going to get the usual visual and mental stuff but going to be more relaxed about the whole ordeal and take it without anxiety.


I'm planning to get several 6 mg blotters and start with a half. Having read this thread I believe 3 mg should provide some minor psychedelia and stimulation for the whole day but without any overwhelming effects, so I'm hopeful Xanax will remain unused at least until I take a full blotter.

Xanax will reduce the visuals and the mental trip, with how much depending on how much you take.  it will also make you feel calmer and less anxious, so if you're in the middle of the trip and you have an anxiety attack you can't get through, it might be worth taking some even though it will also make the trip less "special" and profound.  But if possible you should avoid taking it at all during the trip, instead saving it for the very end when you want to come down and sleep.  very long-duration psychedelics like DOM really benefit from a benzo at the very end because the lingering tail end can last so long, and being unable to sleep after that long duration trip can really suck.

Interesting because I believe more people would agree taking esp a short acting benzodiazepine nearly completely breaks a trip into just at most a left over glowing state?


This is obviously subjective which is the reason I carry IM solution of haldol for non responders to benzos cause I have seen first hand even 6mg not stop a trip???


If I take just 0.5mg of either alprazolam or lorazepam my trip vanishes fast!!! I am very thankful I have such an easy option... Prevents bad trips just knowing I have an anti-trip on hand!!!

Lots of people say benzos kill trips, but most people I know, and most long term posters of BL, as well, will agree that it doesn't usually kill a trip, but only slightly mutes the psychedelia and mostly mutes the anxiety and overthinking.


I've actually been in a group of friends when one had a psychotic break due to NBOMe +  a confluence of unnerving and highly uncomfortable factors, and using etizolam in some ways made the experience worse as it disinhibited a then broken mind.

Has anyone tried the tiny, yellow "5mg" DOM pellets from a certain DN vendor and can tell me how they were (they also sell blue ones)?


I had two of these pellets lab-tested and they came back as 0.5mg and 2.55mg DOM, respectively, which is a pretty frustrating result. No idea how I should go about dosing such a dose-sensitive substance with such unreliable pills. I mean, one contains half and the other one contains tenth of what is advertised!! That's a ridiculuous spread and makes it near impossible to dose properly! I don‘t know if I should take one, two, or more pills (I originally planned on a 5mg dose), because taking three pills for a first time seems excessive and irresponsible. God I hate pills, too bad they didn't sell powder. 


Sorry if questions like this aren't allowed but I really don't know what to do.


Btw, I can't send them back or ask for a refund because I didn't order them personally.

Interesting. Maybe my "11mg" DOM trip was also way underdosed. Seems likely given the experienced effects.... should've just taken 'em all.

Fucking sucks, I would've rather paid more for some good DOM HCl powder. I had their 4-FA lab-tested as well and it came back as 99% pure, so the substance quality isn't the issue, it's their pressing. DId you also have the yellow ones?

I had blotters, purchased close to a year apart from the same vendor.

Felt at a weak ++ from 11mg, the effects were weak and very bland, I was straight up bored honestly and so pissed that this was what I had been looking forward to for months. I figured it could be possible since others have reacted weirdly to it as well and maybe they were only slightly underdosed, but in hindsight it must've been much less than 11mg. Back then I just dosed 2 blotters of acid on top and things got much much more interesting.

Crush and blend? Atleast it would average out the doses in theory. Better way would be to dissolve the pills and dose volumetrically. Would take a bit of trial and error. Pills suck, pure powder is the way. I miss DOM

Hey guys, I obtained a blotter containing 5mg of DOM almost a year ago. I’m planning on using it tomorrow morning.


One question though; Is it possible to have normal conversations with people or is the headspace foggy?

It's more possible than it is with most other psychedelics.  If you're tripping with people, or if they're part of your trip and hanging out, it should be easy and in fact very desirable.  I always end up having the best conversations of DOX drugs, especially DOC, but also DOM.  If you're encountering random people, it is a toss up.

In general I find DOM to be pretty clear minded and easy enough to talk to people, tho I've never pushed dosage past 7.5mg. It can get quite intense, and there have been a couple times that talking to anyone is the last thing I'd want to do.


I once took 2.5mg before going into a personal development seminar, which was actually a super emotional place. The emotional intensity and the required group participation was just too much for me and I had to leave, in that case I did not want to talk to anyone lol.


I find DOM leans on the introspective for me, but I've also had wild ecstatic social moments as well.


Not related but thought I would share that DOM combines amazingly well with MDMA, I usually wait til the DOM has started to decline, to avoid over stimulation. But yeah wow, they really synergize well. Very euphoric

That is exactly how I could describe DOC, too.  I think all of the DOXs share some of that, they're quite social.  But not all are very clear-headed.  DOPr, for example, is very hypnotic, it had a unique sort of group mind type of effect, and I could communicate with my trip partner very well, but a lot of it was unspoken, when it came to talking to my friend who was there butnot tripping, it was kind of hard (not axious, just difficult).  However all 3 of us played music together for 5 hours during the peak, and the connection was incredible, even with our friend who wasn't tripping.


DOET made me anxious and it was hard to communicate.  There were also no classical psychedelic signs, no visuals, no distortions really.  I just felt intensely empathetic, to the point that my friend hurt his foot during our hike, and I could feel literal pain in my foot.


DOET is very strange

Nice, looks like you're having fun. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I have ever really had a full trip on DOM, for whatever reason it seems to just not be that strong for me.  But I love DOC dearly, and have done it too many times to count.  With DOC, around 10-12 hours in, I reach the plateau stage, which is certainly my favorite part of the experience.  I wouldn't call it the peak though, it's less visual and acutely psychedelic, but it's like my mind unfolds and I am in an ideal state, perfect amount of energy, and inspiration, and verbal fluency, and curiosity, and ability to do the things I want to do in order to explore and create.  The DOC plateau might be my favorite drug

I can definitely relate to it being very similar to DOC but yet they're also different. I'm 16 hours in now and exhausted, will report back after a good long nap ![✌️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270c.png)

I tired DOC and DOI and liked DOC way more and once I get into rebuilding my drug collection once again I’ll be sure to get DOC, skip DOI but try to get DOM instead as it’s a classic after all and reading how much you all loved it I bet I too will.

Do any of the DOx have a peak really??? They all seem to have really long plateaus. Even the 2Cx and mescaline and TMA-2 dont have definable peaks like LSD does for example.


With LSD there is a 5-10 minute period where I KNOW "I'm totally peaking" lol.


With DOM I very slowly come up (in fact I forgot I took it once why am I trilping?) Hours 3-4 are the most intense, but hour 5-9 I guess I am in the plateau. And by hour 10 I'm definitely coming back, depending on dosage/environment anywhere from 2-6 hours to be baseline. DOM now matter how hectic it can be at the "peak" I've always ended my trips in very relaxed states, and never had any problem falling asleep. I cannot say the same for DOB.


I've never tried DOC sadly. I once had 50mg and it was stolen. Can get more if I truly feel called, but DOx are kind of a 10x in a lifetime thing for me.

Oh yeah, DOC is far superior to DOI.  I have met I think one person who prefers DOI but not me.  DOC has it all, it's one of my absolute favorite drugs, all around. Like Shulgin said in PIHKAL, it is a true, dyed-in-the-wool psychedelic.  I have probably taken DOC more than any other psychedelic, because I used to use it weekly or near-weekly for years.

Yes, for me they have a peak, but it's not a moment where you say "THIS moment is the peak". It's more like the peak happens 3-5 hours in (depending on which one it is) and lasts for 3-8 hours (depending on which drug), and then the plateu happens.  This is when the peak starts to reduce.  During the peak, tje visuals are the strongest, and it seems to keep getting stronger in waves, then ebbing  bit, then getting stronger again, etc.  The plateau is characterized by it settling into a stable state that very slowly ebbs away, but the plateau is generally the most enjoyable part, because you're still tripping nicely, but you're way more comfortable and back into your self.


Wen I take a high dose of DOC, during the peak, I feel like everything is sort of picked apart, things are confusing, intense, can be overwhelming... the visuals are strong, and it's like pieces of myself and my life are dismantled.  Then when the plateau hits, it's like it all comes back together and all of the stuff I experienced becomes insight about mysel and my life.  I feel euphoric and on top of the world.  The more shattering the peak is, the more profoundly wonderful the plateau stage is.

I know person who used DOC for physical inflammation somewhat successful. I forgot details but DOC is even more inflammatory than most psychedelics.


I used to enjoy DOC much in a way like you, for the fact I was able to use it in environment where I wouldn’t use acid or most psychedelics. I dosed it low, usually 1.2 – 1.5mg but even double was really pleasant experience and surprisingly not too long at all (that might be different for you as some people I know had experienced high lasting for days with residual effects).


I also had experience where I combined it with LSD and 2c-e and topped that with puff of DMT followed with N2O. It caused me to see scenery that looked (in the lack of better description as it’s impossible) like some inter-dimensional cyberpunk plumbing of some other-world energy.

Yeah, DOI, I believe, was studied for anti-inflammatory effects.  I hadn't noticed DOC being anti-inflammatory, but it would make sense if its close cousin DOI is known to be.

I'd definitely take it at home first, DOx are stronk. High dosing variability too with them...

It's energetic. I could see it for hiking. It's also a weird one, with some people finding it shallow at high doses, others get their ass kicked at low doses. Plan accordingly.

DOM is definitely energetic. IME with it, wise to take in comfortable environments. I've taken it at super hot music festivals 2x and things got pretty hectic. Still had a great time but could definitely see a less experienced user having some sort of freak out. I even freaked out a little bit haha. 


I also once took it low dose at a personal development seminar (kinda culty) and its a pretty emotional experience for most people. I could not sit still for the life of me and had to leave because i didn't want to be so stimulated around people who were pouring their hearts out. 

I do love the substance. Has anyone else used it to microdose? Honestly 350ug is enough to def feel it but just barely. But it's character is kind of intense by nature as are most DOx..

I am looking to experiment with DOM. As this is a long-acting one and setting weekends aside for psychedelic exploration always comes at the price for having less time for other important tasks, I'd rather have a full experience than a lackluster one. My DOM is crystalline powder and not some random blotter or tablet, and will be dosed accurately via volumetric dosing. I seem to respond to the phenethylamines I've tried with about the average dose-response curve as outlined by PiHKAL and other experience reports. I'm aware that jumping right into a potentially powerful experience with a new compound is against recommendation, but given the chances I'm willing to take the risk and bear the responsibility: so if I'm looking for an experience close to what 16 mg 2C-E HCl would provide in intensity, would I be better off with dosing towards the higher or lower side of the 4 - 6 mg span I'm leaning towards dosing?


I know a friend characterised 4 mg as feeling uncomfortable and like a never-ending mescaline come-up, and I'd rather avoid that. Most of the DOM-experienced people I've talked so far rather lean to the > 5 mg window for full experiences.

I think you will find that it's a lot like 2C-E in dosing guidelines. Some people find 16mg of 2C-E to be full, rich, and intense (me.) Some find 20mg to be light, fun eye-candy (not me.) 


DOM seems to suit many people fine at 2.5mg. Others find it to be hollow at 7mg+. 5mg seems like it straddles the middle of the road, where it could be really intense or entirely bland. 


I don't think that it's safe to say that you can extrapolate anything from your 2C-E experiences. But I was quite satisfied with 2C-E at 16mg, and I was reasonably satisfied with 2.5mg of DOM. I agonized for years about whether to take my first DOM dose at 2.5 or 5mg, finally deciding on 2.5. I was perfectly fine with that level. I could see revisiting it again at 3.5 or even 5mg, but I suspect that I would find that to be quite strong. 


Like 2C-E, it's a unique and interesting material. I'm not surprised that some people don't get anything out of it. It had a hollowness, a void-like quality to it for me that made me think that some people would likely not get anything out of it no matter how hard they push it.

Took the compound at 5 mg as hydrochloride. Maybe the circumstances I took it in developed to not be the best, but sadly, I didn't see any glimpse of worthwhile component in it. Especially not in relation to the bodily problems, which were worse for me than with 2C-E, but 2C-E at least rewards with its very unique and remarkable mystic/stern headspace. DOM on the other hand for me didn't develop into anything substantial, it felt like a gradual come-up followed by a gradual come-down without leading to any special state or showing any sign of useful component. What a damn shame. If it wasn't for the bodily discomforts, I'd give it another try at around 7 or 8 mg, but I'm not too eager to experience another day of muscle spasms, restlessness, muscle tension and after-trip headaches for what it seems like little reward - and that despite knowing that substances may not show their full glory on the first or even second trial. Fortunately the rather severe nausea of the beginning dissipated completely during the trip and didn't make its way back. Maybe (R)-DOM could be more useful, but I doubt it is worth the effort.

I didn't like DOM at all either the one time I tried it, very shallow, but it might've been an underdose.


Edit: *it was an underdose, supposedly 11mg on blotters, way weaker in practice, no tolerance

DOM is a funny one. Let's just say I'm glad DOC exists.

Let's just say that the bodily discomforts of DOM were such severe that I'd only be willing to try (R)-DOx from now on, in hopes of removing unwanted side effects. I'm not too positive that this actually helps, but one can only hope. They definitely seem to be intriguing to me, and I have a masochistic side which is willing to push through nausea, muscle tension and everything - but DOM didn't put up any rewards at all, at least none that I could see or have a glimpse at! What a bummer - especially cause getting it proved rather troublesome too!


Well, in the closer future, the next targets are getting to know the two thios of the magical half dozen to complete this series! At least 50 % of the magical half dozen are confirmed good already by me, so I hope for DOM to be the only outlier.

Id really loved 2C-T-7 and found it to consistently be fantastic, i find it so odd that other people dont feel the same way but drugs are funny things. My dosing was pretty high tho always between 40-60mgs orally usually or 20mgs intranasal (which i only did twice in the begining. But i probably took it orally maybe ten times or so. It always made me puke pretty ferociously on the comeup, but once that passed it was very euphoric and visual. Id had a ++++ mixing it with 2C-E once, really magical day.

I'm 3-4 months out from getting to try DOC, DOB, 2C-C, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, ALEPH-2, ALEPH-7, 2C-D, DOM, and MMDA. I have only tried LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, 2C-B, vaporized & oral DMT, harmaline, MDMA, MDA, HBWR, ketamine, amphetamine, (probably) methamphetamine, 25C-NBOMe, extracted mescaline acetate and straight peyote. I'm a huge fan of long lasting, intense, challenging psychedelic experiences, and I'm excited for these based on what I've heard, but can you guys offer any advice on these? Especially DOM seems daunting by how people describe it, constantly using adjectives that imply it's challenging but in unique ways which seem (fittingly for psychedelics) very inarticulable.

Have you been confident that you've had explicitly (R)-DOX & (S)-DOX in the past to compare? Did you get it from a chemist or isomerize it yourself? I often distrust drugs I get from the street, but perhaps DNMs have offered better consistency in the past than I'm used to. I'm fascinated in the isomeric differences between these drugs but have had a hard time finding any experience reports of them outside of chemists who usually don't dive too deep, and PiHKAL itself. Which DOs have you tried different isomers of, just DOM?


I've also noticed on drugs-data that many tabs coming in of both DOX and 25X-NBOMe are mixed, either DOB with DOC, or 25I with 25C, things like that. Is that a common occurrence that you guys have run into with things like DOM? I'll be hopefully trying things as liquids, but reagent tests should hopefully let me indicate whether something's been cut with another active compound or not, I suppose.

I'm sorry if my post wasn't clear to you. This single experience with racemic DOM was my only trial with a substituted 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine, and racemic at that. Enantiomers potentially being more benign on the body is pure speculation based on the short descriptions in PiHKAL. I think there is only two options of acquiring enantiopure DOx compounds: make it yourself or have someone make it for you. Neither is really trivial and thus we don't hear much about it.


halo-DOx are a little easier and cheaper to synthesise than alkyl-DOx. And especially with the former being more potent than the latter, it would make sense to use them for cutting from that perspective. But mixing different halo-DOx or 25x-NB is probably rather caused by some person having a big stock of the one and trying to make bank by selling "rarer" compounds. I have no idea about the actual black market and the people involved though.

That's a good point about halogenated DOx's being cheaper to make, DOI is even cheaper to make than DOC/DOB/DON/DOT-X though, because 2C-I/DOI originate from p-dimethoxybenzene with only a small handful of steps before reaching the aldehyde, whereas the chlorinated/brominated, and even further the nitrated/(thiolated? Idk the term for adding the sulphur group) are all made as 2C-H which is later modified, adding steps to the process, even more dangerous interactions with precursors, and likely more waste generated that you'd have to clandestinely handle. It leaves me kind of shocked that 2C-I and DOI aren't more popular on the street, other easier to synthesize drugs like TMA-2 and GHB though don't seem to break through either.


Edit: The route to brominated/chlorinated DOXs can still be used to get to DOI I believe, I think it's just much more involved than this seemingly unexploited route going from a compound that's often used for flavoring purposes, so I assume chemists supplying the street could access it somehow.

This is not true. 2C-I/DOI are typically synthesised with expensive iodine and silver salt catalyst from 2C-H or 2,5-DMA. The 2C-x/DOx on the street are probably typically made from commercially bought 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde. Making the aldehyde is possible, but not really attractive given the chemistry involved and the rather easy availability of the aldehyde. 3 rather easy steps from there. From 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, it is at least 4 steps, and you still have to halogenate. Formylation of unsubstituted or halogenated p-dimethoxybenzene is not trivial and typically requires nasty reagents (chloromethylation, bromomethylation, Duff with trifluoroacetic acid, etc).

I'm definitely intending on writing up reports if things turn out notable. I'll certainly do retrospectives on ALEPH-2 and ALEPH-7, given very few people have ever taken them. I'm a bit nervous of them likely being MAO inhibiting psychedelic amphetamines though, they're going to get a real Shulgin climb.

I think I either misphrased this or it was  misunderstood, what I'm saying is that I'm surprised that the normal route to 2C-I/DOI isn't J. Med. Chem. 27, 1071-1077 (1984), it's a slept on path that uses n-BuLi, NMF and ICl instead of indicating 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, eliminating the need to acquire what's obviously a precursor for drug synthesis.


I'm also really surprised that more people with access to these aldehydes aren't working with the BOx compounds (beta methoxy phenethylamines). Shulgin and the gang really seemed to enjoy them, other trip reports even from people who usually don't like phenethylamines (nervewing comes to mind) still come out positively, it seems. I'm curious about whether or not beta methoxy psychedelic amphetamines would be worthwhile, Shulgin conjectured that they'd likely have four possible isomers under the entry for BOD though which could prove to be a pain in the ass. Interestingly enough, Shulgin claims that BOED (2,5-dimethoxy-β-ethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine), much like 3,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine, is not a psychedelic despite seemingly fitting the SAR, but it's instead a somewhat novel intoxicant. 3C-X's, DON, and DOEt are sometimes described as being moreso stimulants than psychedelics, and I do wonder if things like BOED, or maybe 3,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamime, are similar but perhaps situated somewhere uniquely between a depressant and psychedelic.

Really?  Interesting, I didn't care for DOC much at all.  (Though, I suspect stimulant tolerance from daily Adderall may have contributed.)  It was just very lackluster and uninteresting to me.


DOM on the other hand, the most serene and beautiful psychedelic I've ever done.  I also got to try DOB and really enjoyed that one too, though obviously for much different reasons than DOM.  I figured DOC was maybe a dud or just didn't work well for me but maybe I should give it another shot.  I want to like it, I really do.  I like DOM and DOB so much, I want to try all of the DOx chems.

I've only tried 2.5mg of DOC and DOM. Can't remember my DOI dosage range. I've also tried 2C-B, C, D, and I and see zero correlation between the couterparts between classes. With 2C-x's my first time with each produced much better visuals. DOI produced the least visual activity but still had strong effects. STP had the most body load but I haven't tried 2C-E yet. STP had interesting visuals I still remember purple, blue, and light orange.

Do you care to elaborate on what you KNOW to do with DOC? I've tried DOC and DOM one time each. DOC was great and I'm eager to try it again. Just trying to figure out what to do when I take the dive and consume. I typically hang about the house when I trip but the thought of being stimulated with no outlet for it makes me nervous.


With DOM it was absolutely fantastic, until it went bad and I had the most terrifying experience of my life. I do plan on trying DOM again, but that experience has made me very hesitant to do psychedelic amphetamines. I do have DOM, DOC, TMA-2 and 3C-P and intend to try all of them. Just hard to make the jump when its such a long and uncertain time commitment

I can't speak to the terrifying experience you had when trying to sleep. What's the story there? Did that come up earlier in this thread? 


For me, DOC is a full-spectrum psychedelic that has rich visual activity, a stable plateau, and balanced psychedelic headspace--full, but not deep. I would use it in the same contexts where I would use LSD: festivals, outdoor get-togethers with friends, outside chore days, hikes, etc. I find that *for me* the restless energy is only in the first 2-3 hours of the experience, and that it's manageable even if I have to chill indoors. It's just much *better* if I can find a way to channel it outwardly. I don't like stimulating psychedelics in general, but I have been fine with the energy of DOC and DOM (and DOF such as there is.) But also, DOC only lasts 12 hours for me--much less than mescaline, MAL, or LSD. I'm a fast metabolizer, so it's easier to work into a normal weekend than any of those alternatives (not that I have a lot of time for the long-acting ones these days.)

Can't remember if I posted about the rough time I had. Long story short, friend and I drop 2.5mg of DOM each and during the come up we're smoking a cig and bullshitting. He's explaining a video he saw where apparently soldiers took Acid and in his phrasing "Were dying in the streets laughing". DOM kicks in and I'm feeling great. Insanely visual but a fun time. The trip reaches a point where I'm laughing at EVERYTHING and I can't stop. I take his phrasing of the soldiers "dying in the streets laughing" literally and I convinced myself that I had laughed myself to death. Trip turned dark, had my shirt off and had visuals of my left lung being removed and the flesh cauterized. My flesh looked deep blue (only to me) and I was crying and begging my friends to call my Dad, my brother and sister so I could say good by to them. It was a hellish experience. My friend got me through it by holding my hand and saying "I took more than you, look at me, I'm fine. You're not going to die" and kept repeating it. We split a 5mg tab and he took the larger piece. It's also the only trip I've ever had where I took my clothes off without thinking and began to run around,but that was during the fun part of the trip. Other than that I couldn't sleep for 30 hours or so and I woke up still having some visual activity. My visuals died down completely around the 40 hour mark. Apparently I'm really sensitive to DOM or the blotters were dosed higher than advertised, although his trip seem to be in line with what one would expect. I do intend to try DOM again someday but I'm definitely going to have a benzo around.


Thanks for the response! You did a great job explaining. Told me everything I wanted to know. Makes me feel more comfortable giving a shot in the future. I want to try it with my friend (the one mentioned above), but when we trip together its usually inside. He's not in great shape so anytime we go on a walk he can't last any more than 30 minutes or so, otherwise I'd try to get him to go hiking with me when we take it, but I know he'd be miserable the whole time, I am eager to give DOC another shot. The one time I took it was really nice. Seemed to have a real magic feel to it

##### Learning about STP

In 1967, a synthetic psychedelic drug, nicknamed STP, escaped from the archives of Dow Chemical and flooded the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco. The resulting public health crisis can be seen as a case study in how new unsanctioned psychoactive substances become legible to society...

I suspect I've come across wicked weak DOM, the first time I acquired what was supposedly DOM from the first vendor, it was completely inert to both test reagents and bioassay. The second vendor though has tested correctly but must be low in purity bc it took me 16mg to really feel it. I noticed 7.5mg, but 5mg felt almost completely like placebo.


If it matters though, what I have is racemic and it may explain why I seem to need ~2x the dose of most people to get expected effects. It's absolutely stunning how long it takes to kick in too, I'm not noticing anything for 3.5-4 hours and then it evolves up until maybe hour 10-12, and finally tapers off around there.

I believe [@Psychestim](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/543082/) also had DOM tested recently and it was also massively underdosed.


I don't know how accurately blotters used to be dosed, but some people are way more sensitive to DOM than others. Unlike other DOx where people seem to react somewhat similarly to similar doses.

You are going to have a hard time finding anyone who has enantiopure DOM. So your 2 x dose theory is false. 5 mg racemic DOM HCl from a direct source, matching melting point, were very much active for me. Albeit not what I was looking for, and not too intense for me personally.

Would agree R-DOM is basically going to be impossible to source. In theory one could do it themselves, but you'd need a good bit of DOM powder to play around with. I don't think the tartaric acid process is particularly difficult, but working at micro scale is a skill in itself.


Wish I had grams of DOM laying around.

It's interesting that some people are less sensitive to it than others, I wonder if that relates to why the original tablets ~1967 were dosed so heavily. Also I got my DOM as crystal, looks vaguely similar to a more powdery version of champagne molly if that makes sense, a little brown but not more than most other phenethylamines ime. I'm pretty hard headed with most other psychedelics (LSD, N-benzylated phenethylamines, 2C-B, ayahuasca, etc) so it may also just be related to that.

I need to run a melting point soon, I only reagent tested it and trusted that, though numerous methods of verification would be much more reliable. I wouldn't say that 7.5-10mg isn't active, it's just so subtle that I forget I'm tripping until I look down a hallway and the perspective does that horror movie thing where what's far looks further and what's close looks closer, but then I just feel like I'm on 4-6 30mg Adderalls again for like an hour before anything else happens that even remotely resembles a psychedelic over a stimulant.


I did however use 16mg of liquid DOM as a launching pad for 3.6mg of 25C-NBOMe on blotter to try to spice up the boring DOM, and I found that it's one hell of an enhancer. That 25C really shined in that context, so I think I'm going to explore other crosses of psychedelics with DOM.

Fascinating info, ty for the link! And I agree about the dosing being super reckless, nobody else should follow that by the number of mg, but perhaps instead by this.


The tabs of 25C elicit threshold effects at half a tab consistently around the sheet, I took 3 tabs, meaning six times that. Psychonautwiki has 25C's threshold at 50 mics, so if that's true and I'm really not getting threshold effects from quarter tabs on numerous occasions, does that maybe imply that of the 1.2mg I'm absorbing 100 mics? I may be incorrect in that thought, but if it is true and somebody gave me pure crystal 25C and asked me to replicate the experience, I would do so by trying to get 300 mics of 99% pure 25C, of course assuming it was all freebase so I don't have molecular weights to worry about.


The DOM was the same, threshold for me is with ~3mg of the material I've got, and if we use the same resource as about (psychonautwiki) then 500 mics of DOM is a threshold dose, meaning that I seem to have material that's 1/6 DOM 5/6 seemingly inert cuts if we go by the same logic as above with the 25C. That would mean that to replicate this with assured 99% DOM I would try to replicate this with ~2.5mg of DOM.


On top of that, I'd taken 10mg, waited 2 hours and took another 6, meaning that to replicate this perfectly with assuredly 99% materials, I would:

 * Take ~1.5mg DOM.

 * Wait 2 hours before taking ~1mg DOM.

 * Wait another 6 hours (8 since the initial DOM dose) and take 300ug 25C-NBOMe.


As much as I currently believe in this concept of finding a threshold and using that to try to establish a rough percentage of purity, I'd love to hear from others here on what they would recommend as a potential alternative or improvement.

Please take care of your sources, ensure that your compounds are verified clean and their dosages known. You are playing a very dangerous game. I would highly suggest not combining NBOHs or NBOMes with anything but the greatest respect, and a healthy body - if at all. They are extremely unpredictable and not the safest class of compounds. After my very worrying trial with what appeared to be a reasonable dose of clean compound, I've pretty much decided to leave this class of compounds to in vitro research, personally.

I'll keep that in mind for sure, can I ask what you experienced that put you off of N-benzylated phenethylamines? Bupropion, 2C-B, MDA, DOM, cannabis concentrates, blue lotus, caffeine, and ephedrine are all things I've experimented with mixing with 25C-NBOMe in low amounts, and of them the only ones I found interesting were MDA and cannabis concentrates.


I also want to reiterate that mixing any N-benzylated phenethylamine with anything stimulating can be very, very dangerous. What I didn't think about before mixing it with Bupropion was the fact that Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6, an enzyme partially responsible for many drugs' metabolism. I haven't found data on if that enzyme relates to 25C-NBOMe, but enzymatic reactions like that can very easily kill if mismanaged. About ten hours had passed between taking the Bupropion iirc, but it still noticeably shifted the experience into a shivery serotonin syndrome-y feeling. It honestly reminded me a lot of a time that when taking harmaline and LSD, I accidentally took my daily dose of 300mg Bupropion alongside the acid as to "not forget my meds", overlooking the potential harmaline interactions. Very well could've killed me but the 500 mics of LSD simply had me oogieing and boogieing all night at an open air concert, walked ~7 miles to get there and back, but I was pouring sweat and shivering well into the next evening.


Also, whenever I've mixed things with ephedrine it's always less than 50mg total, always in a ratio of 25mg:200mg ephedrine:caffeine.

Those in bold are very dangerous combos, and that's sure. You are risking a lot. More so with unreliable potency. 2c-b combo is probably less dangerous but still a very bad idea. I think even caffeine should be avoided. Blue lotus and weed shouldn't be problematic. 

As for dosing stuff of unknown potency, there ain't a good way to do that.

And I'm sure you are not absorbing just 100mics from 1.2mg tab. Unless you hold it just a very short amount of time. I used to hold tabs for 20 - 30min on my gums and/or under tongue.

If I'm absorbing more than 100 mics from the tab, then a threshold dose must be higher than 50 mics. I let them sit for half an hour but there's always an inevitable amount of saliva that ends up swallowed, sadly.

I had read this days ago and didn't connect the two usernames, it sounded like you'd made the 25E-NBOH yourself right? I'm curious about how the imine was formed between the 2C-E and o-anisaldehyde, I've heard from other chemists it's easy to mess up. When I read your thread it seemed like you had an anxious response to the drug and didn't actually verify any genuine physical toxicity with the thing with your hand. I've yet to have a drug or combination induce anxiety for me, but I'll certainly keep it in mind.


I'm very careful with giving these to other people, I've only done it with two other people bc with both I've consumed in excess of 1mg of LSD before and I've seen them handle it well. I could see N-benzylated phenethylamines absolutely ruining somebody psychologically if they aren't already the type who could handle say, 5-7 tabs of acid and 60mg of dextroamphetamine. I think there's an inherently higher risk of psychotic reactions to psychedelics that are also highly stimulating.


The things I've received of unreliable potency have all indicated the end of my relationship with that vendor, but if I find them consistently weak I'll still try to use them, at least in the case of this 25C and DOM. Especially because I can't find any other sources for those two compounds at the moment. An interesting note is that even gel capped these tabs of 25C seem to be active, just not as intensely as sublingual administration. It's confusing as fuck because eating even 3-5mg of 2C-C shouldn't have the effects nor duration that eating these tabs has, but they were given to me by somebody who claimed they'd tested them so I ate 4 and found myself tripping try realizing it wasn't acid, even though I thought that eating an NBOMe would render it inactive. Others have encountered this too but claimed they had no effects when putting the tabs in gel caps, though I still seem to get the same effects as not using a gel cap.

Bluelight is not the right place for synthesis discussion - but it is a well-documented reaction easily followed by TLC.


I'm equally torn apart between this having being a purely psychosomatic and real physiological reaction. Both explanations seem equally likely.


Let's just say that I'm no stranger to either psychedelics or stimulants. So that reaction really caught me off-guard.


Anyways, this is straying further and further from the original topic at hand - DOM. I'd be interested to hear if and with what yours is cut - analytical testing is overdue ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Oh, and NBOMes and NBOH may very well be active oral, or at least some of them.

Just got some 5 mg blotters - same as 8-9 years ago from GG! Been looking for this one and 2C-E as my missing pieces of Shulgins magical half dozen for a long time. Love the others! In this thread and at other places it does gets mixed reviews. Only other DOx I've tried is Aleph1/DOT, and we got along well. Love all Shulgins sulphor compounds warmly! I have a normal sensitivity to psychedelics in general, and some slight perma tolerance to 2C-B and LSD from more or less weekly imbibing. Right now I think my first trial ought to be 2,5 - 3 mg as I'll need to be basically funktional (which I normally can be on 50-60 mcg LSD). Does my reasoning seem right? If you can compare, could you give a rough equvalent for mg DOM to mcg LSD?

Just to emphasize: DO NOT combine DOT or any 4-sulphur compound with anything else (cannabis is ok). DOT is a potent inhibitor of MAO (the sulphur on position 4 of the ring substitutes for oxygen and inhibits the enzyme). 4-MTA is a good example of just how much these compounds inhibit MAO.

It also helped me deal with the freakout of having my first out-of-body-space travel-being directed through space by aliens-experience (2 hits needlepoint lsd and 3 No2 charges in one balloon).  Though a wonderful experience, I had that "I'm going crazy" thing going through my mind, and the trip took a stressful turn.  Some xanax helped dissolve the anxiety and mellow the trip out.  I got wonderful sleep and 8 hours later I woke up feeling better than I could ever remember, ready to start my last semester of college and kick ass.

I've mixed Etizolam/Deschloroetizolam with DOM, 2C-B, LSD, and many others, and it definitely dulls things but also eliminates potential anxieties. DOM has required me to take (what would, without the DOM) easily be blackout doses though. 12-15mg of Deschloroetizolam on no benzo tolerance is what it took me once to come down enough to sleep 16 hours after taking 15mg of DOM.

I find it highly separate from LSD personally, and I dose DOM typically in 5mg intervals. 5mg of DOM feels like 40-60mg of Adderall and a very peculiar, mescaline/2C-B flavored tab of acid that takes 3-4 hours to really kick in, whereas the stimulation only takes an hour or two to kick in.


If you're looking to remain fully functional, try 2mg, then 4mg if that doesn't cut it. 5mg leaves me shivering and sweating for a few hours at it comes up. 2mg tabs of this same batch I'm using have proven effective for helping a friend in graduate school grind through math studies, which has been neat.

Some months ago, I posted this link to an article written about the interesting history of DOM written by Matthew Baggot. Now here is one by Keeper Trout and Paul Daley. It goes a bit more into the motives behind Shulgin taking the risk of introducing Owsley Stanley to the compound (albeit speculative in nature).


[https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/dta.3667](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/dta.3667)


Very interesting for anyone who wants to learn about the history of these compounds. Sadly the article is behind a paywall. But I did stumble across it when browsing a website related to pirating science (which should be in the hands of the people anyways), cough cough.

The article was very interesting, but I don't think it shed much additional light on the circumstances.  That's fine though.  By coincidence, I actually managed to meet Nick Sand right after he got out of prison and had a brief one-on-one conversation with him.  He told me that as soon as he got home, he tried some old LSD he'd squirreled away and it was just as potent as when he it fresh.  He said he believed LSD is very stable provided it is sufficiently pure because the crystals formed from a pure product are resistant to chemical attack.


For those interested in reading the article, it can also be obtained from here:  [https://shulginresearch.net/publications/](https://shulginresearch.net/publications/)


All this makes me want to try DOM.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  It's on my list for when I get around to it, health permitting.

Fourth time trying my friend 2,5 dimethoxy, 4 methyl, amphetamine. DOM, second time 5mg. Have done 2.5mg twice before.


Took 5mg at 4am, went for a run at 5am, another 16km. Total running time 2hrs.


Just have to say, thank you everything that came together to make this such delightful experience!


It's just got this edge and push that feels so powerful.


Ah... thank you DOM, you're a good ally.


Had to dig deep to unravel some emotional issues, faced negative aspects of myself and my relationships.


Even was able to get some work done writing code.


Now just on a gentle afterglow 10hrs after initial dose. Lovely. Going to make myself a tea or coffee now.


Now I wonder what to run on next, DOB or LSD... Hmm. Maybe it will need to wait a while.


Note: Do not run 16km unless you have trained to do so, it's not recommended, I do a 16km run every weekend and total 30km each week.

Some studies suggest DOM may have a beta-adrenergic component.  Perhaps it's vaguely similar to ephedrine?  Of course you also have the serotonin-like effect that enhances the motor neurons and muscles along with the psychedelic anti-inflammatory component.  That seems like quite a package for athletics.


I myself am very much looking forward to trying DOM, but it's pretty much at the top of my difficulty ladder, so it will be a little while before I get around to it.


I expect your running on LSD will be great.  LSD is certainly great for hours of continuous dancing, for those of appropriate physical fitness.

Just out of curiosity, what about DOM comes off as difficult for you? If you could take a 30mg tablet of Adderall alongside 300-500mg of mescaline you are certainly prepared to use 5mg of DOM at least, if not more in my opinion.


Four days ago my boyfriend and I took 15mg each. I've gone as high as 18mg before, but he's only gone to 10mg. The jump from 10mg to 15mg is very steep, and the first few hours for him were nauseous and uncomfortable but then he napped the comeup off for a few hours and popped up good to go afterwards. Later on in the night we introduced ketamine and 3-HO-PCE, which added a lot of magic and empathogenic qualities. Watching the edge of the legs of my pants levitate off the ground as colorful bright lights danced around the room painting beautiful elaborations of emotions I was feeling with a degree of articulation I could only ever aspire towards. Cathartically reliving and healing from past traumas just silently crying, perfectly still later that night was very healing.


DOM can be intense over 10mg, but 3-5mg is a dose nobody should be scared of as long as they respond alright to amphetamine and LSD (or mescaline), in my personal opinion.


Edit: It's been 46 days since writing this comment, and since then I've pushed DOM to the 25-30mg range. Imo, as somebody who often doses psychedelics up to very high points and handles them well where others may not, exceeding that feels like it may cause potential vascular concerns in myself or others, just wanted to throw this note in there. 20-30mg is beautiful, idk if I'd ever try 45 though people have been known to be physically fine from 100mg-300mg doses allegedly from the '67 Love-In incident in SF. Like I said, **no advocacy for such behavior here, it's reckless**, but the higher end of this drug ~20-30mg for a highly experienced psychedelic user with a sober tripsitter, tripkillers, on hand (and maybe also propranolol) provides a very mystical experience. </update type="from 46 days later">

I am recovering from Long COVID and have a history of glomerular kidney disease.  Medically speaking, psychedelics are completely and totally contraindicated for me in more ways than one, but after 11 years of abstinence (except cannabis and the occasional benzo/opiate) they called to me to return.  I was extremely cautious, starting with like 0.5 mg of 2C-D and titrating up.  That was only a year ago.  I discovered that I was very hypersensitive to the body load effects of the psychedelics I tried and that my Long COVID symptoms were potentiated too.  On my first significant dose, I was very sad because I thought I wouldn't be able to trip safely, but when I woke up on the morning after, I realized right away that those same symptoms were now greatly diminished.  In time I discovered that the after effects of various psychedelics provide me with a window of symptom relief that fades over a period of days, weeks, or months, depending roughly on the intensity and duration of activity of the substance.  In addition to reducing my symptoms in the short-term, my regular use of psychedelics over time has led to a progressive decrease in symptom frequency and severity and an increase in capacity for exertion without triggering the post-exertion malaise response (which recent research shows involves actual serious damage to tissues.)


So on the one hand, psychedelics are probably unusually toxic to me, but on the other they heal me.  In the long-run, as I continue to become healthier, my body is responding better to the drugs and I can tolerate bigger doses with more therapeutic effect.  Only this summer did I start taking doses up the lower part of the PIHKAL range.  The first couple such doses definitely felt like a stretch for my body, but the last one I took, 18 mg 2C-B HBr, was pretty smooth.  Another thing about being healthier is that the trips themselves are so much more interesting and enjoyable.  I think I've made tremendous progress and probably could handle 3-5 mg of DOM fairly well today, but it's better if I wait a while longer.  Not only will I be more confident in my body but I will probably enjoy the experiences much more than I would have.


And lastly, there are too many other things I want to take and I don't really trip more than every few weeks.  When I'm ready for something brand new to me, I'm probably going to try 2C-P before I get to DOM.  If me and my kidneys get along with the long duration of 2C-P then I'll be a lot more comfortable exploring DOC and DOM.

Hey,


Sorry for the necro post, I found 2 blotters of DOM 5mg in my RC stash. 

Does someone know how is the vasoconstriction of this one in comparisons with DOC or DOI?


Thanks!

I wish I could answer that, but I don't really get vasoconstriction from many psychedelics, certainly not from DOC or DOM. I've never tried DOI. 


Is it speedy? Yes. Or "yes, but..."


I don't like speedy psychedelics in general. They give me the somatic feeling of anxiety, which when tripping is easy for me to equate with actual anxiety. That said, I don't typically mind the stimulation that I get from DOC or DOM, especially if I channel it properly through a hike or dance or something. It feels more focused, less scattered and jangly than the unsettling stimulation that I get from 5-MeO-MET, 4-AcO-EPT, or 2C-B-FLY. Pharmacology be damned: they just feel more like d-amphetamine, while the others feel more like a quad shot of espresso. I went back through my notes to see if I thought it was more or less stimulating than DOC, but all I seem to have noted is that they were basically the same during the come-up, with DOC settling in and with DOM's stimulation basically remaining stable throughout. 


And don't worry about necroposting here. It's good to keep threads active.

If you can't take ~40mg of Adderall alongside a couple tabs of acid, DOM probably won't be very enjoyable imo.

@HoffmanBlotter I would consider any noticeable dose of DOM to be too stimulating for you if 80mg of caffeine is your max.

I'm inclined to agree with Esperighanto here. DOM is kinda known for being a stimulant *and* psychedelic rather than a stimulating psychedelic. How did DOC treat you?

My fiance [@Felidaez](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/588230/) cooked an entire thanksgiving dinner on 10mg and it was fantastic, DOM is the only psychedelic that makes me compulsively clean my living space more than acid haha. Did DOM lead you to getting up to anything past music enjoyment? With how long it lasts it always makes for very long days for me.

Yes the compulsive cleaning effect has been observed in all cultutes.
