## GUIDE            

                    How to test Methamphetamine?

**How to test Methamphetamine (Meth / Ice):** if you intend to use a psychoactive substance first you need a test kit to check purity. Pure methamphetamine can look white or clear and can’t be identified by appearance. Check your sample with a single or multi-use [methamphetamine test kit](/meth-amphetamine-en/).

### Methamphetamine tester

### Recommended methamphetamine testing kits

Recommended multi-use [methamphetamine reagent test kit](/methamphetamine-reagent-test-kit/) includes reagents Marquis, Mecke, Simon’s and Robadope. Reagents Marquis, Mecke, Simon’s are required to identify methamphetamine. Robadope reagent helps detect 2C-B, amphetamine, MDA, PMA or taurine. To discover full ingredients and estimate methamphetamine % pair reagents with TLC [Methamphetamine Purity Test Kit](/methamphetamine-purity-test-kit-tlc/). To detect fentanyl use the [fentanyl test strips](/product/fentanyl-test-strips/).

### Methamphetamine test kit results

### Crystal meth purity testing

Use Robadope and/or Simon’s reagents to confirm presence of meth/amphetamine. Amphetamine (and other primary amines suchs as 2C-X, MDA, PMA, taurine) will cause a pink color change with Robadope reagent, while Simon’s will react to meth (and other secondary amines such as MDMA, MMC analogs, PMMA) with an instant blue color change. Use both in your meth testing kit for best results.

- How to use Methamphetamine Test Kit? 
 .accordion-title 

GET ALL TOOLS
First, prepare a clean white testing surface – ceramic or glass is the best, e.g. bottom of a mug or a plate. Get your sample, reagents, a sharp tool / scoop and paper towels.
PREPARE SAMPLE, ABOUT THIS BIG -> ●   
If testing a pill, powder or crystal, crush it finely. If testing a liquid, dry one drop on paper or clean ceramic surface. A bigger sample can cause a stronger reaction. You need a new sample for each test.
ADD ONE* DROP (OR PILE) OF REAGENT
Shake bottles hard before use, then tap firmly to shake down any reagent stuck in cap. Do not let a bottle touch sample or you will ruin the rest of the reagent. Use just enough reagent to cover a sample. If using crystals avoid air pockets by flattening crystals onto sample using a clean tool. *Do not combine reagents except for „A” and „B” bottles.
OBSERVE FOR UP TO 3 MINUTES*
Disregard any color change after 3 minutes. Do not overinterpret your results, consider that color change reaction is always fastest and most vivid in the part where biggest surface of reagent touches sample, compared to its edges. Over time reaction will degrade due to air contact. Take photos.
COMPARE RESULTS
Compare color change with instructions. Reagents can indicate PRESENCE, but not QUANTITY. Adulterants can be detected with reagents only if they cause a darker color change than the expected substance. To detect all ingredients and estimate their amount pair reagents with a TLC purity test kit.
Clean used reagent tools / testing surface with lots of running water and detergent, avoid contamination.

- How to handle Methamphetamine Test Kit? 
 .accordion-title 

Drug testing kits contain toxic and/or corrosive chemicals, strong enough to burn skin and clothing. Keep out of eyes and mouth. Keep away from children and animals. Always use in a well-ventilated area. Wear gloves (supplied) when handling the bottle and cap. Wear protective eyewear. Never point towards face etc. If you get some on you/clothing, then immediately wash with lots of soap and water. Dispose of any unwanted reagent with running water, ventilate. Store reagents standing up and away from heat in a cool, dark place. The average shelf life of 2 years can be significantly extended by storing in a fridge or freezer (warm up to room temperature before use).
Reagents deteriorate with time or due to contact with air, especially if exposed to sunlight or not refrigerated. If you are uncertain whether the reagent will work, test it with an already confirmed sample.

## STEP TWO            

                    How to test meth purity %?

**To discover all adulterants and estimate quantity** pair reagent tests with a [TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography) Purity Test Kit](/product-category/drug-testing-kits/purity-testing-kits/). TLC purity tests alone don’t identify substances and are best paired with at least 1-2 reagent tests. Thin Layer Chromatography is one of classic substance analysis methods. It works by separating different compounds depending on their solubility in chosen TLC testing liquid (eluent). To precisly estimate methamphetamine purity pair a reagent test kit with the [Methamphetamine Purity Test Kit](/methamphetamine-purity-test-kit/).

### How to test quality of meth?

TLC test works by separating substances present in a sample, each detected spot indicates a different substance.

- You can use an already confirmed sample for reference – if both compounds show up at the same height on the TLC “card” that indicates they can be the same substance.

- You can use any substance for reference after establishing their relation – if substance X shows up twice as high on the same testing “card” as substance Y, you can expect them to keep that ratio.

### TLC MDMA Purity Test potency scale

### How to test quality of meth?

TLC helps estimate quantity (potency). The bigger the size of the detected spot, the bigger the amount of measured substance. Note that different substances need different calibrated rulers and often different testing liquids (eluents).

- One spot indicates a pure substance. If your sample fully dissolved in testing liquid and only one spot was detected on TLC then your substance is pure. Trace amounts of impurities might not be detected, do not rely on TLC for fentanyl testing – get also fentanyl test strips.

GET ALL TOOLS
First, prepare a clean and well lit testing surfach. Get your sample, spatula, gloves, plastic vial, testing liquid, pipette, pencil, glass tube, wrapped esting cards, jar and UV-C flashlight. Next, carefully holding a testing “card” by only top edges mark 4 dots 1 cm apart from card’s bottom, sides and each other.
PREPARE SAMPLE
If testing a pill, powder or crystal, crush it finely. Weigh sample in a plastic vial and dissolve in testing liquid (or other solvent) using ratios mentioned in the booklet. Shake to dissolve. To big or too small sample can cause an inconclusive result.
ADD 1 MICROLITER TO CARD 
In case of sediment wait a minute for it to fall down. Under strong light submerge end of glass tube to fill it with dissolved sample. Gently touch one of the marked dots on Testing Card to discharge sample and mark the spot with pencil.
INSERT CARD INTO JAR
Add 2 ml of testing liquid inside jar and carefully, paying attention to not touch the white side of Testing Card with sample, insert it inside jar. Close the jar and observe for about 25 minutes, until Testing Card almost fully soaks – but not any longer. Remove Testing Card from jar, wait for it to dry.
COMPARE RESULTS
Use UV-C flashlight to reveal results. Spots on Testing Card revealed by UV-C light circle using pencil. Each spot indicates a separate substance.  TLC purity test kits can detect NUMBER and AMOUNT of substances, but not their TYPE. Pair TLC test kit with reagent test kit to indentify ingredients.

## How to test meth for fentanyl?

### Use fentanyl test strips (a fentanyl test kit)

### METHOD 1

If testing a benzo/opioid pill, crush one in a plastic baggie and dump out the powder.  Then add 10 drops of water into the baggie and mix well. Dip the test strip no higher than the thick line. Wait 15 seconds. Put the strip away and check in 5 minutes.

**METHOD 2**

Mix 100 mg of sample in 200 ml of water. Dip the test strip no higher than the thick line. Wait 15 seconds. Put the strip away and check in 5 minutes.

**COMPARE RESULTS**

1 line = fentanyl, 2 lines = no fentanyl. Faint lines also count. Ignore fentanyl tester results after 5 minutes.

To detect all ingredients and estimate their amount pair reagents with a TLC purity test kit.

**[Check all PRO Test guides how to test drugs.](/blog/)**

**A positive or negative test result does not indicate if a substance is safe. No substance is 100% safe.**

I’m researching the street drug scene and the crippling effects that both meth and fentanyl are having on not only my community but having too on the American society as a whole. The rumor is that fentanyl is being cut into all street drugs, and that to me is terrifying. I want an accurate but reasonably priced methamphetamine purity test kit. And I want, I think, are the fentanyl test strips. If I could get prices and comments on the items I’ve listed, it would be of great help. Thank you
