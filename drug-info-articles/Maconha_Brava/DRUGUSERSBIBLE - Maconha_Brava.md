## Subjective Experience

This is used in South America as a mild sedating psychedelic, and according to Plants
of the Gods, is sometimes smoked as a substitute for cannabis. Internet references,
however, were sparse, suggesting that I shouldn’t raise my expectations too high.

I didn’t, and I was correct not to. The 25x extract I purchased invoked the mildest of
headspace, with no notable features.

I should add that the quality of the supplier may have been a relevant factor,
particularly as the packet was marked “Source: Thailand” (where it is not
indigenous). The style of the vendor’s website didn’t inspire confidence either.

The main effect came out of the blue: vivid dreams.

I hadn’t noticed anything on this during research, but upon re-visiting, the reports
were there, or at least some reports were there. This is, perhaps, an aspect worthy of
further exploration, assuming a more reliable supply.
