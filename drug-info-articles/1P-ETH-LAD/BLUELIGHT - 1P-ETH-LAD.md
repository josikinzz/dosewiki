Amazing.


It will be really interesting to compare this side by side with ETH-LAD, we might get a more concrete idea of how this propyl group affects the lysergemide than by comparing 1P-LSD to LSD, because there won't be the variability of people comparing to unknown dosages of LSD blotter.


Nonetheless, it might still be difficult to draw any conclusions because of the randomness of tripping.

Any chemistry savy folks out there who can calculate the molar masses of ETH-LAD and 1P-ETH-LAD? It would be nice to know how the potencies of the two should compare.

1P-LSD is just as potent as LSD and I see no reason why this would be any different here.

The propionyl group has some weight to it, so 100µg of LSD has more molecules than 100µg of 1P-LSD. (Same idea with ETH-LAD and 1P-ETH-LAD). Maybe it's marginal.

Wow, I hope it's not too expensive, although this will be a collectors item, price is irrelevant I guess. To me 1P-LSD is a pure marvel, I have no doubts this 1P-ETH-LAD will be as good.

if this hits the uk market im definetly going to get it , although ill probably wait till those who've tried eth-lad compare the effects and if they are identical/ practically the same etc as was the case for a lot of 1p reports and my first hand experience ill be happy to try them. think of the other possibilities 1p-al-lad ,1p-lsa even. although why havent they produced them as 1acetyl, is it easier to make the 1p bond?

^My *guess* is that they've perfected the method for the 1p bond. Or maybe it's simpler in terms of materials to just produce 1P bonded lysergamides.

I wish this was released after ETH-LAD was banned everywhere. That way they wouldn't got banned together. I guess they are trying to enter the UK market ?

perpetualdawn, i think youre probably on the right track there. isnt the issue with 1p-lsd being banned is that its going to be covered by a huge all inclusive psychoactive compounds ban, so surely this would also be covered by such a ban pretty much eliminating the market? ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Yeah 1p-LSD was held back so that they could bring it out the day after the LSZ and AL-LAD ban went into effect. I hope this means that they have yet another hidden away for the next wave of bans.

Checking to see if it's first of april.........Nope. :D Novelty factor for this one is just through the roof. 


Unfortunately, as I don't really think there's much difference between LSD and 1-P-LSD, I'm hard pressed to think this is going to be much different than ETH-LAD, maybe just a little bit less potent. Great for the british for legality reasons, obviously. But I really don't think this is going to bring any real novel mindstates.


ETH/PRO/AL-LSZ/LSP/LSB would have been more interesting. But what the hell, I'm not complaining ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

There will be no recovery from the next ban as it seeks to completely halt the sale & distribution of ALL RC's from the UK. 1P-Eth-Lad has probably been released because once the "Blanket Ban" sets in it will kill the UK internal market. 


1P-Eth-Lad supply will be limited as I doubt there is time to get another synth in even if the producer was able to recoup the high costs of producing the stuff.

i read on ukrc that this has been produced more to prove the 1p theory rather than to work around the law, although it still conveniently does. they also said that it will more than likely be a one time thing and when its gone its gone as its quite expensive to produce so the main uk lysergamide vendor is going to be distrbuting them in 3,5,10 or 25, i also imagine that powder wont be available with this one unfortantly

well, 1P-LSD should be M(LSD) + 32g/mol (molar mass of the propionyl group, minus the hydrogen originally bonded to the nitrogen). so not a big difference, because the total LSD molecule is much bulkier than one propionyl group.


ad "1p-mxe": well it depends on where the 1-position is... if you go by IUPAC, the first position is the carbonyl carbon, but this is not the same as having a substitution on the indole nitrogen in lysergamides.

So could they make a 1p version of anything? I am super happy with 1p-lsd. If they could make 1p-lsz i would shit. Eth-lad i am not a big fan so i am going to skip this one.

They made cit with a propynl group because ald-52 had not been tested at the time they commissioned the synthesis. They wanted to go with a tried and proven method. There were not enough reports on ald-52 at that time and there still arnt enough trip reports on It still now

I'm assuming there's not a whole lot of difference to this one assuming from the original ETH just a propionyl was added. Stick with 1P-LSD and Ethyl combo should do me well for a good while ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I didn't like the 1p lsd, exactly the same geometry every time with Vaso constriction. Too predictable. I'm hoping the 1p Eth lad Is going to be more like the al lad As I read in a trip report

Those look awesome. Are they labeled on the other side. I really respect those distributors who labeled the blotters with the name of the chemical. Those people obviously valued the psychedelic community and other peoples health. Those people are great.

So yesterday I took 50ug so that I could test the waters. Bit of background I always find myself sensitive to lysergamides and tryptamines and I'd no previous tolerence as the last time I tripped was nye . I've some notes I took throughout the trip but they are a bit broken up as I was a bit distracted to do a full live report

+1 starting to feel spacey there's a definent change of physical feeling in starting to feel very pleasant . Currently finishing typing up work , it seems to be flying in . (Work didn't take too long maybe an hour at most) 


+2h;15 the effects seen more pronounced than 1p LSD at this stage but still very manageable extremely pleasant and strong headspace presenting itself but again is brilliant  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) not really mindfuck in anyway atm very clear process going on  


+2h55 good tracers forming very progressive in though patterns as I don't seem to find it looping in anyway even coming back to previous thought is slightly hard but memories come back to me with ease , definetly beautiful 


+9 I'm still up but effects seem to be slowly fading but are currently still quite noticeable seems to be more euphoric and equally if not more visual ,although after only dosing once this can't be taken as fact but from reading some eth-lad trip reports the effects seem to match , the body load seems slightly lesser than 1p-LSD but this could have been because I was more distracted by the bliss feeling . Goes very well with green def adds to it , helps to dampen the stimulation as the weather was grim today so I didn't feel up to getting soaked :L 


+10h20. After going into cev which were surprisingly more vibrant than expected at this stage with this dose to come out of it for the walks to be breathing strongly and a general increased waveiness has remained till now , very awesome substance wish I'd ordered more now but that's what makes it such an amazing trip is the rareity of the lysergamides  


+11-12hrs  effects are barely there anymore just had food which tasted great without any issue  getting it down. Feeling pretty base again . I fell asleep with ease and feel pretty sound this morning . During the peak of the trip I spent some toke alone and mainly went to my friends houses to hang out and have a laugh . I found that the brick work in the buildings around me would be really popping out like as if the different colours of bricks sat out at different depths . Played chess for a while as the background of the board would form almost tribal like patterns which would change again into another shape but when I turned away it would still just stop so like I wasn't having a major trip on this one but I felt incredible and I was so happy , I'd really like to further explore this compound at higher doses like 75/100ug as 1p-LSD really makes me trip balls with things morphing and people dissolving away during a conversation although I think 1p-eth-lad is stronger, even if just marginally

Thanks for the notes. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I don't doubt that 1p-ETH-LAD is a bit more potent than 1p-LSD, because I find the same to be true with ETH-LAD vs LSD (ETH-LAD is stronger by weight, by a bit).

It's defo sparked my interest in trying to obtain some original eth-Lad but I'd love if they'd reproduce the 1p-eth-lad but I know it's not going to happen with an imminent ban I just prefer the calmer come up with the 1p compounds but I defo get my ass kicked and they still blow my mind ?

I cant believe how much i like this one over 1P-L.S.D.. I only ordered two blotters to test the waters so i took one blotter around 8 or so last night and waited i think about 45 mins and didnt seem to be feeling much so i took the other one. Well about another 15 mins or so i think i started to feel the first alerst but as this was so slow and smooth coming on i suddenly realized i was flying to the music in my headphones needless to say some gong. It didnt get real visual to about 6 hours after dropping then my leather settee turned into a set of waves and i could see mp3 player rolling in sinking in the troughs.I had music on the whole trip non stop and this made it sound as good as acid as far as i can remember as that was so long ago. I realy can't find any negatives no nausea i did eat a light snack beforehand hence the long come up maybe..


It has been the closest trip i have had to the ones i had decades ago on the real deal. Now i am remembering a long time ago so take that as it was a long time ago. For me it blows al-lad,lsz and 1p-lsd out of the water in my book, but i did take 200ug of this as compared to 225ug of al-lad which i found quite uncomfortable for a while. It was better than 150ug lsz and 150ug of al-lad combined . Its was better than the pargy-lad i had at 300ug if that is what it was.. I just cant believe how smooth it was. I hardly had to stretch at all though i was very unsteady on my feet. I did listen to music for the whole trip as i just couldnt stop listening to how good it felt and sounded.Still got an afterglow today and i took it on sat evening.

If i had the money i would buy a lot more and as i said i would swap all my other lysergamides for this one without a doubt.


ps It kind of reminded me of the red heart gel tabs we used to eat back in the late seventies early eighties acid we used to get. it was really smooth too without the speedy edge that the superman acid used to have. I hold the superman acid up as my perfect model but alas that came to an end with operation julie


pps  Please bear in mind that is the only trip i have had with this chemical and the next one could be entirely different so i do think i need to trip a few more times on this to give a comprehensive feedback but alas as its limited stock it will probably be all gone by the time i get around to my next trial.

Hi zombywoof. Have you tried ETH-LAD? I wonder how they stack up? I've tried ETH-LAD recently and it sounds very like your experience with 1PETH-LAD. Like you there has only been one trip with another to follow soon.

Does the illegality of the drug prevent you as in 'I wont buy illegal drugs' or is it "It's illegal can't get it"?

I think it might be a while before we get a comparison of eth vs 1p-eth - everywhere you can get 1p-eth-lad, it's inconvenient to get eth-lad and vice versa. They shouldn't be much different from each other but who knows.


Edit: from the reports here it does seem like it has a slower comeup vs eth-lad, which might be expected because of the prodrug

  I've tried both of them once so far at 200ug both times. Subjectively the effects are identical in my opinion. 1P- did take an exceedingly long time to come up, but I'm not comfortable making a definite statement on that since I ate a lot more before 1P- than I did with regular ETH-LAD.

1p-eth-lad 75ug 

Dropped 437

+2.  

Defo effect felt , strong stimulation,  euphorias building but as is nausea , visuals stronger oev , mind pretty clear feeling a little distracted possibly from coversatio. About to shower ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) feeling a little chilly too don't know if this is the weather or the drug or just me


+9Shower was great very tactile , visuals started to really ramp up within the next hour , faint geometric patterns on surfaces and general line of sight , proper waving effect on the wall , radiant oras on the characters of anchor man at points as well as the backgrounds morphing considerably , everything has motion . Looking at a bag if g I feel it's wrong that it's in a bag it should just be out , decided I need to get some plants for my room . Energy outlines around things giving them a white and technicolor edge.house mates watching a horror film which was to them quite scary but I in no way found it jumpy or scary so it was funny to watch then get on  Food tastes great and sex was so passionate . Still quite cognitive throughout the trip, still find that if I was having visuals as strong as I was I'd expect the mind high to be more intense but I didn't find it anything challenging or at least overly so although at around hour 7 it seemed that the intensity kinda just dropped a level I was still trippin but just not as hard . Cevs when I was drifting of to sleep with music playing were geometric and mandala ish at times but faces within the visuals were very angular and slightly tribal looking , fell asleep at around 10/11 hours .

Just to put out there I wasn't In the shower from the 2hour mark till the 9hour mark :L, but I did find that this hit me pretty quickly with the first effects being noticed in about 35/45minutes when I was in the car home with my partner driving the road seemed to be coming towards me at a slowish pace even though she was driving at 50/60mph . I loved this trip the intensity of the visuals really caught me off guard but not in such a way that it was too much just that it was stronger than 75ug 1p-LSD .   Glad to read that others say that besides the possible slowed come up this is the same as regular eth-lad, because it helps back up the principles behind the r1 attachment .

With 300ug of 1P-ETH-LAD dosed sublingually, effects were evident within 15 minutes and escalated quickly from there, reaching a plateau of effect within the hour, which was where I stayed for the following five hours. I'm aware of another tripper who is rather sensitive to psychedelics who dosed 150ug sublingually and found the come up so fast and intense that they had a panic attack and had to (somewhat reluctantly) take benzos to prevent it turning into a seriously bad trip.


I'm not all that familiar with the timings that could be expected with the propionyless version, but slow onset isn't how I'd describe it. Maybe it's down to sublingual dosing, but what mechanism could be at work is a bit puzzling if that's the case.

Well looking back to 1p-LSD if find It comes to the peak slower or in my opinion has a double peak where you hit what feels like a peak quick then it starts building again all within maybe 2/2& half hours . But back to topic on this 1p-eth trip i was up exceedingly fast and I'd say that 100ug would have me crawling the walls and trippin major balls cause that's where 75ug almost had me , was an amazing time . I'd find my self very sensitive feeling effects of psyches quite strongly . 


Oh I must mention that I hadn't eaten in 4/5hours prior to the trip and took it sublingually holding it on my gums the whole times (well at least until I couldn't find it in my gums![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ) I really wish this had been released ages ago cause if have stocked up so much more it's just too expensive at the moment . Hopefully I can obtain so original eth-lad in the future to compare ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah we definitely shouldn't jump to conclusions that the 1P version hits more slowly - the 1P part might cleave off within seconds on the bloodstream (or saliva) or it might take much longer, I don't think we really know. The onset time of the same psychedelic varies greatly from person to person, trip to trip, so we should be careful not to draw stereotypes from limited reports and the preconceived idea that the 1P *should* be slower.

Yeah you have a very good point there , well id say that there's a fair amount of reports staying this but obviously nothing's in literature yet so it is just speculation but it's a goo point to bring up to avoid people thinking it's not kicking in much and redosing too early/too much .

I've found the 1P-LSD to be a longer come up than LSD25, also found ETH-LAD was above the hour mark, (although still shorter than the 1P-LSD) but I had eaten a couple of hours before it.

I havnt tried the !P ETH - LAD but I love 1PLSD and although I found it longer to reach peak than my experiences with LSD25 (1P takes 2 - 2.5 hours to reach peak compared to about 60 mins for street acid) but unlike its big brother I found the come up more smooth and gentle - street acid seems to do nothing for an hour then - whoomph - your tripping your balls off. The 1P takes longer to peak but I find that it starts to produce threshold effects within 15 minutes of ingestion, which intensifies at what I beleieve is a perefct rate right up untill peak. I also find that it wears off in a similar manner, rather than the trip just wearing off it seems to fade over the course of 2 hours at exactly the rate that it came on. For someone with a fragile mind I cant believe how much I love this drug, although I havnt taken a dose larger than 200mcgs yet (2 standard blotters)

Maybe they added the propionyl group to act as a "timebomb" for the ETH, maybe it will help counteract that nausea for some by reducing the time it comes up, I was thinking maybe the nausea is caused by the intense rate that you convert to the tripping headspace, I'm not sure!

Regarding 1P-lsd, I found it more potent and with a faster come up when drop on an empty stomach just before a meal.

I red somewhere that fat would help the conversion to the active compound.


Ok I tried 200ug 1p-eth-lad today.

And big disappointment for me.

Unless there is a misleading name on the label.

Nothing good for me.

No soul nada.

Just wasn't able to type something on my keyboard.

That's it

Yes just before eating.

Normally it's how work best for me...


Now 7 hours later i'm nearly baseline...


Nan this 1p-eth-lad is a joke for me.

Not at all like lsd or 1p-lsd. Just a waste of time for me.

The propionyl group might help it enter the brain, ala heroin. If that is the case, esters could be more potent than their parents.

No other experiences on this?

I don't  know if it is particular to me but I found it very disappointing.

Same here. I enjoyed the experience, mind you, I just wasn't impressed. 


Do mind, I only have some experience with LSD.


Pro's:

- Visually impressive. Very impressive. Hieroglyphs in rays of sun that shone  through curtains.

- Very grounded, less of a headfuck

-  No post trip blues


Cons:

Alas, the pro's correlate with the cons:

- I enjoy "zooming in" on a visual aspect but ETH LAD left no room to focus on clouds or a pattern in a beam of sunlight. It was like being at a parade, with screamy, flashy lights all over you. 

- being grounded also means  less or in my case no headspace. No room to elaborate on aspects of life, no room to explore certain corners of your mind.

Where LSD is outside of the box, I experienced ETH-LAD as inside the box.

- less musically accessible. Where LSD opens up a large spectrum of songs, picking you up so you can tzirlt about in a song, I had to really dig to get the most out of song. 

A bit frustrating, I felt like I missed out. 

- short lived (in contrast with LSD), I think I was back at baseline with no OEV or CEV or headspace 6 hours after dropping.

- Uneasy: the jitters I get at the come up in LSD, lasted throughout most of the trip, making me uncomfortable. It wasn't until I stopped rolling, until I felt at ease.


It's the set and setting and the company that really made things enjoyable, but probably won't try it again. In hindsight, I rather would have went with LSD. My friends really filled in the blanks though.


My buddies really did enjoy it though, so maybe it's just me or my blotter that was poorly saturated, idunno. 


I suppose my spirit is more compatible with lysergamides?

If the indolic nitrogen is intended to be the i-position, then I don't think it'll just pop off like for example psilocybin undergoing its probable in-vivo dephosphorylation, its a lot tougher to cleave an amide than it is to do hydrolyse an ester, indeed, esters are pretty susceptible to cleavage in basic conditions. But the indolic N takes the form of an propionamide in 1p-lysergamides.


I have to say actually, that I am very impressed with the level of capability shown by the very fact that multiple different compounds have been released, and lysergic chemistry isn't trivial. Somebody, somewhere, has been going to what must be considerable effort into these, not just in the synthesis of the compounds themselves, but in obtaining precursors, I'd love to know if they were simply sourcing ergopeptides of some sort commercialy, or if they have been taking the DIY, biotech approach and if so, weather its coming from Purpurea or Paspali.


Regardles though if the buggers behind the lysergamides we have seen released have managed to get their own biotech fermentation setup and both isolate and maintain a productive strain of C.purpurea or paspalum ergot then they have proved themselves pretty damn resourceful.

So this is really just something people would be stoked about because they can't get eth lad, right? I mean theres no advantages to 1p eth lad if you have access to both, right?

^ We don't know for sure if there is any difference between ETH-LAD and 1P-ETH-LAD, just like how it's debatable whether there is a difference between 1p-LSD and LSD. They are probably indistinguishable from each other, but we don't know for sure.

I've tried both at similar doses (150 ug), and 1P-ETH-LAD seemed to be less potent, it was less of a full blown trip that 150 ug of the non-propionyl version gave me. I've only tried both once though, yet in similar settings.

So my research group finally got to try this fourth of july weekend.  Had high hopes.. was feeling like this could be an amalgamation of the 3 new lysergamides i've been blessed to try.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to our own personal hype.  We WERE planning on trying 3 1/3rd tabs each of 100ug.  But myself always wanting to err on the side of caution convinced the group to start with 2 and redose if we wern't feeling much.  Well about an hour in we wern't even close to what we normally feel on AL or 1P.  


We took the rest and about this time ate some fresh fruit.  I went in the house to take a piss and suddenly looking in the mirror turned on the visuals.  Much different fractaling or mandelas than i normally see on lysergamides.  Very detail oriented and suddenly lighting shades were very pronounced.  I'm not sure if it was going inside or the fruit that ramped up the intensity, but for a few moments i felt like i was tripping HARD.  I went back outside and managed to calm myself down a bit, and discussion with my friends proved that i was experiencing this peak alone.  


I finally got some energy which was surprising i hadn't gotten earlier because it is usually the first sign of onset for me.  The visuals were not overlays but I could concentrate on the ground and see snowflake type patterns.  Like I stated.. much more intricate than the normal detail.  Everyone decided we wern't feeling how we wanted to and so two of us took another tab of AL-LAD.  


We went inside and watched a trippy movie.  I never noticed anything more than that peak i already had been through.  From there on it ramped down on the usual route of lysergamides.  Needless to say i was pretty disappointed.. especially having had a great long trip the weekend before on only 200ug of 1P-LSD.  As far as this one goes for my group, we tried it and can add it to the resume, but it doesn't warrant further research  ;]

I'm happy to see that I'm not the only one that was disapointed by this lys.

I don't know whether the propionyl version differ from eth-lad but according to the reports on the latter I can't see the similarities with the experience I got from 1p-eth-lad.

Had a terrible experience with this last night, I mixed 50ug 1p eth lad with 10my 2cbfly.


The nerves on my tongue got seriously confused, felt like there was something stuck between all of my teeth and/or my teeth were wobbling and bleeding.


Also the bodyload sucked, no euphoria. Not much confusion but communicating was hard.


I tried this before with 5mg and it was fine. Be warned!

I had a fantastic trip with 300ug 1P-ETH-LAD guys, minus 30-45mins of a bad period. I wrote a report here [https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/4vpzg2/300ug_1pethlad_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/4vpzg2/300ug_1pethlad_update/)

I don't know how this compares to 300ug regular ETH-LAD, but it was much more intense and less lucid compared to 200ug ETH-LAD. I think it's just the dose response curve, but who knows what that P group can do.

I took about 150µg last weekend, but I had still been under the influence of alprazolam somewhat. I found it less visual and mentally profound than LSD or 1P-LSD.  I still have more testing to do. I can say however that this one last longer than regular LSD. I wrote a TR, but it's full of complaints how boring I found it and that the bodyload wasn't very pleasant. I had some nice visuals though at some points, but the body high was more noticable than anything else and was distracting. 


I might try a bigger dose next time with alprazolam in my system though.
