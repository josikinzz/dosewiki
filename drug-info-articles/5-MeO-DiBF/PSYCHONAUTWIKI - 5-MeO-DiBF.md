**5-Methoxy-N,N-diisopropylbenzofuranethylamine** (also known as **5-MeO-DiBF** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is related in structure to [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) .

This compound has little to no history of human usage prior to its September 2015 release on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market.

Very little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 5-MeO-DiBF. Due to its extreme novelty and unknown toxicity profile, it is highly advised that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

5-MeO-DiBF, or 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropylbenzofuranethylamine, is a synthetic heterocyclic alkaloid molecule of the [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) class. Benzofuran is a bicyclic structure formed by the fusion of a benzene ring and a furan ring, a five member aromatic ring containing an oxygen substituent.

5-MeO-DiBF is composed of a benzofuran group attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. It is substituted at R 5 of the benzofuran heterocycle with a methoxy (MeO) functional group CH 3 O−; it also contains two isopropyl chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (DiBF).

The benzofuran group of 5-MeO-DiBF is closely related in structure to the indole found in tryptamines; benzofuran contains an oxygen group at the same location that indole contains a nitrogen. As such, 5-MeO-DiBF is closely related in structure to the psychedelic tryptamine [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) . 5-MeO-DiBF is the benzofuran analogue of [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) .

## Pharmacology

5-MeO-DiBF likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT2 family of serotonin receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

This compound is several times less potent as a serotonin agonist than 5-MeO-DiPT. It has relatively more activity at 5-HT1A, but still shows strongest effects at the 5-HT2 family of receptors.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 5-MeO-DiBF use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 5-MeO-DiBF is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 5-MeO-DiBF suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

5-MeO-DiBF is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 5-MeO-DiBF is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MeO-DiBF presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MeO-DiBF all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 5-MeO-DiBF. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.

## Legal status

5-MeO-DiBF is currently thought to be a legal grey area substace in many parts of the world. However, although it is easily accessible through the use of online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors, this does not guarantee anyone to be immune from legal prosecution should they be found in possession of this substance as the legality is likely to vary from country to country.

- **Germany** : 5-MeO-DiBF is controlled under the NpSG (New Psychoactive Substances Act) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Switzerland** : 5-MeO-DiBF is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** : It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.
