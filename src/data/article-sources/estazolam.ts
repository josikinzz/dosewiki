## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepines. These are aromatic compounds containing a 1,4-benzodiazepine fused to and sharing a nitrogen atom with a 1,2,4-triazole ring.

### Background

A benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam.

### Indication

For the short-term management of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or early morning awakenings.

### Pharmacodynamics

Estazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative, is an oral hypnotic agent with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam.

### Mechanism of Action

GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator
GABA(A) Receptor Benzodiazepine Binding Site
Ligand

### Absorption

Tablets have been found to be equivalent in absorption to an orally administered solution of estazolam. In healthy subjects who received up to three times the recommended dose, peak estazolam plasma concentrations occurred within two hours after dosing (range 0.5 to 6.0 hours) and were proportional to the administered dose, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range tested.

### Metabolism

Extensively metabolized in the liver. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicate that the biotransformation of estazolam to the major circulating metabolite 4-hydroxy-estazolam is mediated by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A).

### Half-life

The range of estimates for the mean elimination half-life of estazolam varies from 10 to 24 hours.

### Toxicity

Symptoms of overdose include confusion, depressed breathing, drowsiness and eventually coma, lack of coordination, and slurred speech.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Estazolam is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Abacavir may decrease the excretion rate of Estazolam which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Estazolam can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Estazolam which could result in a higher serum level.
Acemetacin
Acemetacin may decrease the excretion rate of Estazolam which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with or without food. The absorption is unaffected by food.

### Mechanism of action

Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA
A
) receptors, this enhances the effects GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell.

### Protein binding

93% protein bound, independant of concentration.

### Route of elimination

Estazolam is extensively metabolized. The elimination of the parent drug takes place via hepatic metabolism of estazolam to hydroxylated and other metabolites that are eliminated largely in the urine both free and conjugated. Less than 5% of a 2 mg dose of estazolam was excreted unchanged in the urine, with only 4% of the dose appearing in the feces. Radiolabel mass balance studies indicate that the main route of excretion is via the kidneys. After 5 days, 87% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in human urine. Less than 4% of the dose was excreted unchanged.

### Curator comments

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA(A) function by binding at the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits. Of the 6 α-subunits, only 4 (α-1, -2, -3, and -5) participate in the formation of this binding site. The above target is a collection of all α- and γ-subunits that are known to participate in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of sterols, steroid hormones, retinoids and fatty acids (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11093772, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20702771, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:2732228). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2, as well as D-ring hydroxylated E1 and E2 at the C-16 position (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847). Plays a role in the metabolism of androgens, particularly in oxidative deactivation of testosterone (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:22773874, PubMed:2732228). Metabolizes testosterone to less biologically active 2beta- and 6beta-hydroxytestosterones (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:2732228). Contributes to the formation of hydroxycholesterols (oxysterols), particularly A-ring hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-4beta position, and side chain hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-25 position, likely contributing to cholesterol degradation and bile acid biosynthesis (PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA with a preference for the last double bond (PubMed:19965576). Metabolizes endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:20702771). Plays a role in the metabolism of retinoids. Displays high catalytic activity for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal, a rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) (PubMed:10681376). Further metabolizes atRA toward 4-hydroxyretinoate and may play a role in hepatic atRA clearance (PubMed:11093772). Responsible for oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. Acts as a 2-exo-monooxygenase for plant lipid 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) (PubMed:11159812). Metabolizes the majority of the administered drugs. Catalyzes sulfoxidation of the anthelmintics albendazole and fenbendazole (PubMed:10759686). Hydroxylates antimalarial drug quinine (PubMed:8968357). Acts as a 1,4-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase (PubMed:11695850). Also involved in vitamin D catabolism and calcium homeostasis. Catalyzes the inactivation of the active hormone calcitriol (1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)) (PubMed:29461981)

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estazolam*

Estazolam, sold under the brand name Prosom among others, is a tranquilizer medication of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD) class, which are benzodiazepines (BZDs) fused with a triazole ring. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Estazolam is an intermediate-acting oral benzodiazepine. It is used for short-term treatment of insomnia.
It was patented in 1968 and came into medical use in 1975.

## Medical uses

Estazolam is prescribed for the short-term treatment of certain sleep disorders. It is an effective hypnotic drug showing efficacy in increasing the time spent asleep as well as reducing awakenings during the night. Combination with non-pharmacological options for sleep management results in long-term improvements in sleep quality after discontinuation of short-term estazolam therapy. Estazolam is also sometimes used as a preoperative sleep aid. It was found to be superior to triazolam in side effect profile in preoperative patients in a trial. Estazolam also has anxiolytic properties and due to its long half-life can be an effective short-term treatment for insomnia associated with anxiety.

## Side effects

A hang-over effect commonly occurs with next day impairments of mental and physical performance. Other side effects of estazolam include somnolence, dizziness, hypokinesia, and abnormal coordination.
In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

## Tolerance and dependence

The main safety concern of benzodiazepines such as estazolam is a benzodiazepine dependence and the subsequent benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome which can occur upon discontinuation of the estazolam. A review of the literature found that long-term use of benzodiazepines such as estazolam is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, rebound insomnia and CNS related adverse effects. Estazolam should only be used short term and at the lowest effective dose to avoid complications related to long-term use. Non-pharmacological treatment options however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality. The short-term benefits of benzodiazepines on sleep begin to reduce after a few days due to tolerance to the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines in the elderly.

## Contraindications and special caution

Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

## Pharmacology

Estazolam is classed as a "triazolo" benzodiazepine drug. Estazolam exerts its therapeutic effects via its benzodiazepines receptor agonist properties. Estazolam at high doses decreases histamine turnover via its action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex in mouse brains.

## Pharmacokinetics

Peak plasma levels are achieved within 1–6 hours. Estazolam is an intermediate acting benzodiazepine. The elimination half life of estazolam is an average of 19 hours, with a range of 8–31 hours. The major metabolite of estazolam is 4-hydroxyestazolam. Other identified metabolites include 1-oxo-estazolam, 4'-hydroxy-estazolam, and benzophenone.

## Interactions

Alcohol enhances the sedative hypnotic properties of estazolam. In package inserts, the manufacturer clearly warns about an interaction with ritonavir, and although clinical interactions of ritonavir with estazolam have not yet been described, the lack of clinical descriptions of the interactions does not negate the seriousness of the interaction.

## EEG effects in rabbits

An animal study in rabbits demonstrated that estazolam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is significantly suppressed by estazolam.

## Abuse

A primate study found that estazolam has abuse potential. Two types of drug misuse can occur; recreational misuse, where the drug is taken to achieve a high or when the drug is continued long term against medical advice. Estazolam became notorious in 1998 when a large amount of an 'herbal sleeping mix' called Sleeping Buddha was recalled from the shelves after the FDA discovered that it contained estazolam. In 2007, a Canadian product called Sleepees was recalled after it was found to contain undeclared estazolam.
