## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-arylpiperazines. These are organic compounds containing a piperazine ring where the nitrogen ring atom carries an aryl group.

### Background

Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent with a unique structure and a pharmacological profile. Belonging to the azaspirodecanedione drug class,
2
buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT
1A
receptor agonist that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative/anxiolytic drugs.
13
Unlike many drugs used to treat anxiety, buspirone does not exhibit anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Due to these characteristics, buspirone been termed 'anxioselective'.
1
First synthesized in 1968 then patented in 1975,
10
it is commonly marketed under the brand name Buspar®. Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA
4
and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate.
10
The potential use of buspirone in combination with
melatonin
in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated.
4

### Indication

Indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety.
13

### Pharmacodynamics

The clinical effect of buspirone in alleviating the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to achieve.
10
The delayed onset of action of buspirone suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness in generalized anxiety may involved more than its molecular mechanism of action at the 5-HT
1A
receptors,
9
or buspirone may induce adaptations of 5-HT
1A
receptors.
10
Buspirone was not shown to alter the psychomotor or cognitive function in healthy volunteers, and the risk of developing sedation is relatively low compared to other anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines.
1
Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates used in anxiety disorders, buspirone is not associated with a risk for developing physical dependence or withdrawal, or any significant interaction with central nervous system depressants such as ethanol. This is due to the lack of effects on GABA receptors.
1
,
10
Buspirone also does not exhibit any anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing properties,
5
but may interfere with arousal reactions due to its inhibitory action on the aactivity of noradrenergic locus coerulus neurons.
9
Despite its clinical effectiveness in generalized anxiety, buspirone demonstrated limited clinical effectiveness on panic disorders, severe anxiety, phobias, and obsessive compulsive disorders.
4
,
9
The clinical effectiveness of the long-term use of buspirone, for more than 3 to 4 weeks, has not demonstrated in controlled trials but there were no observable significant adverse events in patients receiving buspirone for a year in a study of long-term use.
13

### Mechanism of Action

5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A
Partial agonist
D(2) dopamine receptor
Antagonist

### Absorption

Buspirone is rapidly absorbed following oral administration.
13
Bioavailability is low and variable (approximately 5%) due to extensive first pass metabolism. While absorption of buspirone is decreased with concomitant food intake, the first-pass metabolism of the drug is also decreased, resulting in an increased bioavailability
10
as well as increased Cmax and AUC.
13
Following oral administration of single oral doses of 20 mg, the Cmax ranged from 1 to 6 ng/mL and the Tmax ranged from 40 to 90 minutes.
13

### Metabolism

Buspirone is extensively metabolized upon administration, where it primarily undergoes hepatic oxidation mediated by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Hydroxylated derivatives are produced, including a pharmacologically active metabolite 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP). In animal studies, 1-PP possessed about one quarter of the pharmacological activity of buspirone.

### Half-life

In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of 14C-labeled buspirone, the average elimination half-life of unchanged buspirone following administration of single doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg was about 2 to 3 hours.
13

### Toxicity

The oral LD
50
of buspirone is 196 mg/kg in rat, 655 mg/kg in mouse, 586 mg/kg in dog, and 356 mg/kg in monkey. The intraperitoneal LD
50
is 136 mg/kg in rat and 146 mg/kg in mouse.
13
,
11
In clinical pharmacology trials, administration of buspirone at the dose of 375 mg/day resulted in symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. Few cases of overdosage that have been reported usually resulted in complete recovery. In case of overdose, the use of general symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended along with immediate gastric lavage and monitoring of respiration, pulse, and blood pressure.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Buspirone is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Buspirone may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Buspirone can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Buspirone can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Buspirone can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Alcohol may cause additive CNS depressant effects.
Avoid grapefruit products. Grapefruit increases the plasma concentrations of the drug.
Take at the same time every day. Take consistently at the same time in regard to meals.
Take with or without food. Take drug always with or always without food in a consistent manner.

### Mechanism of action

The therapeutic action of buspirone in generalized anxiety disorders is thought to be mainly derived from its interaction with two major 5-HT
1A
receptor subtypes that are involved in the brain's anxiety and fear circuitry to enhance the serotonergic activity in these brain areas.
10
Buspirone acts as a full agonist at presynaptic 5-HT
1A
receptors, or 5-HT
1A
autoreceptors, expressed at dorsal raphe while acting as a partial agonist at the postsynaptic 5-HT
1A
receptors expressed on hippocampus and cortex.
7
,
8
5-HT
1A
receptors function as inhibitory autoreceptors by being expressed on the soma or dendrites of serotonergic neurons or mediate postsynaptic actions of 5-HT by being highly expressed on the corticolimbic circuits.
9
They are inhibitory G-protein coupled receptors that couple to Gi/Go proteins. When activated, presynaptic 5-HT
1A
autoreceptors causes neuron hyperpolarization and reduces the firing rate of the serotonergic neuron, thereby decreasing extracellular 5-HT levels in the neuron's projection areas. Activated postsynaptic 5-HT
1A
receptors promote hyperpolarization to released 5-HT on pyramidal neurons.
8
The anxiolytic action of buspirone is mainly thought to arise from the interaction at presynaptic 5-HT
1A
autoreceptors. Acting as a potent agonist in these receptors, buspirone initially causes activation of these autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT release. It is proposed that buspirone induces desensitization of somatodendritic autoreceptors over time, which may explain the delayed onset of action of the drug. Desensitization of the autoreceptors ultimately results in heightened excitation of serotonergic neurons and enhanced 5-HT release.
9
Buspirone also displays a weak affinity for serotonin 5HT2 receptors and acts as a weak antagonist on dopamine D2 autoreceptors,
10
although there is not much evidence that the action at these receptors contribute to the anxiolytic effect of buspirone.
6
It acts as an antagonist at presynaptic dopamine D3 and D4 receptors and may bind to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors as a partial agonist.

### Volume of distribution

In a pharmacokinetic study assessing buspirone over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg, the volume of distribution was 5.3 L/kg.
3

### Protein binding

Based on the findings of an
in vitro
protein binding study, approximately 86% of buspirone is bound to plasma proteins.
13
It is mainly bound to serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.
2

### Route of elimination

A single-dose pharmacokinetic studies using 14C-labeled buspirone demonstrated that about 29-63% of the dose administered was excreted in the urine within 24 hours, primarily in the form of metabolites. About 18% to 38% of the dose was eliminated via fecal excretion.
13

### Clearance

In a pharmacokinetic study assessing buspirone over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg, the systemic clearance was 1.7 L/h/kg.

Buspirone, sold under the name Buspar among others, is an anxiolytic medication primarily used for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Unlike benzodiazepines, buspirone does not produce significant sedation, dependence, or withdrawal effects. Its principal mechanism of action involves partial agonism at postsynaptic serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and full agonism at presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, which initially reduces serotonergic neuron firing. Over time, autoreceptor desensitization occurs, leading to increased serotonin release and enhanced serotonergic tone, which may contribute to its clinical efficacy. Buspirone also has weak antagonistic effects at dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors and α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors.
Buspirone is approved for the management of generalized anxiety disorder. It is sometimes used off-label for other anxiety disorders, depression augmentation, and certain behavioral conditions. Buspirone is not effective as a sedative-hypnotic or muscle relaxant and does not have anticonvulsant properties.
Common side effects of buspirone include nausea, headaches, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating. Serious side effects may include movement disorders, serotonin syndrome, and seizures. Its use in pregnancy appears to be safe but has not been well studied, and use during breastfeeding has not been well studied either.
Buspirone was developed in 1968 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1986. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

### Anxiety

Buspirone is used for the short-term and long-term treatment of anxiety disorders or symptoms of anxiety. It is generally preferred over benzodiazepines because it does not activate the receptors that make drugs like alprazolam addictive.
Buspirone has no immediate anxiolytic effects, and hence has a delayed onset of action; its full clinical effectiveness may require 2–4 weeks to manifest itself. The drug is effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) similar to benzodiazepines including diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, and clorazepate. Buspirone is not known to be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders other than GAD.

### Other uses

#### Sexual dysfunction

There is some evidence that buspirone on its own may be useful in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women. Buspirone may also be effective in treating antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.

#### Miscellaneous

Buspirone is not effective as a treatment for benzodiazepine withdrawal, barbiturate withdrawal, or alcohol withdrawal.
SSRI and SNRI antidepressants such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, respectively, may cause jaw pain/jaw spasm reversible syndrome, although it is not common, and buspirone appears to be successful in treating antidepressant-induced bruxism.

## Contraindications

Buspirone has these contraindications:

Hypersensitivity to buspirone
Metabolic acidosis, as in diabetes
Should not be used with MAO inhibitors
Severely compromised liver or kidney function

## Side effects

Known side effects associated with buspirone include dizziness, headaches, nausea, tinnitus, and paresthesia. Buspirone is relatively well tolerated and is not associated with sedation, cognitive and psychomotor impairment, muscle relaxation, physical dependence, or anticonvulsant effects. In addition, buspirone does not produce euphoria and is not a drug of abuse.

## Overdose

Buspirone appears to be relatively benign in cases of single-drug overdose, although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available. In one clinical trial, buspirone was administered to healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375 mg/day, and produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. In early clinical trials, buspirone was given at dosages even as high as 2,400 mg/day, with akathisia, tremor, and muscle rigidity observed. Deliberate overdoses with 250 mg and up to 300 mg buspirone have resulted in drowsiness in about 50% of individuals. One death has been reported in a co-ingestion of 450 mg buspirone with alprazolam, diltiazem, alcohol, and cocaine.

## Interactions

Buspirone has been shown in vitro to be metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4. This finding is consistent with the in vivo interactions observed between buspirone and these inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), among others:

Itraconazole: Increased plasma level of buspirone
Rifampicin: Decreased plasma levels of buspirone
Nefazodone: Increased plasma levels of buspirone
Haloperidol: Increased plasma levels of buspirone
Carbamazepine: Decreased plasma levels of buspirone
Grapefruit: Significantly increases the plasma levels of buspirone. See grapefruit–drug interactions.
Fluvoxamine: Moderately increased plasma levels of buspirone.
Elevated blood pressure has been reported when buspirone has been administered to patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
Buspirone has been found to markedly reduce the hallucinogenic effects of the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin in humans. This parallels findings in which serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists like 8-OH-DPAT attenuate the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, induced by serotonergic psychedelics in rodents. Paradoxically however, buspirone enhances the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, induced by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) plus pargyline in rodents.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Buspirone acts primarily on the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. It behaves as a full agonist at presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe, reducing the firing of serotonin-producing neurons, and as a partial agonist at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in forebrain regions. This difference in activity between presynaptic and postsynaptic sites is thought to result from variations in receptor density and coupling efficiency.
Buspirone also has lower affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7, where it is thought to act primarily as an antagonist. In addition, buspirone has weak antagonistic activity at dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors, with preferential blockade of presynaptic D2 autoreceptors at low doses and postsynaptic D2 receptors only at higher doses.
A major metabolite of buspirone, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP), circulates at higher levels than buspirone itself and is a potent α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, which may contribute to some of buspirone's noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects. Buspirone has very weak affinity for α1-adrenergic receptors, and does not interact with the GABA_A receptor complex, unlike benzodiazepines.

### Pharmacokinetics

Buspirone has a low oral bioavailability of 3.9% relative to intravenous injection due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The time to peak plasma levels following ingestion is 0.9 to 1.5 hours. It is reported to have an elimination half-life of 2.8 hours, although a review of 14 studies found that the mean terminal half-life ranged between 2 and 11 hours, and one study even reported a terminal half-life of 33 hours. Buspirone is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, and prominent drug interactions with inhibitors and inducers of this enzyme have been observed. Major metabolites of buspirone include 5-hydroxybuspirone, 6-hydroxybuspirone, 8-hydroxybuspirone, and 1-PP. 6-Hydroxybuspirone has been identified as the predominant hepatic metabolite of buspirone, with plasma levels that are 40-fold greater than those of buspirone after oral administration of buspirone to humans. The metabolite is a high-affinity partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki=25 nM) similarly to buspirone, and has demonstrated occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor in vivo. As such, it is likely to play an important role in the therapeutic effects of buspirone. 1-PP has also been found to circulate at higher levels than those of buspirone itself and may similarly play a significant role in the clinical effects of buspirone.

## Chemistry

Buspirone is a member of the azapirone chemical class, and consists of azaspirodecanedione and pyrimidinylpiperazine components linked together by a butyl chain.

### Analogues

Structural analogues of buspirone include other azapirones like gepirone, ipsapirone, perospirone, and tandospirone.
A number of analogues are recorded.

### Synthesis

A number of methods of synthesis have also been reported.  One method begins with alkylation of 1-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazine (1) with 3-chloro-1-cyanopropane (4-chlorobutyronitrile) (2) to give (3). Next, reduction of the nitrile group is performed either by catalytic hydrogenation or with lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) giving (4). The primary amine is then reacted with 3,3-tetramethyleneglutaric anhydride (5) in order to yield buspirone (6).

## History

Buspirone was first synthesized by a team at Mead Johnson in 1968 but was not patented until 1980. It was initially developed as an antipsychotic acting on the D2 receptor but was found to be ineffective in the treatment of psychosis; it was then used as an anxiolytic. In 1986, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained FDA approval for buspirone in the treatment of GAD. The patent expired in 2001, and buspirone is available as a generic drug.

## Society and culture

### Generic names

Buspirone is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana of buspirone, while buspirone hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name.

### Brand names

Buspirone was primarily sold under the brand name Buspar. Buspar is currently listed as discontinued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2010, in response to a citizen petition, the FDA determined that Buspar was not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness.
