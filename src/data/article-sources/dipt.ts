Dose
 
by Erowid
 
DOSAGE SUMMARY #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
DIPT is primarily considered an auditory hallucinogen due to its "pitch-shifting" effects, though some people report significant visual effects, particularly at strong doses. DIPT may produce widely varying intensity of effects at each dose ranges; some users report overpowering effects at 50 mg, while others report feeling grounded at 100 mg. It can be taken orally or insufflated, or is sometimes smoked/vaporized (rare).
 
**DIPT Dosages**
**Oral**
- Threshold: 15 mg
- Light: 15 - 30 mg
- Common: 30 - 75 mg
- Strong: 50 - 150 mg
- Heavy: 120+ mg

## SYNTHESIS
A solution of 11 g indol-3-yl N,N-diisopropylglyoxylamide in 350 mL anhydrous dioxane was added, slowly, to 19 g LAH in 350 mL dioxane, which was well stirred and held at reflux temperature under an inert atmosphere. After the addition was complete, reflux was maintained for an additional 16 h, the reaction mixture cooled, and the excess hydride destroyed by the cautious addition of wet dioxane. The formed solids were removed by filtration, washed with hot dioxane, the filtrate and washings combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in anhydrous Et2O and saturated with anhydrous hydrogen chloride. There were formed crystals which were recrystallized from benzene/methanol to give 4.5 g (40%) of N,N-diisopropyltryptamine hydrochloride (DIPT) with a mp of 198â199 Â°C.

(from tryptamine) A solution of 1.60 g tryptamine base in 10 g melted sulfolane was treated with 8.5 g isopropyl iodide and 6.5 g diisopropylethyl amine, and held at steam bath temperature for 12 h with occasional shaking to mix the two phases. This mixture was then added to 100 mL H2O, and extracted with three 30 mL portions of hexane. These were combined and, after removal of the solvent under vacuum, the residue was distilled at the KugelRohr to give an off-white oil boiling at 170â185 Â°C at 0.05 mm/Hg weighing 1.37 g (56%) that spontaneously crystallized to a solid, mp 69â71 Â°C. Recrystallization of a sample from hexane produced a white product with a mp of 72â74 Â°C. IR (in cm-1): 742, 791, 1009, 1133, 1162, 1198. MS (in m/z): C7H16N+ 114 (100%); C4H10N+ 72 (38%); indolemethylene+ 130 (18%); parent ion 244 (<1%). A solution of 0.50 g of the free base in 2.5 mL isopropanol was treated with 0.5 mL concentrated HCl and slowly diluted with Et2O with good stirring. There was thus obtained, after filtering, washing and air drying, the hydrochloride salt with a mp of 192â193 Â°C. The infra-red spectrum of this salt was the same from either source; IR (in cm-1): 752, 773, 935, 972, 1138, 1183.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 25 mg, orally) âWithin the first hour I noted changes already, and my hand-writing became very poor. I cannot seem to measure the rate of the drugâs effects as there is no obvious window through which I am moving. Abrupt sounds have golden spikes attached to them as after-sounds, but I canât focus in on any other sensory changes. I moved into a completely quiet environment and there donât appear to be any effects of any kind. If I were deaf, this would have been an inactive compound. How many other drugs have appeared to be inactive because I didnât know where to look for effects?â

(with 50 mg, orally) âEverything was auditory, and I can only describe it with a â!ââ

(with 100 mg, orally) âNothing until 35 minutes when a definite change in hearing was observed. There was a decrease in high frequency acuity with an unusual tonal shift of all frequencies to a lower pitch. Voices sounded very similar to a single side-band radio signal which had been mistuned to the low side of the center frequency. All familiar sounds became foreign, including the chewing of food. No effects were noted with respect to clarity of speech, and both comprehension and interpretation were normal. Music was rendered completely disharmonious although single tones sounded normal. There were no changes in vision, taste, smell, appetite, vital signs, or motor coordination. The effects began to fade at four hours post ingestion, and were completely gone at eight hours. Mild diarrhea occurred from five to ten hours post-ingestion but was not a significant problem.â

(with 250 mg, orally) âShortly after I ingested the substance I heard a spirit say, âOnce in a lifetime.â She encouraged me to believe that I would have more life after the experience. But, there was a feeling of foreboding. The light was there, but DIPT was the body of Satan. The voices of people were extremely distortedâmales sounded like frogsâchildren sounded like they were talking through synthesizers to imitate outer space people in science fiction movies. In fact I felt that I was somehow sent into an anti-universe where everything looked the same as normal but was a cold and empty imitation. I felt I was a fallen angel.â

(with 8 mg, smoked) âIn four minutes I was aware of things going on, and by eight minutes, I was at a plus 2. My tongue was numb, and my ears felt plugged up although my hearing was keen and there was a background hissing sound.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
A physician friend of mine has expressed it using a neurological vocabulary: âIf it [the drug] delayed only the neural response to a stimulus, then pitch might have been shifted down, and yet harmony between notes should have been preserved. A variable delay related to the pitch of the stimulus would produce the disharmony but would not explain the preservation of normal relationship between single tones. It seems clear that this compound affects the auditory processing centers in the brain in a complex way which deserves further scientific study. The lack of significant toxic effects should make this compound useful for further studies.â

I am in absolute agreement. Here is a drug that goes directly after the hearing system, rather than the seeing system. Letâs stick a carbon 11 on one of those isopropyl groups, and see where the drug goes using the positron emission tomography camera. Will we highlight the auditory cortex? Or maybe some association area? But if we are indeed dealing only with musical pitch, not musical structure, there might be only a small part of that cortical region visible. This could well be a tool for two things. First, the localization of the pitch center in the brain. And second, it is a prototypic drug that might allow structural modification in several directions with several augmenting atoms. Some simple homologue might well have even more remarkable and specific properties. If you donât look, you wonât find.

I have been told by an adventurous graduate student that a study has been made with two subjects who had absolute pitch, employing a piano and a sine-wave generator as a sound source. He wanted to explore the possibility that some relationship could be developed between the pitch of the note provided and the apparent pitch of the note perceived. No meaningful relationship was found, except for the reinforcement that the observed drop in pitch was not linear, in that true distortion rather than simple pitch dropping was always observed. Most interesting was the plot of the error for each note against the elapsed time. This provided what could be seen as an almost-quantitative measurement of the drugâs intensity and chronology. Pretreatment with relatively small amounts of MDMA (35 milligrams, at between 1.5 and 2.5 hours before DIPT, at 55 milligrams) led to an exaggerated distortion, with an enhanced intensity that verged on being painful.

The homologue with only one isopropyl group on the nitrogen, N-isopropyltryptamine or NIPT IPT, has been made according to the same recipe, with the indol-3-yl N-isopropylglyoxalylamide (mp 199â200 Â°C from methanol) obtained in a 98% yield, and the amine hydrochloride (mp 245â246 Â°C from benzene/methanol) obtained in a 60% yield. The free base distilled at 130â140 Â°C at 0.1 mm/Hg to give a fraction that spontaneously crystallized to a very hard solid. MS (in m/z): C4H10N+ 72 (100%); indolemethylene+ 131 (60%), 130 (32%); parent ion 202 (3%). No active level has yet been found in man, to my knowledge.

**N,N-Diisopropyltryptamine** (also known as **Diisopropyltryptamine** and **DiPT** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is a structural analog of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and related to various psychedelic tryptamines such as [4-HO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DiPT) , [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) , and [MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MiPT) .

The first human trials of DiPT were undertaken in 1975 by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who would co-author and publish a paper detailing its synthesis and human psychopharmacology in 1981. A summary of the synthesis and reports of human use is included in Shulgin's 1997 book *[TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL)* ("Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved"). It has been sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) .

While most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) are known for producing vivid visual distortions, DiPT's effects are reported to be primarily auditory in nature. Anecdotal reports have described it causing a downward shift in perceived pitch and other unusual distortions. It has been suggested that DiPT may have value in neurological research due to its unique effects on auditory perception. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Additional [subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) of DiPT include a [body high](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations) , moderate [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , mild [visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting) , [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) , and [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of DiPT, and it has a limited history of human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

DiPT, or N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain.

DiPT also contains two isopropyl groups bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone. Isopropyl groups are a three carbon (propyl) chain bound at the middle carbon to the chemical structure. DiPT has substituted analogues such [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) .

DiPT is analogous to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , containing two isopropyl groups bound at R N instead of the two methyl groups found in [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) .

## Pharmacology

The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects of DiPT are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptor. DiPT also has notable binding affinities at the dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, and the serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine transport sites. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience remains subject to on-going scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

Although DiPT's effects are primarily auditory, some users have reported [lack of coordination or balance](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , [stomach bloating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_bloating) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , and visual [distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting) at higher doses. Aside from these, the most prevalent non-auditory effect is inner ear pressure (which has been painful in some instances such as when combined with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) ). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Auditory effects
 
- There is much speculation as to the nature of DiPT's aural distortion. At lower dosages, it has been reported to have an effect similar to a flanging, or a phase shift (Defined as an audio effect produced by mixing two identical sounds together, one sound delayed by a small amount with relation to the other). At medium and higher dosages, the effect of DiPT is typically a radical shift downward in perceived pitch. This shift also tends to be nonlinear in that the shift downwards varies in relation to the initial pitch, for example, higher pitches are not lowered as much as already low pitches. This can produce bizarre sounds and render music disharmonious or unrecognizable These auditory effects of DiPT are very apparent in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes: 
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**
- **[Tinnitus](/w/index.php?title=Tinnitus&action=edit&redlink=1)** - This is more common in quiet areas or is exaggerated whilst yawning. It does not necessarily hurt in the ears and the pitch and frequency are not as high and constant.
- **[Ear pressure](/w/index.php?title=Ear_pressure&action=edit&redlink=1)** - This effect is generally mild but has been painful in some cases. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of DiPT are reportedly very lucid and clear-headed in comparison to most other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) . 
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** - This effect is subjective and depends on the person and the perceived tunes.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Ego dissolution](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Visual effects
 
- The sensory effects of DiPT are mostly auditory, however it may still produce visual effects, in a similar fashion to other serotonergic psychedelics, especially at higher dosages These effects can include: 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )*
- **[Color enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Color_enhancement)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)** - The visual geometry produced by this compound can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** ### After effects
 
- The auditory effects of DiPT can last many times longer than it's cognitive, physical or visual effects. The auditory effects can also be retained for longer periods of time in a similar fashion to how one can not as easily forget something that has already been seen. Common after effects include: 
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**

## Research

One experiment involving subjects with perfect pitch indicated that there is no clear relationship between perceived pitch and actual pitch.

Although recent unpublished research has examined the role of DiPT in hearing perception in rodents, it is not clear that the auditory effect is preserved in nonhuman species; this finding indicates that DiPT does not produce effects similar to other tryptamine psychedelics such as DPT and 5-MeO-DMT in acoustic startle reflex paradigms. DiPT still remains widely unexplored.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DiPT do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because DiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried DiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

As with many psychedelics, the use of DiPT has the potential to bring about long-lasting perceptual and psychological alterations. DiPT is known to chronically alter the perception of sound and talking, which may not be suitable for everyone.

### Dependence and abuse potential

DiPT is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of DiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of DiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

- **Germany** : DiPT is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Latvia** : DiPT is a Schedule I controlled substance.
- **New Zealand** : DiPT is an analogue of DMT, so is a Class C controlled controlled substance in New Zealand.
- **Sweden** :Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying DiPT as a hazardous substance, on May 15, 2019.
- **Switzerland** : DiPT is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United Kingdom** : DiPT is a Class A controlled substance in the United Kingdom as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : DiPT is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) , a Schedule I compound under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or industrial intents and purposes could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act. 
- **Florida** : DiPT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida. It is illegal to buy, sell, or possess.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiPT*

Diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT), also known as N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family related to dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is unusual among psychedelics in that at usual doses it primarily or exclusively produces strong auditory changes, including decreased pitch, harmonic distortion, and sound unfamiliarity, but produces no other hallucinogenic effects such as visuals, other perceptual effects, or euphoria. However, the drug may produce more classically psychedelic effects at very high doses. It is taken orally, but can also be smoked.
The drug acts as a serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It has weak activity at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. DiPT does not appear to bind to the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor or to several other serotonin receptors. It produces psychedelic-like effects in animals, which appear to be mediated primarily by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation. The mechanisms by which DiPT produces selective auditory changes are unknown. Derivatives of DiPT include 4-HO-DiPT (iprocin) and 5-MeO-DiPT (foxy methoxy), among others.
DiPT was first described in the scientific literature by 1959. The basic properties of DiPT in humans were described by Alexander Shulgin in 1976 and its effects were described in detail by Shulgin in subsequent publications in the 1980s and in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). DiPT was encountered as a novel designer drug in 2005. However, it appears to be little-used recreationally compared to other psychedelic drugs, perhaps due to its unusual effects.

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin lists DiPT's dose range as 25 to 100 mg orally and its duration as 6 to 8 hours. In other publications however, he variably gives an effective dose range of 20 to 50 mg orally, a dose range of 40 to 100 mg orally, and a listed dose of 80 mg orally, as well as a shorter duration of 4 hours at lower doses and 5 hours at a higher dose. Per Shulgin, the full spectrum of effects of DiPT occur at a dose of 50 mg, while a dose of 80 mg has the same activity as a 50 mg dose and only results in an intensification of these effects. A wider recreational dose range for DiPT of 15 to 150 mg or more orally has also been reported, with a typical dose estimate of about 50 mg. According to Shulgin, testing of DiPT started at a dose of 0.5 mg and gradually titrated up in 9 human volunteers, with threshold effects occurring at a dose of 16 mg orally. There was also a report of 250 mg orally in TiHKAL, with apparently very strong effects. The onset of DiPT is 20 to 30 minutes or up to 1 hour, peak effects occur after 1.5 to 2 hours, and full effects last for 1 to 2 hours. In addition to oral administration, TiHKAL included a report of 8 mg DiPT smoked, with an onset of 4 to 8 minutes and a plus-two rating on the Shulgin Rating Scale.
In major contrast to most other known serotonergic psychedelics, which are primarily visual in their effects, the effects of DiPT are unusual in that they are primarily or exclusively auditory. It is said to produce remarkable and extraordinary changes to sound perception, for instance of voices and music. DiPT reduces the perceived pitch (frequency) of sounds, causing an unusual tonal shift of all frequencies to a lower pitch. It also causes distortion of pitch as well as of the timbre (tone quality) of sounds. As an example of its effects on pitch, DiPT makes peoples' voices sound much lower or deeper, like womens' voices being heard in bass tones or peoples' voices sound as if they have a bad cold. Voices are said to sound very similar to a single side-band radio signal being mistuned to the low side of the center frequency. Despite these changes however, there were no effects on clarity of speech, and speech comprehension and interpretation were described as normal.
DiPT makes music sound out of key and completely disharmonious, for instance piano playing sounding like a "bar-room disaster". However, single tones were said to sound normal aside from pitch changes. DiPT does not cause a simple, linear, or proportional decrease in pitch, but decreases pitch by a fixed value. As a result, proportionality is lost, in turn resulting in complete harmonic distortion, jarring distortions of harmonic intervals, and music feeling qualitatively "wrong". An analogy given for this was someone having their thumb on an LP record and making everything come out at a 50 to 75% speed. In terms of other sounds, telephone ringing sounds "partly underwater" with DiPT. The drug causes abrupt sounds to have "golden spikes" attached to them as "after-sounds". DiPT was reported to cause all familiar sounds to become foreign, even the mere chewing of food. Sounds are said to be perceived as amplified or more intense and there is said to be a decrease in high-frequency acuity. The auditory and harmonic distortion with DiPT is described as intense or extreme, even at relatively low doses like 40 mg orally. There is said to be variability between individuals in terms of the auditory effects of DiPT.
Shulgin felt that DiPT could potentially be a useful tool in scientific research on the auditory system. He speculated that it might be able to help locate the pitch center of the brain, for instance if used in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A small study involving DiPT administered to two people with perfect pitch was conducted and findings shared with Shulgin. It assessed whether there was some relationship between a note's pitch and the perceived pitch of the note. No meaningful relationship was found, except reinforcement of the notion that the pitch decrease with DiPT is not linear and that there is true distortion instead of a simple pitch drop. Interestingly, the plot of the error for each note against elapsed time provided an almost-quantitative measurement of DiPT's intensity and time-course of effects. In the same study, pre-treatment with low doses of MDMA resulted in exaggeration of auditory distortion with DiPT, including an enhanced sound intensity that verged on being painful. Aside from research on the auditory system, there has also been interest in DiPT in the study of music and language processing.
In terms of its psychedelic-type effects, DiPT is said to produce only auditory changes. One report observed auditory changes but no effects whatsoever in a quiet environment. The subject remarked that if they were deaf, they would have assumed that DiPT was an inactive compound. The drug is specifically said to produce no visual changes at all or that visual effects with it are non-existent. Relatedly, there was no visual distortion with DiPT at any time and there was no closed-eye imagery. The drug is said to lack the intense sensory disturbances or hallucinogenic effects characteristic of other psychedelics like dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and psilocybin. Relatedly, DiPT produces no changes in vision, taste, or smell. Additionally, it is said to produce little to no euphoria. Moreover, its experience was described as passive and neutral rather than as pleasant or unpleasant, or that it had a somewhat neutral–negative response. Because of its lack of classical psychedelic-like effects, some authors have gone so far as to conclude that DiPT "distorts auditory perception and does not produce psychedelic effects". Aside from hallucinogenic-related effects, DiPT is said to produce lethargy and a desire to lie down and remain that way, which are particularly prominent during the peak. It is also reported to cause distance between oneself and one's surroundings and/or feelings, with these effects neither being disturbing nor stimulating. Owing to its selective auditory effects, the outcomes of DiPT experiences may be less dependent on set and setting than those of other psychedelics.
The drug is said to be relatively free of autonomic side effects and toxicity indications. There are no changes in vital signs or motor coordination, although it was reported to cause handwriting impairment. It causes slight ear pressure as if the eustachian tubes are clogged. DiPT is also anecdotally claimed to produce tinnitus as a side effect. In addition, it causes mild diarrhea, mild nausea, muscular hyperreflexia, and slight pupil dilation. There were no changes in appetite and no sleep disruption.
Although DiPT produces selective auditory effects at typical doses, it appears to produce effects more similar to those of classical serotonergic psychedelics like LSD at higher doses. For example, in one report in TiHKAL that employed DiPT at a very high dose of 250 mg orally, the person described being spoken to and reassured by a "spirit", a feeling of foreboding, that "the light was there" but that DiPT was the "body of Satan", that they felt like they had been sent to an "anti-universe" where everything looked the same as normal but was a cold and empty imitation, and that they felt like a "fallen angel". In addition to these effects, the person reported very strong auditory effects, such as mens' voices sounding like frogs and children sounding like they were speaking through synthesizers to imitate outer-space people in science-fiction movies. While DiPT may be able to produce more classically psychedelic effects at high doses, the precise effective dose range for these effects is not well-defined.
Other tryptamines reported to cause DiPT-esque sound distortion have included 2-methyl-DMT, 2-methyl-DET, and 5-MeO-DiPT. Conversely, auditory changes or distortions with other psychedelics, including DMT, diethyltryptamine (DET), and ethylisopropyltryptamine (EiPT) among many others, are described as mild, rare, or absent. Similarly, auditory changes were not mentioned with methylisopropyltryptamine (MiPT) or 5-MeO-MiPT, except that these drugs produced enhanced auditory acuity and sound discrimination. Although both DiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT can produce notable changes in auditory perception, DiPT's effects in general are said to differ from those of 5-MeO-DiPT's in most respects. Moreover, 5-MeO-DiPT was reported to cause "some" musical sound distortion, specifically in terms of musical character and interpretation, but there were no apparent changes to harmonic structure in contrast to DiPT. Shulgin speculated that 2-methyl-DiPT could be an interesting compound in terms of attempting to develop another psychedelic specifically affecting the auditory system, but he did not synthesize or test it.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

DiPT binds to serotonin receptors including the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C receptors among others. It is known to act as a full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. The drug has weak activity at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. It is also a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In contrast to many related drugs, DiPT does not interact with the rodent or human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).
DiPT fully substitutes for dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and DOM and partially substitutes for LSD in rodent drug discrimination tests. Conversely, it does not substitute for cocaine, methamphetamine, or MDMA. When DiPT is used as the training drug, LSD, DOM, and MDMA fully substitute for DiPT while DMT only partially substitutes for DiPT and methamphetamine fails to substitute. Its stimulus properties in drug discrimination tests are partially blocked by the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist volinanserin and by the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB-242084. This is in contrast to the case of the related psychedelic DMT, wherein volinanserin fully blocks its stimulus properties and SB-242084 has minimal influence. Nonetheless, it was concluded that the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor primarily mediates the interoceptive effects of DiPT in rodents. Besides serotonin receptors, the metabotropic glutamate mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptor agonist LY-379268 had minimal effects on the stimulus properties of DiPT, whereas the mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptor antagonist LY-341495 potentiated DiPT discrimination.
Similarly to DMT and other psychedelics, DiPT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents, and this effect is blocked by volinanserin. In addition, DiPT produces hypolocomotion. The drug also produces convulsions at high doses in rodents.
The unique auditory effects of DiPT in humans have not yet been properly evaluated or demonstrated in animals.
Unusually among most psychedelics, DiPT did not show evidence of behavioral tolerance in rodents.

## Chemistry

DiPT, also known as N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, is a derivative of tryptamine formed by substituting isopropyl groups for the two hydrogen atoms attached to the non-aromatic nitrogen atom in the tryptamine molecule.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DiPT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of DiPT include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), diethyltryptamine (DET), dipropyltryptamine (DPT), diallyltryptamine (DALT), 5-MeO-DiPT, 4-HO-DiPT (iprocin), 5-HO-DiPT, 4-AcO-DiPT (ipracetin), 5,6-MDO-DiPT, methylisopropyltryptamine (MiPT), ethylisopropyltryptamine (EiPT), and propylisopropyltryptamine (PiPT), among others.

#### 2-Methyl-DiPT

2-Methyl-DiPT, the 2-methyl derivative of DiPT, was mentioned by Alexander Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) as a potentially interesting analogue of DiPT that might likewise produce selective auditory effects. This was based on findings that other 2-methylated tryptamines like 2-methyl-DMT and 2-methyl-DET have also uniquely been found to produce DiPT-like auditory effects. However, 2-methyl-DiPT is not known to have been synthesized or tested. A notable analogue of 2-methyl-DiPT is 2-methyl-iPALT.

## History

DiPT was first described in the scientific literature by R. B. Barlow and colleagues by 1959. Alexander Shulgin disclosed the basic properties of DiPT in humans in 1976 based on unpublished findings of his cited to 1974. Subsequently, Shulgin described DiPT, along with 5-MeO-DiPT, in much greater detail in a 1980 journal article. He also described it in further detail in other articles published in the 1980s, as well as in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). DiPT was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2005. However, DiPT appears to be relatively little used recreationally compared to other psychedelic drugs. This may be related to its unusual effects, including lacking the typical recreational effects associated with psychedelic drugs.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United Kingdom

As is the case with many psychedelic tryptamines and phenethylamines, it is Class A in the UK, making it illegal to possess or use.

#### United States

DiPT is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it could be considered an analog of 5-MeO-DiPT, in which case purchase, sale, or possession for human consumption or illicit use that is not for scientific or industrial purposes could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act. Some of the people arrested in Operation Web Tryp were selling DiPT, however the drug is not explicitly forbidden or outlawed.
However the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) withdrew a proposal to ban five psychedelic substances including 4-Hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (4-OH-DiPT), N-Isopropyl-5-Methoxy-N-Methyltryptamine (5-MeO-MiPT) and N,N-Diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT). DEA withdrew the proposed listing as schedule 1 banned substance after a public hearing in 2022.

##### Florida

"DiPT (N,N-Diisopropyltryptamine)" is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.

#### Sweden

Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying DiPT as a hazardous substance, on May 15, 2019.
