## Subjective Experience

Cebil seeds have been used ritually as a hallucinogen in South America for at least
4,500 years, with some astonishing historical finds having been uncovered indicating
a rich and profound cultural influence.

The seeds are generally used as snuff, although they can be smoked. For the former,
the procedure to produce the requisite powder is relatively straight forward, and I
followed the widely cited instructions as closely as possible.

I toasted half-a-dozen in a pan until they snapped like popcorn. I then removed the
brittle shells and pulverised the kernel. I sampled this raw, and also, mixed it with
some lime powder.

Make no mistake about it, the snort was painful. Indeed, it was eye wateringly
painful. However, the psychedelic headspace which this induced was real, and simple
line based CEV patterns and constructs were very evident. Disappointingly, this was
fleeting and short lived.

I also tried smoking, via a pipe, but the outcome proved to be even less intense.

I feel that this deserves a lot more experimentation, and given the time, I fully intend
to revisit.
