## Subjective Experience

This is frequently used as a mix with cannabis, generally instead of tobacco.
However, it is occasionally reported that when smoked alone it does have a gentle
calmative effect.

Contrary to expectation, this was indeed my own experience. Although it was
certainly nothing to write home about, there was a mild relaxing edge there,
somewhere. I should stress that mild is the operative word.

SAFETY WARNING
I have encountered claims that lavender is sometimes treated with toxic chemicals by
horticulturist vendors to preserve colour/odour. Particular care should therefore be
taken with respect to sourcing.
