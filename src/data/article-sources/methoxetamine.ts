**Methoxetamine (MXE)** or **3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE** is a chemical of the arylcyclohexylamine class which acts as hallucinogenic dissociative.

This substance was originally developed as a research chemical through the use of intelligent drug design. An interesting and detailed interview with the anonymous chemist who invented this substance can be found [here](http://www.vice.com/read/interview-with-ketamine-chemist-704-v18n2). It is a chemical derivative of Ketamine that also contains structural features of phencyclidine (PCP) and 3-MeO-PCP.

MXE has almost no history of human usage prior and was first identified by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which monitors the Internet for new psychoactive substances within the European Union, in November 2010. By July 2011, they had identified 58 websites selling the compound, at a cost of 145–195 euros for 10 grams. Today it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors.

In terms of its chemistry, MXE is classed as an arylcyclohexylamine drug. The Ar group is methoxybenzene in MXE. The nitrogen has one substituted ethyl group and there is an acetyl group attached at carbon R2.

In terms of its pharmacology, MXE acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist. NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurones in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. NMDA receptor antagonists close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurones leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually the famous “[hole](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)”.

MXE also acts as a dopamine-reuptake inhibitor and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with µ-opioid affinity and typical dissociative effects. This provides an explanation for its euphoric and often stimulating effects.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical effects:
**

The subjective physical effects of MXE can be broken down into nine components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Tactile disconnection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The MXE body high is a sharp, pleasurable tingling sensation which is location specific to the hands, feet and head.
- **[Tactile suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - This partially to entirely suppresses one’s own sense of touch, creating feelings of numbness within the extremities. It is responsible for the anaesthetic properties of this substance.
- **[Physical autonomy](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**
- **[Motor control loss](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside of balance and coordination is prevalent within MXE and becomes especially strong at higher dosages. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset (unless they are experienced) in case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **[Euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This results in feelings of physical euphoria which range between mild pleasure to powerful all-encompassing bliss.
- **[Decreased bodily weight](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_bodily_weight)** - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become entirely weightless. This effect is strangely stimulating and encourages physical activities at low to moderate dosages by making the body feel light and effortless to move.
- **[Dizziness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Although uncommon, some people report dizziness under the influence of MXE.
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - It’s worth noting that high dose MXE trips can sometimes result in nausea and vomiting at the peak of trip. For most people, this is surprisingly not as unpleasant as they would initially expect due to the accompanying detachment from the physical senses.

**Cognitive effects:**

The general head space of MXE is often described as particularly euphoric and clear headed in comparison to that of DXM and Ketamine. The specific cognitive effects can be broken down into 8 separate subcomponents which are listed and described below:

- **[Consciousness disconnection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Consciousness_disconnection)**
- **[Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)**
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Introspection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**
- **[Deja-Vu](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deja-Vu)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Direct communication with the subconscious](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Direct_communication_with_the_subconscious)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

**Visual effects:**

*Suppression*

This substance does not enhance visual stimuli; instead it tends to degrade and decrease visual aptitude in a variety of ways which generally includes:

- **[Visual disconnection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This eventually results in the MXE’s equivalent of the famous “K-hole” or more specifically, *[holes, space and voids](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)* alongside of *[structures](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures)*.
- **[Visual acuity suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)**
- **[Double vision](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This component is prevalent at moderate to heavy dosages and makes reading impossible unless one closes an eye.
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)** - This effect generally occurs at higher dosages and makes one unable to recognize and interpret perceivable visual data.

*Distortions*

MXE exhibits a full array of dissociative distortions and alterations in visual perception which generally includes:

- **[Perspective distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Environmental cubism](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_cubism)**
- **[Environmental orbism](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_orbism)**
- **[Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**

*Geometry*

The [visual geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) found within MXE can be described as very dark and bland when compared to that of Ketamine or DXM and often consists of many tiny interlocking and woven lines. It does not extend beyond level 4 and can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as simplistic in complexity, algorithmic in style, synthetic in feel, unstructured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in depth and consistent in intensity.

*Hallucinatory states*

At high dosages, MXE can produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that that is less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects include:

- **[External hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations)** (*[Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)*, *[Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)*, *[Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alterations_in_perspective)* and *[Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)*) - In comparison to other dissociatives, this effect can occur at heavy dosages but is extremely infrequent in comparison to the same effect found within deliriants. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. The most common theme for this effect to follow is one of experiencing and talking to friends around oneself when they are not actually present.
- **[Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** (*[Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)*, *[Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)*, *[Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alterations_in_perspective)* and *[Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)*) - In comparison to other dissociatives, this effect can occur at heavy dosages but is considerably less common than the same effect found within psychedelics and deliriants. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, fixed in style, equal in new experiences and memory replays in content, autonomous in controllability and solid in style.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of MXE are common in their occurrence and exhibit a range of effects which commonly includes:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**

**Potential health effects, addiction and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational MXE use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because MXE is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried MXE within the community confirm that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

In terms of MXE tolerance, this can take weeks to build up for some, but for others it can take a single night of heavy use. Once a physical tolerance to MXE has set itself in, it can often take a month or more to reset itself.

MXE has a fairly high potential to be abused. It does not seem to physically addictive, but can become habit-forming as there is no real tolerance attributed to this drug, meaning that it could potentially be used multiple days in a row if somebody chooses to do so. There have been multiple reports across the internet of people becoming seriously addicted daily users of this substance so serious precautions and considerations should be taken before trying this substance.

Reports of compulsive redosing during high dose trips resulting in overdoses have also been reported. This can be prevented by keeping MXE far away from oneself when tripping. Addiction can be avoided by manually limiting one’s usage of the drug. It’s worth noting, however, that as with most hallucinogens, most users note that the desire to use them can actually decrease with use.

In terms of its long term health effects, when used repeatedly and with excess for extended periods of time, MXE seems to exhibit almost identical bladder and urinary tract problems to those found within Ketamine but to a lesser extent. This is because MXE is 4 times as potent as ketamine so significantly less of drug needs to be consumed. Symptoms of Ketamine-induced cystitis can become extremely serious and can described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden, compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

All of these, however, can easily be avoided by simply not using MXE on a daily or even weekly basis and manually limiting your usage of the substance.

**Legal Issues:**

- **Germany:** Possession, production and sale is illegal.
- **Japan:** Possession, production and sale is illegal.
- **Russia:** Possession, production and sale is illegal.
- **Switzerland:** Possession, production and sale is illegal.
- **UK:** MXE is a Class B drug.

Elsewhere in the world, however, MXE is completely uncontrolled and unscheduled. If you want to try this substance, a quick google search for the term “MXE vendor”, “methoxetamine vendor” or other similar phrases is usually sufficient to find a supplier in the top 3 or 4 links. It is also freely available in any desired quantity in the countries of which it has been made illegal, you just have to search a little harder.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, MXE is one hell of a drug. It is an extremely weird trip and not for the faint-hearted. It is, in my opinion, the most genuinely interesting research chemical created so far, taking its users to impossibly deep states of detachment and incredibly rich hallucinations. MXE is capable of taking people to worlds so unlike anything found within psychedelics yet still freely available across the internet through grey market research chemical vendors.

It is definitely worth noting, however, that MXE does have a dark side to it with potentially addictive effects for those who are lacking in self-control; it can easily be abused.`,

## Subjective Experience

MXE began to appear on the markets at the end of 2010, and was to become popular
in a relatively short space of time. It has recently acquired something of a cult status;
due in part to production being banned at source (China), causing it to became
increasingly difficult to obtain.

At time of writing, its legal status in the United States is unclear, noting that it could
be considered to be an analogue of PCE or ketamine. In the UK it was the subject of a
TCDO in April 2012, and was classified in February of the following year. I was
fortunate to have obtained a sample just a few days prior to this ban.

This was one of my first dissociative adventures, and given its sudden disappearance
from the market, my only one with this chemical.

My regret in this context is that I was not able to explore it more deeply, as it was a
very positive experience.

Dissociation was not something I approached lightly, and I had read a number of
horror stories of people mixing dissociatives with alcohol. I was therefore a little
nervous in shovelling perhaps half of my 50mg supply down the hatch.

The action took just a short while to commence: considerably less than an hour.
However, as one of the first manifestations was to alleviate my anxiety, the rest of the
pill was rapidly consumed. For a period though, there was still a slightly scary edge to
proceedings, as everything around me was becoming rather strange.

What followed was a positively charged dissociation, under a mindset of the world
around me not being normal, and my perspective not being quite with it in this
realm. Weird is such a lame word to use, but it does capture the essence of the ride.
At the same time, I was absolutely comfortable with this.

I felt strangely high but not tuned in. I was able to fall into a period of introspection,
but also able to focus upon, for example, academic related pursuits on the Internet.
This was indeed significantly different to other forms of intoxication.

There was an Alice in Wonderland edge to life: I was fully conscious and aware
whilst everything around me had warped slightly, giving it an alien feel. I had
retained all my marbles, my clarity and my rationality, but I was witnessing reality as
though I wasn’t fully in it. Certainly, I enjoyed it.

Another positive came in the aftermath: I suffered no hangover or noticeable come-
down, with a mild afterglow lasting a day or two. I was sorry not to have sampled it
earlier.

\`\`\`
MXE became the subject of the usual sort of adverse media reporting

DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of methoxetamine are usually compared to [ketamine](https://erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/) or [tiletamine](https://erowid.org/pharms/tiletamine) , but there are too few experience reports with reliably sourced material to say much with confidence. Only a few reports of individuals taking a single measured dose of verified methoxetamine by itself are available. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 It is not yet known how addictive or likely methoxetamine is to cause compulsive use. Many reports describe it as "more-ish", indicating it might induce compulsive re-dosing in some users. Because its use is so new and uncommon, no definitive statements about it can yet be made.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[50 mg insufflated, repeated] "[...] over the next hour I started drifting a bit, some mild dissociation, kinda like K but different, warm opiate effects becoming quite pronounced. [...] A lot like K but really quite different at the same time. [...] At some point after that second line, the Mrs decided (knowing what I'm like) to hide the rest of the bag from me so I didn't keep sniffing it, which for what its worth was a good call on her part but did mean that I spent most of the next hour looking for it and repeatedly asking her where it was and if it was safe." -- [Exp 88687](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=88687)
 
[insufflated, repeated] "After about 15 minutes or so, I felt incredibly warm, fuzzy, and somewhat disconnected from my body. I had never done dissociatives except for DXM, so for me this was a new feeling. I laid in my bed relaxing and listening to ambient music, watching images in my head of early Sociologial Theorists doing comical acts. As the initial rush/experience wore off, I noticed I could walk around my room but I was robot-like. All my actions were first calculated and thought of in my head, and no unnecessary actions were made. I thought that this must be what it is like to be an android. My field of vision was very bright, and intense, the colors were very vibrant and it was hard to focus on any one thing. Its what I eventually started to call MXE Vision." -- [Exp 89488](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89488)
 
[10mg + 40mg insufflated] "During peak, I was not able to think clearly, an effect similar to a lot of alcohol or Kratom. Body felt light, but not comfortable. [...] Thoughts were disintegrated, I lost sense of space and laid down on the floor, waiting for it to happen. I listened to music (I tried to play, which was very difficult), but I did not find it enjoyable or interesting at all. [...] To me, it was much different than Ketamine, sort of pushing all the buttons, having something from opiates, from ket and from alcohol, which is something I do not prefer. I like clear mind that allows me to explore, not a state where I can hardly enjoy hallucinations and take something from it. For me, it was just wasted time. Not enjoyable, though not 'bad' per-se. I did not feel depressed, sad or very nauseated. Just in a place not rewarding in any way." -- [Exp 90235](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=90235)
 
[26mg + 16mg insufflated] "The time was at about 2.30 at this point and I was becoming aware that I was entering into a distinctly psychedelic, hallucinogenic experience." -- [Exp 89972](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89972)
 
[repeated, insufflated] "This stuff isn't like ketamine in the sense that, with ketamine, I can return to near normality within half hour to an hour. I was ruined for about 24 hours. I had extremely intense closed eye visuals for the whole time, was unable to sleep for the best part of 2 days. Walking was possible but after lying down for a while my balance was destroyed. Speech still slurred. A complete lack of understand of words/numbers/equations etc. anything that was remotely lingual was virtually impossibly to comprehend. " -- [Exp 90919](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=90919)

Doses reported by different users vary by a large amount, with some users reporting very strong effects from 50mg insufflated (heavy motor impairment, out of body experiences, etc), while others report 50mg insufflated causes much lighter effects (able to walk around mostly unimpaired, able to carry on lucid conversations, etc). 
 
 Many users find themselves taking two or more doses in a session/day. 
 
 Methoxetamine is a dissociative ketamine analog. It is most often found in powder form that is taken nasally, orally, injected intramuscalarly (IM), or used sublingually/buccaly. We have received two descriptions that sublingual is more potent than insufflated/intranasal, which is unusual for a drug, so we have updated the dosages to increase insufflated dosages, but this is all very tentative. 
 
 A number of reports indicate that oral dosages are similar to insufflated and buccal. Oral dosages for most drugs are normally higher (requiring more material to achieve the same effect), so this is an unusual result that will need to be confirmed over time and a larger number of uses.
 
NOTES #
 
Some reports for methoxetamine may actually describe the ingestion of other substances that have been misrepresented as methoxetamine, complicating its profile.

U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Methoxetamine**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I
 
Methoxetamine was uncontrolled in the US until July 6, 2022, when it was added to Schedule I, the most restrictive list of drugs in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license. 
 
 Methoxetamine is not a clear analog of any Schedule I or II controlled substance and is therefore not a controlled substance Analogue under the [U.S. Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/law_fed_analog_act) .
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Alabama #
 
Effective Jan 21, 2015, the Alabama State Board of Health added Methoxetamine to Schedule I. See [https://www.adph.org/publications/assets/ControlledSubstancesList.pdf](https://www.adph.org/publications/assets/ControlledSubstancesList.pdf) . (thanks n) (last updated Apr 10 2015)

(This was originally just a reddit post but I am sharing it here for posterity)

People talk about MXE in the forlorn terms they would discuss a former lover, or an immense fish that had just eluded their grasp after hours of fighting.

And its no wonder! I was fortunate to catch MXE at the tail end of its existence, fairly early on in my psychonautic career. It was the first dissociative I had tried after the standard DXM/Ketamine. It was miraculous to me, that a chemical could make me feel this way, that a single substance could do so much and go so far. And this was with the 2015 china batches, not even the mythical pre-ban UK stuff that had driven the drug's popularity. Nonetheless, it shaded my later explorations into the world of dissociatives and I, like many, found myself chasing that same experience with other substances. But perhaps this has been in folly- I believe there is a lot more that the world of dissociatives has to offer and we are limiting ourselves in our dedication to this single compound.

So what made [MXE](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=108601) so great? Drawing from memories 5 years ago and the bit of experiences I racked up before it was gone forever, it was insightful, introspective, extremely euphoric, bright and visual with a deep and spectacular hole at higher doses, and a lovely sociable stimulation at lower doses. It was firmly hallucinogenic, had a psychedelic edge that many dissociatives were lacking, and most of all it was versatile- a colorful and fabulous party or club drug, great for dancing or hanging out, but with seemingly endless depth if you wanted to push your doses higher and meditate in its grand cathedral sans body. Most of all, was a quality many users describe as “magic”- that sense of wonder you get when you take it, the rush and the thrill and a sensation that “yes”, this is right, this is exactly where you need to be. It almost brought me to tears. Because few other novel dissociatives were available concurrently with MXE, I did not have much opportunity to see how it fared in combination with other dissos.

Since its untimely demise, the novel psychoactive substance market has attempted many times to capitalize on its mythical status- a number of drugs that have been developed since then were advertised in terms of their similarity to MXE, oftentimes with nonsensical naming conventions in an attempt to draw that association. Here’s my brief summary and comparison of a number of them

Something else that has stood out about MXE is its near-universal appeal- while not everyone loved it, a significant amount of people did. Perhaps it was this consistency that built such a strong reputation for it. Opinions on many of these other compounds vary wildly, some finding certain ones boring or uncomfortable which others find exciting or even use as a drug of choice. So take my opinions with a grain of salt here and delve into others' experiences.

-[MXM](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=107738) (Methoxmetamine, 3-MeO-2’-Oxo-PCM): This doesn’t really count, as it existed concurrently with MXE. It probably didn’t catch on as it was overshadowed by its more potent and widely available PCE homologue. It always had limited availability and disappeared entirely from the market around the same time MXE did. Nonetheless, out of all the compounds in this post, this one probably came the closest to the real deal in terms of effects. I admittedly had limited experience, and only tried it in high doses, but the hole carried that same rush, that same sense of wonder and euphoria. It dosed higher- with desired effects coming in at 70 mg. It only worked sublingual or oral too, which may have drained some of its appeal. Still, beggars can’t be choosers, if this one had come onto the scene a year later than it did perhaps it would’ve caught on more. I think it’s certainly worth revisiting.

-[MXP](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=110086) (Methoxphenidine, 2-MeO-Diphenidine): Also doesn’t count, for a number of reasons- it also existed at the same time as MXE, and it’s not even an arylcyclohexylamine. Nonetheless, its name has led to a great deal of confusion. I don’t even think it was intended as an MXE mimic, MXP just seemed like the natural way to abbreviate Methoxphenidine. It wasn’t the same at all- only dosed orally and very high, had a neutral buzzing sinking hole, functional to a degree but oddly sedating too. A unique and fun drug, but not anything like MXE. Also had an odd tolerance buildup and gave a week long cross tolerance to other dissociatives.

-[DCK](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=107832) (Deschloroketamine, 2’-Oxo-PCM): This first popped up on the market shortly after MXE’s demise. All of its naming conventions bother me- first they tried to run with “DXE”, the only thing this molecule has in common with MXE is that they are arylcyclohexylamines. I’m glad that name didn’t stick. Even the DCK name is misleading, as ketamine is defined by its presence of a chlorine and oxygen. O-PCM would be a fine name for this one, but I digress. This one was cognitively quite similar to MXE at hole doses- the hole had a similar rush, a similar magic, a similar degree of visuals and intensity. DCK however is significantly more sedating, with a lazy draining couch lock in the hole that persists as an irritating immobility after the effects wear off, a feeling of haven just woken up, but lasting for hours. At lower doses it is more like low doses of regular ketamine, once again lacking a lot of the stimulation and vibrancy of MXE. It became an appealing drug in its own right eventually, suffered a hiatus, but made a comeback recently.

There was a lull in the development of MXE-like drugs for a few years, with lots of fun variations into different arylcyclohexylamines that would help establish a lexicon for which substitutions accomplished which effects- we were blessed with mass market availability of compounds like 3-MeO-PCE, O-PCE, 3-HO-PCE, 3-HO-PCP, and 2F-DCK. Rumors abounded of “HXE”, a 3-HO-2’-Oxo-PCE, which makes perfect sense as a supposedly interesting compound from a design standpoint, though it seems very few have actually been able to experience it. Then in 2019, interest in chasing the “next MXE” suddenly ratcheted back up, with the idea to place the “MXE substitutions” (that being the combined 3-MeO-2’-Oxo moieties) on other base compounds. The first one, seen in late 2019, was MXPr.

-[MXPr](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=113789) (Methoxpropamine, 3-MeO-2’-Oxo-PCPr): This was the first PCPr compound seen on the market. Strapping the MXE substitutions to it seemed like a pretty safe bet to delve into this new base structure, though other substitutions on PCPr are certainly active in vitro. Being billed as the next MXE, MXPr was found to be ultimately disappointing to many. It has a short duration, a shallow headspace, and doses pretty high. Nonetheless, I found it to be remarkably visual in proportion to its other effects. It had a dull comedown that left me feeling dazed and useless, not particularly exciting. It really shined in combination with other substances however, adding extra dissociation and color so long as the other compound had sufficient stimulant properties. It is particularly miraculous when combined with 3-MeO-PCE.

-[MXiPr](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=114917)(Methoxisopropamine, 3-MeO-2’-Oxo-PCPr): Like MXPr, this was the first compound to hit the market based on the PCiPr structure, another one that offers a potentially interesting base for other compounds. As the name implied, it has also been billed as “the next MXE”, and has proven to be a unique and interesting compound in its own right. At high doses, the hole is delightful, colorful, euphoric and exhilarating and quite stimulating, and might I even say ‘magical’. The comedown is stimulating and psychedelic. It has a shorter duration and higher dose than MXE however, and at lower doses it is fairly uninteresting and lacking in energy.

-[DMXE](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/11/dmxe.html) (Deoxymethoxetamine, 3-Me-2’-Oxo-PCE): Another silly name. Call it Methyloxetamine if you really need to, like MeXE idk, its good to stick to conventions. That aside, this has proven to be one of the more exciting compounds to come out since 2019, I’m currently drafting a report. I finished the report! What MXiPr lacks in stimulating euphoria and rush, this drug has in spades. Lower doses are fun, dancey, active, social and exciting. Higher doses can allow you to sink into a hole though it remains fairly functional otherwise. The comedown is similarly stimulating and psychedelic and pleasant. It lacks the weight and vivid intensity of MXE but is a thrill in its own special way. My only gripes are the fairly high dosage, close to that of MXPr and MXiPr, and the short duration, also similar to aforementioned compounds. I would say this is the closest to actual MXE of the compounds that have been developed since its demise.

I have not yet had the opportunity to try either DMXE or MXiPr in combination with other drugs. I’m a busy bug.

So there our quest should end, many of the structural analogues to MXE have been exhausted and there are new horizons to look towards as far as dissociative development is concerned. Perhaps we should not be chasing this high anymore, but looking for new and exciting effects in the world of dissociatives- perhaps something more miraculous, more magical and exciting and potentially even useful and therapeutic is hiding out there, waiting to be discovered.

There’s three directions we can go- We have now demonstrated that we can reliably predict how modifications at the nitrogen are active, how various substitutions will remain active, and how various alterations of the aromatic ring remain active. [I wrote a whole long thing about this,](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/10/new-drugs-designing-novel.html) but I’ll summarize some of what I think is most relevant.

In altering the amine- We know that everything from a methyl through various butyl alterations are active and interesting, especially thanks to the development of MXPr and MXiPr. Various ring structures are interesting too- from PCPy to PCMo or perhaps a PCTMo. Riskier attempts can be made with the poorly studied alkoxyamines, (pretty much just your basic carbon chain with an oxygen stuck in there somewhere). An allyl also remains active. From here, you can strap on all sorts of the familiar proven substitutions and modifications (eg. 3-Me, 3-MeO, 4-MeO, 3-HO, 3-F, 3-Cl, 2’-Oxo), to attain a plethora of possible effects. The possibilities are really endless and restricted by synthesis! The closer it is to a familiar structure (Say, 3-MeO-PCM, or 3-HO-PCPr), the more predictable it is that the compound will be active, interesting, and sufficiently potent. I personally would love to see 3-MeO-PCM, 3-MeO-PCiPr, 3-Cl-PCE and 3-Me-PCE to start with, though more exciting and “out there” variations would be lovely to see too.

In playing around with substitutions- I rattled off some of the tried and true options- 3-Me, 3-MeO, 4-MeO, 3-HO, 3-F, 3-Cl, 2’-Oxo, alone or in combination (among some other more obscure ones that may work), but perhaps it’s time to try new substitutions, on a more familiar base, such as PCP or PCE. You can take that familiar alkane chain and seemingly keep expanding it, though you lose some potency as it gets bigger. So this would be -Et, -Pr, iPr, -EtO, -PrO and iPrO substitutions. Other possible options are thioalkanes, (say an MeO group with a sulfur instead of the oxygen), or halogens- F- and Cl- have been demonstrated to be active, how would a Br or I behave? The most activity and potency is retained with substitutions on the 3- position of the aromatic ring. On the cyclohexane, any variety of substitutions may help or hurt- its not entirely known yet. Meanwhile, if the amine is a ring structure, that can also see substitutions, which appear most effective on the carbon furthest from the nitrogen, in the case of PCP that would be the 4 position.

Lastly, you can swap in various aromatic rings in place of the usual phenyl- a thiophene actually increases potency, Yielding the TCx family of compounds. Perhaps a furan or a benzyl group would work too.

The thing is, we really don’t know what will be active until we try, the possibilities are truly endless and so many dissociatives are unique and amazing in their own right without having to have their designed constrained by their similarity to the legendary MXE. Perhaps it has gone to rest to leave us to come up with something better after all~`,

**3-MeO-2'-Oxo-PCE** (commonly known as **Methoxetamine** , **MXE** , **Mexxy** , among others) is a [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) substance of the [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) class that produces [ketamine-like](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is structurally related to [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , [PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCE) , and [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) .

MXE was originally developed through the use of intelligent drug design, as a potential treatment for [Phantom Limb Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_pain) among other ailments.

MXE had no documented history of human usage until it was first identified by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in November 2010. By July 2011, they had identified 58 websites selling the compound at the cost of 145–195 euros for 10 grams. Once highly popular, it is now thought to be extinct on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market due to the global ban of the drug.

Limited data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MXE in humans, and it has a limited history of human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Methoxetamine, or (RS)2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone, is classed as an [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) . Arylcyclohexylamines are named for their structures which include a cyclohexane ring bound to an aromatic ring along with an amine group.

MXE contains a phenyl ring with a methoxy (CH 3 -O-) substituent at R 3 bonded to a cyclohexane ring substituted at R 2 with an oxo group (cyclohexanone). Bound to the same location (R 1 ) of the cyclohexanone ring is an amino ethyl chain -N-CH 2 CH 3 .

MXE is a chiral molecule that is often produced as a racemate, although batches of its stereo-exclusive isomers have occasionally been produced and distributed.

## Pharmacology

MXE acts as a non-competitive [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) - [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_Inhibitor) . NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually an almost identical equivalent of the famous “ [k-hole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-hole) .” MXE was reported to be similar to [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , despite being stronger and having a longer duration.

Because of its structural similarity to [3-HO-PCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-HO-PCP) , it was falsely believed to carry [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) properties. This claim cannot be supported by actual data, instead showing only insignificant affinity for the µ-opioid receptor by the substance itself, although in-vivo metabolites could yield different effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)**
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The MXE "body high" can be described as a sharp, pleasurable tingling sensation which is location specific to the hands, feet, and head.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become entirely weightless. This effect is strangely stimulating and encourages physical activities at low to moderate doses by making the body feel light and effortless to move.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside balance and coordination is prevalent within MXE and becomes especially strong at higher doses. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset (unless experienced) in the case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)**
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - This partially to entirely suppresses one's sense of touch, creating feelings of numbness within the extremities. It is responsible for the anesthetic properties of this substance.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Physical autonomy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Although uncommon, some people report dizziness under the influence of MXE.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - High dose MXE experience can sometimes result in nausea and vomiting at the peak of the trip. For most people, this is surprisingly not as unpleasant as they would initially expect due to the accompanying detachment from the physical senses.
- **[Optical sliding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Optical_sliding)**
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)** & **[Orgasm enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_enhancement)** - Orgasm enhancement can sometimes also be present, even at higher doses, although this effect is not reliable. ### Disconnective effects
 
- - **[Tactile disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This eventually results in MXE's equivalent of the "k-hole" or more specifically, *[holes, spaces and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)* alongside of *[structures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures)* .
- **[Consciousness disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Consciousness_disconnection)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Suppression
 
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)**
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This component is prevalent at moderate to heavy doses and makes reading impossible unless one closes an eye.
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)** - This effect generally occurs at higher doses and makes one unable to recognize and interpret perceivable visual data.
- **[Frame rate suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frame_rate_suppression)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Environmental cubism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_cubism)**
- **[Environmental orbism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_orbism)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry found within MXE can be described as very dark and bland when compared to that of [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) and often consists of many tiny interlocking and woven lines. It does not extend beyond level 4 and can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as simplistic in complexity, algorithmic in style, synthetic in feel, unstructured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, multicolored in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity.
 
High doses entering the "hole" can yield a white glow visual phenomena like ketamine.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
At high doses, MXE can produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects include:
 
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , this effect can occur at heavy doses, but is considerably less common than the same effect found within [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, fixed in style, equal in new experiences and memory replays in content, autonomous in controllability and solid in style.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , this effect can occur at heavy doses, but is extremely infrequent in comparison to the same effect found within [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. The most common theme for this effect to follow is one of experiencing and talking to friends when they are not actually present. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The general head space of MXE is often described as particularly euphoric and clear-headed in comparison to that of [DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) and [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . The specific cognitive effects can be broken down into several separate subcomponents which are listed and described below: 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational MXE use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown.

This is because MXE is a research chemical with a very brief history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried MXE suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other NMDA receptor antagonists, the chronic use of MXE can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of producing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of MXE develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

MXE presents cross-tolerance with all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , meaning that after the consumption of MXE all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) will have a reduced effect.

### Urinary tract effects

In terms of its long-term health effects when used repeatedly and excessively for extended periods of time, MXE seems to exhibit almost identical bladder and urinary tract problems to those found within [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , but to a lesser extent. This is because MXE is four times as potent as ketamine, so significantly less of drug needs to be consumed. Symptoms of ketamine-induced cystitis can become extremely serious and can be described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden, compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

All of these, however, can easily be avoided by simply not using MXE on a daily or even weekly basis and manually limiting one's usage of the substance.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **DOx** - As an NMDA antagonist MXE potentiates DOx which can be unpleasantly intense.
- **25x-NBOMe** - As an NMDA antagonist MXE potentiates NBOMes which can be unpleasantly intense.
- **2C-T-x**
- **PCP** - There are no reports available about this combination.
- **Amphetamines** - Risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **MDMA** - There have been reports of risky serotonergic interactions when the two are taken at the same time, but MXE taken to the end of an MDMA experience does not appear to cause the same issues.
- **Cocaine** - Stimulants taken with MXE can lead to hypermanic states much more easily, especially if sleep is avoided.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess.
- **SSRIs** - Depending on the SSRI this combination can be unpredictable.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors appear to increase the potency of MXE. MAO-A inhbitors have some negative reports associated with the combination but there isn't much information available.
- **ΑMT**
- **Alcohol** - There is a high risk of memory loss, vomiting and severe ataxia from this combination.
- **GHB** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **GBL** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **Opioids** - This combination can potentiate the effects of the opioid.
- **Tramadol**

## Interactions

### ⚠️ Dangerous
- **alcohol**: There is a high risk of memory loss, vomiting and severe ataxia from this combination.
- **amt**
- **ghb/gbl**: Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the individual falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **opioids**: This combination can potentiate the effects of the opioid
- **tramadol**

### ⚡ Caution
- **2c-t-x**
- **amphetamines**: Risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states
- **benzodiazepines**: Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place the affected individual in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess.
- **cocaine**: Stimulants taken with MXE can lead to hypermanic states much more easily, especially if sleep is avoided.
- **dox**: As an NMDA antagonist MXE potentiates DOx which can be unpleasantly intense
- **mdma**: There have been reports of risky serotonergic interactions when the two are taken at the same time, but MXE taken to the end of an MDMA experience does not appear to cause the same issues.
- **nbomes**: As an NMDA antagonist MXE potentiates NBOMes which can be unpleasantly intense
- **pcp**: There are no reports available about this combination
- **ssris**: Depending on the SSRI this combination can be unpredictable

  "tripsit-wiki": `# Methoxetamine

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Methoxetamine*

**Methoxetamine** (MXE, 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE) is a near chemical analogue of [Ketamine](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Ketamine) and [PCP](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/PCP). It was first publicly reported in 2010. Some say it's similar to Ketamine or high doses of DXM. Methoxetamine differs from many dissociatives such as ketamine and phencyclidine that were developed as pharmaceuticals in that it was designed specifically for grey market distribution, making it a rare instance of a true designer drug. It has been shown to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and unlike ketamine also acts as Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SRI). The N-Ethyl group on this compound increases potency.

## Dosage

- Euphoria, mood lift
- Sense of calm and serenity
- Vivid recall of past memories and dreams
- Closed- and open-eye visuals (common)
- Out-of-body experience (less intense then ketamine)

### Neutral

- Dissociation of mind from body
- Sweating
- Analgesia, numbness
- Significant change in perception of time
- Increase in heart rate
- Confusion, disorientation

### Negative

- Risk of psychological dependency
- Nasal discomfort upon insufflation
- Blacking out and forgetting one has taken a drug
- Discomfort, pain or numbness at injection site (with IM)
- Severe confusion, disorganised thinking
- Vertigo, spinning sensation (risk of injury)
- Nausea, vomiting
- Susceptibility to accidents (from uncoordination and change in perception of body and time)
- Severe dissociation, depersonalisation
- Loss of consciousness
- Depression of heart rate and respiration (risk increases with increased dose or when combined with depressants)
- Entity contact

## Harm Reduction

A recent [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30377924) on rats indicates that MXE may have harmful effects on the cardiovascular system, and therefor should probably be avoided by anyone with any history of cardiovascular issues.

See [Dissociative Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Dissociatives#Harm_Reduction) for general information.

### Interactions

MXE is extremely dangerous in combination with alcohol and can cause fatal apnea or respiratory depression.
Even residual MXE can potentiate the effects of 5ht agonists.

Examination of MXE molecule showed that, similar to [Ketamine](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Ketamine), the 2 isomers have totally different effects with the (S) having potent NMDA activity (when the -OCH3 is deprotected to -OH, it gets stronger) while the (R) isomer has SRI effects and possibly a opioid metabolite.

MXE is generally sold racemic.

## Legal status

Methoxetamine is illegal in the US states Arizona[1], Florida[2], Indiana[3], Louisiana[4], Minnesota[5], North Dakota[6], Ohio[7] and Virginia[8]. It is also banned in Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and the UK[9].

Methoxetamine (MXE) is a dissociative hallucinogen that has been sold as a designer drug. It differs from many dissociatives such as ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP) that were developed as pharmaceutical drugs for use as general anesthetics in that it was designed specifically to increase the antidepressant effects of ketamine.
MXE is an arylcyclohexylamine. It acts mainly as an NMDA receptor antagonist, similarly to other arylcyclohexylamines like ketamine and PCP.

## Recreational use

### Effects

MXE is reported to have a similar effect to ketamine. It was often believed to possess opioid properties due to its structural similarity to 3-HO-PCP, but this assumption is not supported by data, which shows insignificant affinity for the μ-opioid receptor by the compound. Recreational use of MXE has been associated with hospitalizations from high and/or combined consumption in the US and UK. Acute reversible cerebellar toxicity has been documented in three cases of hospital admission due to MXE overdose, lasting for between one and four days after exposure.
MXE was designed in part in an attempt to avoid the urotoxicity associated with ketamine abuse; it was thought the compound's increased potency and reduced dose would limit the accumulation of urotoxic metabolites in the bladder. Like ketamine, MXE has been found to produce bladder inflammation and fibrosis after high dose chronic administration in mice, although the dosages used were quite large. Reports of urotoxicity in humans have yet to appear in the medical literature.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MXE acts mainly as a selective and high-affinity NMDA receptor antagonist, specifically of the dizocilpine (MK-801) site (Ki = 257 nM). It produces ketamine-like effects. In addition to antagonism of the NMDA receptor, MXE has been found to act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Ki = 479 nM; IC50 = 2,400 nM). Conversely, it shows little or no effect on the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (Ki and IC50 > 10,000 nM). Nonetheless, MXE has been found to activate dopaminergic neurotransmission, including in the mesolimbic reward pathway. This is a characteristic that it shares with other NMDA receptor antagonists, including ketamine, PCP, and dizocilpine (MK-801). Animal studies suggest MXE may have rapidly-acting antidepressant effects similar to those of ketamine. A study that assessed binding of MXE at 56 sites including neurotransmitter receptors and transporters found that MXE had Ki values of >10,000 nM for all sites except the dizocilpine site of the NMDA receptor and the serotonin transporter (SERT).

### Pharmacokinetics

MXE has a longer duration of action than that of ketamine.

## Chemistry

MXE is an arylcyclohexylamine and a derivative of eticyclidine (PCE). It can also be thought of as the β-Keto-derivative of 3-methoxyeticyclidine (3-MeO-PCE), or the N-ethyl homologue of methoxmetamine (MXM) and methoxpropamine (MXPr). It is closely related structurally to ketamine, and more distantly to PCP.
MXE hydrochloride is soluble in ethanol up to 10 mg/ml at 25 °C.

### Detection in body fluids

A forensic standard of MXE is available, and the compound has been posted on the Forendex website of potential drugs of abuse.

## History

The qualitative effects of MXE were first described online in May 2010 and the compound became commercially available on a small scale in September 2010. By November the use and sale of the MXE had increased enough for it to be formally identified by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. By July 2011, the EMCDDA had identified 58 websites selling the compound at a cost of 145–195 euros for 10 grams.

## Society and culture

### Media coverage

Mixmag reported in January 2012, that people in the dance music and clubbing community have given MXE the slang name 'roflcoptr'. Vice commented that it was likely that the phrase will only be used by "the same politicians, parents and journalists" who called mephedrone 'meow meow'. After being called mexxy in UK Home Office press releases, the media adopted the name.
A literature review was published in March 2012 which looked at scientific literature and information on the web. It concluded that "the online availability of information on novel psychoactive drugs, such as MXE, may constitute a pressing public health challenge. Better international collaboration levels and novel forms of intervention are necessary to tackle this fast-growing phenomenon."

### Legal status

#### Brazil

MXE became classified as a narcotic in Brazil in February 2014.

#### Canada

As of January 2011 MXE is a controlled substance in Canada.

#### China

As of October 2015 MXE is a controlled substance in China.

#### European Union

On 16 June 2014, the European Commission proposed that MXE be banned across the European Union, subjecting those in violation to criminal sanctions. This is following the procedure for risk-assessment and control of new psychoactive substances set up by the council: Decision 2005/387/JHA.

#### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on narcotic substances, preparations and plants" and is hence illegal.

#### Israel

MXE became classified as an illegal narcotic in Israel in May 2012.

#### Japan

MXE became a controlled substance in Japan from 1 July 2012, by amendment to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law.

#### Poland

MXE is a controlled substance (group II-P) making it illegal to produce, sell or possess in The Republic of Poland as of 1 July 2015.

#### Russia

MXE has been a controlled substance in Russia since October 2011.

#### Sweden

MXE became classified as a narcotic in Sweden in late February 2012.

#### Switzerland

MXE has been illegal in Switzerland since December 2011.

#### United Kingdom

Prior to March 2012, MXE was not controlled by the UK's Misuse of Drugs Act. In March 2012, the Home Office referred MXE to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs for possible temporary controlling under the powers given in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011. The ACMD gave their advice on 23 March, with the chair commenting that "the evidence shows that the use of methoxetamine can cause harm to users and the ACMD advises that it should be subject to a temporary class drug order." In April 2012, MXE was placed under temporary class drug control, which prohibited its import and sale for 12 months.
Theresa May commented in her reply to the ACMD that "the next step in this process is for the ACMD to undertake a full assessment of MXE for consideration for its permanent control under the 1971 Act." She goes on to say that she hopes the ACMD will do this as a part of the review of ketamine, "including its analogues" and that this review will be completed "within the 12 months from the making of the current order".
On 18 October 2012 the ACMD released a report about MXE, saying that the "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)", despite the fact that the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report went on to suggest that all analogues of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines.
MXE ceased to be covered by the temporary prohibition on 26 February 2013, when it became classified as a Class B drug.

#### United Nations

MXE was made a schedule II drug in November 2016.

#### United States

On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration published a final rule placing MXE in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.
