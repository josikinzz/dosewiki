## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 12 mg) âComes on smoothly, nicely. In 40 minutes I feel nice euphoria, feel home again. Then I begin to get uncomfortable feelings. Gets more and more uncomfortable, feel I am sitting on a big problem. Blood pressure, pulse, go up considerably. Have hard time communicating, lie down for a while, get insight that most important thing for me to do is learn to listen, pay attention to what is going on. I do this the rest of the day, at first with considerable difficulty, then easier and easier. Discomfort stays with me for several hours, and although I get more comfortable towards the end of the day, I am never animated or euphoric. I feel very humbled, that I have a great deal to work out in my life. The next day I find myself very strong and empowered. I see that all I have to do is let things be as they are! This feels marvelous, and a whole new way to beâmuch more relaxed, accepting, being in the moment. No more axes to grind. I can be free.â

(with 18 mg) âI found myself with complete energy. I was completely centered with an absolute minimum of the dark edges that so often appear as components of these experiences. The ease of talking was remarkable. There was some blood-pressure run-up in the early part of the day, but that quickly returned to normal. I would repeat without hesitation.â
