## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepines. These are aromatic compounds containing a 1,4-benzodiazepine fused to and sharing a nitrogen atom with a 1,2,4-triazole ring.

### Background

Alprazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine indicated for the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders.
18
,
19
It is mainly metabolized by CYP3As and so is contraindicated with CYP3A inhibitors like ketoconazole and itraconazole.
18
,
19
Benzodiazepine treatment should be stopped gradually by tapering down a patient's dose to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
4
Alprazolam's adverse effects are generally related to the sedation it can cause.
4
Alprazolam has been mixed with alcohol as a drug of abuse to potentiate the sedative effects of the drug which may lead to coma and death.
4
Alprazolam was given FDA approval on October 16, 1981.
14

### Indication

Alprazolam is indicated for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults.
18
Alprazolam is also indicated, either as a standard or extended-release formulation, for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.
18
,
19
Alprazolam may also be prescribed off-label for insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and depression.
3

### Pharmacodynamics

Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that binds γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA
A
Rs) to enhance their inhibitory effect on neurotransmission, specifically in the brain.
18
,
19
Concomitant use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; patients taking benzodiazepines and opioids concurrently may require lower doses of one or both medications, depending on their clinical situation. Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. In addition, due to its CNS depressant effects, patients taking alprazolam should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving and should avoid other CNS depressants such as alcohol. As with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam carries a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which is higher in predisposed individuals and may require strict monitoring. Cessation of therapy may result in acute or protracted withdrawal symptoms, which may be life-threatening; the patient dose should be gradually tapered whenever discontinuation or reduced dosage are necessary. Newborns born to mothers using alprazolam later in pregnancy may suffer from sedation and withdrawal symptoms. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments. Lastly, benzodiazepines may have negative effects, such as panic disorders, increased suicide incidence, and episodes of mania/hypomania, in patients suffering from depression.

Positive allosteric modulator
GABA(A) Receptor Benzodiazepine Binding Site
Ligand

### Absorption

Alprazolam administered orally is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, reaching C
max
in about 1.8 (1-2) hours. Absorption is high, resulting in an oral bioavailability of 84-91%. A 1 mg oral dose results in a C
max
of 12-22 μg/L.
2
,
18
The extended-release formulation of alprazolam (XANAX XR) has similar absorption, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics as the standard release, with the exception that the T
max
is ~10 hours compared to 1-2 hours. Temporal dosing alters these parameters, with C
max
increasing by 30% and T
max
decreasing by one hour when dosed at night as opposed to in the morning.
19
Food has an effect on alprazolam absorption; a high-fat meal up to two hours before dosing increases the C
max
by ~25% and either a reduction (food consumed immediately prior to dosing) or increase (food consumed after dosing) of ~1/3 in T
max
. Neither the AUC nor half-life are appreciably affected by eating.
19

### Metabolism

Alprazolam is metabolized to less effective metabolites by various CYPs including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP2C9.
5
,
6
,
16
,
18
,
19
The majority of alprazolam metabolism is mediated by hydroxylation via CYP3As.
5
,
6
,
2
,
16
,
18
,
19
4-hydroxyalprazolam has 20% the binding affinity of the parent drug, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam has 66% the affinity, and the benzophenone metabolite has <1% the affinity.

### Half-life

Alprazolam has a mean plasma elimination half-life of 11.2 hours in healthy patients (range 6.3-26.9 hours).
18
The mean half-life is 16.3 hours (range 9.0-26.9 hours) in the elderly, 21.8 hours (range 9.9-40.4 hours) in obese patients, and 19.7 hours (range 5.8-65.3 hours) in patients with alcoholic liver disease.
18
The half-life is 25% higher in Asian patients compared to Caucasians.
18
Other studies have shown the half-life to be 9-16h.
2
The extended-release formulation has a half-life of 10.7-15.8 hours in healthy adult patients.
19

### Toxicity

Alprazolam overdose can present as sleepiness, confusion, poor coordination, slow reflexes, coma, and death.
18
,
19
Taking alprazolam with alcohol lowers the threshold for overdose.
18
,
19
Patients should have their respiration, pulse, and blood pressure monitored.
18
,
19
Patients can be treated by gastric lavage and intravenous fluids.
18
,
19
. If hypotension occurs, patients may be treated with vasopressors.
18
,
19

### Mechanism of action

Neurotransmission relies on excitatory and inhibitory signalling. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA
A
Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (PLGIC) superfamily located synaptically and perisynaptically to mediate phasic inhibition and extrasynaptically to mediate tonic inhibition. GABA
A
Rs comprise a variety of subunits from a homologous family whose members are named based on sequence identity as one of α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1-3. Each subunit possesses an extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), and intracellular (ICD) domain; inter-subunit interfaces are the primary points of neurotransmitter and modulator binding, described by coordination of the principal (+) and complementary (-) sites in each subunit. Binding of GABA to GABA
A
Rs induces pore opening, rapid flow of chloride ions, and synaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn manifests as an inhibitory signal.
8
,
9
The most prevalent GABA
A
Rs
in vivo
are the α1β2γ2 receptors, which contain both GABA (β+/α-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, α+/γ-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits.
8
,
9
,
10
In general, any receptors containing an α
x
/γ
z
interface, where x = 1-3,5 and z = 1-3, have potential high-affinity BZD binding sites, although small sequence differences between subunits may alter binding affinity to individual molecules. The α4 and α6 subunits, in which an otherwise conserved histidine is replaced by arginine, do not bind traditional BZD ligands such as diazepam and hence are considered "diazepam-insensitive".
8
,
9
,
10
GABA binding results in a series of conformational changes in the ECDs of GABA
A
R β subunits, "locking" each to its neighbouring α- interface. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the α+/γ- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator.
11
The exact manner in which GABA
A
R allosteric modulation mediates the therapeutic and unwanted effects of benzodiazepines remains unclear.
3
,
4
Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the α subunit composition, with α1-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, α2/3-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and α5-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines.
12
More recent studies suggest a more complex set of factors including subunit composition, physiological location, neuronal circuit, and nerve cell type.
13
To further complicate matters, there may be up to five distinct BZD binding sites on GABA
A
Rs, with site 1 corresponding to the classical high-affinity α+/γ- interface. The effects of binding at sites 2-4 are not fully understood and likely impart greater complexity to benzodiazepine pharmacological action.

### Volume of distribution

Alprazolam has a volume of distribution following oral administration of 0.8-1.3L/kg.
2
Alprazolam crosses the blood-brain barrier.
4

### Protein binding

Alprazolam is ~80% protein-bound in serum.
18
,
19
The majority of this protein binding is to serum albumin.
1
,
18
,
19
Alprazolam is also bound to alpha1-acid glycoprotein with low frequency.
2

### Route of elimination

Alprazolam is mainly eliminated in the urine.
18
,
19
A large portion of the dose is eliminated as unmetabolized alprazolam.
2
<10% of the dose is eliminated as alpha-hydroxy-alprazolam and 4-hydroxy-alprazolam.
2

### Clearance

A 0.8 mg oral dose of alprazolam had a clearance of 0.90 ± 0.21 mL/min/kg, which increased to 2.13 ± 0.54 mL/min/kg when coadministered with the strong CYP3A4 inducer carbamazepine.
18
,
19
Other studies have demonstrated a clearance of 0.70-1.5mL/min/kg.

### Curator comments

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA(A) function by binding at the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits. Of the 6 α-subunits, only 4 (α-1, -2, -3, and -5) participate in the formation of this binding site. The above target is a collection of all α- and γ-subunits that are known to participate in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site.

### General Function

Functions as a transport protein in the blood stream. Binds various ligands in the interior of its beta-barrel domain. Also binds synthetic drugs and influences their distribution and availability in the body. Appears to function in modulating the activity of the immune system during the acute-phase reaction

## Subjective Experience

Alprazolam (xanax) is by far the most widely known and popular anxiolytic drug.
Indeed, it has long been ranked as the most prescribed psychiatric medication in the
United States, with over 40 million prescriptions per year.

Alarmingly, it is also well known for its addiction potential (as are the other drugs in
this class). Related to this is the fact that large numbers of people build up a huge
tolerance, and dose accordingly.

Another worrying aspect is the number of reports of blackouts and lost hours on
higher doses. For a one-off experiment it was this issue which I most concerned
myself with during research.

After a great deal of investigation I elect to dose at 1mg. This was not the easiest
decision to reach, but I found a disturbing number of forum comments along the
following lines:

\`\`\`
“0.5 - 1 milligrams is optimal for someone with no tolerance. Anything more
than that and you'll pass out” ~ Pasha, BlueLight.org
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
“But from an HR stand point, 2 milligrams is far too potent a dose for
someone with no tolerance. That's a fact, not an opinion. In a clinical setting,
Alprazolam prescribing regimens begin at 0.250 milligrams. That alone says
it all.” ~ Pasha, BlueLight.Org
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
“2mg would put almost anyone with no tolerance on their ass. Swim has
been taking Xanax for years and 2mg is still fine” ~ RaoulDuke32, Drugs-
Forum.com
\`\`\`
I also noted the following:

\`\`\`
“Emergency room visits due to the recreational abuse of Xanax more than
doubled from 57,419 in 2005 to 124,902 in 2010.” - Addictioncenter.com
\`\`\`
Obviously, this is not a drug to treat lightly. I therefore proceed with the utmost
caution, clearing my diary and finding a safe space for the rest of the day.

Note that at the time of testing I have no benzo tolerance at all, and my system is
entirely clear of all drugs.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I separate what is probably a little less than 1mg from the crumbled
wreckage of my supply, and place the rest well out of reach. I consume this
with a glass of cold water, and wait. [3:20pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I sense that something coming-on. I feel a mild head driven relaxation
and a gentle numbness about my hands, feet and body. It’s minor and no
threat to functionality, but the change is noticeable.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 The head bubble may have evolved slightly, and it is more firmly
entrenched in sedation, of the non-fatigued variety. I don’t feel any anxiety,
but I didn’t feel any to begin with.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
All sharp edges have in fact disappeared from my worldview as I have moved
into a chilled ambience of tranquillity. Vision remains extremely clear and
possibly enhanced, which combined with a dreamy headspace makes for a
strange feel to the experience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:20 Time has passed quite quickly, and the above manifestations appear to
be fairly stable. This is quite a gentle ride, albeit not a particularly exciting
one. The word pleasant probably best describes it, with an overall impression
of being a little zoned-out.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I should point out that I don’t feel even remotely like keeling over on this dose,
or blacking out.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I certainly feel the effects, but not in any negative terms.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+2:00 I just ate a meal and enjoyed it, so there is no appetite or taste
suppression in play. I am content and relaxed, overlaid with a drifting
ataractic aura. It’s quite a nice background experience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:45 An unwanted side effect might be that I just spent a large portion of
the last hour doing nothing. I couldn’t be bothered, so I just lounged around,
pinging across YouTube, news sources, forums, and a handful of similar web
sites with a smile upon my face. I was totally unproductive.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Now, this could be because I am just bored and at a loose end, or it could be
that the xanax has numbed my drive as well as my body. Perhaps I am just
chillaxed, which is what I hoped to be, and I could be moaning for the sake of
it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 A feeling of drowsiness has started to emerge, and sleep becomes
appealing. I will fight this, initially with a cup of tea, and perhaps take a walk
in half an hour. I am still partially-immersed but the headiness is morphing
into mental fatigue and sleepiness. I make the effort to snap out of it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:00 I have battled through the drowsiness and now feel like I am
approaching baseline. I’m a little worn, and not yet 100% zoned-in again, but
broadly I feel like I have had a hard day with general fatigue.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am most definitely tired and it is certainly a result of the xanax ingestion.
\`\`\`
I retired to bed at 10pm, fell asleep very quickly and slept like the proverbial log for a
good 10 hours. I awoke feeling a little groggy but a couple of cups of filtered coffee
soon addressed this.

Comfortable and cosy are two words I have frequently seen associated with xanax,
and I wouldn’t argue with them. This was a decent experience, as I floated around the
house for a few hours, with no worldly worries on my shoulders. It evolved into
tiredness later on, and time began to pass in something of a haze, but there was no
hard landing or adverse effects.

Would I take it again, recreationally?

Given that this class of drug isn’t really my bag, and the well documented risks
commonly presented, I wouldn’t. The only circumstance in which I would ever repeat
this exercise would be to identify the effects of a larger dose for the purposes of this
book. This is unlikely.

I will end by re-emphasizing some of the warnings I made above. It’s a nice enough
ride in its early stages, but it can be fraught with danger. If you are determined to
experiment with it, go easy, and definitely avoid it if you are prone to addiction or
struggle to stop when you know you really should. A cursory search on the Internet
should persuade you that this isn’t one to trifle with.

AN ANECDOTAL TALE (WHEN LITTLE BROWN BALLS TRUMP XANAX)
A few years ago I visited a place called McLeod Ganj, famed as the home of the Dalai
Lama and the exiled Tibetan government. It is a suburb of Dharamshala in India,
and is 6,831 ft above sea level. I was staying a couple of miles outside the town, at an
even higher altitude.

As a sensitive soul I quickly began to experience the classic symptoms of altitude
sickness, particularly the headache. I sought help at the local pharmacy, and after
explaining the situation carefully I was given the packet on the left of the photo.

Yes, it's a blister pack of xanax!

Knowing exactly what it was, and having sampled it previously for research purposes,
I decided that this wasn't the cure for altitude sickness. I therefore headed to the
local Tibetan doctor, which was a short walk down the road.

I was greeted professionally, examined, and provided with brown organic balls as per
the right of the photo. The charge for these was about \$2. I took them as instructed,
and from the next day I was back to normal.

So kudos and sincere gratitude to the locals for helping out a strange looking tourist,
and a lesson learned; that flashy western-like dispensaries do not necessarily trump
traditional medicine.

I took the xanax back home with me as a souvenir. The blister pack is still sitting in
the top drawer of my desk.

Alprazolam (Xanax)
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[Alprazolam Images](https://erowid.org/alprazolam_images.shtml)
 
Alprazolam (Xanax) is a pharmaceutical sedative and CNS depressant which acts on the GABA receptor system. Alprazolam is widely prescribed in the U.S. for anxiety disorder, panic attacks, sleeplessness, and sometimes for short-term relief of extreme stress. It is classified as a benzodiazepine. 
 
 Alprazolam is a common prescription drug and is also used recreationally for its relaxing qualities. With regular or excessive use Alprazolam can lead to dependence and addiction. 
 
[ [Main Alprazolam Vault](https://erowid.org/alprazolam.shtml) ]
 
Dose #
 
Alprazolam typically comes in four different strengths: 0.25 mg (white), 0.5 mg (peach), 1.0 mg (blue), 2.0 mg (white), although generic brands can be other dosages as well. An extended-release version (Xanax XR) is also available, in capsules of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 milligrams. 
 
 An average adult dose is typically 0.5-3 mg per day, with a maximum dosage of 4 mg daily. Tolerance develops very quickly; those who take it on a daily basis may find they need to increase their dosage in order to get the same effects.
 
Price #
 
Street price is often US\$5 per 2 mg tablet (2004). The 0.5 peach tablets are rarely seen on the black market, and the 0.25 tablets are even rarer. Prescription prices vary depending upon location, insurance, generic or brand, etc.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/alprazolam_law.shtml) #
 
Alprazolam is Schedule IV in the United States, making it illegal to sell without a license and illegal to purchase or possess without a prescription.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/alprazolam_chemistry.shtml) #
 
Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chemically related to other anti-anxiety benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium) and lorazepam (Ativan).

Alprazolam's exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, it is presumed to work by enhancing the effects of the body's GABA (Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid). GABA is the nervous system's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, found in the brain and spinal cord. GABA tells the neurons that it contacts to slow down or stop firing, and this has a general calming and quieting effect on the brain. Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines enhance the activity of already existing GABA. Contrary to popular belief, they do not increase the nervous system's biological synthesis of GABA.

History #
 
Alprazolam first appeared on the pharmaceutical market in the United States in the 1980s. Since then, it has replaced diazepam (Valium) as the #1 medication for anxiety and one of the top-selling drugs in the U.S.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
Brand Names:
 
Xanax.
 
The Substance:
 
Zanies; Zans; Blue Footballs or Blues (1 mg blue tablets); Z bars; Zan Bars; Quad Bars; Totem poles; or Tombstones (2 mg bar-shaped tablets).
 
The Experience:
 
Barred-out.
 
EFFECTS #
 
Primary effects include calming, euphoria, drowsiness, sedation, a decrease in social inhibitions, anterograde amnesia (forgetting what happens after the effects begin), and intense relaxation.
 
Onset #
 
Effects are generally felt 20-40 minutes after oral ingestion (faster via sublingual), although it can take up to two hours to feel the full effects.
 
Duration #
 
Alprazolam is considered a "short-acting" benzodiazepine. Users report that the effects of the drug last from 2 to 6 hours with lingering after-effects of several more hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Alprazolam has no direct visual effects. If it has any visual effects, it would be to dampen visual effects of other drugs or visual disorders.
 
Hangover #
 
The after effects from alprazolam can include increased irritability, restlessness, and anxiety. This "rebound anxiety" effect increases with dose and frequency. The rebound hangover effect occurs between 6 and 18 hours after the final dose, depening on the individual's metabolism.
 
[PROBLEMS](https://erowid.org/alprazolam_health.shtml) #
 
Side effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, clumsiness, loss of muscle coordination, amnesia, dry mouth, headache, vivid dreams, and changes in libido. Serious, adverse reactions to alprazolam are very rare, but they do occur. Users who experience any of the following reactions after administration should seek immediate emergency medical attention: yellowing of the skin or eyes, hallucinations, a rash, or an allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of lips, face, etc.).
 
Contraindications #
 
Combining alprazolam with alcohol or other CNS depressants can lead to a dangerous and in some cases fatal slowing of the central nervous system and respiratory system. Other contraindications include: 
- Liver or kidney disease Depression History of drug or alcohol abuse Acute narrow angle glaucoma Co-administration of ketoconazole, an anti-fungal medication, or any other anti-fungal medications (due to alprazolam's interaction with drugs that inhibit metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A)
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Alprazolam is both physically and psychologically addicting. Even for those who take it for medical reasons, it may become habit-forming, especially if used on a daily basis. Suddenly stopping daily use of alprazolam could be extremely dangerous, especially if the user has been taking 4 mg or more daily for 6 months or more. In rare cases, suddenly stopping this medication can cause tremors, seizures, and in very rare cases, coma and even death. Medical experts recommend gradually tapering off of alprazolam, rather than abruptly stopping it.

**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Alprazolam** (also known as **Xanax** ) is a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class. Its characteristic effects include [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , and [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) .

Like other [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , alprazolam binds to specific sites on the [GABAA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gamma-amino-butyric_acid) receptor. It is commonly used for the medical treatment of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or social anxiety disorder (SAD).

Alprazolam has a fast onset of action and symptomatic relief. 90% of peak effects are achieved within the 1st hour of using in preparation for panic disorder and full peak effects are achieved in 1.5 and 1.6 hours respectively. Peak benefits achieved for GAD may take up to a week.

The [sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) can be potentially dangerous or life-threatening for individuals using regularly for extended periods of time, sometimes resulting in seizures or death. It is highly recommended to [taper](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Taper) one's dose by gradually lowering the amount taken each day for a prolonged period of time instead of stopping abruptly.

## Chemistry

Alprazolam is a drug of the benzodiazepine class. Benzodiazepine drugs contain a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring, which is a seven membered ring with the two nitrogen constituents located at R 1 and R 4 . The benzyl ring of alprazolam is substituted at R 8 with a chlorine group. Further, the diazepine ring is bonded at R 5 to a phenyl ring. Alprazolam also contains a 1-methylated triazole ring fused to and incorporating R 1 and R 2 of its diazepine ring. Alprazolam belongs to a class of benzodiazepines containing this fused triazole ring, called triazolobenzodiazepines, distinguished by the suffix "-zolam".

Alprazolam is substituted with a phenyl group at position 6, with a chlorine atom at position 8 and with a methyl group at position 1. It is an analogue of triazolam, the difference between them being the absence of a chlorine atom in the 'ortho' position of the phenyl ring. It is soluble in alcohol and insoluble in water.

## Pharmacology

Benzodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site and magnifying the efficiency and effects of the neurotransmitter [gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) by acting on its [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) . Alprazolam is a positive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor. As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of alprazolam on the nervous system. The [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) properties of benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors.

Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Administration of alprazolam has been demonstrated to elicit an increase in striatal [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) concentrations. This results in effects including reduced anxiety, muscle relaxant, antidepressant and anticonvulsant activity. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. Binding of alprazolam to the GABA A receptor, a chloride ion channel, enhances the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter. When GABA binds the GABA A receptor the channel opens and chloride enters the cell which makes it more resistant to depolarization. Therefore, alprazolam has a depressant effect on synaptic transmission to reduce anxiety.

The GABA A receptor is made up of 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABA A receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines such as triazolam that have a triazole ring fused to their diazepine ring appear to have antidepressant properties. This is perhaps due to the similarities shared with tricyclic antidepressants, as they have two benzene rings fused to a diazepine ring. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.

Giving alprazolam, as compared to lorazepam, has been demonstrated to elicit a statistically significant increase in extracellular dopamine D1 and D2 concentrations in the striatum.

## Subjective effects

The general head space of alprazolam is described by many as one of intense sedation, relaxation, anxiety suppression and decreased inhibition.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Alprazolam is capable of producing strong sedation and can lead to a lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and need to fight to stay awake. This sleep deprivation increases proportionally to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force the user into a deep state of unconsciousness.
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - Alprazolam is reported to cause feelings of heaviness in the body. This effect can range from motor impairment and difficulty moving at lower doses to complete lethargy or inability to stand up or move at high doses.
- **[Appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Some users report that alprazolam is capable of enhancing appetite in a manner similar to [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) and that it can have a synergistic effect with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) .
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Alprazolam is reported to produce moderate muscle relaxation greater than that of [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) but weaker than [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) ( *Valium* ).
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Alprazolam impairs motor control in a dose-dependent manner similar to [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) . Higher doses significantly increase the risk of physical injury via falling over or stumbling into objects. This risk is especially prominent around stairs and slopes.
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Dizziness is sometimes present with higher doses, although generally less than the dizzying effects of alcohol (colloquially known as "the spins").
- **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Alprazolam has seizure suppressing properties as a result of its [GABA-mediated](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) inhibitory effects on the nervous system.
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)** - Although infrequent, Alprazolam is capable of causing a dry mouth in some users. This may make a user drink more water. This is not the same as dehydration, as it is not known to be dangerous. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - Alprazolam produces [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) which, along with its memory suppressing effects, can easily lead the user to black out and redose continually until their supply runs out or they lose consciousness. This effect can place the user at risk of fatal overdose from respiratory depression if they are consuming it with [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) .
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - Alprazolam can cause confusion at heavy doses. This effect is a result of the drug suppressing basic cognitive functions such as comprehension, memory, and reasoning skills.
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at heavy dosages.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Benzodiazepines like alprazolam generally inhibit REM sleep and suppress the experience of dreaming. Sleep on benzodiazepines is generally reported to be deep and refreshing, although it should be noted that the actual sleep quality is lower which is why the use of benzodiazepines as long-term sleep aids is not advised.
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Although alprazolam primarily suppresses anxiety, it also dulls other emotions in a manner which is distinct but less intensive than that of [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) .
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria)** - A distinct portion of users report feeling a marked sense of emotional well-being and comfort while under the influence of this substance. Because this does not occur regularly or consistently for most users, it is speculated that this effect only manifests among those who have unusually high baseline levels of anxiety.
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - Alprazolam is known to cause slurred speech and difficulty communicating words in a clear fashion.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Alprazolam primarily suppresses short-term memory, resulting in forgetfulness, and/or disorganized behaviors. 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Higher doses of alprazolam can easily lead to complete short-term amnesia (black out) similar to that of high doses of alcohol.
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - Due to alprazolam's heavy sedation and lethargy, doing any type of activity that requires moving, or high amounts of effort may be difficult to do, especially at higher doses.
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - Like many [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) , alprazolam is known to cause blurred or otherwise suppressed visual acuity. ### After effects
 
- - **Rebound [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Rebound anxiety is a commonly observed effect with [anxiety relieving](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) substances like [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . It typically corresponds to the total duration spent under the substance's influence along with the total amount consumed in a given period, an effect which can easily lend itself to cycles of dependence and addiction.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **Residual [sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - While benzodiazepines can be used as an effective [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, their effects may persist into the morning afterward, which may lead users to feeling "groggy" or "dull" for up to a few hours.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). 
These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Alprazolam has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , or [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) . Resulting in increased [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) via a synergistic effect.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) when using this substance.

The acute oral [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) in rats is 331–2171 mg/kg. Other experiments in animals have indicated that cardiopulmonary collapse can occur following massive intravenous doses of alprazolam.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Alprazolam is extremely physically and psychologically addictive.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7-14 days. However, in certain cases, this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

Alprazolam presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , meaning that after its consumption all benzodiazepines will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Benzodiazepine overdose may occur with extremely high doses or, more commonly, when it is taken with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) . This risk is especially present with other [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) depressants, such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , since they work in a similar fashion but bind to distinct sites on the GABA A receptor, resulting in significant cross-potentiation. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Benzodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly. Symptoms may include severe [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , and non-responsiveness. The user might seem like they are sleepwalking. The user is also more susceptible to consume more of the same or another substance due to their impaired judgement, which is typically not seen with other substances during overdose.

Benzodiazepine overdoses may be treated effectively in a hospital environment, with generally favorable outcomes. Care is primarily supportive in nature, although overdoses are sometimes treated with [flumazenil](/w/index.php?title=Flumazenil&action=edit&redlink=1) , a GABA A antagonist or additional procedures such as [adrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) injections if other substances are involved. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Discontinuation

Benzodiazepine discontinuation is notoriously difficult; it is potentially life-threatening for individuals using regularly to discontinue use without tapering their dose over a period of weeks. There is an increased risk of [high blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/High_blood_pressure) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and death. Substances which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Abrupt discontinuation also causes rebound stimulation which presents as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) and restlessness. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

If one wishes to discontinue after a period of regular use, it is safest to reduce the dose each day by a very small amount for a couple of weeks until close to abstinence. If using a short half-life benzodiazepine such as alprazolam or [etizolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam) , a longer acting variety such as [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) or [clonazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonazepam) can be substituted. Symptoms may still be present, but their severity will be reduced significantly.

For more information on tapering from benzodiazepines in a controlled manner, please see [this guide](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm) . Small quantities of [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) can also help to reduce the symptoms, but otherwise cannot be used as an effective tapering agent.

The duration and severity of withdrawal symptoms depend on a number of factors including the half-life of the substance used, tolerance and the duration of abuse. Major symptoms will usually start within just a few days after discontinuation and persist for around a week for shorter lasting benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines with longer half-lives will exhibit withdrawal symptoms with a slow onset and extended duration. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.

## Effects
Anti-excitant and anti-anxiety, sedative, soporific and muscle relaxant. At high doses: slowing down, drowsiness, danger of memory lapses ("film tear").
Taking benzodiazepines increases the effectiveness of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor. This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system. The flow of information in the brain between the brain cells (neurons) is thereby reduced / disturbed and feelings and perceptions are dampened.
The breakdown of the individual active ingredients of benzodiazepines in the body is age-dependent and therefore varies from person to person.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
There is little information available on risks, toxicity, side effects and long-term consequences. Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:
When mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!
Taking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.
Side effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.

### Long-term Risks
Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).
In addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur. In case of possible dependence, withdrawal should be discussed with a doctor beforehand and the withdrawal should be medically accompanied. It is extremely important that the dose is reduced gradually.

## Safer Use
- If medicines are obtained on the black market or on the internet and not from a pharmacy/medical facility, the contents are unclear. Have the medicine tested for the exact ingredients in a drug check!
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use benzodiazepines. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses can be much higher and fatal for new users.
- Blisters of counterfeits may look identical to the original packaging.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, opioids and/or other benzodiazepines is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/alprazolam/*

Alprazolam is a common benzodiazepine in medical settings that is also taken for recreational purposes. It’s normally used for anxiety and panic disorder, though it has antidepressant properties.

The drug’s recreational effects include anxiolysis, disinhibition, and euphoria.

It was the top benzodiazepine in the US within a few years of its introduction. The substance has remained one of the most common psychoactive medicines.

## Effects

**Positive**

- Anxiolysis
- Sedation
- Insomnia reduction
- Muscle relaxation
- Disinhibition

**Negative**

- Amnesia
- Drowsiness
- Headache
- Dry mouth
- Depression
- Confusion

The primary negative effect in medical settings is drowsiness, which declines after the first few weeks. Other negatives that aren’t as common include fatigue, slurred speech, and memory impairment.

#### Recreational effects

Some users find it’s very recreational, while others prefer alternative benzodiazepines. It reliably offers anxiolysis, relaxation, and sedation. Euphoria is also possible to varying degrees.

Amnesia is a real possibility with strong+ doses.

#### Medical efficacy

Alprazolam is mainly used as an anxiolytic and in the treatment of panic disorder, but it’s sometimes used in patients with depression as well.

The most common recommendation is to restrict its use to 2 – 4 weeks. It’s regularly used for much longer periods.

**Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)**

Most studies have examined its effects over a period of 4 to 8 weeks at doses ranging from 0.5 to 3 mg.

There is evidence for it being more effective than placebo. Its efficacy is basically the same as diazepam and lorazepam.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often just as useful, with longer-lasting effects and a lack of physical dependence. For those who can go through CBT, it may be a better option.

Compared to buspirone

Over a period of six weeks with an average dose of 1.9 mg, it was as effective as 18.7 mg of buspirone. Alprazolam worked faster, but their ultimate efficacy was the same. This was supported in a second study.

**Anxiety during alcohol withdrawal**

It was able to reduce anxiety to the same degree as diazepam.

**Panic disorder**

The studies have usually been for under 8 weeks, with the most common result being that alprazolam is similar to other benzodiazepines. It’s as efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and more effective than trazodone.

Compared to placebo

Placebo or alprazolam were given for 8 weeks. After three weeks, the alprazolam group was using an average of 6 mg per day.

The drug was clearly more effective after four weeks, but that usefulness declined by Week 8.

Compared to TCAs

A study with 1168 people compared it to imipramine, a TCA. Alprazolam worked faster, but they ended up being equally effective after eight weeks. The average dose was 5.7 mg.

Compared to non-drug therapy

*Study 1*

Behavioral therapy was more effective over a period of 15 weeks. Alprazolam was used at an average of 4.6 mg and didn’t significantly differ from placebo.

*Study 2*

It was tested in combination with exposure therapy in patients with agoraphobia. That combo was compared to alprazolam alone, exposure therapy, relaxation therapy, and placebo.

Alprazolam’s effects didn’t differ much from placebo, but they did manifest faster. Exposure therapy wasn’t enhanced by the drug.

Exposure therapy was found to be superior based on its efficacy and because alprazolam’s sedation persisted through the trial.

*Meta-analysis*

The review looked at alprazolam’s use in patients with agoraphobia in comparison with behavioral therapy.

While they were similar for the panic and anxiety symptoms, behavioral therapy was superior for the phobia aspect.

Compared to SSRIs

There’s some evidence that SSRIs are as effective or more effective while coming with fewer side effects and a lower dependence risk.

Longer-term efficacy

One paper suggested it could remain useful for many patients with minimal dose escalation. When participants in a 6-week trial were asked about their treatment 1.5 years later, 78% were still using alprazolam and hadn’t increased their dose.

Those patients still reported occassional panic attacks and agoraphobia.

**Depression**

Alprazolam might be better as an antidepressant than other benzodiazepines. It’s at least as effective as TCAs, according to some research. Other studies have found amitriptyline and imipramine are superior.

Review

A Cochrane review found it was as useful as TCAs, but it needed to be compared more with SSRIs. There were concerns about the quality of the studies involved in the review.

Even though there weren’t many short-term side effects, the potential for dependence could tilt the scales in favor of other antidepressants.

**PTSD**

A study found it could reduce general anxiety symptoms but wasn’t useful for PTSD overall.

#### Impairment

Alprazolam is impairing when taken acutely. Using it over long periods is at least partially protective against the impairment.

In a group of studies using 0.25 to 2 mg acutely, doses over 0.5 mg led to psychomotor impairment (increased reaction time.)

It may be most problematic when trying to maintain your performance for over 30 minutes, such as with extended highway driving. One test found 0.5 mg impaired performance on a 60-minute vigilance test. 0.8 mg impaired speed and accuracy on a 20-minute vigilance test performed 3.5-hours after administration.

**Driving ability**

20 healthy volunteers were given 1 mg. They then had to complete an on-road driving test, during which they were instructed to maintain a steady position for 100 km at 60 mph.

Their performance was severely impaired, leading to greater side-to-side weaving and excursions out of lane. Impairment in the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) test was similar to 0.15% BAC.

Of the 20, 6 had to stop the test due to falling asleep behind the wheel.

**Memory effects**

There is a dose-dependent impairment of acquisition and retrieval of newly learned information. Long-term memory isn’t notably impaired at common doses.

Immediate and delayed recall and recognition are impaired over 0.5 mg.

**Tolerance**

Just as sedation declines with use, impairment appears susceptible to tolerance. After 1-3 weeks of daily use, some research indicates there is no longer a negative effect from the drug on most tests.

In one study, delayed recall was impaired after 3 and 10 days of treatment. The impairment went away by 24 days.

#### Paradoxical reactions

Effects like agitation and aggression are known to occur in a small set of users. Paradoxical reactions are more common in those with preexisting aggression and psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder. Concomitant alcohol use may raise the chance of these effects.

Here’s an example:

**Case**

14-year-old male had excessive anger, irritability, and was assaulting people. He said he wanted to die and planned to commit suicide by cutting himself.

This behavior began 10 days into his alprazolam treatment (1 mg/day) for anxiety. There were no other disorders and no other medication was involved.

All of this resolved after he was switched to sertraline.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Alprazolam differs from many other benzodiazepines in that it contains a triazole ring. This makes it a triazolobenzodiazepine.

#### Pharmacology

**Pharmacodynamics**

It’s a GABAa positive allosteric modulator. The substance binds nonselectively to the benzodiazepine receptor on the GABAa receptor complex.

Complexes affected by the drug include the a1 subunit (sedation/amnesia) and the a2 subunit (anxiolysis).

By operating on the complex, it facilitates greater GABA binding and activity. This leads to inhibition around the brain.

Decreased cerebral blood flow can be seen.

Alprazolam is associated with greater extracellular dopamine in the striatum, something that might differ from some benzodiazepines.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Peak plasma concentration: 12 – 22 ug/L (single 1 mg dose)

Tmax (oral): 1 – 2 hours

Tmax (sublingual): 2.8 hours

Tmax (IV): 30 minutes

Half-life: 9 – 16 hours

Bioavailability (oral): 90%

The drug easily crosses the blood-brain barrier.

Metabolism

It is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4. There are at least 29 metabolites, of which 4-hydroxy-alprazolam and a-hydroxy-alprazolam are the primary ones.

Both of those metabolites are present at low concentrations and have a lower BZ affinity. They don’t really contribute to the pharmacology.

80% of alprazolam is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

## History

#### 1969

The patent for alprazolam was filed by Upjohn.

#### 1970s

While research on the drug was taking place, other benzodiazepines were already on the market and growing in popularity.

Animal research showed it was more potent than diazepam and offered anxiolytic effects.

#### 1981

Following human trials which further demonstrated its anxiolytic activity, alprazolam was released by Upjohn as “Xanax.”

It was the first triazolobenzodiazepine to be approved for anxiety.

#### 1980s – 1990s

Studies and case reports showed the substance could be useful in panic disorder and other conditions. It also became clear that physical dependence occurs in medical settings following weeks of use.

There was interest in using it for adolescent anxiety.

#### 1985 – 1988

Emergency room admissions involving the drug increased by 50%.

Alprazolam was the top benzodiazepine in the US and one of the top prescriptions overall by 1988.

#### 1991

Approved in the US for panic disorder.

#### 1990s

There was a rise in its use for panic disorder, despite there being first-line treatments, like SSRIs.

#### 1997 – 2007

Prescriptions for alprazolam increased 71% in the US. They increased 99% in Australia.

#### 2014

Australia rescheduled it to Schedule 8 due to a rise in illicit use and concerns about its relative toxicity and misuse potential.

#### 2016

It’s the most prescribed benzodiazepine in the US and one of the most popular in recreational settings.

---

## Legal Status

#### USA

Schedule 4

#### Controlled

It is illegal in many other countries when not prescribed. You should check your local laws to verify its legal status.

Among the countries that treat it as a controlled drug are Australia, Canada, and the UK.

## Safety

Most of the deaths and near-fatal cases have involved polydrug use. Taking it with other depressants, which is quite common, is particularly dangerous.

There’s been some suggestion that it may be more toxic than other benzodiazepines. Even when other factors are corrected for, alprazolam is associated with an increase in the following:

- Length of hospital stay
- Likelihood of mechanical ventilation
- Flumazenil administration
- ICU admission

#### Pregnancy

It appears to raise the chance of congenital abnormalities during the first trimester. It can be detected in breast milk.

#### Acute safety issues

The primary acute concerns are amnesia and cognitive impairment. Severe overdoses could lead to respiratory depression and coma. It’s far more dangerous when combined with other depressants.

Many people attempt suicide each year using alprazolam, but the vast majority are unsuccessful.

Here’s an example of a near-fatal case:

**Case 1**

- 15-year-old male
- Alprazolam and heroin detected
- Found unresponsive, required intubation for over a day

#### Deaths

It’s unusual for alprazolam alone to be found in a drug overdose death. Other depressants are normally involved.

Here are some case reports:

**Case 1**

- 30-year-old female
- Found dead with tramadol, alprazolam, and wine near her
- Blood concentration: 0.21 mg/L

**Case 2**

- 44-year-old female
- Found dead in bed–she had a history of psychiatric problems
- She was prescribed alprazolam, fluoxetine, phenytoin, lorazepam, and venlafaxine
- Heart blood: 2.1 mg/L

**Case 3**

- Depressed and suicidal female
- Blood: 0.177 mg/L

**Case 4**

- Alprazolam and ethanol
- Blood: 0.122 mg/L

#### Tolerance & Withdrawal

**Tolerance**

Tolerance builds over time and is associated with lower GABAa benzodiazepine receptor density. In one study, receptor density was lower after 24 days of 2 mg daily.

**Withdrawal**

Withdrawal includes insomnia, anxiety, agitation, depression, restlessness, seizures, and delirium. It reliably occurs afters weeks of use, with the severity affected by your daily dose and how long it’s been used.

Tapering over a period of weeks or months is recommended. During this time, withdrawal may still appear, but it’s usually less severe. Tapering reduces the chance of rebound anxiety. Alprazolam does lose its effectiveness as the dose is reduced.

Research has found 4-week tapers still result in rebound anxiety/panic in 25-30% of patients. Combining the drug with CBT may reduce the withdrawal and rebound symptoms.

Here are some case reports:

**Case 1**

A woman used it for 8 weeks, rising from 1 mg to 6 mg daily. This was then reduced by 1 mg every 3 days.

A headache developed on the 12th day of dose reduction. The patient’s final 1 mg dose was taken on Day 13.

On Day 14, she had a severe headache and a tonic-clonic seizure.

**Case 2**

68-year-old man with depression became delirious after two days without his alprazolam. He had been taking 1.5 mg per day.

Diazepam and haloperidol were ineffective in alleviating the delirium. Alprazolam re-administration was effective.

**Case 3**

43-year-old female had been on diazepam for years. Alprazolam replaced the diazepam 10 days prior to admission.

She was told to use 2 mg (3x daily), but she ended up using ~200 mg over the course of six days.

Four days after running out, she experienced severe insomnia. She took 60 mg of zolpidem to overcome the insomnia, yet she developed hallucinations instead and presented in the emergency department (ED).

She was hypertensive, hyperthermic, and tachycardic (130). She was suffering from shaking episodes.

14 hours after admission to the ED, she was found dead. Initially it was believed to be a zolpidem overdose, but the final conclusion was that alprazolam withdrawal caused the death.

#### Risky Combos

Other depressants, including ethanol, opioids, and benzodiazepines.

Alcohol at moderate doses has been found to cause additive (not synergistic) impairment. Higher doses of alcohol cause synergistic impairment. The combination may also increase aggression and irritability.

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Alprazolam*

**Alprazolam** is a short acting anxiolytic of the [benzodiazepine](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines) class of drugs. It is commonly used and FDA approved for the treatment of panic disorders and anxiety disorders, such as GAD/SAD. It is available in both instant and time released version.

## History

Alprazolam was first released by Upjohn, under the brand name Xanax. The patent was filed in October 1969, granted in October of 1976, and expired in September of 1993. It was first released in 1981, for the treatment of panic disorders.

## Formulations

Instant release tablets are available in 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, and 2mg.

Extended Release tablets are available in 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 3mg.

Oral solutions are available in 0.5mg/5mL and as 1mg/1mL solutions.

## Dosage

Note: Higher doses have an increased risk of blacking out.

- Irritability, aggression, rage

- Personality changes

- Emotional and social dissociation or de-realization (long term use)

## Harm Reduction

When on high doses of [benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines), users are likely to black out and potentially hurt themselves through a variety of adventures. If you are using it as a sleep aid, it's recommended to continue doing what you're doing until you begin to feel drowsy, then go to bed.

Some users report Alprazolam (and [benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines) in general) to lead to compulsive redosing, trying to find a “high” which is where a fair amount of the point above comes from. To avoid this keep doses low and be wary of reduced inhibitions while under the influence of Alprazolam.

### Interactions

As with other depressants, Alprazolam should not be combined with any other CNS depressants (such as [Alcohol](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Alcohol)), at the risk of respiratory depression, which can lead to death.
See the [Drug combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations) chart for more information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Alprazolam is absorbed fairly rapidly, with peak plasma levels achieved around the one-two hour mark.

It is primarily metabilised via CYP3A4. Alprazolam is a chemical analogue of triazolam. It is a triazolobenzodiazepine. It binds to the GABA(a) receptor and modulates the function of the GABA receptor. You can learn more about the GABA(a) receptor [here](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/GABA_Receptors_and_Subunits_Info).

The LD50 of Alprazolam in rats is 331-2171mg/kg.

An Australian study (2004) of overdose admissions between 1987 and 2002 found alprazolam, which happens to be the most prescribed [benzodiazepine](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines) in the U.S. by a large margin, to be more toxic than [diazepam](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Diazepam) and other [benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines).

## Legal Status

### USA

Alprazolam is a schedule IV substance.

### UK

Under the UK drug misuse classification system benzodiazepines are class C drugs (Schedule 4).

### Ireland

Alprazolam is a schedule 4 medicine.

### Sweden

Alprazolam is a prescription drug in List IV under the Narcotic Drugs Act (1968).

### Netherlands

Alprazolam is a List 2 substance of the Opium Law and is available for prescription.

### Australia

Alprazolam was orginally a Schedule 4 (prescription only) medication; yet as of February 2014 it has become a Schedule 8 medication.`,
  "wikipedia": `# Alprazolam
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam*

Alprazolam, sold under the brand name Xanax among others, is a fast-acting, potent tranquilizer of moderate duration within the triazolobenzodiazepine group of chemicals called benzodiazepines. Alprazolam is most commonly prescribed in the management of anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Other uses include the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea, together with other treatments. GAD improvement occurs generally within a week. Alprazolam is generally taken orally.
Common side effects include sleepiness, depression, suppressed emotions, mild to severe decreases in motor skills, hiccups, dulling or declining of cognition, decreased alertness, dry mouth (mildly), decreased heart rate, impairment of judgment (usually in higher than therapeutic doses), and decreased memory formation, depending on dosage. Some of the sedation and drowsiness may improve within a few days.
Benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms may occur if use is suddenly decreased.
Alprazolam was developed by Jackson Hester Jr. at the Upjohn Company and patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. Alprazolam is a Schedule IV controlled substance and is a common drug of abuse. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 37th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

Alprazolam is used in the management of anxiety disorders and nausea due to chemotherapy. Alprazolam is indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

### Panic disorder

Alprazolam is effective in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. In Australia, alprazolam is not recommended for the treatment of panic disorder because of concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only four to ten weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to eight months without apparent loss of benefit.
Alprazolam is recommended by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) for treatment-resistant cases of panic disorder where there is no history of tolerance or dependence.
A 2023 meta-analysis of published and unpublished FDA-submitted regulatory trials of alprazolam extended-release for panic disorder found that only one of five clinical trials showed a positive efficacy outcome (20%), while the rest were negative and did not demonstrate effectiveness. In the published literature, three trials were published conveying a positive outcome (100%), but of these, only one was positive and the other two were considered to have been inappropriately spun as positive. The effect size (Hedges's g) of alprazolam for the treatment of panic disorder based on the five clinical trials was 0.33 (a small effect) and based on the published trials was 0.47 (a moderate effect), equating to an increase of 0.14 or 42%. The authors concluded that publication bias substantially inflated the effectiveness of alprazolam for panic disorder.

### Anxiety disorders

Anxiety associated with depression is responsive to alprazolam. Clinical studies have shown that the effectiveness is limited to four months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression.
In the US, alprazolam is indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.
In the UK, alprazolam is indicated for short-term symptomatic treatment of anxiety in adults.

### Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting

Alprazolam may be used in combination with other medications for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

## Contraindications

Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in children and in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance use disorder history, particularly alcohol dependence, and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders.
Alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies such as cirrhosis, severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity, allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder, where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol.
Like all central nervous system depressants, alprazolam in larger-than-normal doses can cause significant deterioration in alertness and increase drowsiness, especially in those unaccustomed to the drug's effects.

## Side effects

Sedative drugs, including alprazolam, have been associated with an increased risk of death.
Possible side effects include:

Anterograde amnesia
Concentration problems
Ataxia
Dysarthria
Disinhibition
Drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, ataxia, and vertigo
Dry mouth (infrequent)
Hallucinations (rare)
Jaundice (very rare)
Seizure (less common)
Skin rash
Respiratory depression
Constipation
Suicidal ideation or suicide
Urinary retention (infrequent)
Muscle weakness
In September 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required that boxed warnings for all benzodiazepine medications be updated to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

### Paradoxical reactions

Although unusual, the following paradoxical reactions have been shown to occur:

Aggression
Mania, agitation, hyperactivity, and restlessness
Rage and hostility
Twitches and tremor

### Pregnancy and breastfeeding

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta, enter the fetus, and are also excreted in breast milk.
The use of alprazolam during pregnancy is associated with congenital abnormalities, and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has a high risk of causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.

### Overdose

The maximum recommended daily dose is 10 milligrams per day.
Overdoses of alprazolam can be mild to severe depending on the quantity ingested and if other drugs are taken in combination.
Alprazolam overdoses cause excess central nervous system (CNS) depression.

### Dependence and withdrawal

The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and similar to that of other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the short half-life and rapid onset of action may increase the risk of misuse. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior.
Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds specifically on an allosteric site on the GABAA receptor. Long-term use causes adaptive changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, making them less sensitive to stimulation and thus making the drugs less potent.
Withdrawal and rebound symptoms commonly occur and necessitate a gradual reduction in dosage to minimize withdrawal effects when discontinuing.
Not all withdrawal effects are evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of symptoms such as anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, in the absence of the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug dependent.
Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines may also cause the development of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if the drug is administered in a higher dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.
In 1992, Romach and colleagues reported that dose escalation is not a characteristic of long-term alprazolam users and that the majority of long-term alprazolam users change their initial pattern of regular use to one of symptom control only when required.
Some common symptoms of alprazolam discontinuation include malaise, weakness, insomnia, tachycardia, lightheadedness, and dizziness.
Those taking more than 4 mg per day have an increased potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases have been known to cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause rebound anxiety.
In a 1983 study, only 5% of patients who abruptly ceased taking long-acting benzodiazepines after less than eight months demonstrated withdrawal symptoms, but 43% who had been taking them for more than eight months did. With alprazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, taken for eight weeks, 65% of patients experienced significant rebound anxiety. To some degree, these older benzodiazepines are self-tapering.
The benzodiazepines diazepam and oxazepam have been found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam, temazepam, or lorazepam. Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.

## Interactions

Alprazolam is primarily metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which may result in its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.
Imipramine and desipramine have been reported to increase an average of 31% and 20% respectively by the concomitant administration of alprazolam tablets. Combined oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of alprazolam, which may lead to increased plasma levels of alprazolam and accumulation.
Alcohol is one of the most common interactions; alcohol and alprazolam taken in combination have a synergistic effect on one another, which can cause severe sedation, behavioral changes, and intoxication. The more alcohol and alprazolam taken, the worse the interaction. Combination of alprazolam with the herb kava can result in the development of a semi-comatose state. Plants in the genus Hypericum, including St. John's wort, conversely can lower the plasma levels of alprazolam and reduce its therapeutic effect.

## Pharmacology

Alprazolam is a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator. When it binds to the receptor, effects of GABA are enhanced, leading to inhibition of neurons in the brain. This results in effects including reduced anxiety, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant activity. The activity of alprazolam in the central nervous system is dose-dependent.

### Mechanism of action

Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolobenzodiazepine: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring attached to its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces a variety of therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor site and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates the inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The binding of alprazolam to the GABAA receptor, a chloride ion channel, enhances the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter. When GABA binds the GABAA receptor the channel opens and chloride enters the cell which makes it more resistant to depolarisation. Therefore, alprazolam has a depressant effect on synaptic transmission to reduce anxiety.
The GABAA receptor is made up of 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines such as triazolam that have a triazole ring fused to their diazepine ring appear to have antidepressant properties. This is perhaps due to the similarities shared with tricyclic antidepressants, as they have two benzene rings fused to a diazepine ring. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic, and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.
Giving alprazolam, as compared to lorazepam, has been demonstrated to elicit a statistically significant increase in extracellular dopamine D1 and D2 concentrations in the striatum.

### Pharmacokinetics

Alprazolam is taken orally, and is absorbed well – 80% of alprazolam binds to proteins in the serum (the majority binding to albumin). The concentration of alprazolam peaks after one to two hours.
Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, mostly by the cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4. Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, as well as an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have little to no contribution to the effects of alprazolam.
The metabolites and some unmetabolized alprazolam are filtered out by the kidneys and are excreted in the urine.

## Chemistry

### Physical properties

Alprazolam is a triazole and benzodiazepine derivative substituted with a phenyl group at position 6, with a chlorine atom at position 8, and with a methyl group at position 1. It is an analogue of triazolam, the difference between them being the absence of a chlorine atom in the ortho position of the phenyl ring. It is slightly soluble in chloroform, soluble in alcohol, slightly soluble in acetone and insoluble in water. It has a melting point of 228–229.5 °C (442.4–445.1 °F; 501.1–502.6 K).

### Synthesis

For the synthesis of alprazolam the same method can be used as for triazolam, except that it starts from 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone. However, an alternative easier synthesis starting with 2,6-dichloro-4-phenylquinoline has been suggested, in which it reacts with hydrazine giving 6-chloro-2-hydrazino-4-phenylquinoline. Boiling the mixture with triethyl orthoacetate results in cyclization with the formation of the triazole ring. The product undergoes oxidative degradation in the presence of periodate and ruthenium dioxide in acetone solution, giving 2-[4-(3'-methyl-1,2,4-triazolo)]-5-chlorobenzophenone. Oxy-methylation with formaldehyde results in a product that is treated with phosphorus tribromide when 2-[4-(3'-methyl-5'-bromomethyl-1,2,4-triazolo)]-5-chlorobenzophenone is obtained. By substituting the bromine atom with an amino group conferred by ammonia, it forms alprazolam triazolobenzophenone, following which an intramolecular heterocyclization takes place to obtain alprazolam.

### Detection

Quantification of alprazolam in blood and plasma samples may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of intoxication in hospitalized patients, or to provide evidence in the case of crimes e.g., impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a thorough forensic investigation, e.g., in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma alprazolam concentrations are usually in a range of 10–100 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–300 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 300–2,000 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Most of the commercial immunoassays used for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with alprazolam, but confirmation and quantitative determination are usually done by chromatographic techniques.

## Dosage forms

Alprazolam regular release and orally disintegrating tablets are available as 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets. Extended-release tablets are available as 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg tablets. Liquid alprazolam is available in a 1 mg/mL oral concentrate.

## Legal status

Alprazolam has varied legal status depending on jurisdiction:

In the United States, alprazolam is a prescription drug and is assigned to Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
Under the UK drug misuse classification system, alprazolam is a Class C drug. In the UK, alprazolam is not available on the National Health Service (NHS) and can only be obtained on a private prescription.
In Ireland, alprazolam is a Schedule 4 medicine.
In Sweden, alprazolam is a prescription drug in List IV (Schedule 4) under the Narcotics Drugs Act (1968).
In the Netherlands, alprazolam is a List 2 substance of the Opium Law and is available for prescription.
In Germany, alprazolam can be prescribed normally in doses up to 1 mg. Higher doses are scheduled as Anlage III narcotic drugs and require a special prescription form.
In Australia, alprazolam, as of February 2014, is a Schedule 8 medication.
In the Philippines, alprazolam is legally classified as a "dangerous drug" under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, along with other schedule drugs listed in the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The importation of dangerous drugs including alprazolam, requires authorization from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.
Internationally, alprazolam is included under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances as Schedule IV.

## Availability

In December 2013, in anticipation of the rescheduling of alprazolam to Schedule 8 in Australia, Pfizer Australia announced they would be discontinuing the Xanax brand in Australia as it was no longer commercially viable.

## Recreational use

There is a risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users of alprazolam; alprazolam's high affinity binding, high potency, and rapid onset increase its abuse potential. The physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome of alprazolam also add to its addictive nature. In the small subgroup of individuals who escalate their doses, there is usually a history of alcohol or other substance use disorders.
Despite this, most prescribed alprazolam users do not use their medication recreationally, and the long-term use of benzodiazepines does not generally correlate with the need for dose escalation. However, based on US findings from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), an annual compilation of patient characteristics in substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States, admissions due to "primary tranquilizer" (including, but not limited to, benzodiazepine-type) drug use increased 79% from 1992 to 2002, suggesting that misuse of benzodiazepines may be on the rise.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an 89 percent increase in emergency room visits nationwide related to nonmedical benzodiazepine use between 2004 and 2008.
Alprazolam is one of the most commonly prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration concluded that, in the US, benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency department visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.

Regarding the significant increases detected, it is worthwhile to consider that the number of pharmaceuticals dispensed for legitimate therapeutic uses may be increasing over time, and DAWN estimates are not adjusted to take such increases into account. Nor do DAWN estimates take into account the increases in the population or ED use between 2004 and 2006.
Those at particularly high risk for misuse and dependence are people with a history of alcoholism or drug abuse and/or dependence and people with borderline personality disorder.
The poly-drug use of powerful depressant drugs poses the highest level of health concerns due to a significant increase in the likelihood of experiencing an overdose, which may cause fatal respiratory depression.
A 1990 study found that diazepam has a higher misuse potential relative to many other benzodiazepines and that some data suggest that alprazolam and lorazepam resemble diazepam in this respect.
Anecdotally, injection of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure of blood vessels (embolization), and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water; when crushed in water, it does not fully dissolve (40 μg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There are also reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper in a manner similar to LSD.
Misuse of alprazolam and other benzodiazepines has been shown to cause cognitive impairment. Alprazolam has typically caused anterograde amnesia effects (inability to recall new events), but a study conducted on mice by the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Research at Punjabi University has also determined that alprazolam can produce retrograde amnesic effects (inability to remember events occurring before amnesia). One 2016 study found that "chronic administration of alprazolam affects memory but attentive and psychomotor performance remained unaffected".
A 2016 randomized controlled trial stated that "overall, long-term benzodiazepine users may not be in their full cognitive state upon withdrawal". Similarly, a 2017 meta-analysis concluded that "a range of neuropsychological functions are impaired as a result of long-term benzodiazepine use, and that these are likely to persist even following withdrawal".

### Slang terms

Slang terms for alprazolam vary by geographic location. Some of the more common terms are modified versions of the trade name "Xanax", such as Xannies (or Xanies) and the phonetic equivalent of Zannies; references to their drug classes, such as benzos or downers; or remark upon their shape or color (most commonly a straight, perforated tablet or an oval-shaped pill): bars, ladders, Xanbars, Xans, Z-bars, handlebars, beans, footballs, planks, poles, sticks, blues, or blue footballs.
