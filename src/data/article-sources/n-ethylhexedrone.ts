## Subjective Experience

Although it was referenced in the 1960's, hexen wasn't synthesised until 2011. It
finally began to appear on the markets towards the end of 2015. Frequently
presented as a short acting cathinone with relatively limited residue-stimulation, it
rapidly became popular, particularly in the United States

As heavy redosing and compulsive binging is often referred to on Internet forums, I
take particular care in this area. As a precautionary barrier, I set aside the maximum
I am prepared to sample during this session, and place the rest of the supply well
beyond reach.

I divide 50mg into 5 lines of 10mg each. Whether I snort them all depends upon how
the afternoon rolls. I place another 32mg in a drawer, in case I decide to extend into
the evening.

82mg will therefore be the absolute maximum I can sample today, with a built-in
decision point at 50mg.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I insufflate 10mg. [3:15pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:15 I feel an ever-so-slight stimulation, and I am noticeably warmer.
Noting that I am around threshold at this stage, I decide to insufflate the next
10mg. This should take me into light territory, where I should feel something
more pronounced.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 The previous 30 minutes have flown by. Granted, I was busy installing
software, but nonetheless, it whizzed. I feel stimulated and quite happy. As the
first 10mg must be fully effective, I insufflate a third line, taking the overall
dose to 30mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I notice that there is some jaw tension, and that my pupils are slightly dilated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 The experience seems to have settled on to a plateau now. I feel pretty
good, with slight euphoria, and I am definitely stimmed, and warm.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I feel the sense of a slight headache in the background, but it isn’t sufficient to
cause discomfort.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:15 I am quite buzzed and elevated, but not flying. Certainly, I am
functional in the sense that I could perform any task required. However, I am
well aware that I am wired and I am happy to roll with it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As it is 30 minutes since the last line, I decide to insufflate the fourth. I am
now up to 40mg in total.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Is there any horn? Yes, there is. It is not up to methamphetamine or
amphetamine levels, but it is strong, and fully available. Those forum posts on
extended porn binges do make sense.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 The experience is now slightly more intense than earlier. I am
consciously drinking water to keep my fluid intake high, as I am still warm
and obviously pumping.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:45 I insufflate the fifth 10mg line. I am now on 50mg, having consumed
the whole of the primary batch.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I am well in control of myself and riding on a pleasant plateau. My
pupils remain semi dilated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
There is no doubt that I am enjoying the experiment. This has an edge that
makes it very recreational, whilst enabling normal functionality to varying
levels of capability.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+2:45 I am still rolling at the same level but I feel a sense of being slightly
weary.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As I feel no ill-effects I take the decision to extend. I insufflate 8mg of the
optional 32mg batch, splitting the remainder into three equal lines.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:30 As I feel I am tiring again, at least mentally, I insufflate another 8mg,
and then another 8mg 30 minutes later.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:15 I insufflate the final 8mg of the secondary batch. The pre-ordained
limit of 82mg has now been reached.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I can see how some people binge on this and consume ridiculous amounts. It
is very moreish, yet the comparatively painless snorting gives the impression
that it is mild, which isn’t the case.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is now 7:30pm. I hope to slowly come-down from here and land towards
midnight, and in theory, have a good night’s sleep.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:45 It is now 10pm, so as a harm mitigation measure, I eat a bowl of
muesli and drink a glass of orange juice.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
At 11pm I retire to bed.
\`\`\`
The night’s sleep was not good, or at least, the first part of it wasn’t. I lay tossing and
turning for several hours, and could only fall into slumber by taking 1mg of etizolam,
which worked well.

In the morning I suffered the usual hangover symptoms. I felt mentally drained and
distant, and tired.

I felt nothing like as bad as I did following my forays with some of the infamous
hangover stims, or even with MDMA, but regardless, this was a major factor for
much of the day. I suspect that had I continued to binge this could have been
significantly worse.

I undertook the classic program for recovery, including vitamin pills, 5-HTP, exercise
and food.

Hexen is often considered to be relatively forgiving, or even benign. I would suggest
emphasis on the word relatively. At high doses, it can certainly take its toll, and the
urge to redose is definitely strong.

This is not a drug not to take liberties with. The gentle climb and overall placidity can
be deceptive. Note also that was one of those occasions upon which I retrospectively
believe I dosed too highly.

**N-Ethylhexedrone** (also known as **NEH** , **ethyl-hex** , **hex-en** and **hexen** ) is a lesser-known novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) class. N-Ethylhexedrone is a derivative of [hexedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hexedrone) and is part of a diverse group of compounds called the [substituted cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinones) . Little is known about its pharmacology, although it likely acts by increasing levels of [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) in the brain.

N-Ethylhexedrone was first synthesized by Boehringer Ingelheim in 1964. It appears to have emerged on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market in late 2015. It is an example of a novel psychoactive substance specifically chosen to mimic the features of prohibited substances and bypass drug laws. It is one of a number of substances collectively referred to as "bath salts".

User reports characterize N-ethylhexedrone as having euphoric stimulant effects comparable to those of [crack-cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Crack-cocaine) and [α-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91-PVP) -type compounds, particularly when they [insufflated](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Insufflated) or [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Vaporized) . Like other [substituted cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinones) , N-ethylhexedrone has gained notoriety for its association with [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) and addictive behaviors when abused.

Very little is known about the pharmacology, metabolism, and toxicity of N-ethylhexedrone. Due to this, it is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

N-Ethylhexedrone was patented by the German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim in 1964 as a potential anorexigenic agent. The patent describes its synthesis together with other derivatives of aminoketone.

The substance spread remarkably quickly in the NPS market in different European countries. It was first identified in a sample from the Belgian Customs laboratory which was received at the [JRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Research_Centre) on November 2015. In January 2016, it was identified at the JRC in a sample provided by French Customs. Subsequently, in February 2016, the [EMCDDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMCDDA) received notifications of the identification of this substance from other countries, such as Sweden, The Netherlands, France, Belgium and Slovenia.

In 2017 it was the most frequent seized cathinone in the EU, Norway and Turkey. In 2018, it was the most commonly identified cathinone after [pentylone](/w/index.php?title=Pentylone&action=edit&redlink=1) in Drug Enforcement Administration seizures.

## Chemistry

N-Ethylhexedrone is a derivative of [hexedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hexedrone) , in which the methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom is substituted by an ethyl group. It is structurally similar to [pentedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pentedrone) , and also α-pyrrolidinohexiophenone ( [A-PHP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PHP) ), from which it differs by the substitution of a pyrrolidine group with an N-ethyl group.

The compound is a molecule of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) chemical class. The term "substituted cathinone" refers to a broad array of substances based on [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) , the principally active constituent of the [khat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Khat) plant. Cathinone is principally constituted of a [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) core (a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core with an alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon) and an oxygen group attached to the beta carbon. Cathinones are also known as the beta-ketone (βk) (double-bonded oxygen to the β-carbon) analogs of [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) . Notably, the cathinone backbone can be modified in three different places to create hundreds of possible compounds, which include substituents on the aromatic ring (R 2 -R 5 ), the alpha carbon (R α ), or the amine group (R N1 , R N2 ).

Relative to cathinone, N-ethylhexedrone consists of two added substitutions. At the R α position, a n-Butyl substitution forms a hexan chain. The second substitution is an ethyl group, that's attached to the amine group at R N2 , thus forming N-ethyl.

## Pharmacology

Very little data exists on the human pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of N-ethylhexedrone and other substituted cathinones. Like amphetamines, synthetic cathinones exert their stimulating and sympathomimetic effects via increasing synaptic concentration of [catecholamines](/w/index.php?title=Catecholamines&action=edit&redlink=1) such as [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) . These molecules are able to inhibit [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake transporters](/w/index.php?title=Reuptake_transporters&action=edit&redlink=1) producing a decreased clearance of the [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) from the synapse. Furthermore, they may cause release of biogenic amines from intracellular stores. It appears that N-ethylhexedrone has high preference for the dopamine transporter.

Based on the structure and assuming that N-ethylhexedrone is metabolized similarly to other cathinones, this compound is likely metabolized through N-dealkylation and/or reduction of the carbonyl group followed by N-dealkylation.

Synthetic cathinones are generally less able than amphetamines to cross the blood–brain barrier because the beta-keto group causes an increase in polarity. Unlike other synthetic cathinones, pyrrolidine derivatives have a higher ability to cross the blood–brain barrier because the pyrrolidine ring confers a low polarity to these molecules. The studies on the metabolism of synthetic cathinones have shown that they are N-demethylated, the keto group is reduced to hydroxyl and ring alkyl groups are oxidised.

## Subjective effects

User reports suggests that N-ethylhexedrone has more side effects compared to other stimulants like [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) or [NEP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NEP) . This can lead to excessive redosing, sobriety delusions and toxicity, which can eventually lead to highly uncomfortable experiences. The effects of vaporized N-ethylhexedrone are reported to be much stronger and more euphoric with less side effects than when insufflated or taken orally, but extreme care should be taken with this route of administration due to the degree it promotes compulsive and reckless use.

Another commonly noted property of N-ethylhexedrone is its tendency to produce a powerful initial rush which fades away and cannot be brought back by redosing, only increasing the negative physical and mental side effects.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - N-Ethylhexedrone is reported to be moderately to extremely stimulating and energetic.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - As with related cathininones, it is commonly reported that medium to high doses of N-ethylhexedrone can produce a pleasurable "body high" characterized by pleasant tingling sensations, which are stronger than that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) but weaker than [a-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) .
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** and **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - Reports suggest that at moderate to high dosages, N-ethylhexedrone is slightly anesthetic which is reminiscent to [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) but with lower effects.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - N-Ethylhexedrone presents a moderate local anesthetic effect.

- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)** - This effect seems to be more apparent when compared to similar substances such as [NEP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NEP) .
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and more similar to the teeth-grinding that can result from general [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) use like [a-PHP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PHP) or [NEP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NEP) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- The headspace of N-ethylhexedrone is typically described as extreme mental stimulation accompanied by a powerful sense of euphoria. 
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect is usually not as powerful as with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) .
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is mostly present in lower doses and is considered weak compared to other stimulant compounds. At high doses, it becomes overshadowed by euphoric stimulation.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low doses as anything higher will usually impair concentration due to the accompanying euphoria.
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**

- Auditory effects are usually present at extremely high dosages, or when taken in a dangerously sleep deprived state. 
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** ### After effects
 
- N-Ethylhexedrone's comedown is usually described as more slow and less dysphoric than the same effect found within [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) but harsher than that of [NEP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NEP) with a strong unpleasant bodyload. The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational N-ethylhexedrone use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because N-ethylhexedrone has a very brief history of human usage.

Early anecdotal reports from those who have tried N-ethylhexedrone suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying it at low to moderate doses by itself and using it in a sparing and controlled fashion (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

Some users have reported N-ethylhexedrone to be caustic to the nasal membrane when it is insufflated. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

A toxicology screening indicated that measured with yeast and SH-SY5Y cells, N-Ethylhexedrone seems to be the most toxic among the five cathionones tested.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of N-ethylhexedrone can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and seems to be readily liable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of N-ethylhexedrone develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the total absence of further consumption). N-Ethylhexedrone presents cross-tolerance with all [noradrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) and [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of N-ethylhexedrone all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the stimulant class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for (dextro) [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with N-Ethylhexedrone should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - N-Ethylhexedrone may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .

## Legal status

Internationally, N-ethylhexedrone was added to the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances as a Schedule II controlled substance in March 2020.

- **Brazil** : Possession, production and sale is illegal as it is listed on Portaria SVS/MS nº 344 since June 5, 2017.
- **Canada** : N-Ethylhexedrone is a Schedule I controlled substance.
- **Germany** : N-Ethylhexedrone is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of N-ethylhexedrone are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Hungary** : N-Ethylhexedrone is controlled as a new psychoactive substance.
- **Ireland** : N-Ethylhexedrone is controlled under SI 173/2017 under Schedule 1, paragraph 1(b) (page 35) as the substance is structurally derived from 2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanone and is I the 3-position of the propanone side-chain with an alkyl substituent in this case, an ethyl group (subparagraph iii).
- **Japan** : N-Ethylhexedrone is a controlled substance.
- **Poland** : N-Ethylhexedrone is under the II-P group as of March 11, 2021. It is illegal to own, possess, and sell in Poland.
- **Sweden** : N-Ethylhexedrone was classified as a potentially dangerous substance in Sweden on June 21, 2016, and is thus a controlled substance but neither narcotics-classified or fully outlawed.
- **Switzerland** : N-Ethylhexedrone can be considered a controlled substance as a defined derivative of Cathinone under Verzeichnis E point 1. It is legal when used for scientific or industrial use.
- **United Kingdom** : N-Ethylhexedrone is a Class B drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the cathinone catch-all clause.
- **United States** : N-Ethylhexedrone was placed in Schedule I by a DEA temporary scheduling order effective July 2019; the order was set to expire in July 2021, but on July 16, 2021 it was extended until July 2022.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/n-ethyl-nor-hexedrone-hexen/*

N-ethyl-nor-hexedrone (Hexen) is a stimulant in the cathinone class. It’s only been on the market since ~2015 and little more than anecdotal reports exist about its activity.

It’s become somewhat popular due to its recreational potential. People have turned to the drug as an alternative to methamphetamine, cocaine, alpha-PHP, and alpha-PVP, among other recreational stimulants. It’s most often used via fast-acting routes of administration (e.g. intranasal and inhalation) to maximize its recreational effects.

Though most people are pursuing euphoria when using it, the drug may be used as a productive stimulant at low to common doses.

## Experience Reports

## Effects

#### Positive

- Mood lift
- Euphoria
- Stimulation
- Greater talkativeness
- Increased sociability
- Increased confidence
- Physical euphoria
- Increased motivation

#### Negative

- Anxiety
- Paranoia
- Jitteriness
- Increased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure
- Sweating
- Jaw clenching
- Dry mouth
- Muscle tension
- Vasoconstriction

A lot of comparisons to cocaine have been made due to its short duration and ability to cause a pleasant “rush.” Though those comparisons are common, a lot of people find they’re substantially different, often with cocaine considered an overall superior substance due to a potentially lower propensity to become uncomfortable, scatterbrained, and anxious. It’s been suggested a better comparison may be to cathinones like alpha-PHP and alpha-PVP.

The drug does have a strong stimulant effect, surpassing that of a typical methylphenidate or caffeine dose. It may be stronger in this regard than amphetamine.

If you restrict yourself to common doses, it may be clearheaded (albeit with faster thinking) and even useful for productive applications. Once you’re using larger amounts and/or redosing, it’s easy to end up impaired and you can produce a state that’s not conducive to working.

Overall, a lot of the positive effects (mood lift, concentration enhancement, sociability, clearheadedness) can decline or disappear with a few redoses or large amounts.

Common to strong doses can produce pleasurable feelings around the body, including sensations of warmth and tingling.

Peripheral stimulation easily becomes noticeable at common+ doses, with users reporting signs of vasoconstriction (e.g. cold fingers) and heart palpitations.

Some of the greatest problems (e.g. severe comedowns, stimulant psychosis, paranoia, and hallucinations) occur with extended multi-day binges or with really heavy use during a single day, such as a few hundred milligrams or more. Its somewhat compulsive nature increases the likelihood of people’s use getting out of hand, thereby leading to those problems.

**Rush & Euphoria**

Especially with a strong dose via a fast-onset ROA (e.g. intranasal, inhalation) it can produce a rush of stimulation, euphoria, and sometimes a momentary sense of calm and peace. This quickly gives way to a substantially enhanced mood and greater engagement in whatever you’re doing. The rush is less prominent or nonexistent when lower amounts are taken.

Usually the rush declines or disappears after repeat dosing. By the time you’ve taken a few redoses, the same positive effects don’t consistently return. Stimulation continues to come back, but the core activity people are usually pursuing doesn’t stick around indefinitely.

Despite its euphoric potential, some users come away disliking the drug because it so easily produces undesirable effects if you try to maintain the euphoria for a long period of time.

And some portion of users don’t get especially strong euphoria from the start. Just like any stimulant, its ability to produce the desired recreational effects is partly dependent on the user.

**Compulsive nature**

Stimulants are generally going to be compulsive for some users if they have sufficiently recreational properties, especially if their duration is short. That applies to hexen.

If you have trouble controlling your use under the influence, you’re best off avoiding the drug. At the least, you should restrict the amount you have access to ahead of time.

Because the best effects can begin to go away within just 30-60 minutes, redosing is incentivized. After just a few redoses you’re primarily taking it to avoid a comedown and although the stimulation persists, there’s a rising level of anxiety, paranoia, and physical stimulation. At that point it may just be generally uncomfortable.

Some individuals have reported staying up for days because of compulsive use. This comes with a high chance of stimulant psychosis and paranoia.

If you’re going to redose, you should plan out your doses ahead of time. Don’t decide how to use it in the heat of moment. When you’re on the drug it may continue feeling like it’s the right time to take more long after it actually is.

**Comedown**

Euphoria declines in just 30-60 minutes and for some people they’re already experiencing a comedown within an hour or two. Most users report a comedown when sufficient doses are used, particularly with repeat administration. Generally it’s described as quite unpleasant, though perhaps not as bad as alpha-PVP.

The symptoms can include dysphoria, irritability, restlessness, depression, low motivation, and insomnia.

Because those symptoms quickly show up, people will often redose to keep the positive effects going. This unfortunately has the effect of making the eventual comedown worse, so it’s not recommended.

Comedown severity varies based on personal susceptibility and dose. It can range from some fatigue and irritability to severe depression.

**Stimulant psychosis**

Usually psychosis will only appear once you’ve skipped at least one night of sleep, but really heavy use on a single day can trigger psychotic symptoms, including paranoia and hallucinations.

Psychosis is a legitimate and serious concern with overuse.

Those who are naturally prone to visual distortions, paranoia, and other odd symptoms from natural sleep deprivation should be even more careful. No one should take it to avoid sleep.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Hexen is the n-ethyl derivative of hexedrone. It also has structural similarities to alpha-PHP, with the nitrogen in the pyrrolidine ring of alpha-PHP instead being bonded to an ethyl moiety and a hydrogen in hexen.

The drug is similar in structure and homologous to N-ethyl-nor-pentedrone, another research chemical stimulant.

#### Pharmacology

Its pharmacology is unknown. Considering its observed activity in humans and its structure, it’s thought to act as a reuptake inhibitor for dopamine and norepinephrine, making it an NDRI. Though it could conceivably function at non-transporter targets or be a monoamine releaser.

Based on the effects, it seems to have substantially more impact on dopamine and norepinephrine than on serotonin.

---

## History

#### 1964

It was originally mentioned in a patent on aminoketone derivatives from Boehringer Ingelheim, a German pharmaceutical company. The patent discussed new α-secondary-aminoketones with potentially valuable pharmacological properties.

#### 2015 – 2016

No research was conducted and nothing was done with hexen until ~2015, when it appeared on the research chemical market.

From 2015 to 2016, multiple law enforcement agencies around Europe reported seizures of the drug. Some of the shipments were coming from China, including in bulk quantities.

Seizures reported to the EMCDDA in 2015 and 2016:

- Belgium – 3 seizures totaling 50 grams of powder, coming from China. Seizures were in October and November 2015.
- Czech Republic – A seizure of 1 gram from February 2016.
- Germany – Collected 10 grams of powder from a Chinese online shop. This took place in November 2015.
- Netherlands – Seized 3 kilograms in December 2015. The circumstances of the seizure were listed as “distribution.”
- Slovenia – Collected a sample of 0.14 grams of white powder in January 2016.
- Hungary – Seizure of 2.57 grams in January 2016.

---

## Legal Status (As of December 2017)

#### US

Not specifically controlled, but it could be covered by the Analog Act.

#### Other countries

Australia: May be treated as a controlled drug due to its analog status.

Canada: Schedule 1

UK: Class B

---

## Safety

Very little is known about its safety. It’s best to use it infrequently, at common doses, and without combinations.

#### Cardiovascular

The drug does increase cardiovascular stress. Those with cardiovascular disorders are best off avoiding it entirely.

#### Seizures

It likely increases seizure susceptibility. Those with epilepsy are best off avoiding the drug entirely.

#### Intranasal use

A large portion of intranasal experience reports mention it being painful and causing runny nose, bleeding, or seemingly obstructed breathing for a short time after periods of use.

If taken via this route, chronic use can conceivably cause tissue damage. It’s best to limit intranasal use even further.

#### Risky combos (list may not be complete)

Other stimulants, tramadol, MAOIs, and psychedelics.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Ethylhexedrone*

N-Ethylhexedrone (also known as α-ethylaminocaprophenone, N-ethylnorhexedrone, hexen, and NEH) is a stimulant of the cathinone class that acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) with IC50 inhibition values of 0.0978 and 0.0467 μM, respectively (97 nM and 46 nM). N-Ethylhexedrone was first mentioned in a series of patents by Boehringer Ingelheim in the 1960s which led to the development of the better-known drug methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). Since the mid-2010s, N-ethylhexedrone has been sold online as a designer drug.  In 2018, N-ethylhexedrone was the second most common drug of the cathinone class to be identified in Drug Enforcement Administration seizures.
N-Ethylhexedrone was first synthesized by Boehringer Ingelheim in 1964. It appears to have emerged on the online research chemical market in late 2015. It is an example of a novel psychoactive substance specifically chosen to mimic the features of prohibited substances and bypass drug laws. It is one of a number of substances collectively referred to as "bath salts".
User reports characterize N-ethylhexedrone as having euphoric stimulant effects comparable to those of crack cocaine and α-PVP-type compounds, particularly when they are insufflated or vaporized. Like other substituted cathinones, N-ethylhexedrone has gained notoriety for its association with compulsive redosing and addictive behaviors when abused.

## History and culture

N-Ethylhexedrone was patented by the German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim in 1964 as a potential anorexigenic agent. The patent describes its synthesis together with other derivatives of aminoketone.
The substance spread remarkably quickly in the NPS market in different European countries. It was first identified in a sample from the Belgian Customs laboratory which was received at the JRC in November 2015. In January 2016, it was identified at the JRC in a sample provided by French Customs. Subsequently, in February 2016, the EMCDDA received notifications of the identification of this substance from other countries, such as Sweden, The Netherlands, France, Belgium and Slovenia.
In 2017 it was the most frequent seized cathinone in the EU, Norway and Turkey. In 2018, it was the most commonly identified cathinone after pentylone in Drug Enforcement Administration seizures.

## Chemistry

N-Ethylhexedrone is a derivative of hexedrone, in which the methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom is substituted by an ethyl group. It is structurally similar to pentedrone, and also α-pyrrolidinohexiophenone (A-PHP), from which it differs by the substitution of a pyrrolidine group with an N-ethyl group.
The compound is a molecule of the cathinone chemical class. The term "substituted cathinone" refers to a broad array of substances based on cathinone, the principally active constituent of the khat plant. Cathinone is principally constituted of a amphetamine core (a phenethylamine core with an alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon) and an oxygen group attached to the beta carbon. Cathinones are also known as the beta-ketone (βk) (double-bonded oxygen to the β-carbon) analogs of amphetamines. Notably, the cathinone backbone can be modified in three different places to create hundreds of possible compounds, which include substituents on the aromatic ring (R2-R5), the alpha carbon (Rα), or the amine group (RN1, RN2).
Relative to cathinone, N-ethylhexedrone consists of two added substitutions. At the Rα position, a n-butyl substitution forms a hexan chain. The second substitution is an ethyl group, that's attached to the amine group at RN2, thus forming N-ethyl.

## Pharmacology

Very little data exists on the human pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of N-ethylhexedrone and many other recently introduced substituted cathinones, aside from post-mortem results in overdose cases. Like amphetamines, synthetic cathinones exert their stimulating and sympathomimetic effects via increasing synaptic concentration of catecholamines such as dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.  These molecules are able to inhibit monoamine reuptake transporters producing a decreased clearance of the neurotransmitters from the synapse. Furthermore, they may cause release of biogenic amines from intracellular stores. It appears that N-ethylhexedrone has high preference for the dopamine transporter.
Based on the structure and assuming that N-ethylhexedrone is metabolized similarly to other cathinones, this compound is likely metabolized through N-dealkylation and/or reduction of the carbonyl group followed by N-dealkylation.
Synthetic cathinones are generally less able than amphetamines to cross the blood–brain barrier because the beta-keto group causes an increase in polarity. Unlike other synthetic cathinones, pyrrolidine derivatives have a higher ability to cross the blood–brain barrier because the pyrrolidine ring confers a low polarity to these molecules. The studies on the metabolism of synthetic cathinones have shown that they are N-demethylated, the keto group is reduced to hydroxyl and ring alkyl groups are oxidised.

## Legal status

Internationally, N-ethylhexedrone was added to the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances as a Schedule II controlled substance in March 2020.

Brazil: Possession, production and sale is illegal as it is listed on Portaria SVS/MS nº 344 since June 5, 2017.
Canada: N-Ethylhexedrone is a Schedule I controlled substance.
Germany: N-Ethylhexedrone is controlled under the NpSG (New Psychoactive Substances Act) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of N-ethylhexedrone are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
Hungary: N-Ethylhexedrone is controlled as a new psychoactive substance.
Ireland: N-Ethylhexedrone is controlled under SI 173/2017 under Schedule 1, paragraph 1(b) (page 35) as the substance is structurally derived from 2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanone and is I the 3-position of the propanone side-chain with an alkyl substituent in this case, an ethyl group (subparagraph iii).
Japan: N-Ethylhexedrone is a controlled substance.
Sweden: N-Ethylhexedrone was classified as a potentially dangerous substance in Sweden on June 21, 2016, and is thus a controlled substance but neither narcotics-classified or fully outlawed.
Switzerland: N-Ethylhexedrone can be considered a controlled substance as a defined derivative of Cathinone under Verzeichnis E point 1. It is legal when used for scientific or industrial use.
United Kingdom: N-Ethylhexedrone is a Class B drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the cathinone catch-all clause.
United States: N-Ethylhexedrone was placed in Schedule I by a DEA temporary scheduling order effective July 2019 and was permanently placed in Schedule I effective June 2022.
