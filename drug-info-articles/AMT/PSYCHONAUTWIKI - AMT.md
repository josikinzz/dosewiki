**a-Methyltryptamine** (also known as **Indopan** and commonly as **aMT** or **aMT** ) is a lesser-known [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class.

aMT was originally developed by Upjohn in the 1960s. It was briefly used in the Soviet Union as an [antidepressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressant) under the trade name **Indopan** . Indopan was prescribed in 5-10 mg doses, which is significantly lower than the dose used for recreational effects.

Erowid has received "a handful of unverifiable reports of hospitalization after high-dose (over 60 mg oral) aMT ingestion." There were 22 deaths linked to aMT in England and Wales where the drug became popular as a legal high from 2012 until it was banned in early 2015.

Limited data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of aMT, and it has a limited history of non-medical human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

aMT, or a-Methyltryptamine is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. AMT is substituted at the alpha carbon R a of its tryptamine backbone with a methyl group.

AMT is found in freebase form as a racemate of its (R-) and (S-) enantiomers.

## Pharmacology

aMT acts as a relatively balanced reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of the main three monoamines; serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist.

aMT's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) .

aMT also acts as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) , and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . It also acts as a very weak, non-selective [RIMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMA) in-vitro and in-vivo. , but this is unlikely to be very significant (if at all) with common doses.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Regarding its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, AMT tends to be very stimulating, resulting in jaw clenching and a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands. The stimulation encourages the user to move around, run, dance, climb or engage in physical activities. In comparison, other common psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) are sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - AMT's "body high" can be described as an intense and constant all-encompassing sensation. In comparison to other psychedelics, this sensation does not manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body spontaneously; it is instead felt like an extended, unchanging activation of every nerve ending on the body that lasts throughout the entire duration of the experience. This continuous sensation is immensely pleasurable but can become overwhelmingly intense and almost a burden at higher levels.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - A slight difficulty urinating is occasionally present.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - Many people report headaches towards the end of the experience.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Moderate to extreme nausea is commonly reported. This either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of AMT are mostly present only when large doses have been consumed and are proportionally mild in comparison to the intensity of its accompanying cognitive and physical effects when compared to substances such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) . 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)** - In comparison to more commonly used psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , this effect is significantly less intricate and complex although it is still very distinct in its presence.
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by aMT can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . At lower levels it can appear to be bland and simplistic in complexity but becomes equal regarding intricacy and depth to that of any of the classical [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) at higher doses. It can be comprehensively described with its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity (at heavy dosages), abstract in form, organic in feel, structured in organization, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equal in soft and sharp edges, small in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in round and angular corners, non-immersive in depth, and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, the visual geometry is significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This particular effect is uncommon during the first half of the trip but capable of manifesting itself towards the end of the experience, particularly if sleep deprivation starts to take its toll due to the abnormally long duration. The internal hallucinations are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, fixed in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- In comparison to more traditional psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , the AMT head space is described as not nearly as deep, insightful or profound. The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes: 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect is consistently manifested mainly in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This component is [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant and consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational aMT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because AMT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

As a [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , aMT can be dangerous when taken in excessive doses or when combined with [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMAs) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) and any substance which act as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . There is one reported death from AMT, but it is not known how much of the substance was taken. Erowid states that they have received "a handful of unverifiable reports of hospitalization after high-dose (over 60 mg oral) AMT ingestion."

It is worth noting that aMT's analog [aET](/w/index.php?title=%CE%91ET&action=edit&redlink=1) has been shown to produce long-lasting serotonergic neurotoxicity at very high doses. It is possible that AMT could cause the same neurotoxicity at high dosages or with repeated long-term use.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying aMT by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

AMT is considered to be moderately habit-forming.

Tolerance to the effects of aMT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 14 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 month to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). AMT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , meaning that after the consumption of aMT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

Deaths from aMT are rare but, as a powerful [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (MRI), injury could occur when excessive doses are taken or when it is taken with substances such as [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMAs) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) and any substance which act as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) .

- **Alcohol** - aMT has a broad mechanism of action in the brain and so does alcohol so the combination can be unpredictable
- **Caffeine** - High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating the combination may cause some physical discomfort.
- **Cannabis**
- **2C-T-x**
- **2C-x**
- **5-MeO-xxT**
- **Amphetamines**
- **Cocaine**
- **DOx**
- **DXM**
- **MAOIs** - aMT is an MAOI on its own. Using enzyme inhibitors can greatly reduce predictability of effects.
- **MDMA**
- **Mescaline**
- **MXE**
- **25x-NBOMe**
- **PCP**
- **SSRIs**
- **Tramadol**
