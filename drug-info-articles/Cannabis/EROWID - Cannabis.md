DESCRIPTION #
 
[Cannabis Images](https://erowid.org/cannabis_images.shtml)
 
Cannabis is a leafy plant which grows wild in many of the tropic and temperate areas of the world. It is cultivated both indoors and out for the production of its flowering tops. The most commonly used form of cannabis are the leaves and flowering tops (buds) which may be either smoked or eaten; It also comes in a more concentrated resinous form called hashish, and as a sticky black liquid called hash oil. There are three distinct species of cannabis: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis, though there is some argument as to whether these should be considered varieties rather than species. Most recreationally used cannabis is the result of interbreeding between these three types. The term 'hemp' is generally used to describe low-thc varieties of cannabis which are grown for industrial uses.

[Dose](https://erowid.org/cannabis_dose.shtml) #
 
The strength of cannabis varies greatly from one variety to another. Some, known as 'one-hit-shit', requires only a single lung-full to reach full effects while other varieties require many hits to achieve the same effects. Additionally, the amount that one individual likes to smoke can be many times what another prefers. Generally, 1/8 ounce (3.5 g) of mid-quality bud could get around 20-30 people reasonably high.
 
Price #
 
Cannabis is sold on the street for anywhere between $25 - $150 per 1/4 ounce depending on quality and location. In the U.S., prices are generally $30-$60 for 1/4 ounce of lower quality and $60-$120 for 1/4 ounce of high quality bud. Prices drop quickly as quantity goes up, with prices for one pound of the lowest quality cannabis going from 0 (leaves are sometimes given away during harvest) to $200 and good quality buds from $1200 - $2000 per pound.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/cannabis_law.shtml) #
 
The legal status of cannabis is currently shifting around the world. Although the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances prohibits cannabis and requires counties to prohibit its use and sale, individual US states and some countries have started legalizing cannabis. As of August 2015, Cannabis has been nationally legalized in Uruguay (2013) and Jamaica (2015). In contradiction of federal law (as of May 2019), ten American states have legalized the recreational use of cannabis; Alaska, Oregon, Colorado, Washington, California, Nevada, Vermont, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Rhode Island. 
 
 Prescription and quasi-prescription medical use of cannabis is increasingly legally recognized, with individual cities, states, and countries exploring approved medical use.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/cannabis_chemistry.shtml) #
 
The active ingredients in cannabis are called cannabinoids. There are many cannabinoids synthesized by the plant including tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabinolidic acid, cannabigerol, and cannabichromene. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is thought to be responsible for most of the psychoactive effects of cannabis and is the active ingredient in synthetic thc pills such as marinol.
 
Pharmacology #
 
Pharmacology Summary Needed.
 
Production #
 
Cannabis plants do grow wild in many parts of the world, but the quality of wild specimens ('ditch-weed') is generally quite low. Most cannabis is cultivated intentionally and can be grown either indoors or out.
 
[History](https://erowid.org/cannabis_timeline.php) #
 
The cannabis plant has been used both medicinally and recreationally for thousands of years. It wasn't until the early 19th century that the use of cannabis as a psychoactive spread from China and the Middle East to the population of Europe and then to America in the middle of the century. Cannabis was made illegal in the U.S. in 1937 and has continued to be a popular recreational substance since that time.

[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/cannabis_effects.shtml) #
 
The primary effects sought by those using cannabis recreationally are euphoria, relaxation, and changes in perception. Effects vary depending on dosage, with effects at low doses including a sense of well-being, mild enhancement of senses (smell, taste, hearing), subtle changes in thought and expression, talkativeness, giggling, increased appreciation of music, increased appetite, and mild closed-eye visuals. At higher doses, visuals may become more prominent, sense of time is altered, attention span and memory are frequently affected, and thought processes and mental perception may be significantly altered.
 
Onset #
 
When smoked, the effects of cannabis begin almost immediately. When eaten the effects can take 1 to 2 hours to manifest, based primarily on how much food is in the stomach.
 
Duration #
 
The effects of smoked cannabis peak after about 20 minutes and last for 1-2 hours. When eaten, the effects will peak more slowly and primary effects may last for 3-4 hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
While most people do not experience a strong visual component to the cannabis experience, some do and some particular varieties of cannabis as well as higher doses are more likely to produce this effect.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Negative effects can include paranoia, dry mouth, respiratory problems and nervousness/racing heart. Other effects may be negative or inconvenient in certain settings or situations including reduced ability to concentrate, impaired memory, tiredness, and confusion. Side effects tend to increase with lifetime use: as users age, they often report the anxiety-producing and uncomfortable effects increase and the euphoria decreases.
 
Contraindications #
 
Avoid Driving - While there has been little formal study into the effects of cannabis on driving, it is generally a good idea to avoid driving while under the influence of **any** psychoactive or intoxicating substance. Several studies have shown that drivers who use alcohol and cannabis in combination are far less capable than when taking either substance alone. Some studies have shown that cannabis causes impairment in driving performance, but that users often are aware of the impairment and compensate by driving more carefully.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Regular use of cannabis can lead to psychological habituation for some people making it difficult for them to quit. Studies have estimated that between 5 and 10% of those who try smoking cannabis will become daily users sometime during their life, but most of these smokers will have given up the habit by age 30 and few remain daily smokers after age 40. Most people do not experience signs of physical addiction, but with regular daily use, mild to medium withdrawal symptoms usually occur for less than a week, but can extend for as long as 6 weeks.
 
Long Term Health Problems #
 
The most common negative health impact of regular cannabis smoking are lung and throat problems including: coughing, increased frequency of throat and lung infections, and reduced lung capacity. There are concerns about possible long term carcinogenic (cancer causing) effects of cannabis smoking, but the results are still somewhat controversial. It can be safely said, however, that health risks increase with frequency and duration of smoking anything.
 
Risk of Death #
 
There are no confirmed, published death reports from cannabis-only poisoning. Especially given the wide use of cannabis, it appears that fatal reactions are approximately unheard of. There are a small number of people who report serious cannabis allergies which cause unexpectedly intense reactions, throat & lung irritation, etc.
 
Heart Issues #
 
Because cannabis increases heart rate, it could potentially increase risks of heart problems in those at risk of heart disease. One study found that cannabis use increased the risk of heart attack in men over 40, but its findings were weak and based on a very small number of individuals. In a large study of 65,000 individuals in California [by Sidney et al in 1997](https://erowid.org/references/journal/1997_sidney_amjpubhealth_1/1997_sidney_amjpubhealth_1_text.shtml) , cannabis was not found to increase mortality rates among users under 50.
 
Mental Illness #
 
For those with schizophrenia, paranoia, or symptoms of psychosis, the use of cannabis, alcohol, and other recreational drugs can contribute to worsening symptoms and a decline in normal functioning. It is less clear whether cannabis causes asymptomatic--or otherwise healthy--people more than temporary paranoia and anxiety, though several major studies have documented an association between the use of cannabis by young people and later diagnosis of psychotic disorders. Those with a family history of psychotic disorders or who are otherwise predisposed to mental illness may be at increased risk of problematic mental health issues if they use cannabis.

- Total Duration: 1 - 4 hrs
- Onset: 0 - 10 mins
- Coming Up: 5 - 10 mins
- Plateau: 15 - 30 mins
- Coming Down: 45 - 180 mins

- Plateau: 2 - 5 hours
- Coming Down: 1 - 2 hours
- After Effects: 6 - 12 hrs
- Hangover / Day After: 0 - 24 hrs
 
Duration is strongly affected by dose, tolerance, and individual reaction. Those who use cannabis regularly experience a shorter duration than those who do not. Note that most cannabis users smoke multiple times in a single session and this extends the duration. 
 
 For oral consumption, duration is complicated by stomach contents and delivery mechanism. Taking THC-capsules on an empty stomach lasts much shorter than eating THC-containing cookies or food, which take hours to fully digest. 
 
 There has been some research into the pharmacokinetics of THC (how it moves through and is processed by the body). See [Grotenhermen's research](https://erowid.org/references/refs.php?A=View&ID=6617) , which showed that the peak THC concentration after smoking was between 15-30 minutes and sloped down for 1-2 hours. He also showed that oral consumption caused the THC levels to peak between 2 and 4 hours and last for 4 to 8 hours.

DESCRIPTION #
 
The primary effects sought by those using cannabis recreationally are euphoria, relaxation, and changes in perception. Effects vary depending on dosage, with effects at low doses including a sense of well-being, mild enhancement of senses (smell, taste, hearing), subtle changes in thought and expression, talkativeness, giggling, increased appreciation of music, increased appetite, and mild closed-eye visuals. At higher doses, sense of time is altered, attention span and memory are frequently affected, and thought processes and mental perception may be significantly altered. 
 
 One of the most common comments about cannabis is that it enhances the appreciation of sensory experiences without substantially changing the perceptual experience. Many people attribute their love of music, appreciation for new forms of music, and ability to play instruments to the use of cannabis. 
 
 At overly high doses, the effects are often likened to other psychedelics and panic and dysphoria (bad mood) are more common. High doses, especially when taken orally, can sometimes result in difficult experiences and trips to the emergency room in response to racing heart, extreme confusion, short-term memory loss, and panic. After high-dose experiences, especially among those who are not regular users, after effects can last 1-2 days. 
 
 Paradoxically, although cannabis is normally considered a relaxant / depressant, its effects are stimulating in a substantial portion of those who use it. While some people use it to help them sleep, others cannot sleep for 3-6 hours after their last smoke.

Cannabis & Marinol Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
SMOKED CANNABIS
 Cannabis dosage is fairly easy to manage. A good method for determining your dose is to smoke a small amount (a quarter to two "hits"), wait 5-15 minutes, repeat as desired. The strength of cannabis products increased dramatically between 2000 and 2016. When considering waxes, oils, and other high potency extracts, always start smoking a tiny hit. For sensitive people, a mouth full of smoke from a high potency oil is enough to become confusingly stoned. 
 
 A single intake of smoke from a pipe, water pipe, or joint is generally called a hit. An average size hit from a pipe or water pipe weighs somewhere on the order of 1/20th of a gram. With reasonably high potency Cannabis buds, a small number of hits (1-3) is generally enough. The lower the potency the more hits people will need to achieve the desired effects. 
 
 Below is a chart with very approximate dosages for dry, smoked, high potency cannabis. These numbers will vary greatly depending on individual reaction, potency, and smoking method. Generally, brown leafy cannabis is not as strong as green, gold, purple sticky buds. There does exist "One Hit Shit" that can surprise even the veteran smoker with it's strength. Pay attention to your body's reaction when you first try a new type or a new smoking method, and be careful when introducing others to cannabis. Everyone reacts differently to different doses.

NOTE: In cancer treatments, cannabis and THC are used primarily to treat and reduce symptoms from cancer and cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy. After some confusion, we wanted to note that the use of THC as a medicine during chemotherapy is not usually prescribed for any anti-cancer effect of cannabis itself. THC is prescribed in the US as an anti-nausea and appetite stimulating agent. In California and some other US states, THC and raw cannabis can legally be prescribed for any indication and there are reports of cannabinoids being prescribed as a direct anti-cancer agent. The research evidence does not yet support human use of cannabis as a direct anti-cancer medicine, though *in vitro* (in petri dishes) cannabinoids do show some positive medical effects. Some of the confusion in this area is that a great deal of research has been dedicated to showing cannabis *causes* cancer, however the research failed to validate that theory. One of the explanations for the lack of cancer-causing action of smoked cannabis is that cannabinoids have some anti-cancer effect on lung cells that reduce or block the cancerous effects of the heated chemicals in burned plant material.

Cannabis (Marijuana)
 
Health
 
by Erowid
 
NOTES #
 
Use of cannabis is relatively safe, compared to many recreational psychoactives. There are no confirmed deaths caused by cannabis alone, although deaths can and do result from injuries sustained while intoxicated. Especially when combined with alcohol, cannabis has been shown to reduce driving ability and can contribute to traffic accidents. The primary health concerns related to cannabis use are lung and airway health (but not cancer), accidental injuries, reversible reductions in memory scores, and triggering of paranoid and psychotic thinking in vulnerable individuals. 
 
 It is worth noting that the first large age cohort (people who were in their teens between 1967 and 1980) of heavy, frequent cannabis smokers in the United States is only now reaching the age at which many serious health complications occur. 
 
 For many years, anti-cannabis campaigns have included the theory that the use of cannabis causally leads to use and abuse of other recreational psychoactives. This "Gateway Theory" is now considered a debunked myth, with dozens of scientific papers showing that other factors cause the correlation and cannabis use itself does not cause the use of other drugs. Even the DEA has abandoned this theory. 1,2,3,4 
 
 The political climate around cannabis and other recreational psychoactive substances makes it complicated to find balanced opinions about its safety and risks. Prohibitionist organizations and individuals are more likely to emphasize risks associated with heavy use and those who believe cannabis should be legalized focus on the much lower risks associated with occasional use. 5
 
DEATHS #
 
Cannabis use does not, by itself, cause death. Deaths can result from accidental injuries (such as car accidents). Extreme panic reactions, especially after oral consumption of high dose cannabis, have resulted in many people being briefly hospitalized until they come down, but no deaths from anxiety reactions have been reported.
 
CAUTIONS #
 
- Dramatic Changes in Thinking. Changes to thought processes, while among the primary reasons why people choose to use cannabis, can also impair judgement.
- Respiratory Ailments. Frequent smoking of cannabis can lead to respiratory ailments, including COPD, associated with smoke inhalation. The most common negative health impact of regular cannabis smoking are lung and throat problems including: coughing, increased frequency of throat and lung infections, and reduced lung capacity. 
 
 Although cannabis smokers have used bongs/water pipes to reduce the impact on their lungs, a 1995 study 6 suggests that use of water pipe does not lower the overall ratio of particulate matter to THC and may be counterproductive. In other words, it lowers the particulate matter, but it also lowers the amount of THC, and may cause users to simply smoke more material. Vaporizers are reported to reduce the lung impact of 'smoking' cannabis. 
 
 A large, well-designed study of tens of thousands of hospital patients found that cannabis use does not cause cancers of the airway and lungs. 7,8,9,10 
 In 2013, a comprehensive review of all studies on regular use of cannabis and lung health and found that although regular cannabis use was associated with airway irritation and increased bronchitis, it is not associated with with the development of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, or bullous lung disease. The author, Donald Tashkin writes: 
"[H]abitual use of marijuana alone does not appear to lead to significant abnormalities in lung function [...] [F]indings from a limited number of well-designed epidemiological studies do not suggest an increased risk of either lung or upper airway cancer from light or moderate use. Overall, the risks of pulmonary complications of regular use of marijuana appear to be relatively small and far lower than those of tobacco smoking." (Tashkin 2013) 13
- Short-Term Memory Impairment. Cannabis intoxication is known to cause memory impairment during the period of acute effects, but the reduced ability to store and recall memories can linger for days and affect cognitive or academic test scores.
- Panic and Anxiety Attacks. Some people may experience panic attacks (including extreme feelings of dread, accelerated heart rate, feeling as if they're going to die) from smoking cannabis. [See the [Psychedelic Crisis FAQ](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml) for information about such an occurrence.]
- Increased Heart Rate. Cannabis use causes an increase in heart rate in many users, usually lasting for the period of intoxication and slowing back down as the cognitive effects wane.
- Cannabis and Mental Health. Cannabis use has been implicated in triggering psychosis and other mental health problems. Although these issues are complex and (as of 2015) still an active area of research, a 2011 report by the FDA in their role as US Department of Health and Human Services advisors to the DEA found no clear causal linkage between cannabis use and psychotic mental disorders. 10,11,12
- Cannabis and Brain Area Shrinkage In the 2000s, a new risk was suggested by some researchers that using cannabis by teenagers could cause reductions in the volumes/sizes of certain important brain areas. These were not experimental studies, but instead used brain scans of living humans. Research published in [2015 by Weiland et al.](https://erowid.org/references/8802) found no differences in those brain areas in a tightly controlled study.
- Cannabis and Intelligence / IQ Loss (mostly myth) In 2016, it appears that the National Insitute on Drug Abuse is finally beginning to admit that cannabis does **not** cause reductions in IQ and does not damage intelligence directly. There has been persistent evidence that heavy cannabis use during the teens was associated with lower performance on some academic or intelligence tests, but no studies were able to actually demonstrate a causal link. A [paper in 2016 by Jackson et al.](https://erowid.org/references/9105) using matched twins and studied over a decade demonstrated that no causal hypothesis fit the data. But what the research does seem to suggest is that heavy use of cannabis during high school can reduce interest in performing well in school and thus is associated with lower scores on tests such as increased vocabulary. 15
- Cannabis Interactions. Cannabis is not known to have negative health interactions with many other drugs, but some report unpleasant effects when combined with alcohol or venlafaxine (Effexor). See [Venlafaxine Interactions](https://erowid.org/pharms/venlafaxine/venlafaxine_interactions.shtml) .
 
BENEFITS #
 
- Medical Uses. Cannabis has many possible medical uses. Symptom relief is claimed for ailments such as cancer, AIDS wasting syndrome, and glaucoma. Patients have found that the appetite-stimulating and anti-nausea properties of cannabis can help to mitigate the drastic weight loss and weakness from wasting syndrome and the nausea of cancer chemotherapy, and help them to regain weight. Cannabis reportedly helps glaucoma patients by reducing ocular pressure, which can cause damage to the eye. 
 
 Cannabis and cannabinoids have repeatedly been found to be effective at treating chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spacicity associated with multiple sclerosis.

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Cannabis**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I
- CLASSIFICATION: Hallucinogen
- MOVEMENT: Likely Federally Legalized before 2020
 
The Cannabis plant (listed as "Marihuana") and its major active chemicals including delta-9-THC (listed as "Tetrahydrocannabinols") are Schedule I in the United States. This means they are federally illegal to buy, possess, cultivate, synthesize, or distribute (sell, trade or give) in all forms (cannabis plants, extracts, hash, hash oil, THC, wax, etc.). In one of the incoherent curiosities of the current Controlled Substances Act, a specific synthetic THC (dronabinol; Marinol) is Schedule III. This means THC is both without a "currently accepted medical use" and has a fully FDA-approved medical use. 
 
 Practically, simple possession of small amounts is almost never prosecuted federally. Arrests and punishments for cannabis-related offenses are based on state and local law. For state-by-state laws, see below . 
 
 In 2015, the legal status of cannabis in the United States is rapidly changing towards legalization for recreational and medical use. Several states have already set up legal regulatory systems to allow for the growing and distribution of cannabis inside their borders. These remain in a legal gray area with regard to federal law, and many major U.S. politicians are now saying they will support removal of cannabis from Schedule I, allowing states to choose its legal status. Most non-idealogical expert observers believe that cannabis is well on its way to becoming fully legalized and regulated in most U.S. states in the next decade. 
 
 **History of US Cannabis Law** 
 The federal scheduling of Cannabis was disputed in 1988 by Judge Francis Young, an administrative law judge for the DEA, who recommended that marijuana be reclassified as schedule II on the grounds that if a respectable minority of doctors endorse it, then it has a "currently accepted medical use". [Full text of Judge Young's ruling]](https://erowid.org/cannabis_law1.shtml)

 [The history of the Marihuana Tax Act](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/taxact.htm) 
 
 **[MEDICAL MARIJUANA](https://erowid.org/cannabis_medical.shtml)** 
 Cannabis has many reported and demonstrated medical uses. Its most active component (THC) is an approved drug in the United States and the second most active drug in the plant, Cannabidiol (CBD), is heading towards FDA approval for specific indications. Starting in 1975, after losing a court case, the US government was forced to provide a small number of people with medical cannabis based on "medical necessity". Although closed to new applicants in 1992, it is another example of the confusing question of cannabis's medical value. The US Congress has defined through legislation that it has no medical use, but that has never been fully true, and is now just a bizarre historical error encoded into law, policy, and public educational programs. As of November 2015, 23 states and Washington DC have legalized cannabis for medical use. See [NORML's Medical Marijuana by State](http://norml.org/legal/medical-marijuana-2) and the Congressional Research Service's [Medical Marijuana: Review and Analysis of Federal and State Policies](https://erowid.org/cannabis_medical_law2_2010_crs_review.pdf) (Eddy 2010) for a review of the legal history of medical cannabis in the United States.

Alaska #
 
In November 2014, Alaska passed a voter initiative legalizing the recreational use of cannabis for those 21 and older. The new law allows possession up to one ounce of cannabis and grow up to six plants. It creates a legal market and legalizes cannabis-related paraphernalia. See [http://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Marijuana_Legalization,_Ballot_Measure_2_%282014%29](http://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Marijuana_Legalization,_Ballot_Measure_2_%282014%29) . Previously, the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts had ruled that personal possession of cannabis was protected by state constitution's privacy clause. As recently as Sep 14, 2004, the AK Supreme Court refused to overturn a unanimous Appellate Court decision that police were not allowed to enter a home simply based on smelling cannabis smoke outside. See [Pot vs Privacy, Oct 2003](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/GoodMorningAmerica/alaska_marijuana031014.html) and [Alaska Supreme Court chooses privacy over pot, Sep 2004](http://www.talkaboutsupport.com/group/alt.support.mult-sclerosis/messages/359885.html) and [Eric Sterling's Response](https://erowid.org/cannabis_law5.shtml) . The Alaska Legislature passed a law banning cannabis, but a judge struck down the law in July 2006: [Judge rules against Alaska marijuana ban law](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003118645_webpot10.html) , Jul 2006, AP.

California #
 
Legalized for possession in November 2016 up to one ounce per person, although the law is not as clear as it should be. Cannabis is nearly legal for any purpose with the caveat that smoking **anything** indoors is banned with very few exceptions. It is unlikely that any sales will be legally allowed prior to 2018. The legalization initiative in 2016 was driven largely by commercial interests that will favor large distributors and growers as small production is outlawed over the next few years. 
 
 Prior to 2016, the penalty for possession had been reduced to a non-arrestable $100 ticket for under 1 ounce (28.5 grams) on Oct 1, 2010. Previously, possession of one ounce (28.5 grams) or less was treated as a misdeameanor; the new law reduces the penalty for simple possession of an ounce or less of cannabis to an infraction, with a maximum fine of $100. [2010 SB 1449](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_1401-1450/sb_1449_bill_20100405_amended_sen_v98.html) . Possession of "Concentrated cannabis" products are still subject to penalties including imprisonment. 
 
 The California Supreme Court has upheld the California Medical Marijuana law (state Prop 215, [July 19, 2002](https://erowid.org/cannabis_law4.shtml) ). In January 2008, a San Francisco Appeals court ruled that police may not enter and search a home without a warrant simply because they see someone inside smoking cannabis. 
 
"The possession and cultivation of marijuana is no more criminal -- so long as (the law's) conditions are satisfied -- than the possession and acquisition of any prescription drug with a physician's prescription." CA Chief Justice Ronald George.
 
Colorado #
 
Recreational and medical cannabis are legal in Colorado as of early 2014 for those 21 and older. Individuals are allowed to grow plants and regulated businesses can grow and sell cannabis, its concentrates, and orally ingestible food-type preparations. Use in public is outlawed. 
 
 On Nov 6, 2012, the state of Colorado passed a voter initiative that legalized growing, distribution, and possession, while still outlawing public use. See [http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/](http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/) . City of Denver votes to legalize possession of up to an ounce of cannabis. Although police will still enforce Colorado state law, the city population has clearly expressed that they are disatisfied with the state laws. See [Denver Voters OK Marijuana Possession](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/11/02/politics/p044040S34.DTL&hw=denver+marijuana&sn=001&sc=1000) - Nov 2, 2005, AP and [Mile High City Legalizes Pot Possession](http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20051102083609990004) - Nov 2, 2005, AOL News.

Oregon #
 
Cannabis for recreational use is legal in Oregon, and Oregon was one of the first states to permit medical use. Oregon voters passed a cannabis legalization initiative in November 2014 that would allow possession and growing of cannabis and create a legal market for sale and purchase. The law took effect on July 1, 2015. Households can have up to four live plants. See [Marijuana legalization Q&A: What's next for Oregon?](http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/11/marijuana_legalization_oregon.html) (The Oregonian, Nov 2014) and [Oregon Legalized Marijuana Initiative, Measure 91 (2014)](http://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Legalized_Marijuana_Initiative,_Measure_91_%282014%29) . Curiously, the federal TSA (air travel security agency) [announced that carrying up to an ounce of cannabis](http://www.kgw.com/story/news/local/2015/07/08/flying-with-pot/29888803/) for in-state flight is allowed.

Recreational use of cannabis is decriminalized in Rhode Island and it has approved medical cannabis. Rhode Island legalized the medical use of cannabis in Jan 2006, overriding a veto of the legislation by Governor Don Carcieri (house vote 59-13). The law allows people with certain illnesses such as cancer to register with the state, receive a special ID card, and then grow up to 12 plants or buy/possess up to 2.5 ounces of dried cannabis.

Washington State #
 
Recreational use of cannabis is legal in Washington state and the medical use cannabis is approved. Washington has one of the nation's first Drugged Driving rule specifying blood levels of cannabinoids. Washington State passed a voter referendum on November 6, 2012, that created a legal structure for cannabis to be produced, distributed, sold, and used recreationally. The exact rules for how this legalization will be implemented have not yet been finalized. See [http://sensiblewashington.org/blog/](http://sensiblewashington.org/blog/) . In December, 2012, the Seattle Police stated that they would not arrest or cite people for smoking cannabis in public for a month or so: [http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2012/11/09/marijwhatnow-a-guide-to-legal-marijuana-use-in-seattle/](http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2012/11/09/marijwhatnow-a-guide-to-legal-marijuana-use-in-seattle/) (last updated Nov 14 2015)

Belgium #
 
No amount of cannabis is legal to possess in Belgium, however possession of up to 3g of cannabis by adults, for personal use, is tolerated. It is also said that 1 female plant is tolerated. We have been told that if the possession meets the informal 'personal use' criteria, the police most often register the offense anonymously (do not record the individual's name) and the state will not prosecute. The criteria for this include: possession of an amount that is consumable in 24 hours (usually 3 grams or less), possession of leaf or bud and not oil or other processed product which are less tolerated; that the use is not around minors or while driving; and other factors that might indicate 'problematic use'. In practice, almost all non-problematic personal users will be registered anonymously. The criteria are described in Het Staatsblad published on June 2, 2003: [http://www.staatsbladclip.be/wetten/2003/06/02/wet-2003009496.html](http://www.staatsbladclip.be/wetten/2003/06/02/wet-2003009496.html) and [http://www.staatsbladclip.be/wetten/2003/06/02/wet-2003009479.html](http://www.staatsbladclip.be/wetten/2003/06/02/wet-2003009479.html) . Erowid has also been told that a new law to allow for medical use of cannabis has lead the police to be more forgiving about possession of small amounts of non-medicinal cannabis. We have been told that there is no legal way to buy or import cannabis or its seeds. See [ejustice.just.fgov.be (French only)](http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/api2.pl?lg=fr&pd=2004-10-28&numac=2004203248) . (thanks Cholo, CG, FA.) (last updated Aug 2006)
 
Brazil #
 
Cannabis possession is criminal, but is not stricly enforced. Cannabis sativa is listed as a controlled substance, making the plant and all of its parts illegal to cultivate, distribute, or possess. Other cannabis species do not appear to be listed, though THC is separately scheduled. Presumably any THC-containing plant is illegal by extension. We have been told that as of 2007 cannabis prohibition is not vigorously enforced. (thanks P) (last updated Nov 14, 2015)
 
Bulgaria #
 
Cannabis is included in Schedule no. 1 of Bulgaria's [Drugs and Precursors Control Act](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/legal_library/bg/legal_library_2000-09-12_2000-2.html) . Plants in the genus Cannabis containing greater than .2% tetrahydrocannabinol by weight are illegal to grow, possess, or sell. (thanks GD)
 
Canada #
 
As of January 2019, Cannabis has been effectively legalized in Canada, though the illegal ('black') markets have continued to thrive. In most places in Canada, it is now legal to smoke, use, and buy cannabis at age 18. There are a lot of complex details, but in most cases it is still illegal to grow cannabis without a license, though this is not enforces in most of the western states. There are further medical laws that allow prescription cannabis and cannabinoids in Canada, though these generally require prescription by medical personnel. See [Washington Post Jan 2019](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/canada-legalized-pot-in-october-but-its-black-market-is-still-going-strong/2019/01/04/ca09a3b0-fe53-11e8-a17e-162b712e8fc2_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7b3f117af9cd) .

Czech Republic #
 
In March, 2008 the Czech Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a medical cannabis grower, finding that growing cannabis is not necessarily "illegal production". While cannabis is still illegal to possess, use, and produce under Czech law, this ruling is expected to influence the way drug laws are interpreted by lower courts. (see [Radio Praha article](http://www.radio.cz/en/article/101549) )
 
Estonia #
 
Cannabis is prohibited. According to joh, "Seeds are legal to sell but illegal to import and export." (unconfirmed) (thanks JOH)
 
Germany #
 
Cannabis use and possession are partially decriminalized in Germany. Some medical use has been approved. Cannabis is prohibited by the German BtMG (drug schedule), making it illegal to possess, cultivate, or sell. A reader comments that possession of 6 g or less is generally not prosecuted, and more or less may be tolerated, depending on the state. The northern states tend to be more permissive than the southern states, where amounts smaller than a gram may even be prosecuted. (thanks JL, 5, TNO) (last updated Nov 2, 2015)
 
Greece #
 
Cannabis is controlled in Greece and illegal to grow or possess. We've received conflicting reports about how severely police treat minor possession offenses (less than 1 gram) with one submitter saying police are likely to overlook possession at that level and a March 2007 submitter saying that they were themselves prosecuted in southern Greece for 0.8 grams of cannabis and that raids on cannabis farms had increased over the last 3 years. (thanks Z, A) (last updated Mar 2007)

India #
 
Although India has a long history of the use of Cannabis, including involvement with religious traditions, it is illegal to grow or possess. In some areas, cannabis use is openly ignored by authorities, particularly during the festivals of Holi and ShivaRati. (see [Times of India article](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/37204187.cms) on bhang use). (thanks C)
 
Israel #
 
Cannabis is illegal for most purposes in Israel, though inactive hempseed oil is sold and available in some products. Medical prescriptions/licenses have been increasingly available from 2007 to 2010.

Italy #
 
Possession for recreational use is a misdemeanor crime in Italy and some medical use has been approved. In 2015, Italy is considering legalizing cannabis. See [Italian parliament mulls cannabis motion : July 16, 2015](http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/italian-parliament-mulls-cannabis-motion/story-fnihsg6t-1227443503602?nk=0007a72cb8af0dd467dcf970e3a27556-1437009263) . Cannabis preparations and THC are illegal to use, sell, own, cultivate etc. Personal use is decriminalized, with penalties for possession of small amounts (< 5g) resulting in confiscation of passport or driver's license. Possession of larger quantities is treated as possession with intent to sell and is subject to stronger penalties. (unconfirmed) In 2008, the Italian Supreme Court created a legal exception for personal use of cannabis by Rastafarians. See [http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/abruzzo/supreme-court-lets-rastas-keep-their-weed](http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/abruzzo/supreme-court-lets-rastas-keep-their-weed) and [http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2008/jul/18/europe_rastafarians_can_smoke_ma](http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2008/jul/18/europe_rastafarians_can_smoke_ma) .

Jamaica #
 
Possession of ganja in Jamaica is decrminalized up to two ounces, it is legal to smoke where it is allowed to smoke cigarettes, and it is now legal to grow. Medical use has also been approved. Sale for recreational use is prohibited by Jamaican law, but the law is widely ignored and cannabis is sold openly in many markets.

(thanks E) However, viable cannabis seeds are available in headshop as of June 2005, selling for Y1300-Y2500 (12-23 USD) each. Growing the seeds is illegal and the shops have warnings that the seeds are just curiosity samples and the shop will not answer questions about cultivation. (unconfirmed) (thanks S4M)

Netherlands #
 
Cannabis possession is decriminalized up to only 5 grams and it is still sold openly in some "coffee shops". The legal status of cannabis in the Netherlands has vacilated from more to less restrictive over the last forty years. 
 
 Although cannabis is technically illegal to possess and sell in the Netherlands, the government does not prosecute individuals (over 18) who smoke cannabis. Possession of less than 5 grams or growing of less than 5 plants will not be prosecuted. Cannabis seeds are reportedly not controlled and are legal to possess and sell. Certain cafes/coffee shops are allowed to sell cannabis and hold 100 grams behind the counter and another 500 grams in the back. Paradoxically, we have received unconfirmed reports that coffee shops are not allowed to legally purchase cannabis. In March of 2003, the Dutch government changed the law to allow doctors to prescribe cannabis for medical purposes through pharmacies. [BBC Sep 2003](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3196849.stm) . 
 
 On Jan 1, 2008, Dutch police will officially be disallowed from smoking cannabis while off duty.

Norway #
 
Recreational use, possession, and distribution of cannabis are ilelgal in Norway and no medical exception is allowed. The penalty for possession of small quantities of Cannabis (less than 15 g) is normally 3000 NOK. For more than 15 g, higher penalties apply and can include community service and jail in some cases. The Norwegian police does not punish use, possession and distribution of Marijuana as harshly as hashish, and hashish in Norway is often adulterated with other ingredients. (unconfirmed) (thanks S and numerous others)(last updated Nov 7 2015)
 
North Korea #
 
Technical legal status unknown, assumed to be controlled, however reports indicate that smoking cannabis is tolerated and not prosecuted. "A 2010 report by Open Radio for North Korea, an American nongovernmental organization based in Seoul, cited an anonymous North Korean source as saying that Kim Jong Un's regime does not consider marijuana to be a drug."

Pakistan / Peshawar #
 
We have been told that in Peshawar and the northern parts of Pakistan, smoking Hash (Charas) is socially acceptable and even sold on an open market where the government does not intrude. One can be jailed for up to six months if they are caught with Charas in other parts of the country, but it's apparently very common to bribe the police with as little as $5-20 to get out of an arrest. We are also told that many shops have Charas behind the counter, but only sell to known customers.

Peru #
 
According to Article 2999 in the Peruvian penal code, personal possession of small amounts individual drugs is not a crime. The list of maximum quantities include 2000mg of cocaine, 5000 mg cocaine basic paste, 8000 mg of cannabis, 2000mg of cannabis derivatives, 1000 mg of opium latex or 200mg of opium derivatives, 250mg of MDA or MDMA.

Poland #
 
Possession of cannabis is illegal in Poland. Even small amounts (1g) are not tolerated and penalties can be high. Since Jun 2005 according to the new law, a new resocialization program for drug addicts has been formed as a alternative to putting young people in prison. Cannabis is still a public enemy treated the same way as 'hard drugs'. (thanks RaN) 
 
 In 2006 an Erowid reader told us that possession of seeds is legal in Poland, and they are available through online vendors. (unconfirmed) (thanks D) (last updated Nov 2015)
 
Portugal #
 
Effective July 2001, personal use of cannabis was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 (see [text of law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/portugal/lei30-2000.pdf) ). Possession of less than 25 g leaves and flowering tops, 5 g resin, 2.5 g oil, or 500 mg THC is not regarded as a criminal offense, though the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale, or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit, are criminal offenses punishable by jail time. We are told the police have a rather tolerant attitude towards cannabis consumption in major cities, and it is largely ignored. (thanks P)
 
Romania #
 
According to a contributor: "Cannabis growing, possession or selling is prohibited. Seeds have no legal status (neither legal nor illegal). If you are caught with seeds they will take them and you will receive not more than a warning. Possession of small amounts (1-3 grams) is only punishable by a small fine (~ $150-200). For bigger quantities possession or for growing (only for personal use) you can stay 3 or 6 years in prison. If you sell cannabis you can take over 6 years in prison." (unconfirmed) (thanks EG)
 
Russia #
 
Cannabis is a prohibited drug under Russian law. We have been told that the 2003 change to decriminalize personal possession of small amounts has been rescinded, but have been unable to confirm that. Previously, in Dec 2003, personal possession of up to 20 g of cannabis was legalized (see [article](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8339.php) ). (thanks o, QBM) (Last updated Oct 14 2011)

It is generally said that it is legal to keep and smoke cannabis inside one's own home with the windows closed. Spanish laws about cannabis possession are not 100% clear. Possession and use are illegal, but there may be an exception for private behavior. If someone can see or detect you using it, it is potentially a crime. Cannabis is illegal in Spain, with small amounts punishable by fine. Larger amounts, cultivation, or sale are punishable by jail terms. Cannabis seeds are legal and are commonly available for purchase. (last updated Nov 14, 2015)

Cannabis possession is a crime in the United Kingdom with no exception for medical use. Cannabis was reclassified as a [Class B](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/uk/uk_law_definitions.shtml) drug in Britain in January 2009. 
- Oct, 2008 - A draft order was proposed to return cannabis to Class B, effective Jan 26, 2009. The proposed amendment would add cannabinol, cannabinol derivatives, and cannabis resin to the statute, also under Class B. It is to be debated in Fall 2008.
