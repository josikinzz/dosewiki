Well i know it isn't exactly big, or exactly dandy, but its a start! I have recently ran into some of this compound and have found very little on it. Anyone else have anything to contribute?

I don't know if I missed something, but he said he has 4-propoxy-3,5-Dimethoxy-**phenethylamine**.  That would not be 3C-P (an amphetamine), it would be Proscaline.

Another rariety.  Jealous.  


I've only tried mescaline once...seemed like more trouble than it was worth, with all the fluxed cactus flesh tea I had to down--it tasted like ass.  The effects were not quite what I expected (although the dose was very low); it felt quite sedating for a psychedelic, with significant myorelaxant effects.   None of the zing of the dimethoxy-amphetamines or the glorious mental accession of LSD, but a very peaceful experience nonetheless, with a nice afterglow to boot.


I wonder if the analogues are better.  Clearly, one of the problems with mescaline is the lack of potency.  Escaline and proscaline (or even better, the TMAs) should rectify this.

Once upon a time, the 3C / amphetamine homologue of proscalline appeared on the Japanese research chemical marketplace, which was then almost legal or at least tolerated over there, but the most notable thing said about this chemical, according to reports on bluelight, was that it was highly stimulatory in nature even 24 hours after ingestion.


Hmm, I wonder what higher dosages of proscaline would develop into?  I somehow think, based on MPM's (PiHKAL, #138) somewhat disappointing performance, that 3,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propylphenethanamine might be a better allocation of psychedelic time and resources than proscaline, but then 300mg proscaline might lead to a whole new level of highness.


Any attempts to take proscaline to that level should be taken incrementally over time and very carefully, I might add.

I picked up some of the 3C-P but never tried it as it got less than stellar reviews.  Proscaline sounds ok, but nothing too great.  Of course, I'd still sign up for a try.


Please write up some reports if anyone gets to try!

Nah, I've read a few other reports of 4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyPEA (some private communications) and it seems like it has something missing from the 3-propoxy, isopropoxy or ethoxy compound - probably the slightly more stimulant edge it has over the aforementioned three. Still has a long way to go though to compete in the same league as mescaline (although not having to consume two fifths of a gram of a drug in order to get the full effect would def get a thumbs up from my stomach! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif))

If you want another hunch of mine as to what seems to be a potential gem, then I'd say 3,5-dimethoxy-4-methylthioPEA (thiomescaline) just seems to light all the right lights in my head. Mind you, the psychedelic PEAs I've tried that have a 4-alkylthio group have all been a bit strange; so far 2C-T-2 being the closest to my expectations & DOT(aleph-1) being the most bemusing (DOT def deserves another test drive at some point as it feels like it has huge potential, just not quite sure how to access it)

what is the reason that no halogenated mescaline analogs were made, could one not put a bromo group in the 4 position?

I read great things about thiobuscaline, being less of a psychedelic, but a good euphoriant.


Maybe with a wee bit of tweaking (NO! BAD BLUELIGHTER! not that kind of tweaking![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)) a nice halfway point could be had.


Thioisoproscaline and thioproscaline, now there are two I want to give a go.

Someone has got some proscaline, and would like some more information before proceeding with the ingestion of 50mg 

Does it cause pupil dilatation ?

In pikhal it is said no hangover is felt, although sleep is not possible before the 12 hour. Could anyone confirm this ?

Well just would like to report I discoved a vendor who is synthing proscaline right now.


I have placed an order as this one has interested me for freaking ever. Like since my early days. Plus I would like to enjoy a "mescalesque" experience without actually chugging cactus.

From pihkal reports I think thioescaline or thiomescaline would be the best of the 345s with a sulfur. 3,5 DiMeO 4 Bromo PEA would be very interesting too.  I've been wondering why that one isn't in pihkal.  It's amphetamine brother is though...

Riga I dont exactly know. I just discovered it, and reading some reports it seems they've been trying for a bit but I dont know how long.


Hoping they didnt get scammed. In the meantime they happen to have 4-meo-pcp which interests me a great deal.

new TR from another board


> ive had 100mg of proscaline sitting around for a while. i took it yesterday. in the beggining after an hour 1/2 i was lying on my bed in pur extacy, then i got up and watched tv. this turned the trip into a difficult time. i got paranoid and stuff. for about 5 more hours i was tripping really bad. i took 3mg of zanax and watched some of the phish clifford ball dvd. it helped so much. i watched, sang, and danced while i smoked bowl after bowl after bowl.

Rhodium- "like mescaline but comes on faster (within a half hour) and there is no nausea". Seems pretty fuckin' nice to me. I would try a low dose first, like 5mg's just to see that there are no adverse effects and just work up from there, maybe trying 30mg's if all is well with the 5mg's. Oh, you are very lucky, I'm jealous.

**Proscaline - p.140 in Pihkal or 3,5-Dimethoxy-4-propoxy-PEA**


Hi everyone.

I have several caps of the above chemical 40mg each. Pihkal made it sound like a medium dose, 60 mg is high. But person who gave it to me this  said

that 60 mg is a medium and higher level should be 80 - 120mg. He is aware of what Pihkal says...


Does anyone had experiences with this chem?

bump!


I have ~150mg of this compund left Ive been holding onto for about a year now. I initally took 75mg when I got it in, as did a friend, but it produced minimal results. Felt a little something- initial claminess and slight nausea follwed by minor mood elevation, giddiness, pupil dilation, but no fireworks. Where do you guys think I should go from here? Should I up it to 100, or should I bite the bullet and go for the whole 150 since the other 50 is pretty much useless? I wouldn't think it has a steep dose response curve due to it's high active dosage, but you never know considering it's relatively unexplored. Any input is appreciated.

well... it goes like this. there are some good things, and some bad things, and some unexpected.


the good: mood enhanced, heightened senses (or at least this was the impression), very clear head (clearest on any substance ive tried so far), very much in control


the bad: long comeup, some nausea, some anorexia, long period of stimulation afterwards, high price/dose


the unexpected: very very discreet visuals, to the point where if one didnt look for them they might be completly missed. very much a "2c" kind of feeling about the whole thing... hard to explain. it is like you are on a hollowed out version of 2ci, without the visuals and a lot more clear headed.


ill post a more detailed TR in that particular section, though i wouldnt call this substance spectacular. if the price would go down, then i might reconsider (perhaps this is more of a problem with my vendor).

in my experience, dosing at the very bottom of shulgin's dosage range usually isn't enough.  i wouldn't write the stuff off as "hollowed out 2ci" until you take a +++ dose.  i'm fairly sure that you were just at a ++, maybe even a +...


it does suck how expensive this stuff is, but its not really much more expensive per dose than LSD (if you're buying individual doses of LSD, that is).

Wonder if Nasal would be an effective ROA of this.

i know what you mean about dosing at the low end of the scale, but its always my policy when dealing with unknown substances... might have enough for a longer and more powerful trip (perhaps in the 50mg range), but will wait a while. been feeling a bit drained really. but personally i enjoyed it at this level as well.


i also didnt mean the hollowed out 2ci in a bad way. and like all substances, your results may vary. 


the smell of the substance wasnt really all that bad, but the taste was chemical, and i suspect it to hurt when insufflated.

Tried it recently and it was def missing something - more of a euphortiant than a psychedelic. I've got a couple of doses of 4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyPEA but haven't got around to trying it yet. Will report back when I do

Hmm a euphoriant doesn't sound all that bad to me, I should be receiving this as well. The timeline isn't all that clear to me though I should consult pihkal.

As a proper psychedelic I will fall back on mescaline hcl if need be, my days of cactus blubber are behind me.

Lower doses of the 2cs to me seem like a euphoriant with little insight, revelations, ect. Maybe higher doses of proscaline might expand the mind a little more. I think peeps are writing this one off too quickly.

I heard from someone who has access to it, apparently together with friends who have experience with it that 75 mg can definitely get you in over your head. So about that 80-120 mg, it might be a purity thing or a personal sensitivity thing but it shouldn't necessarily be that PIHKAL is aiming much too low again.

Makes me wonder anyway, Shulgin should always have the pure material, perhaps some of the time when people think they are dosing too low it's because of a difference in purity?


About the proscaline: I do hope 40-50 is adequate because it means my 150 will go further.

i believe you will definetly feel 50mg, however you might want to combine it with something else to fully enjoy a new flavor to a trip. that is to say, a low dose might get you somewhere, but if you use it on top of another psychedelic (like lsd for instance) you might be better off.

^ this one with JWH-018 (or weed) really gives a different effect. Becomes immersive (sp) and more psychedelic.  On its own, doesn't really have a strong effect but when cannaboids are offered it really goes somewheres

Proscaline was tested at 50mg and found to be quite euphoric. Pleasant stimulation and some CEV. Some anxiety at the onset but thereafter was a nice ride but nothing too deep into the psychedelia at this dose.   This seems like a good social lubricant.


75mg seems to be the sweet spot for this one.  At 75mg there was emotional opening without any negative thoughts.  Bodyload is nonexistent. Lasted a good 8 hours with lingering stimulation for another 2 hours.

Sounds like 5-MeO-DALT from phenethylamine family. Can you compare these two? I will get a good amount of this chemical in the next few weeks.

Proscaline has a longer duration, right? Also I think the stimulation would be less comfortable with 5-MeO-DALT than with proscaline but I have not tried either of them. Just sounds like it. Mescaline absolutely has one of the best types of euphoria for me so I am quite interested in trying proscaline. I have something along the lines of 150 mg of this material.

 the dalt has a tryptamine feeling whereas proscaline is more like mescaline/mdma and more electric/stimulating. procaline headspace is clearer.  i prefer the proscaline.

^ Thanks for this info, I think I know what you're talking about. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


^^ Yeah, proscaline should be more long-lasting, and it is a plus to me. 

I am very excited about trying this chemical.


Offtopic: hmm, new avatar? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Several days ago I had experience with this drug. I took 50 mg two days after my LSD experience(1.5 blotters). I thought about publishing a TR, but this drug lacked action, so I was lazy to keep records. 


I would this drug as phenethylamine version of 5-MeO-DALT. Light, mellow and long-lasting. Not very euphoric, but quite pleasant. It is also "colder" but cleaner and thought process isn't disrupted. There were waving and patterning during the peak, but then visuals subsided, and I wasn't focused on them. 

It mixed with alcohol amazingly well. During T+08:00 -- T:09:30 (times are approximate) I drinked 1 liter of beer, and damn, alcohol was a lot better than usual: definite psychedelic tint and less sedating, and a lot of subtle differences which create unique complex feel to this drug combination.

Tried this one up to 60mgs but gave up after that. It was nice, mellow, but pretty uneventful. I just wasn't getting anywheres as I pushed the dosage. Lacked the visuals and effects that I was expecting to be more mescaline like. I decided to mix it 50/50 with some 2C-D and found them both mixed really well together. A few bumps of P with some vaped JWH-018 had a great effect as well. Just wasn't that great on it's own, IMO.

ive tried this one a few times, even at close to a 100mg..


a few of my friends and i had some and after working our way up from 20 to 100mg then running out of product decided that shulgin ws def off on the dosage. its more potent than mescaline but not by too much.Id bet 125-150mg would have been enough for an actual noteworthy experience


but alas i have no more,nor does my previous source ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Ive recently had the opportunity to try this chem again. After a relatively long period of cleanness, you could say my tolerances were back to zero. 

The dose was ~40mg... compared to my previous trip at 30mg this was a different, more powerful trip, but again, not overpowering in any way.


I found it to be pleasant, long lasting (around 8h easy), quite clearheaded, and even a bit visual (certainly more visual than 30mg), with senses again enhanced (careful with loud music, as the senses seem to come into focus in turns). On the downside, it was accompanied by some body load (some "waves" of nausea every hour or so) along with muscle tension (especially in the back), and not that much increased music appreciation (which was a bit dissappointing).


The CEVs from this were on the other hand quite interesting to say the least. Might have been the brightest ive seen, with the closed eye darkness seeeming open space, with flashing lights that were indeed beautiful to look at. later on, some landscapes developed, but alas, they were hard to focus.


and this is also the first substance ive actually heard/ composed music in my head... and im not a musical person at all, but it did sound beautiful. It was like tunning in to some radio while driving slowly down a summer road, you hear some familiar music, and you enjoy the mix the dj plays.


also, this time, the "erotic" was also explored, and it was quite delicious, not impairing at all, and getting a backrub felt amazing.


next day, no hangover, just tiredness from not sleeping, and a difficult time sleeping even 20h after it. some muscle pain due to excessive dancing and prolongued sex, but really cant complain about that ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png).... might write a TR later on if i get the time


overall, a very nice experience, and while i continue to think there are more worthwhile substances out there, i continue to believe this has a place (theres a lot worse substance out there). i will be revisiting, but the long duration will keep this reserved for just very occasional use.

hmm, not really like fluffy clouds, as the "background" so to say wasnt all light, it was more darker tones... but at times, when just laying relaxed, it did feel a lot like my mind was just bringing forth various dream sequences... it was actually a bit distinct from the more common form of geometric patterns i get for cevs. but the best part was that my mind was conjuring up music, making me think i was musically inclined (i dont have a musical talent irl)

Tried this chem in 20 & 40 mg. 20 mg trip was very uneventful, exept  that my brain felt speedy and colors were brighter and body load resembled flu like symptoms. With 40 mg body load was very uncomfortable and speedy with very clear head. There was a lot happening in the mental department, all sorts of ideas on self improvement, lots of understanding about myself and my mind but body load made me wonna lay in bed.  Zero euphoria. I also smoked quiet a bit of bud during the entire experience hoping  it will ease uncomfortable body load i was having.  No CEVs or OEVs, just all lights seemed to be really bright  and yellow color became too pronounced. Thinking of trying proscaline at a higher dose, hoping for it to be more euphoric/psychedelic, less body load after the come up. Anyone has any advice on this and the dose?

anyone try vaping this? i vaped escaline to no success. Hearing that proscaline is the 5-meo-dalt of the PEA family makes me sad ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) unless it's like vaping 5-meo-dalt, which would make me a happy panda.


i have 1g to work with, going to try 60-70mg tonight (have to read a bit more to see if thats on the high side or about right). Will take some notes and compare to escaline and mescaline.

is that you rplanned vaped or oral dose? or different ROA?


in case of oral 60mg should be somewhere in the high middle to strong as far as i would be concerned, with little if any tolerance for psychedelics... if thats vaped.. then i cant really predict anything....


alas, i think proscaline, as 5-meo-dalt, is a somewhat less psychedelia interesting compound that, while having its uses and good times, should be reserved for enhancing rather than expanding the mind. ymmv of course, as i feel the same about some other compunds that others swear by (2c-i for instance)

oral dose, i won't vape it unless i know it's safe and worthwhile. 


I ended up taking 70mg, one hour in and it's starting to hit, feels like escaline and mescaline so far for the come up. 


i was really hoping this would provide more psychedelia than escaline but if it's not the case then that's fine, i think it's still going to be a pleasurable drug based on what i'm feeling so far. Sometimes i like 2c-i over 2c-e for that same kind of reason, more fun recreational and not slam you over the head intense.


one thing i noticed is that proscaline is very rocky/crystally in texture, like chunky whereas escaline is fluffy and sticky almost, sticks to itself kind of thing. Not that, that is important or anything just interesting i suppose.

Have you read the thread? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Based on it and PIHKAL, my *interpretation* would be like:


10 mg: might be absolute threshold, who knows though...

15-20 mg: threshold to weak

30-45 mg: weak to moderate

45-70 mg: moderate to strong

I took 40mg of proscaline orally today. It seemed to really potentiate MDMA and make DMT last longer  than it usually would. I'm wondering if it might have some MAOI action?

I think the mescaline analogs we've seen so far have all been more or less of a let down. Upping the dose has often been suggested, but it doesn't seem like it turns a crappy psychedelic into something worthwhile. 


3C-P sounds slightly better than proscaline, while 3C-E most certainly sucks more ass than Escaline (which it self is a bad, bad imitation of Mescaline) MAL seems to be a little too harsh on the body, while AL is alright but too long compared to how mild it is.


the 2C's just seems to be better.

If it's anything like Allylescaline, I bet Proscaline and Escaline would absolutely magical combined with a tryptamine.

3c-p sounds like it could be a real winner but the duration is just way too long for me. I'm aware this is the proscaline thread but has anyone tried plugging 3c-p? I highly doubt it but I'm curious how this will affect it's duration


Back to the topic at hand, sorta... to anyone who has taken all available mescaline analogs which one seems the most worthwhile? An online buddy says that MAL isn't too bad until you reach higher doses, I would give it a go but the only vendor I know that stocks it prices it absurdly high.... high enough that I don't think will be worth the "chance" of being good.

I am also wondering about plugged 3C-P.  After reviewing this thread and some linked reports, I am now thinking I'd like to experiment with this at some point.  Sounds nice.  And I like long durations when they're for nice states. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Don't get me wrong, I like long durations as well but IIRC a couple reports say that the 1/2-3/4 of this trip are great and the rest is exhausting, pehaps a benzo could solve this. Either way I have access to this chem so maybe I'll give it a shot eventually. If I can cut some of the duration by plugging count me in but info on this chem is scarce at best.

There are several TRs in the Trip Reports forum... I think there are links in the B&D 3C-P thread.  A few made it sound pretty awesome.  There's one about combining with mescaline and this person said it was a super synergistic combo that was amazingly euphoric and sensual.

Thanks I'll check those out, I haven't looked up 3c-p TR's for a couple years and at the time info was very scarce, maybe some of these new trip reports will convince me to give it a shot. I think a combination of plugging and using benzos to knock me out when I'm ready to throw in the towel could probably solve the duration issues, only thing is I have no clue what a plugged dose is nor the dose response curve should I choose to titrate up.

Yeah last time I looked up 3C-P there were very, very few reports and the consensus seemed to be "boring".  Now I read about what people have done with it since and it sounds quite nice.

I'm getting some too, i don't usually combine when i first try a substance (actually i never do) but would it be worth combining this with 4-HO-MET or 5-MEO-MiPT?? for instance to give it some more depth... I know people have talked about combining it with a tryptamine.?

I will say that I tried it once, a few months ago, at I think 40mg, and it was underwhelming and then after a few hours I got a RAGING headache that nearly ruined my night... eventually I powered through it and had a good night, but the 3C-P did not really contribute much to that, it was just because I was hanging out with friends and having fun.  I was however still on opiates and I wasn't having good trips towards the end of that period.  I actually took ibogaine a week after that and finally got off them.  I'll give it a try again sometime but I'm in no hurry for another headache.

Yes, but 3C-P is the amphetamine (alpha-methyl) analogue of proscaline. Hence the comparisons. For sure extensive 3C-P discussion belongs in the 3C-P thread but call me very interested in the whole enterprise.


Proscaline sounds like a version of mescaline that has been stripped of most of the spirituality and vision quests but is still very warm, cozy and loungey. And 3C-P would be the extra sweet version of that.

Reminds me of reading about 4-HO-DET. Apparently if you go high enough there is still ego death type stuff waiting for you, but people still think that it has the intricate wild psilocin visuals but here is the kicker: with most of the real spirituality stripped.

The fact that DPT and analogues are truly freaky and VERY spiritual / "religious even if you are not" throws me off. Is it just that the compounds have different dose-response curves and people are just used to going that far with DPT because there isn't that much at lower doses? That would make sense: it would make spiritual / psychotherapeutic vs. recreational effects very relative phenomena dosage-wise, and not coupled.. just like other tendencies of psychedelic activity are often not necessarily package deals.

Know what I mean?

Pretty interesting theory Solipsis. In theory/ideal everything ought to be spiritual, because genuine spirituality is wholistic, there is no distinction between the profane and sublime. Yet it's hard to deny that some PDs are entheogenic, and some more than others. I would put DPT, mescaline and LSD in that category. Perhaps it can be regarded as another axis akin to the therapeutic index, like you suggest.

well ive read some reviews and think it best to split into to 35 mg piles and do it that way

And yes mescaline and analogues / homologues that can be a bit hard on the gut seem to be taken best by splitting into 2 or 3 portions and staggering the dose a little. Just like MDMA crystal, going in too hard can lead to very sudden bouts of vomiting that make you lose your precious material (often that is a bigger issue than discomfort). Then again I know from experience that waiting too long can also lead to lost material since even with staggered dosing after about an hour one may still throw up. If you pre-dissolve your material in a neutral drink like a glass of water, it should be absorbed pretty quickly in the stomach compared to a capsule.


I am talking mostly about mescaline itself by the way, not sure about homologues like prosca.

You're not thinking of using it stealthily are you? Come on... having to hold back is such a terrible shame to do on something like this.


Proscaline is apparently a bit more easygoing and less deep than mescaline, but still I would not forget about the possibility of crying tears of joy out of the blue - having your soul touched - being reborn through lightning.. things like that.

And no the vomiting isn't done casually either.


I wonder myself about plugging or IMing mesc and its analogues, but havent tried it yet. It may help with part of the picture like body load or vomiting, but probably not all of it. Snorting sometimes makes matters worse for a while, depending on the compound.


You are making me wanna do mescaline over the holidays, but not in a stealthy way.

Yea.... the crying bit haha.... my girlfriend and I did proscaline last year in a huge snow storm in Central Park, sat on one of the frozen ponds and listen to Ave Maria, really spiritual. I didn't read much over this thread but I'll say proscaline for us was very dream-like and flighty. Had a light feel to it, but I believe we only dosed 45mg, at most. I really wanna do it again now thinking about it

me and my gf want to trip this weekend, her first time and my 100th or so (but my first one in 3 years or so)


we have access to al-lad, shrooms, and proscaline


any opinions on which is best for her?

MAL is mainly considered the better of the mescaline analogues i think. But for HER go with AL-LAD most definitely.

I'd hazard a guess that it wouldn't, as I know of no common drug tests that test for any psychedelics whatsoever, outside of PCP. None the less, this is just speculation, I can't tell you for sure whether or not you would pass. For that reason, we try to avoid drug testing questions here in PD, so please keep that in mind with your future posts. Thanks!

Does any of you knows if the shelf life of this compound is stable like 2C-X ? Is it the same for Escaline?

It should be at least as stable as mescaline, which has been found in peyote in archaeological sites from ~5700 years ago.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's great to hear a report from this fairly under-researched chemical, and welcome to the forum. I look forward to hearing what you have to say about it after it's all wrapped up.


Proscaline seems to have a very low potency.

I was trying to edit my previous post on my phone. Somehow this resulted in deleting it altogether. So, to summarise, I created an account a few days ago while tripping on about 100 mg's Proscaline. Instead of rewriting what I typed then, and on which above quote by perpetualdawn is a response, I posted a trip report here: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/800618-102-mg-s-Proscaline-(20160809)?p=13740339#post13740339](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/800618-102-mg-s-Proscaline-(20160809)?p=13740339#post13740339)

I tried this chemical for the first time recently and my overall  impression of it is that it's a decent psychedelic for a mild trip, but  its kind of pointless. It has a mescaline-like feel to it, but it's like  a watered down imitation. I find it lacking in some ways compared to  mescaline and most other psychedelics I've tried, and it doesn't seem to  offer any advantages over mescaline.


My dosage was around 45mg. I  would describe it as a fairly light trip, but during the trip I was  thinking that I would want to take a little bit less next time because  of the physical effects and a general sense of agitation. There was some  nausea, but it seemed milder than what I've experienced with mescaline  and 2C-x. The bodyload wasn't particularly bad for a phenethylamine, but  it still made me pretty uncomfortable at times.


Despite its lack  of intensity, I found proscaline to be very nice for listening to and  playing music. I jammed on guitar for a while and it was great. It was  like playing guitar on LSD. I listened to recordings of myself later and  it sounded better than anything I could play sober. Still, there are  other more enjoyable psychedelics available that have a similar effect.


I  enjoyed the visual effects but they were subtle. It was similar to a  low dose of mescaline. If visuals are what you are looking for I  wouldn't recommend this chemical.


Overall, I wasn't impressed by  proscaline. I don't see a reason the use it considering the abundance of  natural sources of mescaline, not to mention the amazing lysergamides  and tryptamines that are available. I'll probably try it again but I  don't plan on getting any more when I run out.


I'm thinking about  trying ~25-30mg of proscaline with ~10mg of metocin. I'm hoping it will  add what's missing from proscaline and create an experience more  similar to a mescaline trip.

I have to agree that I don't find Proscaline very interesting. Even at a heavy dose (100mg). It was definitely fun and a nice experience. I would compare 100mg of proscaline to 30mg's of 2cb, strength wise.

Can anyone let me know what their proscaline looks like?  I got some recently from a vendor who is pretty hit or miss... I received escaline from them previously, which appeared as a chalky white nondescript powder, which turned out to contain escaline and a bunch of unknowns, so is basically garbage (haven't tried it, highly unsure whether I should).  But I've also received great quality products from this same vendor.  The proscaline I just got appears very distinctive, it's slightly yellowish, flaky crystals, shimmery and scaly.  Just wondering if the description matches anyone else who has gotten it.  I will probably send off to GC/MS sometime, but I have a lot of things I want to do that with...

The proscaline I have looks the way you describe it. Shiny, slightly yellow crystals. It looks a little bit like raw sugar.

Interesting, mine is like flakes of crystal, not like sugar crystals, but it's very shiny indeed and slightly yellow.  I'm feeling pretty good about this one being the real deal... wish the escaline had been because it sounds better.  But oh well.

I haven't looked at it in a while, but I just pulled it out and it is pretty flaky. Not quite like sugar, but more sparkly and crystalline than other RCs.

The Proscaline HCL I have received (from the same vendor as pure white 3C-P and an excellent batch of 6-APDB)  looks VERY similar in appearance to Allylescaline HCL (and similar to Mescaline HCL and Methallylescaline HCL) I have from different guys - brownish small particles clumping powder with slight crystalline shine to it. Not very flaky but it gets in clumps. I  suppose oxidation plays a role in coloring the substance. 


I will test  mine within a few weeks and post results.


Do you guys also have HCL salts of your Proscaline?

The color is just coming from the impurities from the synthesis, not from the molecule itself. The shape of the crystals can also greatly vary depending on the conditions (temperature l, solvent ratios, impurities, etc. ). Thus, non of this is more than some hint but nothing so rely on. 


I guess a reagent test could give you some indication but, as you said, gc/ms or hplc/ms would be the way to play safe.

Tried my brownish-yellow proscaline few days ago at 35mg (one single dose) and as far as  effects go, it felt like a tuned down 3C-P, which precisely fits the profile,  my experience was very similar to pretty much everyone's descriptions of it. Reagent test showed it pretty much the same as what's posted on youtube (orangy-red Marquis, yellow-brown Mandelin, brown Mecke) but I didnt perform any analytical measurements on it, too damn expensive ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)


Effects felt were  mostly entactogenic and empathetic with minimal visual disturbances (there was some sparkling in my vision corners though) and mental affection,  felt like all effects were emanating from my chest (which is somewhat a signature for me for mescaline and all it's analogs), developed by 1,5 hrs and never went over plus ++. 

2,5 hrs into the experience I took about 20mg of 4-HO-EPT dissolved in water to round it up and had a great time reading, watching movies and playing video games afterwards. Also had a bottle of wine with my GF few hours later and it made me feel even more empathetic and warm (imo AL and Proscaline are mixing with alcohol quite well) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


 All in all, an easy and pleasurable compound that appears to be another nice mixer for tryptamines and lysergamides, just like AL and MAL for me. I liked Proscaline more than AL but less than MAL.

Sounds like my experience, mine is sparkly, slightly off-white flaky crystals though.


I posted a TR of this, it was a great experience: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads...me-A-Wonderfully-Complete-Musical-Exploration](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/820818-Proscaline-First-Time-A-Wonderfully-Complete-Musical-Exploration)

Would you guys say it's a bit like 2C-D but longer lasting? Cause that's how it sounds to me from the descriptions, having never tried Proscaline, but lots of 2C-D.

I've only taken 2C-D at low doses, I never had much and tried to use it as a nootropic as was being discussed years ago.  Worked pretty well for that.  Never tried pushing it to higher doses though.  To me proscaline felt sort of like mescaline-lite without the deep spiritual connection, also kind of like LSD-lite.  The body feel was much closer to mescaline than to any 2C-X I've taken a full dose of.

As I understand it, 2C-D would be "colder" and a lot more "heady" compared to Proscaline, which undeniably has light euphoric body buzz. It reminded me of Allylescaline a lot in the way it feels inside the body but it felt clearer, sharper, "zestier" and with a lot more defined psychedelia and entactogenic effects. This similarity kinda makes sense to me now as I'm looking at the AL and P molecules - they appear very very similar to each other.


More testing is needed with this one, I'm glad I've reserved enough for later! %)

Yeah, I would say they're pretty similar. They're both pretty stimulating and just a little bit psychedelic. From my limited experience, 2C-D seems more euphoric and easier on the body. Proscaline has some body load but it's not too terrible.

Yeah I found proscaline to have some light bodyload in the form of energy and stimulation that felt a little alien, until I hit the peak whereupon it felt wonderful and comfortable.

My girl and I tried Proscaline a couple of times together recently, last time I have mixed 45mg of 6-APDB, 28mg of 3C-P and 30mg of P, when she took just 25mg of Proscaline. 


I am always interested in my girlfriend's opinion on psychoactives as she doesn't really know much about pharmacology or chemistry (not that I'm a professor at it :D), neither she has basic information on drugs, unless I'd tell her. Also she is terribly afraid of bad trips and a "mindfuck" in general but she is always curious about my research. So her opinion on this matter is very unbiased and genuine. She tried quite a lot of different psychedelics over the time of being with me, her favorites are LSD, AL-LAD and Mescaline, she likes MDMA and 6-APDB too. 

After trying 25 mg of Proscaline, she said: "I feel like nothing can shake my calm, like I don't care anymore and it's good and fluffy! It reminds me of Mescaline in how it makes me feel. Yes, I feel pretty good, I like it!" 


So we had great time playing mini-golf in a forestry settings, walking park trails and listening to music. Truly, the high from Proscaline (at doses less than 40mg) is very life-affirming, warm, with no "mindfuck" at all. Music sounded great, I truly was enjoying everything from classical to techno - music made me feel quite euphoric! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


IME Proscaline synergised very well preloading with 700mg Aniracetam (usually enhances music appreciation for me), 500mg Phenibut and 600mg Agmatine. Also felt synergistic effects of P taken on the tail end of 6-APDB and 3C-P mix. Took forever before I went to sleep after all that taken (3C-P just lasts and lasts), stayed up for about 30hrs, then slept for 20hrs straight %)


IMO Proscaline is a great psychedelic "mixer" and very pleasant on its own - perfect "museum" level at 25-30mg and a definite mood boost. I think I'm going to need more of this material for thorougher research, it felt very pleasant! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Nice, I've got to try my 3C-P still.  Would you characterize 3C-P as more psychedelic than proscaline?  or how does it differ?  I know 3C-E is basically barely psychedelic, more of a great amphetamine-style stimulant, but from what I've read it seems like 3C-P is a bit heavier.

^^^ 3C-P at dose around 30mg produces  light psychedelic effects and general feeling of trippyness but its the  mellow speedy afterglow I'm after with it - it kicks in about 6-9hrs  after ingestion and makes me feel floaty and happy for hours. IME 40mg and more will bring out unmistakable ++ and perhaps +++ experience. 3C-P feels  more psychedelic than P but on higher dosage, when the true psychedelia  comes out, it's not very comfortable to deal with. Proscaline feels a  lot more gentle and doesn't last nearly that long but also doesn't  produce such a fluffy headspace. Maybe it's just in my mind, as I see  their molecule structures and expect certain effects, but I think they  are very similar, with 3C-P being a Proscaline wrapped in an amphetamine  blanket thus feeling stronger but more synthetic and speedy.

^^^ Naturally, I'd apply Proscaline  anywhere I was applying Allylescaline before as the molecules are very  similar in action, Proscaline providing "cleaner" feel and more  psychedelia than AL IMO - I have already mixed P with 4-HO-EPT, 6-APDB, 3C-P and small amounts of 5-MeO-MiPT. I have a feeling it will be excellent with 4-sub tryptamines  in particular, but I'll try it with DMT, MET, LSD, AL-LAD, 4-Aco-MET,  4-HO-MET, 4-Aco-DET and 5-MeO-MiPT. IMO Proscaline and most Mescaline  analogs are good with alcohol too, which makes them a good choice for  social hangouts, YMMV! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Proscaline goes very nicely both with 4-Aco-MiPT and 4-Aco-MET, tried it  in combinations with dosages up to 40mg of P so far. I would recommend  to start with 30mg of P and about 15-20mg of a 4-sub tryptamine of your  choice. Results are increased duration, increased visual effects, deeper headspace and better mood lift, at least these are results that I got. The negatives are a little increase in nausea and possible mild headache at the end, especially if taken in larger doses.


Next ones on the list to try are Proscaline combos with 5-Meo-MiPT and AL-LAD ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

After some advise - direct advise might not be possible so hint if I'm ball park = seems all the x-escaline don't shine till above Shulgins measly doses - I was think somewhere round 75mg - I have one shot - I have

*maybe* 100mg. 100mg escaline seems fairly standard - turns out I only had 80 esc so 80mg it was - slight visuals - got an idea of it - some bodyload or discomfort at points but not very eventful.pros and esc have similar Shulgin doses, is proscaline stronger? I take it durations long - escaline said 8-12 and went on at least 15 I guess this is the same. Am I right to expect this to be very stimmy?

Proscaline is not very stimmy for me. It feels like a Mescaline's younger brother - fantasy, pleasant body feel, confidence boost and good moods are present with it, along with mild mental stimulation. But theres not much depth to it if taken by itself. I like it a lot as a social psychedelic and as a mixer with 4-sub tryptamines. It lasts quite a while too, about 12 hours but becomes quite benign at the end.


Proscaline is one of my girlfriend's favorites now, being so easy going and mood boosting! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Proscaline is maybe a little more potent than escaline from what I gather, but then again most people seem to write proscaline off as subtle and weak.  I have read of people taking 150mg and having a strong trip.  I haven't taken it above 50mg, I have taken it twice, once at 45mg and once at 50mg, and the first time (45mg) I had a wonderful night playing music, I wrote a TR about it, it was quite lovely and more powerful than I had expected.  It was emotionally powerful and reminded me a bit of the light side of a modest LSD dose and also it reminded me of mescaline.  I find proscaline more stimmy than mescaline, but it's not very stimmy.


I'd say do an allergy test but besides that, given you're very experienced and only have one shot, you'd be safe to take it all.

Have been using Proscaline in sub-psychedelic doses for two days in the row, as an anti-aggression and anxiolytic agent, dosed 10mg along with vitamins and a few nootropics here and there.

I know its too early to talk about it's effectiveness as such, but! I have noticed that even at this small dose it still was able to invoke the characteristic music enhancement properties (subjectively stronger than with Phenibut)! :D


Besides music enhancement it also made me a lot more easy-going without making me high, kinda similar to LSD microdosing, feels as it reduces my aggression rapidly and for a long time too.


So far I'm liking it in a therapeutic low dose - soft and fuzzy antidepressant qualities and very nicely increased music appreciation, I will continue for up to a week and observe subjective changes.

Have been taking it for more than two weeks and it appears to be almost side effect free (residual stimulation persist on the 12-13th hour - subtle but interferes with sleep) at doses 8-10mg a day, combines nicely with pretty much all supplements that I usually take. 


On days when I dose Proscaline, I avoid taking too much other stimulating substances. Russian anxiolytic drug Fabomotizole goes heavenly with Proscaline - the best antidepressant feel without being obviously high that I've experienced (especially with kratom on top)! %)


I am particularly interested in anti-aggression action of psychoactives and Proscaline fits the bill neatly for me.


I have also noticed that the best effect is achieved if I take P every other day or as needed, not every day.


IME Proscaline is waaaay more effective as an anti-depressant than Bupropion. And the reason why I mention it is that I have found that there is a similarity in their subjective anti-depressant qualities, maybe both substances activate certain receptors in a similar way?


I also really like that Proscaline is pretty potent (compared to other x-scalines) and only requires such small doses for a good feel that lasts all day. So far, I'm asking myself "Whats not to like about it?". I will continue using it as needed for heavier stress work days and on days when feeling dark blue.


I wonder if Big Pharma would ever consider using X-scalines molecular design to create pharmaceutical drugs, I think it is worth exploring it. 8)

Recently decided to have a pleasant afternoon with Proscaline and combined 30mg of it with 16mg of 4-HO-MiPT, while preloaded with some vitamins (I also was taking quazi-stimulants earlier that day) and 500mg of Phenibut. The result was surprisingly strong! I am glad I didnt go anywhere as I was at a full +++ for three hours or so and only could lay down with my girl listening to the music with the eyes closed. 8(


This trip started unusual as me and my girl took the mix of Proscaline and 4-HO-MiPT as we were getting intimate so the come up was happening during climax. I have never tried taking psychedelics during sex, its usually the other way around...8) I think it had contributed greatly to the trip quality! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

**A few notes on Proscaline**


I’ve recently revisited Proscaline, which I’ve had at 50 mg oral about 3-4 years ago. That time resulting in a nice, mild trip with warm colors and stimulation lasting 14 hours. This morning I took Proscaline again, this time by plugging (fasting). The evening before, I had taken 1,1 g of Phenibut. And I probably had some slight tolerance as I did 10 mg 2C-B 3 days ago. I’d guess it may have reduced effects by maybe 10-20%. Set & setting was pretty good.


I had a dose of 38 mg, divided in two and taken 20 min apart in order to reduce any nausea. Strangely I only felt slight alteration of headspace from those 2 doses. I had expected a rather quick come up… So 2 hours later I took an additional 14 mg. In total 62 mg rectally administrated. Probably equal to 100-110 mg oral (adjusted for tolerance). So PiHKAL's dosages seem to be too low, or rectal administration does not double the effects (which I've read that it should).


Within 10 min of the last dose it came on quite strong making me a bit restless. I was quite “intoxicated” from then on and felt like I’d have difficulty to appear normal. After 30 – 60 min I reached a plateau which lasted for 4-5 hours. Music became so much greater and felt very 3D. I experienced slight nausea a few times and once I got the taste of what I imagine rotten cactus may taste like in my mouth. Some ginger tea made it better. Touch felt very magical, maybe more towards MDMA than 2C-B. Got slight tracers and a keyboard with rainbow halos around the letters and very saturated colors! Sex was marvelous! On par with 2C-B, though a different feeling. Closed eyes I got some sparkling diamonds in red & green, but nothing to write home about.  Had a strong social need and was on the verge to call people and tell them how I miss them and appreciate them. Though as a rule I don't when tripping, but I almost broke the rule on Proscaline. So quite stong empathogenic effect!


I had two small epiphanies. I felt/saw (in my mind’s eye so to speak) a presence of an elderly native American man who felt like a relative, maybe ha even said that he was – I don’t remember now. He said that our culture which only focuses on effectiveness and short term gain is a disease threatening our planet. His message being that I need to help more people change their values & ideals so we consume less and cares more for Gaia /our planet.


I saw a spider and became awe-struck thinking that as I was “god” (like everything living also is “god”) and delighted in seeing myself in the spider!


If not a bit emotionally numbed from Phenibut, I’d probably have cried a little as I have some grief. Felt bad not being  able to. It ended in a slow comedown for another 5-6 h.


All in all, a nice compound which I would buy again if available. Though I have some left, I’ll probably choose a lysergamide or a 2C–X compound next time. But surely there is some cactus spirit in the molecule! Thank you Dr. David Nichols for making this compound!

Thanks for the mini-report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


One thing, that surprises me you get emotional blunting from phenibut.  Phenibut always makes me feel very emotional, I feel all of my emotions more intensely, although it certainly facilitates a positive emotional state.


Also of note, Dr. Shulgin first made/explored this, not Nichols. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Interesting thread....I've been sitting on some proscaline and escaline for quite a while and never tried either. Think I may give plugging them a go closer to the holidays.

I really want to try escaline, I have some but it is supposedly not a very good synth, so I'm wary.  Proscaline is nice, but lacking, IMO.  I did have one really nice experience with it where my music playing and listening was enhanced beautifully, but that was not the case the next time I tried it and instead it was just a bit edgy with no particularly redeeming qualities.  The first time it was really nice though.

Hmm, i think the main reason I haven't tried either was because I hadn't heard any glowing reviews but I've never tried Mescaline and so was hoping those two would be close enough an experience. Reckon a combo would be good?

I think proscaline would combo with other psychedelic great, though I haven't tried.  I have heard escaline is a lot more similar to mescaline.  But mescaline is wonderful and no one says the others truly compare. Mescaline is easy to get, just get some cactus.

Ah ok, I guess I was just being lazy when I bought the two compounds because they didn't require any preparation...then I thought I was going to finally try Mescaline this year as I'd made a friend in a different city who invited me to come try his cactus concoctions but then corona struck so that got postponed ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Though I'm not 100% certain who actually made proscaline first, Nichols published how to synthesize it before Shulgin. And I think I've heard Nichols say he made it - but I don't trust my memory these days. ![🙂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)
