3C-E, also known as 4-ethoxy-3,5-dimethoxyamphetamine or as α-methylescaline (3C-escaline), is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and 3C families related to 3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA). It is the amphetamine (3C) analogue of escaline. The drug has a dose range of 30 to 60 mg orally, with a typical dose estimate of 45 mg, and a duration of 8 to 12 hours. It has about the same potency as escaline. The drug is a potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist and also interacts with other serotonin receptors and targets. It produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. 3C-E was first described in the scientific literature by Benington and colleagues in 1954. Alexander Shulgin and colleagues reported an active dose of 40 mg based on unpublished findings in a 1978 literature review. Subsequently, Shulgin further reported the properties and effects of 3C-E in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2013.
