# Acetylfentanyl
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/acetylfentanyl/*

Acetylfentanyl is a synthetic opioid that was originally described in the 1960s. It’s less potent than [fentanyl](https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/fentanyl/) and more potent than [morphine](https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/morphine/) .

The drug has contributed to many fatalities, often due to it being mixed with heroin or misrepresented as heroin.

In terms of effects, it appears similar to fentanyl.

## Effects

#### Positive

- Euphoria
- Mood lift
- Pain relief
- Sedation

#### Negative

- Respiratory depression
- Drowsiness
- Unconsciousness
- Constipation

Some reports indicate it’s not particularly euphoric relative to typical recreational opioids. It shares this quality with fentanyl.

It appears easier to encounter significant respiratory depression with acetylfentanyl in an overdose than with some other opioids. This fits with its comparatively low safety ratio (LD50:ED50) in animal tests.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Acetylfentanyl is a synthetic opioid of the phenylpiperidine class.

It’s structurally similar to fentanyl, with a phenylacetamide group in place of fentanyl’s phenylpropanamide. The end result is that acetylfentanyl drops a methyl group, hence its “desmethyl fentanyl” name.

The drug has been found to occur as a process impurity when making fentanyl citrate. It’s been detected at around 0.04%.

#### Pharmacology

Opioid receptor binding, specifically at the u-opioid receptor, has been demonstrated. It’s known to be an agonist.

Antinociceptive activity connected to opioid agonism was shown in animals.

Acetylfentanyl alleviated morphine withdrawal symptoms in the rhesus monkey. This was achieved with 0.5 mg/kg (subcutaneous), which appears to be equipotent to 3 mg/kg of morphine.

The drug also achieved full inhibition in the mouse vas deferens stimulated twitch test. A delta opioid antagonist didn’t affect the inhibition, whereas a u-opioid antagonist reduced the activity. Naltrexone reversed the inhibition.

Using the acetic acid writhing test in mice, acetylfentanyl was shown to be 15.7x more potent than morphine for analgesia. It was 0.29x as potent as fentanyl. The drug had an ED50 of 0.021 mg/kg.

## History

#### 1960s

Acetylfentanyl was first mentioned in patents from a Belgian company, Research Laboratorium Dr. C. Janssen (Janssen Pharmaceutica).

Its analgesic activity was described in a patent from Paul Janssen, founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica, in 1968.

#### 2010s

Nearly all of the drug’s history comes from the 2010s, particularly from 2012 onward.

2012 is when discussion about the substance increased online and reports of seizures appeared.

Some of the first reports about its use came from Russia, where acetylfentanyl was detected in smoking “spices” in 2012. At least 12 deaths, some involving morphine, ended up being reported in that region.

Most of the fairly large shipment seizures have involved packages originating in China.

According to the EU Early Warning System Network, the first EU seizure was reported in Poland in 2014. Three seizures were reported in Finland in 2014, two had China as the country of origin and one listed Belgium.

In late April 2013, police in Montreal (Canada) raided seven locations and recovered 300,000 drug tablets. Of those, 11,000 were found to contain acetylfentanyl. A separate 3 kg of acetylfentanyl powder was also confiscated.

Japan first reported it in products in 2014.

Belgian Customs Services reported four seizures around June 2015 totaling 114 grams:

- Seizure 1 
- Sourced in China, headed to Finland
- Seizure 2 
- Sourced in China, headed to France
- Seizure 3 
- Sourced in China, headed to Germany
- Seizure 4 
- Sourced in China, headed to Germany

The EMCDDA issued an alert about the drug in September 2015 following 22 confirmed acetylfentanyl-related deaths in the EU. 20 cases were in Sweden and the other two were in the UK.

It was seized for the first time in West Australia in November 2015. Acetylfentanyl was present in tablets designed like PEZ candies.

**United States**

The first lab submission involving acetylfentanyl occurred in Maine in April 2013, according to the National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS).

Based on data from the NFLIS, the DEA’s STARLiMS system, and federal/state/local labs, submissions increased between 2013 and 2014.

50 fatalities involving acetylfentanyl were reported in 2013 just in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. It appears the drug was often mixed with heroin or sold in place of heroin.

Florida reported a rise in fentanyl and acetylfentanyl-related deaths after late 2013. For example, 4 out of 37 heroin-related deaths in Tampa between late 2013 and 2014 involved acetylfentanyl.

## Legal Status

#### Controlled (list may not be complete)

Austria, Canada (as a fentanyl analog), China, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Sweden, UK

## Safety

Too little is known about the drug to understand its safety, especially with chronic use.

#### LD50

A test in mice showed an LD50 of 9.3 mg/kg oral. That has a potential human equivalent of 0.744 mg/kg, but that dose could certainly be inaccurate.

That LD50 results in a worse safety ratio than is seen with morphine, meaning the dangerous overdose level is closer to the psychoactive level.

#### Overdose

Using too much could lead to a fatal level of respiratory depression. The drug can also result in unconsciousness, which can be dangerous on its own.

Cocaine, morphine, ethanol, and benzodiazepines have commonly been found in overdoses cases.

#### Risky combinations (list may not be complete)

Any other depressants, including ethanol, opioids, and benzodiazepines.

#### Possible overdoses

Sweden reported nine analytically confirmed intoxications between April 2015 and November 2015.

Those cases involved the following:

- 6 had unconsciousness
- 6 had respiratory depression
- 5 had miotic pupils
- 5 had tachycardia
