## Subjective Experience

Pyrazolam was developed during the 1970s at Hoffman-La Roche, and became
widely available via the online markets circa 2012.

I originally purchased it as a potential sleep aid, but research, prior to consumption,
revealed its true niche. It counters anxiety, and is active even at relatively small
doses. I don't suffer from undue social anxiety but I have tested it in a number of
stressful situations. I have always been impressed.

Its strength for me is that whilst acting as an anxiolytic, it doesn't cause drowsiness.
It is functional, or at least has been every time I have sampled it.

It is one of only two benzodiazepines I have used on more than a couple of occasions
(the other being etizolam).

In December 2016, despite the prior implementation of the Psychoactive Substances
Act, pyrazolam and a number of other specifically named benzodiazepines were the
subjects of a UK TCDO banning order, which made personal possession, and not just
import and supply, illegal.
