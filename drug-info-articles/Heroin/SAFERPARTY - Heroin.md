## Effects
Diacetylmorphine is chemically identical to heroin and therefore has analgesic, balancing, sedative, anxiety-relieving and euphoric effects.

## Dosage
Due to the lack of impurities and extenders, diacetylmorphine must be dosed much lower than heroin.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Slowing of breathing, nausea, vomiting, itching, drop in blood pressure, pulse slowing, pupil constriction and urinary retention may occur.
Confusion, disorientation, memory lapses, slurred and slurred speech as well as coordination disorders, constipation, reduction in sexual desire and a potentially life-threatening reduction in breathing rate to 2 to 4 breaths per minute (due to the attenuation of the coughing and breathing centre) are also known side effects.
For users who are not used to opiates, the use of diacetylmorphine even in small quantities can be life-threatening (severe respiratory depression, danger of suffocation).

### Long-term Risks
The danger of addiction with psychological and physical symptoms is great, the same as with illegally produced heroin. As soon as a tolerance has developed and the body is not supplied with the necessary amount of substance, physical withdrawal symptoms occur 8 to 12 hours after the last intake.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.
