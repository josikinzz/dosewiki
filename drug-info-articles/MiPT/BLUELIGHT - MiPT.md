It definitely sounds cool. I'd do it if I had it but won't go out of my way to obtain it. I'd like to know what happens when you push the oral dosage higher than 25mg...perhaps 40 or 50 is where it really shines (Shulgin had a tendency to not push some chems into +3 range for some reason - ie 5-meo-mipt).

Great idea, illusion!


MiPT sounds interesting to me, but all the reports say it's fairly boring and it's good only as an enhancer.  But there are very few reports on Erowid.  I'd love to try it.  Someone (MGS?) described it as a trip without any sensory alteration, just mental.  Sounds good to me!


Its large dose and rarity make it a pretty costly one to test.  But I'd love to try it out, for sure.


[Here](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?A=Search&S1=251&S2=-1&S3=-1&C1=-1&S4=-1&GenderSelect=-1&Context=-1&DoseMethodID=-1&Title=&AuthorSearch=&A1=-1&Lang=&Group=-1&Str=&Cellar=1) are the Erowid reports.


Now anyone who's tried it, please share your experiences, I implore you! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I gave this a spin once.


[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=25865](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=25865)


Interesting material, easy on the body.  24mg (or whatever I took) felt like 'enough' but there were no 'bells and whistles' with this material.  Much like what I read 5-MeO-DALT is like.


I'd take MiPT again (and I am sure I will) but I have never been in rush to try it again.  Interesting material but nothing special.

All these odd-balls, people seem to try them at home on a rainy day. I wonder how much effect that has on the nature of the trip.

I wouldn't mind trying this one if it comes by one day. I like 4-ho-mipt so it would be interesting to try some of it very close relative.

It just doesn’t sound all that spectacular from the reports though.

You want to get some because it sounds like an amazing substance, or because someone called it "minx?"  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


As I said before, there is nothing I found too stellar about the material...it didn't even feel very sexy...but I do hope others try and find it worthwhile.

+3 with 5meo mipt? I dont udnerstand how this compound could produce even a low +2, its void of any meat and potatoes, has no real back bone to support it's self. It is a nice tryptamine rush but I found NOTHING entheogenic/spiritual about it. I even aquired more and took it up to 9-10mg, just a faster come up andmore pronounced "rush". Nothing realy in the way of mind space or visual/auditory hallusinations, the only real psychedelic effects I got from it was the first time using it in which I had no idea what to expect, and I allowed my own mind to create a psychedelic/panic state when the effects came on, but within the next 30min I realised the effects and settled down (though there were cops involved)

^^ I find it to be a sort of spiritual/emotional "battery" when used sparingly (5-MeO-MiPT).  It's a transparent effect (at regular doses anyway), but a great one... it provides me with a sense of profound euphoria and connection and makes colors incredibly saturated.  It doesn't dissolve the ego at all though, at least it hasn't for me.

^smoking it (5 maeo mipt) produces much greater effects than oral.

Very psychedelic if u will.


Then again i found oral to be pretty psychedelic as well (and visual) but my doses were higher than the ones you mentioned.

12mg at least for a fully immersing psychedelic experience.


BTW i dont recomend others take high doses of psychedelics, this is just what i found to work for me with this particular drug.

See my post in the B&D 5-MeO-MiPT thread if you're curious... I've found you have to learn how to work with its effects, and then even a pretty small oral dose provides a great psychedelic tool.

MiPT sounded sort of bland to me at first, and overall it might be.  I have had many trials with this compound a few years ago, anywhere from 10 mg insuflated to more than 60 mg (partially oral, partially up insufflated.)  I can say that with 30+ mg orally, I did indeed have visual effects.  Face patterns everywhere, especially on the backs of people's heads.  Also, close-eyed visuals that went to the music seemed common.


With 5-MeO-MiPT, I know that TiHKAL suggests something like 3-7 mg.  From my many numerous experiments, and various experiments with lab partners I am close to, this is a sub-dosage level.  Most people I have met prefer to start with at least 10, and work up from there.  20 mg was not at all uncommon for 'trippin hard'.  Some people ventured up to 40 or 50 mg.


One set up unusually stupid people took somewhere around 85 mg each (this was stolen).  Long story short on that dosage..  one ended up in a psych ward after declaring himself Jesus and trying to break into houses while completely naked.  The other spent several months in jail for violating parole in very obscene ways in a tourist town.  When they returned to the streets, they said they liked it.


Work your way up to 20 or 25 mg of 5-meo-mipt, slowly and carefully, and you will find it is incredibly psychedelic.

85mg of MiPT or 5-MeO-MiPT?  That's not clear from your message.


Dondonte....I have correspondence with a fellow who smoked MiPT...and said the nature was unchanged (unlike with 5-MeO-MiPT) so I wouldn't count on IM administration changing MiPT very much other than onset, duration, etc.  This one is what it is....not much.


It has many positives...it was very easy on the body and had no side-effects at all.  No comedown either.  There is just nothing particularly exciting about it.  Maybe it is a good psychedelic for trying in situations where psychedelic users would normally not be welcome since nothing would give away that one is tripping?

Oh sorry, the 85 mg was in reference to 5-meo-mipt.  I would never suggest taking this amount of this compound!  I have to also include that this was broken into 10 mg units, and 17 were taken between two people.  So I cannot actually say it was 85 mg, just 170 split in two.  When asked an hour after ingestion, one fellow said, "I took 8!"  Within the next hour he was in jail.


85 mg of MiPT on the other hand, while I would not suggest it, I doubt it would have nearly as profound of effects.  Although, while most people do not note visual activity with MiPT, even at 30-40 mg oral I had noted various unusual things.  Distorted faces and gradient facial patterns on the backs of heads would not end.

I was able to try 4-AcO-Mipt last night and found it fairly pleasant,

although visuals were somewhat lacking from what i'd expect out of something so akin to psilocybin

tried 20 mg: had a nice, and very mild psychedlic state. Noticable music enhancement, slight mood elevation, mentally very clear. It was not totally visually inactive: I would compare it to a slightly above treshhold dose of something like 2C-I, visually. I have the feeling that this would be very interesting, either in combination with something else at the same dose, or at a higher dose. I will try to find out in the future ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

How do you compare it to DPT?

DPT I have tried insufflated at 25 mg. To me, MiPT and DPT were almost like opposites. DPT gave me an enormously intense rush and also a lot of fear. Both were not really visual for me, and the music enhancement for MiPT was more significant, even at this less intense dose. I have tried DPT only once though.

How did your body feel on MiPT?  Was it very stimulating at that dose, laid back, etc?  Any noticeable after effects?  I'm trying to decide where to rank this on my list of chemicals to collect.


MGS has said that it feels very transparent, I was just wondering if you agree.

To me, it felt very clean(=transparent?). I usually experience physical side-effects on most psychedelics, such as muscle cramps. This was not the case for MiPT. There was also no "bodyload". Also, the come up was a little under an hour and I was back to baseline at about 4-5 hours. And it did not dissolve in water, not even a little bit (even though it was sold as a salt(I think the HCl))

A week or 2 ago, I ingested another dose of MiPT, this time 30 mg. Effects were nearly identical, except that the body component was more pronounced. No real intensification of mental effects was noticed. Only after about 4-5 hours (at 20 mg, I would be near baseline now) I had the chance to listen to some good music on my own, and to my surprise, music was still greatly enhanced. I spent about 2 hours listening to music, after this, sleep proceeded without difficulty.

my lab has been evaluating** 5-meo-mipt** at low doses ( 7-9 mg )  for the past few weeks.

results:

a) nice mild body stone - some stimulation, very little, if any negative body load

b) pleasant mental state

c) visual enhancement -walking my dog thru the woods during a light snowfall was very nice

d) musical enhancement was a +


test subject is a musician, singer/composer and found this compound very useful for working through writers block  - makes me want to sing


surprisingly hungry - munched a lot and enjoyed food while dosing


seems to be a nice, safe ,mild substance at low doses - which I prefer- personally not looking to 'trip balls' or get 'way out there' - had enough of that in my younger years ( late 60's early 70's )


one of my favs


will increase dosage at next trial to 12-15mg

**MIPT - Any experiences?**


I have used the search engine and cannot find any posts about the chemical MIPT [[TIHKAL](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal47.shtml)] [[Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mipt/mipt.shtml)].


I have used MIPT in the past. The person I got it from said that each capsule was MIPT, 25mg. He has been reliable in the past, though of course it's possible that he was wrong or lying.


IME, it was very fun, and showed the property of many tryptamines that it's perfectly possible to take a very high dose and have a good time (I've heard of people doing this with 4-AcO-DMT, for example, while this would be suicide with most phenethylamines). I took 50mg and went to a show, and felt no discomfort. This experience also contradicted the statement in TIHKAL that MIPT is not visual. Even one capsule, 25mg, was quite visual for me.


MIPT is also great in combination with other drugs. I did MDMA + MIPT + (later) Ketamine and that was a fantastic experience.


Would MAOI + MIPT work in much the same fashion that MAOI + DMT/4-HO-DMT/other tryptamines work? I would like to try this but I'm curious if anyone has experience with it or knows about it.


Does anyone else have experience with this compound, or any info to share?

the reason MAOI+DMT works is because plain oral DMT is deactivated quickly by MAO. since plain oral MIPT works orally, this points to MAO being unable to break down MIPT. so perhaps MAOI+MIPT won't feel any different from MIPT alone. Or maybe it will be completely different. Maybe it depends on which MAOI you choose (moclobemide or harmala).


then again, psilocin is available orally, pointing to its resistance to MAO. but harmala+psilocin is one HELL of a trip.


try it and let us know, just be sure to start low with the MIPT

An MAOI might not be dangerous but it likely will make it much stronger.

EDIT: IGNORE THIS. Sorry, didn't see my original thread was merged into this.


I've done MIPT a few times. 25mg feels good but it's a little light. I did 50mg with no ill effects, and at this level MIPT is definitely visual. I've also mixed MDMA + MIPT + Ketamine and this was a stellar combination. MDMA + MIPT alone feels excellent, and K just makes everything better.


I'm interested in Syrian Rue + MIPT. Has anyone done this?

I wouldn't be surprised if no one has tried this.  Thus, it may be dangerous, or may not be.  Here is what we know if I remember right:


DMT + MAOI = Activates it orally, roughly double potency and length snorted and smoked.

MET + MAOI = Similar to above (increases potency orally as oppose to activates)

DiPT + MAOI = ?

DPT + MAOI = Similar to MET + MAOI

5-MeO-DMT + MAOI = Very dangerous, probably responsible for one death ([http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dmt/5meo_dmt_health.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dmt/5meo_dmt_health.shtml))

5-MeO-DiPT + MAOI = Increased body load, maybe dangerous?  The person definitely took way too much ([http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24026](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24026))

5-MeO-MiPT + MAOI = Large body load even on low dose, could be dangerous.  ([http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24026](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24026))

4-AcO/HO-DMT + MAOI = Ayahuasca like and intense, probably not dangerous but mentally trying?  ([http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=58480](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=58480))

4-AcO/HO-MiPT + MAOI = Unknown AFAIK.


So, my guess would be that MiPT + MAOI would be safe, make it more intense, double potency, lengthen the duration of action, and increase the body load.  That is only a **guess** though.  It may be very dangerous, so be careful.  Hope this helps.

**Mipt**


So does anybody have any experiences with MIPT?


If there already is a MIPT thread, please delete this post. I tried using the search engine, and only came up with hits for 4-aco-mipt and 4-ho-mipt.


Solipsis: Tihkal excerpt hidden


**NSFW**: 


From Tihkal:


DOSAGE : 10 - 25 mg, orally


DURATION : 3 - 4 hrs


(with 25 mg, orally) "Quite an active dose. Same initial effects as with 10 milligrams, but considerably more excitement, central stimulation. At an hour, the effects seem to have plateaued. Enhancement of visual field, i.e., brightened colors, clearly defined objects. Definite auditory effects, and I can pick out each sound with clear definition. Very 'heady,' but still remarkably free of visual distortion. Slight mydriasis. As it subsides, there is some muscle tension in the jaws, but much milder than with MDA or even psilocin."


(with 20 mg, by insufflation) "Immediate onset (less than a minute) and to ++. A little dizziness. My first thought is, 'This is definitely psychedelic.' Everything looked brighter, and vision was tinted orange. Everything appeared as if under an orange overlay. No other visual changes to speak of. Skin, hearing, sensitive. All-in-all, however, sensory changes were minor. The effects on thought were more typically psychedelic. The spin-offs, tangents, and implications of different threads of thought became apparent, and I could watch them unfold with my mind's eye. These effects gradually tapered off over the next three and a half hours or so. During this time, interaction with my companions was facile, and we had a good conversation. This compound seems to emphasize 'psychedelic' effects over 'hallucinogenic' effects."

Your question was merged here and left to serve as a valid bump, if you don't mind me taking the liberty - and the tihkal entry to which there was already a link in this thread is nsfw'd.


Thanks for helping with the link planckunit - as you probably saw this thread is visible when searching for mipt so I guess you just missed it fagott. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This sentence from wiki(like last sentence from TiHKAL report): "MIPT is said to emphasize psychedelic/entheogenic effects over sensory/hallucinogenic activity. Users report strong mental effects, but few perceptual alterations." makes me don't want to try it before I tried others. 


How does the effects of MIPT compare to the effects of 5-MeO-MIPT(which I tried and don't liked much).

Also, I think DIPT should be more interesting to try ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've been keeping my eyes peeled for this one. Shulgins description of it as a more holistic psychedelic rather than a simple sensory indulgence really appeals to me. I would think that it would have lots of potential at higher doses than most have yet reported.

"MIPT is said to emphasize psychedelic/entheogenic effects over sensory/hallucinogenic activity. Users report strong mental effects, but few perceptual alterations."


I´m considering getting this one aswell. It might go well in a mix with other tryptamines.


It´s funny that 4-ho-mipt is all about the visuals and not so much psychedelic. Were as this one seems to be the opposite.

Well I've been dying to try this since the days before webtryp, and I finally got myself a hold of a 50mg sample, which I took.

Effects lasted for approx 4 hours, so it's not as long or as pronounced as the 5meo or 4- cousins.

I'd heard about the so called "intellectual stimulation" that this drug affords, so I was interested mainly for that reason, and to test my theory that in high enough doses it would prove to be quite hallucinogenic.

Time to come on was about 20mins-usual by oral route on empty stomach.

Peaks around 1hr - 2 hours. Spatial distortion very evident - things like doors and tables appear "shrunken" but the rooms and interior of the house seem massive, like my house just doubled in size. This was an interesting effect.

Mild hallucinations and perceptual distortions, all visual, noticed, but nothing particularly colourful. No desire to listen to music, but if I did I doubt I would have experienced any enhancement. No desire for sex or tactile bliss.

Overall, a type of "retarded" feeling to the action of the drug on the receptor, as if the IP group is having trouble dissociating and so not as frenetic as a dimethyl, methylethyl or diethyl. In this case a very similar feeling overall to 4-aco MiPt, and not at all like 5meoMiPT (which when I took it found quite overwhelmingly speedy).


I've decided I don't like the methylisopropyl moeity much. Instead of intellectual stimulation, which I expected to enjoy in the post-peak period of 3-5 hour mark, all I found was a distinct "sluggishness". That one word really captures the overall feeling quite well. Sort of a lazy, slightly soperific and depressogenic feeling just wanted me to go to bed and stop experiencing the drug. So much for feeling stimulated!


I ended up terminating the trip by taking zopiclone etc and going the heck to bed.

I won't be repeating experiments with this one, overall very disappointing considering the build-up I had formed of it in my own mind. I think that experiments with 125mg could really bring on the visual psychedelic aspects of this drug, but I personally don't want to experience that sluggish iP terminus feeling again, especially at double the dose. 

If you want intellectual stimulation look elsewhere, this is about as stimulating as taking rauwolfia root.

Anyone else got experience with this rare compound? It seems to be around more lately and I'm getting a bit curious. I have this hunch that it's probably quite underrated, because why should only the simplest member of the MiPT family be so uninspiring? The rest are all gems in my book, along with most all of the other tryptamines in my experience.

Not yet but thanks for reminding me because I might in the near future... I am not sure if I want to take it orally yet (insufflation does sound somewhat interesting), I probably do. Somewhere in between 20-25 mg I guess.

It will be interesting to be gentle but still with potential to be intense, but virtually all of it mental. I don't know if I will pull through with this plan, if so it might be due the weekend in 2 weeks.

I tried it some moths ago but i didn't make a report because there wasn't much to say tbh.

I tried with 20mg orally, i had only that amount so couldn't push higher, and i had very  mild effects, +1 level, i didn't experience any visual activity and very mild euphoria, for me it was just a night wasted.

Maybe there was some tolerance because 5 days or so before i had taken some other psychedelic (don't remember what tho).

I only felt 'strange' but not really tripping, i guess the dose was too low or the tolerance was still too high.

I think both, but especially tolerance.


I have used 10-15mg to lighten my mood with some sparkle to it. There is little sensory enforcement, but I believe MiPT to be more of a "meditative feeling" compound then a real trippin compound.

Perhaps nobody has really pushed the dose high enough. I think the highest dose I have seen reported is 100mg oral. And don't these simple tryptamines get partially eaten by MAOI when taken orally? DPT requires a hell of a dose when taken by this route, probably for the same reason.

I think people probably need to insufflate or vaporize it unless they're willing to take enormous oral doses.

I feel the same as the above two posters. I don't think people are being adventurous enough with this compound, or at least not providing much of any reports on it...

Last monday I tried MiPT and wrote a report on it, you can read it here:


[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/663908-(MiPT-27-mg)-First-Time-Utter-Weirdness](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/663908-(MiPT-27-mg)-First-Time-Utter-Weirdness)

Well shit, there doesn't seem to be much on this at all. I may need to just IM 50mg to give MiPT the chance, that, to my knowledge, it has never been given. I'm very curious about what's going on at the level of receptor agonism to elicit these reported psychedelic mental effects without any visuals. Hell, I might have to end up IMing 100mg just to make sure there's nothing to this one. Color me intrigued.

I did end up trying this one, but only with MXE. I vaped about 25mg over a short period, a couple hours after a doing small-medium dose of MXE. This put me in a very enjoyable state, with a mindspace reminiscent of miprocin and tactile effects similar to 5-meo-mipt, perhaps even stronger in some ways. One of the most enjoyable and non-offensive body highs I've ever gotten from a psychedelic, the come-up (which is usually somewhat uncomfortable for me) was essentially non-existent when smoking it. OEVs were present but extremely sparse and minor. Closed-eye visuals on the other hand were extremely complex and detailed, some of the best I've had in a while, but exactly how much the MXE affected this I cannot say. Overall I definitely found the experience enjoyable, but it did have a distinctly "not-very-psychedelic" vibe to it, at least at my dosage. I agree with the people who say that it seems to be a fairly potent compound, and I'd personally be reluctant to try some of the higher doses people talk about here. Definitely worth trying again, and I'll have to wait till then before I can say much else.


Sorry I couldn't comment on MiPT by itself or anything, but I figured it was better than nothing, considering how very little information there is about this stuff.

^I'm assuming you have the fumerate? Did you convert it to freebase before you vaporized it? If not, did it seem like some of it got burned or did it mostly vaporize cleanly?

22mg of MiPT fumerate was prepared for IM injection in 0.5mL sterile saline + 0.1mL 5% acetic acid. Assuming the usual tryptamine relationship between this ROA and oral, I estimate my dose to be about equal to 44mg oral. The mixture needed to be heated in five three second bursts in the microwave, including light shaking of the vial following each heating, before it went entirely into solution. 


12:36: 11 of 22 mg injected IM.

12:39: first alerts.

12:59: Satisfied that the onset was leveling out in +1 territory, I finish the remaining 11mg. 

1:04: an elevation in intensity is noted, continuing with the general head swimming, chilly tryptamine onset feeling. 

1:08: Some mild visual shifting is noticed in the texture of the carpet. 

1:22 At the plateau I take a couple hits of high-grade sativa to soften the edge characteristic of this whole class of compounds. The effects have not developed past the wavy, underwater sensations noted during the onset, though the feeling has naturally matured and cast off the shivery airs of its inception, resulting in a pleasant, wholly unintrusive, sleepy and contented headspace largely devoid of more serious psychedelics' visual and cognition warping effects. At this level I'd characterize MiPT as a droopy-eyed sedative with generalized tryptamine colorings. It complements the relaxing qualities of cannabis nicely. Of the many psychedelics I've tried, the closest comparision to MiPT is 4-ho-MPT, which I likewise felt was fairly subdued. 


1:50 20mg of MXE is used RA in preparation of my viewing of “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and as expected the effects meld smoothly. MiPT alone simply would not have been strong enough at this level for a chemically-enhanced cinematic experience. 


If I use MiPT again it will be at 35mg or more IM, all taken in one go. I imagine plus three effects will manifest as well as a little psychedelia-proper at that dosage.  One could probably get powerful effects around 60 -70mg IM if they were determined to really test MiPT, though I expect they'd encounter a high, though not unpleasant, noise-to-signal ratio as far a cognitive psychedlia is concerned. My overall impression of MiPT is that of a relaxing mild tryptamine that will mostly only be of interest to connoisseurs and completists.


EDIT: I misspoke above. When IMing the potency increase over oral is more like 250 - 350% greater.

Does anyone yet know how MiPT does along with harmine or moclobemide? I was thinking about it giving it a shot for the sake of trying to extend my supply and maybe lengthening the trip and adding in some synergy too, but there is definitely a lack of information on it. It certainly didn't feel like there was anything threatening about it to me even at 50 mg, but of course that's no guarantee.

I have tried this substance for the first time tonight at a 25mg dose oral and it was extremely pleasurable. There was a slight distortion in the visual field (perhaps for smoking a few joints in between) although the main action for me was a very hightened sense of communication and visualizing the words internally in images, a sort of synesthesia between the few of use present (6). A very sociable subtle euphoria and feeling of connectedness :=)

This has been very high on my list to try! I love the 4-ho version and the 5-meo version. 

I wish I could find this stuff.  I suspect that it would really really shine at higher dosages or combined with something else like 4-aco-MET or even a Lysergermide.

In fact, I would especially like to see how this would combine with MDMA!!

^Start with low doses of ~1mg or less. People report significant hypersensitivity reactions with the 5-MeO version. More than with most drugs, individual responses vary.


The "5-MeO version" aka 5-MeO-MiPT has wonderful effects. The chemical is great.

This is actually MiPT, the base tryptamine.  I'd say try 1mg as an allergy test, and then jump in higher, as these base tryptamines are nowhere near as potent as their 5-MeOs.

^I agree an allergy test is advisable even if MiPT is less potent than 5-MeO-MiPT. My only experience is with 5-MeO-MiPT and I thought perhaps the related chemical MiPT could demonstrate the same propensity toward idiosyncratic reactions I had noticed. Erowid also mentions this about 5-MeO-MiPT here:

Reports are sparse on this, but maybe the above posters are correct. A quick survey of reports on Erowid shows quite a few lackluster experiences. However, of the three high dose oral reports, two qualified as "glowing experiences" (links below.) 


I wonder if we have another 2C-D situation here, where the initial dosages reported by Shulgin were too low and where the dosage response curve is atypically linear.

As the author of the second of those three reports, I will say that that is still very much my opinion as well. That 50 mg was stunningly satisfying, not lacking in any sense of the word. It would appear that other base tryptamines like MET and MPT also often require oral doses in the hundreds of milligrams for significant activity, so I don't know why we should expect more of MiPT.


Luckily I've still got a pretty good amount to prove it one way or another with too. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I really would love to hear other peoples' accounts too though. I honestly thought that my one trip on MiPT so far was and still is one of my best psychedelic experiences ever, visual, euphoric, deep, and easy all at once.

I found it lackluster at 25mg orally, but vaped it was nice...though nothing stunning...certainly no MET.  But it was lost and i never got a chance to try it again.   Boo hoo for me.

I am going to dose 100-200mg of MiPT freebase soon. I saw in TiHKAL that someone dosed 250mg of DiPT so I'll go out on a limb and say that it's nothing to worry about.

I read some < 30mg trip reports and it was mostly people complaining about a lack of intensity. There is a 50mg + cannabis report here somewhere and he sounded satisfied. I don't know why nobody's venturing up into this dosage range yet.

I got psyched about the aural drug DiPT but grew disappointed when I saw there are no DiPT vendors to the US. I could only find MiPT, so let's hope this produces satisfactory aural effects.

My sentiments exactly. I was actually planning to take 75 mg orally soon, but I might hold off on that if you're going to go for 100-200, might as well see how much of a difference it makes. I look forward to the report!


In retrospect I feel that MiPT did produce some DiPT-like audio effects, but not enough that I even really noticed in the moment, it was only when listening to some of the same songs later that it stood out. If you want the DiPT experience, unfortunately I think you need to take DiPT itself.... It's worth the wait though. The unique effects make up for the struggle while at the same time not being so life-changing that it's like you're missing out if you don't do it right away. That's my opinion anyway.

Why not we both try it on the same day? : D


I'm thinking 150-200mg now. Could anyone venture a guess as to what these amounts might be like or has anyone heard of undocumented HD MiPT trips?

I have seen the light. MiPT is severely underrated. Here is the report I submitted to Erowid:


After reading up on obscure tryptamines on Psychonaut Wiki, I stumbled upon a drug called DiPT, which reportedly distorts sound (as opposed to vision), giving such aural psychedelia as feeling like you're in another universe. I was disappointed to find that DiPT is, as of now, unavailable to most Americans. I happened upon MiPT, and noticing how similar the molecules were, thought that it could be an adequate substitute. I've only read reports of doses up to 50 mg, and they were mostly people complaining. Since DiPT was taken in amounts of 250 mg and more, I figured MiPT must have a similar safety profile.


Me and my colleague, Susan, decided to go hiking at 8pm on a Friday night. I was going to be the only one tripping. Prescription drugs I had taken prior to the trip included 30 mg of Vyvanse for my ADHD and 5 mg of hydrocodone for pain relief. I had eaten food and smoked marijuana at 7pm. At 8:15pm, I swallowed my capsule of MiPT fumarate which was weighed out to a dosage of 95 mg and we began hiking.


After hiking for about 5 minutes, we saw that the trail was wide enough to drive on, so we went back and with Susan driving, we explored the trail by car.


About 20 minutes in, the rocks on the road started forming subtle patterns of a tryptamine signature. At this point, Susan decided to turn the car around and take us to the university for us to play pool.


It was at around 8:50pm that the music on the radio started sounding "condensed". If you were to visualize music as a painting, then the MiPT was causing the music-painting to fractalize, bringing condensed dewdrops of auditory information to the front of the image. At first, I was worried MiPT might not deliver on aural effects like I heard from DiPT, but all doubt has been eliminated.


As we were looking for parking at the university, around 9pm, the radio was playing groovy funk music and the only way I could describe this absolute auditory euphoria is to picture a jazzy, orange-and-blue, reggae-dressed funk DJ. The music came alive and reminded me of synesthetically-tangible Mickey-Mouse-shaped disks "on the down low". I felt like I couldn't get enough of what was now music. Headspace at this point was on the trippy side, but still remarkably clear.


After parking the car, I looked around to see MiPT didn't fail to deliver on visuals either. Cars looked out-of-proportion, parking spots looked tiny, and there was a vague air of color distortion all around. I could understand people, but their speech was distorted in subtly bizarre ways.


Susan and I went downstairs in the student center and started playing billiards. My performance was noticeably affected, and it was almost like people's observation directly affected my behavior. The highlight of this part of the trip, however, was the incredibly surreal way people sounded. The pool parlor reminded me of a cheesy 3D video game about a bar parlor with humorous characters and dialogue. For instance, one guy looked like an old stoner friend of mine telling jokes about tripping in public. It sounded like he said, "Just play it cool. When you laugh randomly and drop balls, just pretend you're doing a thing [akin to acting like a unique character]. Then nobody suspects a thing. *cheesy laughter* " He did not actually say this out loud, but sound was getting distorted appreciably.


There were a couple Chinese students playing pool next to us and the vibe they were giving off was just too hilarious. It was like they, too, were characters in the pool game and they were judging the game Susan and I were having. Such dialogue came to mind as, "Huh. So you think you can play shoot-pool? We'll be the real hustlers here. No pressure for disgrace." There were some other people on the pool table next to us and they kept giving off an aura of cheesy video game lines. After several minutes of this (felt like hours), the background dialogue that I was hallucinating changed to one of humorous commentary poking fun at the idea of a cheesy pool game. For instance, the guy that looked like my old friend sounded like he was commenting on the video game characters. "Play your cool," "get the new texture pack," "check out this vinyl," and "it's a big deal in this lame dating pool" are lines that come to mind. It was also suggested that all the characters, animations, and models are all just "ads for some gay shit". The idea of this was too funny -- that all the trippy people that came by were just advertising themselves in artistic ways. In any case, at the end of the match, approximately 10pm, I lost to Susan and had to pay for the game time.


Susan, who isn't very good with directions, told me to help her navigate to my house to drop me off. We headed up the main road. The audio distortions were still escalating. I became entranced by the bizarre musical sounds coming from the radio and zoned out. She drove me clear to the other side of town before realizing I lost track of directions. I typed my address in her phone so she could find my house that way. If music is typically a forest, then MiPT had turned it into a swamp. Even radio advertisements were distilled into watery packets of sound information. It felt like the other people on the road were psychically communicating with me and shooting the breeze about life theories and social philosophies. One such exchange I remember was about how it would bring great benefits to the world at large if everyone were friendlier and followed more intelligent direction.


After I was dropped off, I went to a semi-secluded area and smoked a bowl of marijuana (no tolerance). The effects of the MiPT exploded as sound became a lot more interesting and tryptamine visuals garnished all surfaces. I was talking to some friends over the phone and realized the sounds that I was producing were no less trippy than the sounds I was receiving. It was like as soon as I said something, conversational possibilities radiated out and we explored a good number of them.


At about 10:30pm, I went inside and watched TV. Just as with the radio, the sounds coming from the TV were "crystallized" into virtual sound packets emanating the gist of each idea. Soon after, the drug peaked and I was tripping balls. Images of my thoughts cascade through my mind and I got lost pondering the future. I flashed back to an old LSD trip I had where I noticed how life is on a prepackaged collision course with death and we're all one under the collective consciousness of the universe, living life on repeat forever, touching on the idea of every conceivable reality, breaking negative cycles. At one point, I was convinced that I died, but I was hardly shaken at all, as I was living on through collective consciousness -- a "giant force ghost" if you will, and I wasn't alone. Futurama was playing on the TV and I believed that each scene in the cartoon indicated us force ghosts engaging in multiverse/omniverse activism, potentiating life and placing events on brighter paths. It was as though all the characters in the show are comprised of universes and the way life was in the universe regions reflected what appeared on the show. For instance, garbage represented worlds where life was corrupted or inefficient, and metal represented neutral, long-term, objective-oriented life. Later, I was pacing the living room, deluded into believing that I am the MiPT messenger sent to spread the word about psychedelic drugs in general and how they can dramatically change people's perception of the world.


I remembered how matter and energy in the universe are comprised of information, and that led me down such psychotic thought tangents as the concept that life carries on through thoughts because ideas are our connection to parallel universes. Information stored in thoughts and memories are translated into actual occurrences in dimensions far beyond. Along with the idea of death came ways to transcend it. In light of the "realization" that thoughts are our connection to other timelines, I continued on to come up with the idea that thoughts are the light, we need the light to exist, and therefore the more we think, the more life we inadvertently create. I know this sounds stupid, but I was convinced that the cascade of ideas that psychedelic drugs often bring increase this "interdimensional diffusion". In other words, I thought life was but a cruel, solitary mistress and somehow drugs were the cure to existential irrelevance and the key to immaterial ideological immortality, and that we can benefit our timeline through intelligent discussion and true virtue. Only when people embrace the extraordinary and accept that which we cannot control do we encounter the path of true happiness.


I changed the TV channel to a comedy talk show and that's when my trip really started speaking. It looked like the hosts saw that since thoughts were generating benevolence, their task was to create as much thought-provoking conversation as possible. I tried to focus on what people were saying, but it came across as garbled yet somehow meaningful nonsense. It felt absolutely surreal, like I spawned into a parallel universe where people just go on TV and spew out sensical noise in the trippiest manner imaginable.


There was little body load, but it felt like alternative timelines were affecting the way my body felt. For example, if I thought about the parallel universes where I drove under the influence, I would mostly feel the "average timeline behavior" (to supplement this concept, think about how engineers and scientists often approximate the behavior of large systems using average behavior) of me being perfectly alright, but I would also get a psychosomatic pain in my chest considering the timelines where I crashed the car. I also hallucinated jeers from the public and the feeling of handcuffs where I was pulled over and failed a sobriety test. Strangely enough, I also experienced hallucinations about parallel universes where people were more understanding and tried to sweep my deaths under the rug. With average system behavior on my mind, I thought about how since the Asians have the greatest population, they really do make the biggest difference in the world and have the potential to sway the momentum of consciousness at large. Seeing and thinking about all these fine factors that play a role in these timelines made me feel like we could engineer universes with our thoughts. The Rick and Morty line came to mind, "What about the universe where Hitler cured cancer? The answer is to not even think about it, Morty!"


This brought me back to similar thought patterns as my aforementioned LSD trip about engineering life to be as painless and efficient as possible. Picture a 2D graph. Now imagine elongated "idea seeds" appearing at the origin and linking outwards like digital mycelia carrying the plans for life. Now imagine a Japanese-style, anime-illustrated, "liquid crystal" (the same type of display as a low-end calculator) box containing a duo of anthropomorphic female neko kitten people. Life energy is generated by the warmth of the love that the kitty people bring, and death is negligible. The kitty boxes also drew energy by subtracting entropy from other universes, further perpetuating the miracle of life and intelligent existence.


Concomitant with an idea I had during my first full psychedelic trip (which was on mescaline), the idea being that misunderstandings are like kinks in a flowing mesh of consciousness, there was one such kink I had to deal with concerning one of those "energy kitten boxes" where one of the kitties was born with a delicate heart and couldn't bring itself to fully trust the other kitty. I had to tap into my inner conscience and shed some pure, concentrated love onto the skittish kitty in order to bring it closer towards the light. The kitty also happened to suffer from atrial fibrillation, so I had to "close the doors" in the kitty's mind away from suffering an excitement-induced heart attack to keep it alive and joyful. The kitty and I bear witness to many a timeline where it fell ill and died of irregular heartbeat, but the air of inner peace surrounding us led to this typically depressing concept to fail to spread substantial negativity. There is no telling where this kitten pair energy unit went afterwards.


At approximately 1pm, towards the end of my trip, things took a gray turn as I walked upon the concept of pedophilia in the world. I encountered a universe controlled by an older Japanese man raising a pair of incest energy kitten children. The Japanese man was essentially god to them, and although deemed corrupt in his cognitive inclination towards the child-oriented, he was actually well-meaning, and the weirdest thought lines proceeded with ideas like aside from placing too much weight on such an irrelevant concept as sex, the Japanese man was truly moved by the ideals that the kitty people stood for, and some part of him turned away from the pursuit of radical sex and he carried on about his real business in his otherwise ideologically correct school. The teachings seemed to be based on some fusion of Finnish appreciation for nature and eastern ideals of educational prowess.


Coming back from the critical analysis of other universes, I felt it upon myself to start paying more attention to the timeline I'm currently in and to treat my body with rest. I'm sure the trip would have continued for a few hours more, but I was tired. The next morning, I was blessed with an afterglow of waning auditory distortions and a vague sense of inspiration to bring people to real action.


In conclusion, MiPT is nothing short of a psychedelic treasure with a deliciously unique flavor and it's time that it got the recognition it deserved. It appears that I was correct in conjecturing that the reason most MiPT trips describe something lackluster is because they aren't taking high enough doses. I felt fine on this 95 mg trip and have no reason to believe you can't take the dosage much further. If DiPT is indeed the queen molecule of sound distortion, then MiPT is the royal princess. This experience was my craziest, most expansive, and most informational trip yet. I do plan to take amounts as high as 200 mg in the future and to share this beautiful molecule with everyone that I know. This strange material also gives my high hopes for the day I try DiPT. Thank you for reading this, and I wish you luck on your mission.


"The purpose of life is a life of purpose."

______________________________________


One thing I forgot to add is that when I was listening to the comedy talk show, the lead-in to the neko kitty box idea was where people touched on the idea that we can flex our existential presence beyond the limits of known science by integrating things that are inherently irrational. The hosts on the show expanded upon this by memorizing irrational beliefs they had as a kid, be it faith in religion or unrequited love, and threw the conceptual items into a consciousness machine pool where minds optimized universe blueprints to create the nicest existences imaginable. They were also explicitly discussing neurological cellphone (the voice inside our heads, the oft erroneously neglected telepathic and clairvoyant abilities that all life forms with a nervous system possess).


Another thing I should have mentioned is that the multiverse afterlife I experienced in the LSD flashback consists of reliving the life of everyone who ever existed due to the unlimited number of configurations your bodily matter could plausibly become after it's swept away following your death. I was thoroughly convinced that I saw the mechanism of death, and this scares me a little. Picture all your cognition as following a predictable path. If you dilate time enough, you can "hear" the cogs of life working as expected, and you must make peace with it.


A makeup advertisement during the comedy show led me to illustrate an individual's life as a stack of 3D "memories" and they actions that they accomplished in life and the places they went formed their "makeup". For this trip, bloody, dying flesh makeup certainly existed, but the latency of the process of losing life prevented this from being a dominant focus, fortunately.

Fantastic. You sound just like me after I tried my 50 mg. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I felt so vindicated after reading all the weak trip reports and just wanted to share the real MiPT with anyone and everyone. I still do. In many ways that one trip was still the best I've ever had on anything.


Sorry I couldn't dose with you. I actually became extremely sick starting Monday night and am only just now feeling about fully recovered today, minus a sore throat. Any psychedelic experience I partook this week would have been completely miserable, and not to mention unnecessary since I was already practically tripping from the fever. @_@ But I'm very glad to hear that it went so well for you, and you've definitely got me excited to dose even higher in the future!


It's cool that you were able to get such strong DiPT-like audio effects too, they didn't seem like they'd be as strong for me. For what it's worth, you shouldn't be in doubt if you just want to experience them period.... I actually believe that all isopropyl tryptamines will cause them in high enough doses, as I have already experienced them to varying degrees on MiPT, DiPT, 4-HO-MiPT, and 4-HO-DiPT. What makes DIPT unique is just that it does it most strongly and selectively, like it can take you to a level that you described with MiPT here while leaving you otherwise practically sober, which is of course pretty different from what MiPT does. For that reason, and considering how strong it would get by the time you *were* tripping that hard on it, I would have to agree that DiPT is definitely the queen. But it's pretty cool to know that MiPT can take it that far too!


Thanks much for sharing! I look forward to reading more from you in the future. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

**I have officially switched my drug of choice to MiPT.** I think it's highly underrated. There is no comparison with anything else I've tried. People have got to try doses over 100mg. I know for a fact that I'm going to plug 200mg soon. I have a feeling that DiPT will become my new favorite once I get my hands on it. By the time I'm finished experimenting, my hearing is going to be fucked to shit.

Let me just confirm that my hearing was still fucked up for the next few days, although the effect diminished to periodic aural HPPD -- just as people report with DiPT.

Yesterday, I took 200mg orally.


I went out walking, listening to music on my headphones.


Started getting nauseous about 30 minutes in so I took a small hit of marijuana.


The music started getting more defined, the aesthetics more intense, and the way lyrics registered were interestingly exaggerated. Images of bands and singers on top of rocks etched with dynamic fossil formations in a bright room came to mind.


About 1.5 hours in, I sat down to smoke a small bowl of marijuana. It definitely exploded the audio effects.


I was walking past the university when a Chinese student dressed like it's California started walking in front of me in the same direction. He telepathically phoned me and manipulated my trip. He got me in contact with the DiPT overlords and they sent me the scariest sounds I ever heard. It's the sound you hear on LSD when you think you've died and gone to the hospital, but the sounds that I heard on MiPT put the sounds I heard on LSD to shame. After freaking out for a moment, he made me focus on him as he played a soothing island theme simultaneously. Then we parted ways.


Later on, I kept hearing familiar death noises, but I had grown used to them. I played around with the sounds in my head to the point of absurdity. The song "Elizabeth" by Ghost B.C. played on my headphones and I think this very well describes the sound of LSD death versus the sound of MiPT death. "~Forever young, Elizabeth . . .~"


I sat down to rest in a parking lot and played around with the MiPT sound effects in my head. There were all kinds: pitch shifting, vibrato (as with shrooms), condensation, echoes, and some kind of metallic filter. Had I smoked more marijuana, the effects as well as the trip would surely have intensified.


The sound effects continued on the rest of the day and lingered on the next.


Overall, I'd say MiPT is definitely worth trying if you want to get that unique aural trip where DiPT isn't available. However, with the amount required and with how much marijuana you'd need to smoke to achieve the same perceptual effects as DiPT, MiPT is only an ambassador to the more glorious DiPT nation.

So you're saying at high doses, MiPT also produces audio distortions?

I'm glad you like it so much. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It's not my absolute favorite, but it's pretty high up there. The audio distortions are actually something that keep it from being at the top for me, because listening to music is such a big part of tripping for me, I just can't have something that distorts it so much as a favorite. As a perceptual distorter though, I have to say that I think MiPT is unbeaten. If the audio distortions really do get that intense then honestly I don't think even DiPT would surpass it overall. DiPT may have more audio selectivity, but MiPT is a far more intense visual hallucinogen in my experience so far. Though, I did get the feeling so far from what I've read and experienced that DiPT in very high doses might be like DPT... as opposed to how MiPT has a lot in common with DMT. So if you like DPT more than DMT I'd guess you might like DiPT's trip more than MiPT's too. But, who knows....

Thanks for writing a report again. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I can't believe you can take that much and just get nauseous! 50 mg had me puking my guts up, which is another reason I'm a little hesitant to dose much higher. This definitely makes me want to push it though....


I also honestly can't believe you can even function or see on this dose. Did you not have extreme visual hallucinations on that 200 mg dose? Even 50 mg for me was nearing a breakthrough point particularly when I was listening to music. It's cool that it is still that manageable at that dose though, I would really like to experience those strong visual and audio distortions simultaneously.

I will vouch for this too. After I had that 50 mg trip, I went back and tried to find some of the new music I listened to and was astounded to find that it didn't sound the same anymore. It wasn't until after I tried a higher dose of DiPT that it really sunk in though. Afterwards I also noticed that 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT had a similar level of audio distortion to the same amount of MiPT. It's much, much less than 50 mg of DiPT, but it definitely seems like it could be similar at a higher dose.

The audio distortion effects from 50mg DiPT were some of the most profoundly strange and engrossing sensory distortions I've ever experienced.  Very alienating in a way that visual distortions have never touched for me.  I'm even more excited to try a full dose of this now. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I tried 20mg of the batch I have before, and it was very nice feeling but entirely threshold.  I'm going to go for 50mg or so.  I haven't been able to find the time to really trip lately.  I've taken AMT a few times recently but that's more of an empathogenic thing, I usually take drugs at shows lately, and I'm not trying to take a full dose of a most psychedelics out in public.

Yeah, mine were still not incredibly strong at 50 mg of DiPT but they were still pretty out there, definitely unlike anything else I have experienced.... I can only imagine that having them alongside the visual trippiness of MiPT would make the world nearly incomprehensible! I'm definitely still excited to hear what you think about it, 50 mg should be a nice first full dose. I feel you too, I feel like I've barely tripped at all lately, just too much going on in life. Probably for the best though, it always makes for an even more satisfying trip anyway when you can finally get around to it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I've taken AMT a few times like I said, and also ALD-52 a few times, in the past, well, since the early Fall.  So like 6 months.  But no deep trips since then.  I'm thinking this will probably be my next deep trip.  I'm not sure when that will be though, my friend and I also want to do a tryptamine jam, where we take around 40mg of a 4-sub-tryptamine and play music together for the trip.  That makes for a heavy trip but a trip of a different sort, not really the kind to sit there and observe the specific differences of a particular drug.  Probably won't want to use MiPT for the first time for that.

I didn't get very many visuals from the 200mg, but I feel like smoking more would have changed that. I also feel like the 100mg I took last week had left a slight tolerance. When I took the 100mg and smoked, the visuals were more obvious. Isn't DiPT similar though? I heard about melting surfaces on dosages like 140mg.

Yeah, after that much time a deep trip on MiPT should definitely be pretty great. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I would agree that it probably wouldn't be best for the jam though, at least not during the peak. It was very heavy for me in a way similar to DMT, almost sedative despite being mentally and emotionally stimulating. There actually was quite a bit of energy and even a prosocial effect after the peak though, one I also noticed uniquely in MET. It's actually making me start to wonder if their sigma-1 receptor activity is playing a role or something like it seems like it might with MDMA, because this effect is distinctly absent from 4-substitited tryptamines for me.


I'm curious, did you ever use 4-HO-MPT for that? I've wondered how it would be for playing music due to the similarities to LSD I feel in it.... It seems like it has the right kind of energy and sensory enhancement to really do well there, at the right dose.

Interesting, well I did smoke and meditate to music on my 50 mg so that definitely could have brought it out a lot.... I'll have to do some more experimenting with that.


The kinds of visual effects shared by MiPT and DiPT for me are the most similar of any two drugs I've tried so far, but there are even more visual qualities they don't share. MiPT is highly DMT-like for me in that it produces intense, complex, and colorful geomety that starts pushing into classical tryptamine breakthrough designs. DiPT on the other hand almost entirely loses the geomety at regular doses, even at 50 mg I had no open eye visuals other than slightly pulsing carpets with no color changes. Closed eye visuals are a little more present but the geomety is still dark and simplistic. Instead it is the visions that are much more prevalent, like animal entities and dark vortices and large open some spaces. I expect that at a higher dose a full hyperspace will unfold for it as well, but it still feels like it will be a largely visionary experience for me, very out of body but not heavily reality distorting, just detaching. That's why I'd still pick MiPT if I wanted the strongest blend of both audio and visual effects so far, it just seems like it has the most potential for that to me.

Actually I gave out the rest of my MiPT.

In light of the upcoming DiPT wave, I'm just going to wait on that for more sound trips.

All in all, MiPT is a good alternative for getting the same fucked-up aural trip when DiPT is unaffordable or unavailable.

I actually don't recommend gel caps and would actively advise against them. My experience and those around me has been that gel caps add a huge variable into the equation, ranging from never feeling the dose at all to the dose hitting hours later than expected. The gelatin doesn't break down quickly nor evenly. I've taken solid doses of tryptamines and phenethylamines on fullish stomachs and never felt a thing, a friend has taken a 27mg dose of 4-AcO-DMT on a pretty empty stomach and not had any effects until drinking a milkshake four hours later and all of the sudden peaking hard. And on and on.


My advice is to get a good sip of water or other liquid in your mouth, tilt your head back, dump the substance into your mouth, and swallow. Anything but encapsulation.

75% of my experiences have been fine but after 10+ times just myself and hearing others' experiences I've resorted to avoiding them. If not possible, breaking them open in my mouth before swallowing.

Think I'll go with this method, dump it in with a mouth full of water and chase it down with some lemonade or something, going to shoot for 100mg and see if it really shines at that dose since sigmundfloyds report sounded more magical than the others at 95

I must say I'm utterly disappointed in MiPT, after my 100mg trial I wouldn't even consider it a + on the scale. There might've been a mild change in my headspace but I'm almost sure that was placebo, no changes in thoughts, no visual/auditorial perception changes, nothing. Maybe I had a bad batch but one would thing pushing this to 100mg there would be some kind of definite telltale sign that the chemical is indeed doing its job, not one for me.

Could be that MiPT is rapidly broken down by monoamine oxidase when ingested orally, perhaps more or less depending on individual biochemistry. Earlier today I was thinking that I wanted to try oral MiPT with an MAOI like moclobemide, or even B. caapi.

Kaleida took 50mg orally and had [an amazing trip](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/770549-(MiPT-50-mg)-First-Time-Absolutely-Breathtaking)... maybe it would work differently for some than others though.

I'm not sure if hers was the fumarate or the freebase.  I have the freebase myself.  If you have the fumarate, I know that the fumarate salt of AMT is only about 60% as potent as the freebase, fumarate salts are quite heavy.

Yeah that's weird.  Is your source good?  That does seem pretty odd.  I mean there are reports of 25mg (of freebase) being definitely active and even somewhat strong.

Based on comparisons of the label to others of chemicals from the same now defunct vendor, I think my MiPT is the freebase. I'd be surprised if you didn't feel that much from a good batch of MiPT even if yours was only equal in potency to 60 mg of mine, but if you have significantly more psychedelic tolerance than I do, or just generally require higher doses than I do, or anything like that, I don't think it would be *entirely* out of the question.... Not feeling almost anything at all is a little odd though. Even TiHKAL lists 20 mg orally as a ++ experience.

Assuming 1P-LSD's tolerance build-up works like LSD's, that would definitely make my trips a little weaker than their maximum potential, but I would expect to at least feel something from that much MiPT. On 50 mg my visuals were very bright, solid, complex, and immediately available without having to be milked out or anything, and the euphoria with music was nearly overwhelming. It was definitely a full dose, but, just because it was for me doesn't necessarily mean it will be for everybody.... 5-MeO-MiPT was also a surprisingly visual drug for me, and I've found other reports of MiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT being similarly visual drugs to what I got in similar doses, but also a lot of accounts of people calling them weakly hallucinogenic drugs. On the other hand, lots of people call 4-HO-MiPT extremely visual, but for me it's actually somewhat hard to get super strong visuals out of, other than in a geometric way that is still somewhat reduced in diversity compared to other tryptamines. So, who knows how you or anyone else will react to them....

Many say it's a good experience, if you've read over this thread you'd see kaleida had a great experience at 50mg freebase, I feel my attempt was a freak occurrence seeing as to how i had no reaction to 100mg fumarate. I'd like to give it another go but after that situation I'm hesitant to spend the money on this.

^ Hey PsychaStevic, I meant to PM you but it slipped my mind! Sorry about that.


A couple weeks ago, I took 50 mg MiPT fumarate, and while I didn't have anything nearly as profound as Kaleida's trip, I certainly felt it. It had the characteristic -MiPT adrenergic stimulation, so I'm pretty confident in the identity of the substance. Basically, it felt like an extended come-up with no peak. As many others have reported, there was a remarkable absence of visuals: most psychedelics tend to at least brighten colors, if nothing else, but MiPT didn't even remotely alter my vision.


However, there were at least a couple positives: firstly, the music enhancement was pretty great. Like LSD, MiPT strongly pumps up the emotions of music. Secondly, MiPT seems to have a nice uplifting afterglow.


Maybe I would get a deeper trip if I took a larger dose, but at 50 mg, it already had a lot of pushy stimulation which made my heart race, so I'm hesitant to take it much higher. In retrospect, I think MiPT is nice for what it is, but it may disappoint those looking for something more classically psychedelic. Personally, I think of MiPT as more of an empathogen, or a slightly trippy stimulant, best used for euphoria and music enhancement. But, reactions to MiPT seem to vary wildly, so for anyone interested in trying this drug, please proceed with caution, and expect the unexpected!

Did you experience anything other than auditory effects? I'm glad to hear that those are being further verified, but I'm also really amazed with the level of variability when it comes to the more traditional psychedelic effects with this one. It seems like a good amount of people have very little trip even in the 50-100 mg range... whereas for me the former dose truly was intensely visual and euphoric and emotional on the level of some of my best LSD trips. It's hard to believe it could differ so much, but I'm not shocked by much in this way when it comes to drugs these days.

Hello platinum.  I found MiPT mild and uneventful at 25mg orally.


[https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=25865](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=25865)


As a vaporized compound (up to 20mg) it is a little more interesting.  If I had to describe it (smoked)...I would say it is like a visionless DMT, or a soft and slow version of smoked DPT (DPT-light).  Not near as interesting as DiPT, MET, or DPT.  I never took it up to higher levels and sadly my supply was lost.


The reports of auditory distortion strike me as "not MIPT-like" but then I never took 100mg.  Still, it was a decidedly "not sensory" compound for me and my circle.

I tried MiPT and it was better than I thought it would be. I had some mild visuals, but the trip was definitely more sound oriented. Music sounded great. I don't see a lot of people comparing MiPT with 4-HO-MiPT, but I think they are really similar.

I am glad I keep notes...I was sure MIPT did not intensify music in my brain, yet there are the words..


> To pass the time while waiting for the material to take effect, I listened to my favorite Pink Floyd album; 'Meddle.'  I started to notice some effects within twenty minutes or so.**After the initial alert, I felt a strong intensification of the music. Each instrument and note I heard was very clear and well defined. There was also an intensified emotional connection to the songs. ** No closed-eyed or open-eyed visuals however were present, but when the record was over I did begin to notice some mild trails when I moved my hands around..........
> 
> 
> 
> I then decided to put on the Beatles 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.' What an album! **Every note sounded so perfect and in its right place. Interestingly enough, even though the sound of the music was strongly intensified, there were still no closed-eyed visuals produced from listening to the music. I did not see anything with eyes shut beyond normal.** It was very strange considering how hard I felt I was tripping in my head. It was almost mushroom-like but with no visuals. At least MiPT was not a sensory psychedelic for me.

Well look at that, it wasnt totally uneventful.

Well, I finally tried a higher oral dosage of MiPT, after my first completely wonderful experience on 50 mg years ago. I was inspired by the fact that I had also recently taken 50, then 75, then 100 mg orally of MPT and found it very worthwhile when pushed far enough and still quite clean on the body compared to my one 40 mg smoked MPT experience that was actually rather uncomfortable; it seemed like a plausibly better route of administration all around for me, and my attempt at smoking 50 mg of MiPT had also been much smoother, though less remarkable, than my smoked MPT experience, so I figured that was probably as good a sign as I was going to get. Continuing the pattern, I opted for 75 mg of MiPT orally this time around.


Ironically, this experience ended up being very uncomfortably physical for me, very tense and almost painful in the body, mostly lacked in any sort of euphoria or high, and was associated with a similarly uncomfortable psychological disorientation. Furthermore, as these effects kicked in I did also start getting some psychedelic hallucinations alike other base tryptamines I've taken like some transparent neon corridors appearing from a bird's eye view in my mind's eye or beyond closed eyelids, but these corridors were also immediately swarming with an uncharacteristically high amount of spiders, insects, snakes, and lizards compared to most other psychedelics, so much so that on top of the other effects already kind of described, I honestly felt kind of like I had ingested an anticholinergic deliriant, on top of a serotonergic psychedelic, or in this case blended into one drug. I don't mean to suggest that MiPT necessarily has anticholinergic properties (I'm also not suggesting that it necessarily doesn't, and think it's not out of the question), but if it doesn't then it surely must have some downstream pharmacological overlap with deliriants because it's a highly memorable effect I'm quite familiar with, and that was pretty much it.


That being said, I still found the experience worthwhile and deep, just not pleasant. It had a powerful psychedelic signature to it that was as useful as many other powerful psychedelics generally are, though I felt it was somewhat lacking in the character that makes some specific particularly significant psychedelics really stand out from the crowd. I did a lot of internal work and came out of it feeling refreshed, but struggle to name something about the trip that was really more memorable than anything else now aside from the hallucinogenic effects, which were interesting but not really meaningful to me in the moment or afterwards that I've picked up on so far. I really don't even remember how long the experience lasted because it kind of passed without much fanfare, but I remember it trailing away for a very long time, possibly basically the rest of the day.


I'm not completely turned off from trying a higher dosage again, but I think next time I'll return to 50 mg orally and see how it holds up after all this time. I loved MiPT at that point so far and am starting to think that may be the point around which it really shines for me, if that sort of trip is repeatable.

Ok so I have experimented with smoking this chem and it's a nice feeling and worthwhile in my mind. Last night I combined it in an oil burner pipe with MET and they definitely had a synergistic effect and potentiated each other quite a bit. Has anyone else tried MiPT with another of the base tryptamines? I only have those two and DPT to play around with. Thinking that MiPT will add a positive push to the DPT. If no one has experiences with these combinations I will gladly submit some experience reports for SCIENCE!

I just revisited N,N-MiPT at 25mg rectally with no tolerance a couple days ago. It was biphasic in a way that reminded me of 5-MeO-MiPT, with a somatically titillating, rushy, clearheaded comeup and "peak" followed by a headier but more blunt and uninteresting plateau. It might have been more enjoyable if I weren't hungry at the time, but while I evened out after eating, I still found the second phase to be thoroughly meh. I enjoyed the comeup quite a bit. If the peak were stronger and the plateau were milder, it would be quite the fun and euphoric material.
