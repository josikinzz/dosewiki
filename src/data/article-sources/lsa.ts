LSA (also known as Ergine, d-lysergic acid amide, and d-lysergamide) is an alkaloid of the ergoline family that occurs in various species of vines, the morning glory flower and some species of fungi. It is the dominant alkaloid found in the seeds of several varieties of morning glories in concentrations of approximately 10 µg per seed, as well as Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds at a concentration of around 0.13% of dry weight. It has structural similarities to LSD, putting it in the lysergamide family of psychedelics.

A traditional use of morning glory seeds by Mexican Native Americans was first described by Richard Schultes in 1941 in a short report documenting their use going back to Aztec times. Further research was published in 1960, when Don Thomes MacDougall reported that the seeds of morning glory flowers were used as sacraments by certain Zapotecs (sometimes in conjunction with the seeds of Rivea corymbosa, another species of morning glory which has a similar chemical composition, containing lysergol instead of LSA).

LSA was assayed for human activity by Albert Hofmann in self-trials in 1947 (well before it was known to be a natural compound). Intramuscular administration of a 500 microgram dose led to a tired, dreamy state with an inability to maintain clear thoughts. After a short period of sleep, the effects were gone and normal baseline was recovered within five hours. This suggests that the theory of LSA being the main psychedelic compound within morning glory seeds and Hawaiian baby woodrose is debatable as anecdotal reports suggest that the effects of synthetic LSA and iso-LSA are only slightly psychedelic in their effects and may well be triggered by a mixture of various lysergamides instead of one specific compound.

The LSA experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of LSA can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high of LSA can be described as a mild yet pleasurable, soft tingling sensation. This is largely noticed in high doses and is accompanied by strong waves of physical euphoria which are usually manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip but can also maintain a consistent presence. In either case, they steadily rise with the onset and hit their limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Sedation** - in terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, LSA tends to be sedating, however, it can be setting dependent. For example, when taken in settings with large amounts of stimulus or during physically strenuous activities such as walking, running, climbing or dancing it is fully capable of becoming stimulating and energetic. In contrast, however, when taken in calm environments such as darkened rooms with comfortable seating it is consistently relaxing, peaceful and quite sedating.
- **Vasoconstriction**

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of LSA is described by many as extremely relaxing yet lucid and clear headed in its style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or Psilocin. Although it is primarily sedating, it is accompanied by fast paced bursts of thought.

LSA contains a large number of psychedelic cognitive effects. The most prominent of these typical effects include:

- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Introspection**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Time distortion**
- **Direct communication with the subconscious**
- **Deja-Vu**

**Visual Effects:**

The visual effects of LSA are mostly present when large doses have been consumed.

*Enhancements*

LSA presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, these are significantly more simplistic from that of open eye distortions found with other psychedelics. Effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as mild but highly detailed yet cartoon-like in appearance. They are fast yet smooth in motion and fleeting in their permanence. This is an inconsistently manifested effect with some never reporting such distortions.
- **Colour shifting**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT, ayahuasca and 2C-E than LSD or 2C-B. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, zoomed out and small in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, blurred in their edges and rounded in their corners. They have a much more “natural” feel to them than LSD and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

LSA produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is very consistent when taken in large doses. The effects of such states include:

- **External hallucinations** - these are extremely common within LSA and partially follow the content of the user’s current thought process.
- **Internal hallucinations** - unlike LSD, LSA consistently produces moderate to high level hallucinatory states in high doses. This particular effect can be compared to a lucid dream state and commonly contains hallucinations with plots, settings, autonomous entity contact and scenarios. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively religious, spiritual, mystical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. These hallucinations are complemented by a powerful enhancement of the ability to visualize concepts. This ability eventually becomes so drawn out proportional to dosage that it leads to full blown hallucinatory states that are entirely lucid and for the most part controllable.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of LSA are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- Enhancements
- Distortions
- Hallucinations

**Natural Sources:**

**Morning Glory Seeds**

The seeds of many species of morning glory contain lysergamide alkaloids (including the psychedelic known as LSA). The seeds are found in many gardening stores, however, it’s worth noting that the seeds from commercial sources are often coated in some form of pesticide or methylmercury which can result in extreme nausea if ingested. Seeds without these pesticides can be purchased cheaply online and are freely available through search engines such as Google.

When using morning glory seeds, the dosage for oral consumption is generally considered to be:

- **Light** : *50 - 100 seeds* / *1.5 - 3 g*
- **Common** : *100 - 250 seeds */* 3 - 6 g*
- **Strong** : *250 - 400 seeds */* 6 - 10 g*
- **Heavy** : *400 + seeds */* 10 + g*

**

**Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds**

Hawaiian Baby Woodrose is a perennial climbing vine that is native to the Indian subcontinent and was introduced to numerous areas worldwide including Hawaii, Africa and the Caribbean. Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds may be consumed for their various lysergamide alkaloids such as LSA. These seeds are found in many gardening stores, however, the seeds from commercial sources are often coated in some form of pesticide or methylmercury which can result in extreme nausea if ingested. Seeds without these pesticides can be purchased cheaply online and are freely available through search engines such as Google.

When using morning glory seeds, the dosage for oral consumption is generally considered to be:

- **Threshold** : *1 - 4 seeds*
- **Light** : *3 - 6 seeds*
- **Common** : *5 - 8 seeds*
- **Strong** : *7 - 12 seeds*
- **Heavy** : *12 + seeds*

**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxic dosage of LSA is unknown as there has never been a single reported overdose. This suggests that LSA is perfectly safe to simply try on the odd occasion.

However, LSA should not be used on a frequent basis. When used repeatedly over a short period of time, the vasoconstriction effects build up while the psychoactive effects get weaker. If you’re feeling sore legs, this is a sign of the vasoconstriction effects building up in your body. The legs feel sore because not enough blood is getting to the muscles. Your upper leg muscles are the largest, most energy eating muscles in your body, and they will feel sore if blood flow to them is lowered even a little bit. If you’ve taken HBWR seeds, morning glory seeds, or pure LSA and are experiencing sore legs you need to hold off for a while. Let your body get back to baseline before using them again. This is more important with LSA (HBWR, morning glories, etc.). With LSA, it can take up to 3 days of abstinence to get back to baseline.

It’s important to note that LSA is non-habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating. You also build an almost immediate tolerance to LSA after ingestion, preventing you from experiencing its full effects more often than every 4-7 days (unless you increase your dose significantly). 

**Legal Issues:**

- The consumption of LSA containing materials is prohibited under state legislation in most Australian states.
- LSA is not listed in Canada’s Controlled Drugs and Substances act and is therefore not illegal to possess. It is probably illegal to sell for human consumption as a drug, though the plants that contain it are not controlled in Canada.
- LSA is not legally classified as a drug, so consumption or possession of LSA or LSA containing-materials is not prohibited.
- LSA is controlled in the Netherlands. This makes it illegal to possess, distribute, and produce without a license.
- Chemical LSA is controlled as a drug in New Zealand. The plants and seeds of morning glory species are legal to possess, cultivate, buy, and distribute. Seeds are reportedly sprayed and warnings are included on the packets to not consume the seeds.
- The status of LSA as chemical is unknown, but LSA-containing plants appear to be uncontrolled in Poland.
- Sweden is planning to control a number of chemicals as of May 1, 2007 including LSA, 2C-T-4, DXM, and DOI.
- LSA is a Class A substance within the United Kingdom and categorized as a precursor to LSD (Misuse of Drugs Act 1971).

**Preparation Methods:**

LSA containing seeds can be prepared in a number of different ways. Click the links below for detailed step by step techniques.

- [Extraction of LSA tincture](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Extraction_of_LSA_tincture) - This extraction uses household chemicals such as naptha and ethanol to extract the LSA into a pure and nausea free liquid form. It is perfectly safe if performed correctly and can take between a few hours to several days depending on the desired potency.
- [Nausea free LSA extraction with garlic ](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_free_LSA_extraction)- This extraction uses cold tap water and a refrigerator to extract the LSA from the seeds and into a glass of water. It uses garlic to minimize the nausea and takes at least 4 hours in total.
- [LSA Adducts](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA_Adducts) - This preparation method is not an extraction and merely theoretical but based around well-reasoned chemistry and consistently themed anecdotal reports. It uses common household herbs such as peppermint and cinnamon bark essential oil to convert LSA into other substances with radically altered subjective effects including LSH and CDLSA.

**In Conclusion:**

The entirety of the LSA subjective effects breakdown for this particular article was not written by myself but the [PsychonautWiki](http://www.PsychonautWiki.org) admin known as [Cocoanatta](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/User:Cocoanatta). I have tried LSA myself on numerous occasions and can confirm that this article is indeed accurate.

As for the substance itself, although LSA is well known across the psychedelic community, this substance has a pretty bad reputation for causing painful states of nausea, vomiting and vasoconstriction despite the fact that this can be greatly reduced depending on the method of preparation. Alongside of this, LSA is also perceived as a substance which only causes very mild visual and cognitive effects in comparison to other more “classical” psychedelics.

This assumption however is simply untrue. LSA goes just as deep as LSD, mushrooms, ayahuasca or any other psychedelic and you simply need to find the right dosage and extract it correctly. This makes LSA an excellent choice for any psychonaut, especially when considering how cost effective and widely available the natural plant sources are.

## Quick Reference
- **Binomial / Botanical Name:** Argyreia Nervosa
- **Street Names:** Hawaiian Baby Woodrose
- **Major Active Compound:** LSA
- **Indigenous Source:** Indian Subcontinent
- **Form:** Seeds
- **RoA:** Oral
- **Personal Rating On Shulgin Scale:** ++

## Subjective Experience

Argyreia Nervosa has a rich history of traditional use, including in ayurvedic
medicine. It is referenced in a spiritual and ritual context in cultures as
geographically dispersed as Hawaii and Nepal.

Its seeds provided one of my biggest surprises in terms of psychoactive strength.
Contrary to the impression created by many Internet reports, just three were
sufficient to take me into Shulgin ++ territory. This was even more surprising given
that I had prepared a concoction, which for me, usually spells abject failure.

For the preparation I found that a number of approaches were suggested. In the end
the formula I adopted was to scrape the worst of the darkest colouration from each
seed, crush them with mortar and pestle, stir the powder into a glass of cold water
(not tap water), place this into the fridge overnight (keeping it covered), and finally
add a bit of shredded clove for the last hour or so, stirring every now and again.

This was quite an operation, but the outcome was a solid psychedelic experience,
similar to LSD, but with variation in headspace, and perhaps fewer visuals. It was
extremely pleasant, and without the nausea often reported. It faded after a few hours,
with no hangover or disagreeable residue.

## Summary
Argyreia nervosa is a perennial climbing vine native to the Indian subcontinent and introduced to numerous areas worldwide, including Hawaii, Africa, and the Caribbean. Though it can be invasive, it is often prized for its aesthetic and medicinal value. Common names include Hawaiian baby woodrose, adhoguda अधोगुडा or vidhara विधारा (Sanskrit), elephant creeper and woolly morning glory. Its seeds are known for their powerful entheogenic properties, greater or similar to those of Ipomoea species, with users reporting significant psychedelic and spiritual experiences. The two botanical varieties are Argyreia nervosa var. nervosa described here, and Argyreia nervosa var. speciosa, the roots of which are used in Ayurvedic medicine.
Argyreia nervosa contains various ergoline alkaloids such as ergine. A study reported stereoisomers of ergine to be found in the seeds at a concentration of 0.325% of dry weight. Two modern studies from a team of researchers also revealed lysergic acid, methylergometrine (syn. lysergic acid butanolamide), methysergide, lysergylalanine, and suspected, unidentifed ergopeptines. A study of the related Ipomoea tricolor showed that ergoline concentrations in the leaves are 12-fold lower than that of the seeds.

## History
While seeds of other Convolvulaceae, specifically Ipomoea corymbosa (ololiuhqui) and Ipomoea tricolor (tlitliltzin), were used in shamanic rituals of Latin America for centuries, A. nervosa was not traditionally used for this purpose. Its properties were first brought to attention in the 1960s.

## Cultivation
Where temperatures fall below 13 °C (55 °F), Argyreia nervosa is grown in a warm greenhouse. Elsewhere, it is grown on arbours, pergolas, walls, or trees. It is often grown professionally under glass in a loam-based potting compost (John Innes No. 3) in full light, and watered freely from spring to autumn, with a balanced liquid fertilizer applied monthly and reduced water in winter. It is grown outdoors in moderately fertile, moist but well-drained soil in full sun. Pruning is done in late winter.

## Entheogen
The seeds of A. nervosa contain ergot alkaloids varying considerably in concentration with LSA weight ranging between exactly similar looking seeds from 3 μg to 34 μg (avg 17 μg). However, in its effects, LSA is about one tenth as potent as its cousin LSD, making a threshold dose level for LSA (D-Lysergic Acid Amide) about 500 μg. The psychoactive effects of the seeds may therefore be due to other alkaloids present in them and the safe and effective dose may be difficult to predict.

## Uses in the traditional medicine of India
While he does not claim there to be any evidence for the use of the seeds  of A. nervosa as a traditional entheogen in its native India, Christian Rätsch does describe some interesting traditional uses of the root of the plant in Ayurveda somewhat suggestive of effects upon the CNS:

The root is regarded as a tonic for the nerves and brain and is ingested as a rejuvenation tonic and aphrodisiac to increase intelligence. 
Other traditional uses are in the treatment of gonorrhea, strangury, chronic ulcers, diabetes, anemia, and cerebral disorders. The plant is also used as appetizer, brain tonic, cardiotonic, and aphrodisiac. It possesses anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activities.  Claims that alternative medicines including Ayuverdic possess proven medical qualities, such as having widespread beneficial effects such as antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal activities are not claims that satisfy the scientific requirement of medical claims.  Further, since the plant is partially toxic even if there were medical benefit, which is not established, this would have to be weighed against the potential poisoning impact of the substance.
