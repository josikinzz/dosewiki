## Subjective Experience

Carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant, which according to the US National Library of
Medicine “is used with rest, physical therapy, and other measures to relax muscles
and relieve pain and discomfort caused by strains, sprains, and other muscle
injuries.” However, it is also known for its sedating, anxiolytic and hypnotic
properties, for which it has been recreationally used for a number of years, and is
sometimes claimed to have similar effects to barbiturates..

Dose presents a slight dilemma in that I am tempted to take two of the pills (700mg)
for which there are numerous trip reports on Drugs-Forum.com. However, in
consideration of the TripSit figures, and the disaster I had with the last sedating
prescription drug I sampled (pregabalin) I elect to target 425mg, about one pill and a
quarter, which sits more or less in the centre of the common range.

Research also identified serious warnings with respect to interaction with other
drugs, including alcohol and opioids, so I ensure that I am absolutely clean at the
time of testing. I would also point out that at time of writing addiction potential and
a number of other adverse effects are widely cited.

Finally, I am carrying a shoulder injury at the moment, so it will also be interesting to
see how this bears up.

I initiate the experiment at approximately 5pm, on an empty stomach.

```
T+0:00 I sit down at my computer and swallow the dose with a glass of water.
```
```
T+0:10 The first hint of a heady-dreaminess manifests itself in the form of
mild but nonetheless discernable waves.
```
```
T+1:00 I certainly feel sedated but not particularly elevated. I sense that I am
somewhat devoid of energy, but relaxed. Lethargic is a good word for this.
There is certainly a psychoactive effect albeit of an unexciting nature.
```
```
Note that the pain from my injury is still there, although it might be of a lower
order.
```
```
T+2:00 This is quite stable now. To varying degrees I am sedated, slightly
zoned out and weary. There is no discomfort present, and the pain I carried
into this is indeed reduced.
```
```
I feel no particular mood lift but I do feel that I could retire and sleep should I
choose to.
```
```
T+3:30 The earlier manifestations are still present but the intensity has now
faded somewhat.
```
```
T+5:00 The effects have continued to fade, and I am now ready to retire to
bed.
```
The night’s sleep was reasonable: no more disturbed than usual but not the blissful
eight hours I had hoped for. My shoulder pain was still in situ when I awoke and the
after effects the next morning comprised a minor sedation or placebo.

Note that the subsequent night’s sleep was of very poor quality. This may or may not
be connected, ditto the general lack of form.

Overall this was a solid if unspectacular ride, lacking uplift and euphoria, but
delivering an anxiolytic and relaxing sedation. Recreationally I suspect I would have
got more from it with a higher dose, but realistically it would be difficult to justify a
revisit, particularly given the potential risks referred to earlier.
