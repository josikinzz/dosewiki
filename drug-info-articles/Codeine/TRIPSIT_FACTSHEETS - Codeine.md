## Summary

Codeine is a weaker opioid used to treat mild to moderate pain and to treat coughs. In many countries it is available over the counter in combination with acetaminophen, which can easily be extracted to retrieve near-pure codeine. For this reason, it is used widely as a recreational opioid. It is metabolised into morphine in the body at a rate of 5% mg for mg.
