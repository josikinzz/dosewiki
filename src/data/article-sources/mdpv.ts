DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of MDPV are usually compared to [amphetamines](https://erowid.org/chemicals/amphetamines/) or other stimulants. A rough comedown is frequently reported, occasionally leading to compulsion to redose. 
 
 
Routes of Administration
 MDPV is most often taken via insufflation, though there are reports of it being orally ingested. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 MDPV is known to be associated with compulsive use ("fiending") in a minority of reports. Because its use is so uncommon, no definitive statements about its use can be made.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[4 mg insufflated] "I felt a mild euphoria, lightness in the head, and a bit speedy, but in a good way, wanting to get things done, rather than jittery and jumpy. Not a lot of feelings throughout the body, but rather in the head. [...] My creative writing skills are definitely enhanced, and I am sincerely enjoying the process of recording my thoughts to virtual paper. This is a good study aid perhaps, beneficial to writing research papers..." -- [Exp 78708](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=78708)
 
[3 mg insufflated] "Effects are starting to wear off, especially the happiness and euphoria. Still feeling energetic and have the need to do something. I feel the need to redose, however I control myself." -- [Exp 68773](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=68773)
 
[repeated insuff. redosing] "Doing/coming off of MDPV is like winning a Mercedes and being told at the last minute they got your name wrong. Uggh." -- [Exp 62097](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=62097)
 
[14 mg oral] "Hmm... heart-rate is back up at 86bpm. The mental/physical energy is totally gone. It's like I have been on a giant amusement park ride made of sparkly energy and the ride has slowly ground to a halt. Show's over. But the price to pay is this stubborn heart-rate issue. Tachycardia, my new friend. A racing, pounding heart in my chest. Not fun." -- [Exp 74539](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=74539)
 
[10 mg insuff. x 3] "Elevated blood pressure and pulse noted, slight pressure on the inside of my skull. Slightly anxious, but still in this centered, detached mood. Still wide awake. So far, it would have been impossible to sleep. Furthermore... Mild feelings of stiffness in the body. All in all, the comedown was perceived as very gentle despite the weird effects on my memory, which I really didn't care that much about. ... No problems remaining still like on some other stims. Rather, it had a couchlocking effect. In comparison with Amphetamine, this seems very mild indeed...." -- [Exp 80490](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=62097)
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 With virtually no available data from people taking single measured doses of MDPV, the phenomenon of redosing confounds what data does appear in reports. None of the dosing patterns are consistent, which makes it difficult to estimate duration of effects. 
 
 With MDPV, when people redose, it tends to have a really dramatic effect on the duration. The first dose might only last an hour, but with some people, it seems as if with subsequent doses, the effects are extended. The duration appears to be very dose dependent. 
Erowid's effects information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of effects people report experiencing. Effects may vary dramatically from one person to another or one experience to another based on a variety of factors such as body chemistry, age, gender, physical health, dose, form of material, etc.

MDPV was placed into Schedule I in September 2012 by Health Canada. See [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/_2012/2012-144-eng.php](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/_2012/2012-144-eng.php) . (thanks gl) (last updated Jun 30 2014)
 
Czech Republic #
 
The Czech Republic added a number of recent drugs to their controlled lists in early 2011, including BZP, 2C-I, PMMA, synthetic cannabinoids, and a variety of cathinone derivates including 4-methyl-methcathinone and MDPV. The Czech Republic has decriminalized possession of small amounts of most recreational drugs, so penalties for possession are quite low. See [Czech Drug Law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/law_czech.shtml) . (thanks p) (last updated Apr 17 2011)
 
Denmark #
 
MDPV was added to schedule B on Mar 13, 2009, meaning it is illegal to possess or consume without a license or prescription. (see [Danish legal information database](https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=123762) , [Danish Medicines Agency](http://www.dkma.dk/1024/visUKLSArtikel.asp?artikelID=14856) ).

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 2 mg
- Light: 4 - 8 mg
- Common: 8 - 14 mg
- Strong: 14 - 25 mg
- Heavy: 25 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 2 - 7 hours
- Onset: 15 - 30 minutes
- Peak: 1 - 4 hours
- Offset: 0.5 - 2 hours
- After effects: 2 - 48 hours
**MDPV may cause [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and addiction at a significantly higher rate than other stimulants.**
 
Due to its unusually long duration, extreme potency, and compulsive nature, it is strongly discouraged to abuse this substance in high doses, multiple days in a row, or in combination with other drugs known to increase the risk of psychosis. MDPV is one of several designer drugs that has been sold as " [bath salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_salts_(drug)) " both in the US and in Europe; In a four-year period between September 2009 and August 2013, the European Union (EU) reported a concerningly high number of MDPV-related deaths, reaching 99.
 
Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDPV#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone** (also known as **MDPV** , and **Monkey Dust** ) is a novel lesser-known [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) and [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_pyrrolidine) classes. It is known to be one of the most powerful and potent stimulants. MDPV is thought to act primarily as a [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (NDRI).

MDPV was first developed in the 1960s by a team at Boehringer Ingelheim. It was claimed to have potential to be an alternative for racemic amphetamine and, despite showing some desirable qualities such as reduced toxicity as compared to amphetamine, was chosen to not be developed as a medicinal drug.

MDPV remained an obscure stimulant until around 2004, when it was reportedly first made available to the public as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) . Products labeled as "bath salts" containing MDPV were previously sold as recreational drugs in gas stations and convenience stores in the United States, similar to the marketing strategy of [Spice and K2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synthetic_cannabinoids) as incense. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Subjective effects include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , and powerful [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) .

Several incidents of psychological and physical harm have been attributed to the use of MDPV, including an unusually large number of fatalities. A total of 107 non-fatal intoxications and 99 analytically confirmed deaths related to MDPV between September 2009 and August 2013 were reported by nine European countries.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

MDPV, or 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone, is a synthetic stimulant of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) and [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_pyrrolidine) classes. MDPV is the 3,4-methylenedioxy ring-substituted analog of the compound [a-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) , developed in the 1960s, which has been used for the treatment of chronic fatigue and as an anorectic, but caused problems of abuse and dependence.

However, despite some shared structural features, the effects of MDPV bear little resemblance to other methylenedioxy phenylalkylamine derivatives such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) ), instead producing primarily classical stimulant effects with only mild entactogenic qualities.

MDPV is structurally related to cathinone, an active alkaloid found in the khat plant, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methamphetamine, and other schedule I phenethylamines. MDPV, like some other substances in this class, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. MDPV is also reported to have hallucinogenic effects.

## Pharmacology

MDPV is thought to act primarily as a potent [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) . Reduced re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine results in higher concentrations of the two [catecholamine](/w/index.php?title=Catecholamine&action=edit&redlink=1) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) in the [synaptic cleft](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synapse) , or gap between [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) .

The result of this inhibition is an enhanced and prolonged concentration and resulting post-synaptic effect of dopaminergic and noradrenaline signaling at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors on the receiving neuron. [Serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) also plays a role, although to a much lesser degree. This sudden increase in neurotransmitter concentration in the brain is thought to be responsible for the high that MDPV produces.

Mainly possessing re-uptake inhibiting qualities and not releasing qualities, MDPV could be considered more like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) than [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) in method of action. In contrast, amphetamine acts primarily as an agonist to release dopamine and noradrenaline indirectly via activation of the TAAR1 receptor.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the offset of a stimulant experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its peak. This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of neurotransmitter depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
 It should be noted that many users consider the after effects of MDPV to be significantly more unpleasant if compulsively redosed. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The general cognitive effects of MDPV can be described as being similar to those of other typical stimulants. At common dosages, the MDPV high is described as being euphoric and slightly empatheogenic in its effects, causing increased motivation, sociability, sexual desire and concentration. Higher doses of MDPV, however, can intensify numerous negative effects such as anxiety and disorganized thoughts; at extremely high doses or continued use, delusions and psychosis become likely. 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - MDPV is extremely potent in this effect; it has been shown that some users end up redosing, even if the negative effects outweigh the positives.
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - This effect is prominent at higher doses and after long periods of staying awake on the drug.
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This effect can also manifest at high doses.

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: MDPV](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_MDPV.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

MDPV has a relatively short history of human use, with very few mentions concerning the use thereof before 2004. Although once considered a potential alternative to existing stimulants with a lower risk for toxicity, human MDPV administration has not been extensively studied in a clinical setting for many decades. Despite this, several recent studies on cases of persisting psychosis caused by chronic use of MDPV show promising rates of recovery among individuals who are treated with certain [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) and first-line [antihistamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antihistamine) . There is currently no conclusive data concerning the neurotoxicity of MDPV in the human brain.

Anecdotal evidence from those who have tried MDPV in the community suggest that there are no negative health effects associated with the substance if simply taken at low doses by itself and when used sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

Data taken from in-vitro and in-vivo studies have indicated that MDPV shares similar properties to [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) ; in fact, MDPV is more potent than these two stimulants in a number of varying ways. The over-excitation of dopamine and noradrenaline caused by MDPV use, combined with MDPV's potential inability to create compensatory serotonergic activity, sets the stage for a number of hostile and psychotic reactions to the drug. These hostile tendencies have been witnessed in emergency response situations, and have also seen wide television coverage in the past, after an individual under the influence of MDPV viciously assaulted an innocent bystander. It is uncertain if the individual had any pre-existing mental disorders or if he was under the influence of any other drugs. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Lethal dosage

The exact lethal dosage of MDPV is unknown and no formal studies have been carried out in humans. For sake of reference, one report placed the lethal dosage for a 39 year old male at 0.4 micrograms per millilitre or greater following the results of a post mortem, but this data is far too individually unique and the variables simply too diverse to derive any kind of meaningful information from it. MDPV may be quantified in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma MDPV concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >50 μg/L in intoxicated patients, and >300 μg/L in victims of acute overdose.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Dependence and abuse potential

More so than other stimulants, the chronic use of MDPV can be considered highly addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage. Addiction is a serious risk among users of MDPV as it easily causes compulsive redosing and causes highly unpleasant comedown symptoms.

### Psychosis

User reports indicate that chronic abuse or single exposure overdose of MDPV can potentially lead to [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) more readily than the vast majority of stimulants. Psychotic symptoms from MDPV can include [hearing voices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations) , [visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , urges to harm oneself, severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , grandiosity, [paranoid delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , increased aggression, and [irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability) .

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - MDPV can be potentially dangerous in combination with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) as it can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with MDPV should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - MDPV may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and other stimulants.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/MDPV*

**Methylenedioxypyrovalerone** (MDPV) is a potent, synthetic euphoric stimulant, which shares some of the empathogenic effects of MDMA and acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is known for its tendency to cause compulsive redosing and some users report sexual arousal. MDPV (together with Methylone and Mephedrone) is one of the first substances that have been found in products sold as "bath salts", "plant food/fertilizer", and in some "ecstasy" pills.

## History

MDPV was first developed in the 1960s by a team at Boehringer Ingelheim. It remained an obscure stimulant until around 2004 when it was reportedly sold as a designer drug. Products labeled as bath salts containing MDPV were previously sold as recreational drugs in gas stations and convenience stores in the United States, similar to the marketing for Spice and K2 as incense.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Systematic name: (RS)-1-(Benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentan-1-one

MDPV is the 3,4-methylenedioxy ring-substituted analog of the compound pyrovalerone, developed in the 1960s, which has been used for the treatment of chronic fatigue and as an anorectic, but caused problems of abuse and dependence. However, despite its structural similarity, the effects of MDPV bear little resemblance to other methylenedioxy phenylalkylamine derivatives such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA), instead producing primarily stimulant effects with only mild entactogenic qualities.

## Legal status

MDPV is currently in Schedule I in the United States. This means it is  illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or  give) without a DEA license.

MDPV is also illegal in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Sweden and the UK.

Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a stimulant of the cathinone class that acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).

## Use and effects

MDPV acts as a stimulant and has been reported to produce effects similar to those of cocaine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine.
The primary psychological effects have a duration of roughly 3 to 4 hours, with aftereffects such as tachycardia, hypertension, and mild stimulation lasting from 6 to 8 hours. High doses have been observed to cause intense, prolonged panic attacks in stimulant-intolerant users, and there are anecdotal reports of psychosis from sleep withdrawal and addiction at higher doses or more frequent dosing intervals. It has also been repeatedly noted to induce irresistible cravings to re-administer.
Reported modalities of intake include oral consumption, insufflation, smoking, rectal and intravenous use. It is supposedly active at doses of 3 to 5 mg, with typical doses ranging between 5 and 20 mg.

## Adverse effects

### Long-term effects

The long-term effects of MDPV on humans have not been studied, but it has been reported that mice treated with MDPV during adolescence show reinforcing behavior patterns to cocaine that are higher than the control groups. These behavioural changes are related to alterations of factor expression directly related to addiction. All this suggests an increased vulnerability to cocaine abuse.

### Documented fatalities

In April 2011, two weeks after being reported missing, two men in northwestern Pennsylvania were found dead in a remote location on government land. The official cause of death of both men was hypothermia, but toxicology reports later confirmed that both Troy Johnson, 29, and Terry Sumrow, 28, had ingested MDPV shortly before their deaths. "It wasn't anything to kill them, but enough to get them messed up," the county coroner said. MDPV containers were found in their vehicle along with spoons, hypodermic syringes and marijuana paraphernalia. In April 2011, an Alton, Illinois, woman apparently died from an MDPV overdose.
In May 2011, the CDC reported a hospital emergency department (ED) visit after the use of "bath salts" in Michigan. One person was reported dead on arrival at the ED. Associates of the dead person reported that he had used bath salts. His toxicology results revealed high levels of MDPV in addition to marijuana and prescription drugs. The primary factor contributing to death was cited as MDPV toxicity after autopsy was performed. An incident of hemiplegia has been reported.
A total of 107 non-fatal intoxications and 99 analytically confirmed deaths related to MDPV between September 2009 and August 2013 were reported by nine European countries.

## Overdose

Physicians often treat MDPV overdose cases with anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines, to lessen the drug-induced activity in the brain and body. In some cases, general anaesthesia was used because sedatives were ineffective.
Treatment in the emergency department for hypertensive emergency, tachycardia, agitation, or seizures consists of large doses of lorazepam in 2–4 mg increments every 10–15 minutes intravenously or intramuscularly. If this is not effective, haloperidol is an alternative treatment. It is suggested that the use of beta blockers to treat hypertension in these patients can cause an unopposed peripheral alpha-adrenergic effect with a dangerous paradoxical rise in blood pressure. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been shown to improve persistent psychotic symptoms associated with repeated MDPV use.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MDPV acts as a potent norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). Its IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration for monoamine reuptake inhibition were 4.1 nM for dopamine, 26 nM for norepinephrine, and 3,349 nM for serotonin in rat brain synaptosomes. Similarly, MDPV's IC50 values for monoamine reuptake inhibition were 10 nM for dopamine, 80 nM for norepinephrine, and 2,860 nM for serotonin in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells expressing the monoamine transporters. Hence, its activity at the dopamine transporter is about six to eight times stronger than at the norepinephrine transporter and it is virtually inactive at the serotonin transporter. (S)-MDPV is the active enantiomer, whereas (R)-MDPV is far less potent.
MDPV is much more potent than amphetamine as an NDRI, with 23-fold higher potency for dopamine reuptake inhibition and 2.6-fold greater potency for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition in rat brain synaptosomes. With HEK293 cells expressing the monoamine transporters, MDPV was 568-fold more potent as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and 12.5-fold more potent as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor than amphetamine. The drug is also far more potent as an NDRI than cocaine and mephedrone in both rat brain synaptosomes and HEK293 cells. MDPV is one of the most potent dopamine reuptake inhibitors in vitro or in vivo known. The only others that were more potent in vivo were desoxypipradrol (2-DPMP) and 3,4-dichloromethylphenidate (3-DCMP) and in vitro was α-PVP.
In addition to its monoamine reuptake inhibition, MDPV acts as a weakly efficacious partial norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (NDRA), with EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy values of 24% for both norepinephrine and dopamine in rat brain synaptosomes. However, MDPV failed to produce any dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin release at a concentration of 100,000 nM in HEK293 cells.
MDPV has no record of FDA approved medical use. It has been shown to produce robust reinforcing effects and compulsive self-administration in rats, though this had already been provisionally established by a number of documented cases of misuse and addiction in humans before the animal tests were carried out. When assayed in mice, repeated exposure to MDPV causes not only an anxiogenic effect but also increased aggressive behaviour, a feature that has already been observed in humans. As with MDMA, MDPV also caused a faster adaptation to repeated social isolation in rodents. A cross-sensitization between MDPV and cocaine has been evidenced. Furthermore, both psychostimulants, MDPV and cocaine, restore drug-seeking behavior with respect to each other, although relapse into drug-taking is always more pronounced with the conditioning drug. Moreover, memories associated with MDPV require more time to be extinguished. Also, in MDPV-treated mice, a priming-dose of cocaine triggers significant neuroplasticity, implying a high vulnerability to its abuse.
Similarly to other dopamine reuptake inhibitors like methylphenidate and bupropion, MDPV has been found to block methamphetamine-induced dopamine release in vitro. This is thought to be because substrate-type monoamine releasing agents like amphetamine and methamphetamine enter monoaminergic neurons via the monoamine transporters and then induce monoamine efflux intracellularly. By blocking the dopamine transporter, MDPV is thought to prevent access of these drugs into dopaminergic neurons and hence inhibits their dopamine release and associated effects.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Distribution

Permeability across the blood–brain barrier has been observed with cathinones like MDPV and mephedrone in vitro. The blood–brain barrier permeability of MDPV was found to be greater than that of amphetamine, methamphetamine, methcathinone, and mephedrone in vitro.

#### Metabolism

MDPV undergoes CYP450 2D6, 2C19, 1A2, and COMT phase 1 metabolism (liver) into methylcatechol and pyrrolidine, which in turn are glucuronated (uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyl-transferase) allowing it to be excreted by the kidneys, with only a small fraction of the metabolites being excreted into the stools. No free pyrrolidine will be detected in the urine.
Molecularly, this is seen as demethylenation of methylenedioxypyrovalerone (CYP2D6), followed by methylation of the aromatic ring via catechol-O-methyl transferase. Hydroxylation of both the aromatic ring and side chain then takes place, followed by an oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring to the corresponding lactam, with subsequent detachment and ring opening to the corresponding carboxylic acid.

## Chemistry

### Appearance

The hydrochloride salt exists as a very fine crystalline powder; it is hygroscopic and thus tends to form clumps, resembling something like powdered sugar. Its color can range from pure white to a yellowish-tan and has a slight odor that strengthens as it colors. Impurities are likely to consist of either pyrrolidine or alpha-dibrominated alkylphenones—respectively, from either excess pyrrolidine or incomplete amination during synthesis. These impurities likely account for its discoloration and fishy (pyrrolidine) or bromine-like odor, which worsens upon exposure to air, moisture, or bases.

### Detection in biological specimens

MDPV may be quantified in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma MDPV concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >50 μg/L in intoxicated patients, and >300 μg/L in victims of acute overdose.

### Analogues

MDPV is the 3,4-methylenedioxy ring-substituted analogue of the compound pyrovalerone, developed in the 1960s, which has been used for the treatment of chronic fatigue and as an anorectic, but caused problems of abuse and dependence. Other drugs with a similar chemical structure include α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (α-PPP), 4'-methyl-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (M-α-PPP), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (MDPPP) and 1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-pentanone (α-PVP).

## History

MDPV was first developed in the 1960s by a team at Boehringer Ingelheim. It remained an obscure stimulant until around 2004 when it was reportedly sold as a designer drug. In the US, products containing MDPV and labeled as bath salts were sold as recreational drugs in gas stations, similar to the marketing for Spice and K2 as incense, until it was banned in 2011.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

In 2010, a 33-year-old Swedish man was sentenced to six years in prison by an appellate court, Hovrätt, for possession of 250 grams of MDPV that had been acquired prior to criminalization.

#### Australia

In Western Australia, MDPV has been banned under the Poisons Act 1964, having been included in Appendix A Schedule 9 of the Poisons Act 1964 as from February 11, 2012. The Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia announced that anyone intending to sell or supply MDPV faces a maximum \$100,000 fine or 25 years in jail. Users face a \$2000 fine or two years' jail. Therefore, anyone caught with MDPV can be charged with possession, selling, supplying or intent to sell or supply.

#### Canada

Canadian Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq announced on June 5, 2012, that MDPV would be listed on Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which was realized on September 26, 2012.

#### Finland

MDPV is specifically listed as a controlled substance in Finland (listed appendix IV substance as of June 28, 2010),

#### United Kingdom

In the UK, following the ACMD's report on substituted cathinone derivatives, MDPV is a Class B drug under The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2010, making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess without a license.

#### United States

In the United States, MDPV is a DEA federally scheduled drug. On October 21, 2011, the DEA issued a temporary one-year ban on MDPV, classifying it as a schedule I substance. Schedule I status is reserved for substances with a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted use for treatment in the United States and a lack of accepted safety standards for use under medical supervision.
Before the federal ban was announced, MDPV was already banned in Louisiana and Florida. On March 24, 2011, Kentucky passed bill HB 121, which makes MDPV, as well as three other cathinones, controlled substances in the state. It also makes it a Class A misdemeanor to sell the drug, and a Class B misdemeanor to possess it.
MDPV is banned in New Jersey under Pamela's Law. The law is named after Pamela Schmidt, a Rutgers University student who was murdered in March 2011 by an alleged user of MDPV. A toxicology report later found no "bath salts" in his system.
On May 5, 2011, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam signed a law making it a crime "to knowingly produce, manufacture, distribute, sell, offer for sale or possess with intent to produce, manufacture, distribute, sell, or offer for sale" any product containing MDPV.
On July 6, 2011, the governor of Maine signed a bill establishing fines for possession and penalties for trafficking of MDPV.
On October 17, 2011, an Ohio law banning synthetic drugs took effect barring selling and/or possession of "any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any quantity of the following substances having a stimulant effect on the central nervous system, including their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers", listing ephedrine and pyrovalerone. It also specifically includes MDPV. Four days after this Ohio law was passed, the DEA's national emergency ban was implemented.
On December 8, 2011, under the Synthetic Drug Control Act, the US House of Representatives voted to ban MDPV and a variety of other synthetic drugs that had been legally sold in stores.
