## Summary

A chemical found in tobacco, aubergines and tomatoes. It is considered one of the most addictive drugs in existence. It is a mild stimulant, with nootropic and stress relieving effects. Nicotine is used in a variety of forms and is a large-part of what makes cigarettes and other tobacco products so addictive. Nicotine is suggested to be safer when ingested in isolation, such as nicotine vapes (in addition to the lack of combution and associated harm via cigarette smoking).
