## SYNTHESIS
A solution of 3.3 g 3,5-dimethoxy-4-ethoxybenzaldehyde in 25 mL nitroethane was treated with 0.5 g anhydrous ammonium acetate and heated on the steam bath for 36 h. The solvent/reagent was removed under vacuum giving a thick yellow-orange oil that was dissolved in two volumes hot MeOH. As this cooled, crystals appeared spontaneously, and after cooling in ice for a short time, these were removed by filtration and washed sparingly with cold MeOH, Air drying to constant weight provided 2.2 g 1-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-ethoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene with a mp of 84â85 Â°C. The mother liquors, on standing overnight, deposited large chunks of crystalline material which was isolated by decantation, ground up under a small amount of methanol, then recrystallized from 60% EtOH. A second crop of 0.7 g of the nitrostyrene was thus obtained, as canary-yellow crystals with a mp of 83â85 Â°C.

A solution of 2.7 g 1-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-ethoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene in 20 mL anhydrous THF was added to a suspension of 2.0 g LAH in 150 mL warm THF. The mixture was held at reflux for 48 h. After stirring at room temperature for another 48 h, the excess hydride was destroyed by the addition of 2.0 mL H2O in 10 mL THF, followed by 2.0 mL 15% NaOH and then an additional 6.0 mL H2O. The inorganic salts were removed by filtration, and the filter cake washed with THF. The combined mother liquor and washings were stripped of solvent under vacuum leaving a yellow oil with some inorganic salts still in it. This was dissolved in 300 mL CH2Cl2, washed with dilute NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã150 mL 1 N HCl. The pooled extracts were washed once with CH2Cl2 made basic with 25% NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2. The combined organics were washed with saturated brine, and the solvent removed under vacuum to yield about 2 mL of a colorless oil. This was dissolved in 10 mL IPA, neutralized with concentrated HCl (10 drops were required), and diluted with 125 mL anhydrous Et2O. The slight cloudiness gradually became the formation of fine white crystals. After standing at room temperature for 2 h, these were removed, Et2O washed, and air dried. There was thus obtained 1.9 g of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-ethoxyamphetamine hydrochloride (3C-E) as brilliant white crystals.

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 60 mg) âVisuals very strong, insistent. Body discomfort remained very heavy for first hour. Sense of implacable imposition of something toxic for a while. I felt at the mercy of uncomfortable physical effectsâfaint or pre-nausea, heavy feeling of tremor (although tremor actually relatively light) and general dis-ease, un-ease, non-ease. Kept lying down so as to be as comfortable as possible. Fantasy began to be quite strong. At first, no eyes closed images, and certainly anti-erotic.  2nd hour on, bright colors, distinct shapesâjewel-likeâwith eyes closed. Suddenly it became clearly not anti-erotic. That was the end of my bad place, and I shot immediately up to a +++. Complex fantasy which takes overâhard to know what is real, what is fantasy. Continual erotic. Image of glass-walled apartment building in mid-desert. Exquisite sensitivity. Down by ? midnight. Next morning, faint flickering lights on looking out windows.â
