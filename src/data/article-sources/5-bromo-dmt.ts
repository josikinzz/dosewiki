5-Bromo-DMT, or 5-Br-DMT, also known as 5-bromo-N,N-dimethyltryptamine or by informal names like sea DMT or SpongeBob DMT, is a psychedelic drug and brominated indole alkaloid of the tryptamine family related to dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is the 5-bromo derivative of DMT. The drug is naturally occurring in the sponges Smenospongia aurea and Smenospongia echina, as well as in Verongula rigida (0.00142% dry weight) alongside 5,6-dibromo-DMT (0.35% dry weight) and seven other alkaloids. It has been encountered as a novel designer drug.

## Use and effects

5-Bromo-DMT was only briefly mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and its properties and effects were not described. Subsequently, the drug has been reported by others to have a dose of 20 to 50 mg smoked and a duration of 15 minutes to 1.5 hours. It is minimally active or inactive orally. It was described as producing mild psychedelic effects, such as visuals, pronounced tactile effects, and euphoria. 5-Bromo-DMT was said to be similar to low-dose DMT, but also distinct from it. A 50 mg dose was said to be near the limit of what can be physically inhaled. However, it was thought that greater exposure to the drug nonetheless might be able to produce stronger effects. These findings were reported in a Shulgin- or TiHKAL-like style via credible anonymous personal communication with Hamilton Morris and Jason Wallach.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

5-Bromo-DMT is a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, with an affinity (Ki) of 138 nM, an EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration of 77.7 to 3,090 nM, and an EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy of 34 to 100%. It also shows affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors and for the serotonin transporter (SERT) (Ki = 16.9 nM, 403 nM, 193 nM, and 971 nM, respectively). The drug is a weak serotonin 5-HT1A receptor full agonist (EC50 = 1,810 nM; Emax = 94%) and a very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 8,055 nM).
In contrast to 5-fluoro-DMT and 5-chloro-DMT, 5-bromo-DMT failed to significantly produce the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. As such, 5-bromo-DMT would be expected to be non-hallucinogenic in humans. In addition, 5-bromo-DMT antagonized the head-twitch response induced by 5-fluoro-DMT. On the other hand, 5-bromo-DMT produced antidepressant-like effects,  hypolocomotion or sedative-like effects, and hypothermia in rodents. Moreover, 5-bromo-DMT has been found to produce psychoplastogenic effects.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 5-bromo-DMT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 5-bromo-DMT include 5,6-dibromo-DMT, 5-fluoro-DMT, 5-chloro-DMT, bretisilocin (5-fluoro-MET), 5-fluoro-DET, 5-fluoro-AMT, 5-chloro-AMT, BK-5Br-NM-AMT, 5-nitro-DMT, convolutindole A, desformylflustrabromine, and plakohypaphorine, among others.

## History

5-Bromo-DMT was briefly mentioned by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), but he did not synthesize or test it. Hamilton Morris and Jason Wallach reported the properties and hallucinogenic effects of 5-bromo-DMT in humans in 2013 via publication of credible personal communication with an anonymous "Dr. Osculum". 5-Bromo-DMT was described as a novel designer drug by 2020.
