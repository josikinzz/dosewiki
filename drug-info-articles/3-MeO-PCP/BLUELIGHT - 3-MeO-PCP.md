**Welcome to the Big & Dandy 3-MeO-PCP Thread - Part 4**


**Formula : 1-{1-(3-Methoxyphenyl)-cyclohexyl}-piperidine**


![3-methoxyphencyclidine.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fd%2Fd9%2F3-methoxyphencyclidine.png&hash=ee06e6db4ccd23fc325229f999cf1bc6)


*Warning


**Do not exceed the recommended dosage range! If you read this thread you will realize the numerous demonstrations of psychotic delirium, amnesia, mania, various kinds of misbehavior and other serious consequences of abuse.

Preferably use this substance orally (it seems to be effective and reliable that way, and your dosage will match those you read about better - and is imo for these reasons safer), slowly work your way up to about 10 mg, and only after considerable experience / expertise proceed to maybe 15 mg, with SMALL STEPS.


Your previous experience with other drugs does not give you any protection against the sudden increase in manic / psychosis-like risk above certain dosages. Do not think you can treat it like MXE or ketamine. And most certainly never eyeball it!

**

If you have corrections / additions to this warning post about it in the thread.

The corresponding 4-methoxy derivative 4-MeO-PCP is also known, but is around 10 times less potent by weight than the 3-methoxy isomer, making it around the same potency as ketamine.

3-MeO-PCP hydrochloride is a white crystalline solid with a melting point of 204-205°C [5]

3-MeO-PCP has a Ki of 20 nM for the NMDA receptor, 216 nM for the serotonin transporter and 42 for the sigma1 receptor[6]

On October 18, 2012 the ACMD released a report about methoxetamine, saying that the "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)", despite the fact that the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report went on to suggest that all analogues of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines, including 3-MeO-PCP.[6]

And if it does happen, it doesn't really feel like much because the euphoria is smoothed out across the entire sexual experience. This actually seems to pan out better for both parties involved.

Granted, I tend to use it in small bumps and avoid any dissociation, because I find when I'm dissociated, it's hard to get it up (MXE for example, sex is impossible for me on MXE, except for this one time).

I'm not sure my four day 3-MeO-PCP low dosing schedule did the trick for me. I had 4 x 12 mg measured and eyeballed 3 mg dosages taking them nasally about every four hours or so. 


First day just noticed a mood improvement, and after the second dose I was starting to feel a little bit dissociated. Just threshold, though, but noticeable still.  Finished the day doing Yoga and it felt cleansing and pleasurable.


The second day I think was the best, I was feeling lot's of energy, motivation, pretty excited ... hypomanic I would say, but nothing too crazy. Productive day at work, felt mentally sharp. At the end of the night I did feel like I was having some wild mood swings though, like I was generally feeling pretty uplifted and then very small things made me feel disproportionately upset and grumpy, but the feeling would fade pretty quickly and I would be back to feeling good. I wrote it off as tiredness at the moment, though. 


Saturday was the third day, and by that time I'm not sure the 3-MeO- PCP was doing much. I didn't really feel anything when dosing, just a little weirdness for the fist half hour after taking the bump, but then it didn't develop into much of anything. That night I took some MXE on top of the PCP baseline (25 mg plus 10 mg two hours latter, orally) and as expected it had a great synergy. I had a very beautiful experience strolling through the empty streets of the city during a night of rain. Magical stuff, feeling in love with the world type of experience.


I woke up feeling still a little bit dissociated, but decided to keep going with the low doses of 3-MeO-PCP. In the fourth consecutive day I was just feeling sort of scatter-brained, and very mentally exhausted, even though I wasn't much tired physically. I had band practice but didn't feel particularly enhanced. I just had a general feeling of having over-done it. At the end of the evening  I was pretty much zombified, not motivated at all, sort of depressed even. 


Now it's monday and I'm still feeling a little bit burnt out. 


I did this out of curiosity, it was my first time ever dosing a dissociative on consecutive days (Or any other drug excepting weed and alcohol very occasionally), and mostly because I was interested in whether I would be able to maintain the hypomanic afterglow I sometimes get from this drug. I certainly didn't feel pronounced mania, but I did benefit of the stimulant-like effects for the first two days.  Doing this I never felt the beautiful next-day afterglow, but I must also say that I don't always get it when dosing orally either. Still,at least in my experience it is easier to achieve that state after coming down from a single medium-to-high oral dose (For me that's around 12-15 mg). 


I don't think I'll be trying this again, seems like my brain didn't cope with being off baseline for that long. Well, guess it's time to stay sober for a while. I think I'm a little bit dopamine depleted or something.

Img_9999 your story sounds similar to what I've experienced. I've never been able to hit any magic place with it besides four or five times. The last of which, a  few weeks ago, having left me feeling like I finally pierced through. But alas, dosing the next day and day after just left me feeling fried and worthless.

Yeah, from now on I will stick to single oral doses, seems to agree better with me. Sometimes I get the magical afterglow but it's kind of elusive and random. I still enjoy very much the "functional", stimulating dissociation it gives me at 10 (+/-2)  mgs, and the trippyness that comes pushing the dose closer to 15 mg and combining with weed. Haven't ventured further and don't really feel the need. 


In a way I feel 'glad' that dosing for multiple days didn't work all that well. When this chemical does it for me, it's pretty amazing at that, so it would be too tempting to make a habit out of it.

I've just noticed Crashing's post about hormonally making males more female. I don't know what other people have experienced, but last time I used it,for a few days was when I came to openly realize my non-binary gender identity. Even though it has been about 2 months since then without using, I never 'unrealized' that realization. I mean, I have always been some degree of gender fluid or 'trans-curious' but 3meo brought it to light in a very real way. It wasn't like when I came down I felt like ' It was just a trip'. Kinda like when in July during a deep contemplative trip I concluded beyond personal doubt my belief in the 'Simulation Hypothesis'. When I came down from the trip it still felt every bit as 'real' and still does, months later. 


What does this mean? This shit can have some seriously lasting effects. Be careful not too get too deluded or disconnected from 'reality' cause I can see the possibility of not returning.

The first time I did it I had a few cocktails in me and snorted 20mg and then smoked some herb


Was wonderful....very much put me in a world of dissociation.....about 3 hours in I took a nap....nasal is almost immediate for me....I much prefer that route to oral...oral takes to long and doesn't give me that stim feel I get from sniffing it

The hole is not the goal, though I do invite it from time to time. I skirted around it today. I am not a poetic person by habit.


Gently spinning

A magnetic ball clinging to a metal bowl

Going down, toward the hole


Taste of aluminum


Surfing the rim

I have a choice


Invert the bowl

Spiral out, down, repelled from the void


Dimensions distorted

Extremeties' perception extremely contorted


I remember me

Take deep breaths

Fix my proprioception

Flex digits

Open eyes

Shamble to the shower

Wash it away


Why do I like this drug?


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSa1VtZhx2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSa1VtZhx2g)

Gonna get me a little oblivion, baby

Try to keep myself away from me


*Also, music is a big catalyst for 3-meo-pcp for me. Phantogram was what eased me down toward the event horizon this time.

It definitely can develop mood swings when dosing consecutively but I use beer kratom and weed during any of these potential low spots in the 3-meo-pcp experience and I think it allows me to use the drug indefinitely, although i did about 100ug of LSD about 7 or 8 days in a couple days ago and ended up getting some strong paranoia that no amount of beer weed or kratom that i personally wanted to ingest was going to even poke a stick at. So I decided to take a day off, and now on day 2 which is my second day off after maybe a 2 week nearly solid run I feel 100% baseline, so I don't really see a reason not to dive right back in. YMMV though, and I think using solely 3-meo-pcp would be a recipe for much more regular breaks.


I love this drug because I know the real me isn't totally the person I want to be, and i'm totally happy with that because we have the tools for the job. In the past, angry people drank moonshine and got angrier. But I guess we've come a long way.

Damn thank you for summing up a thought I had been trying to figure out how to express. I feel like each psychedelic has a particular hard drug addiction it can help based on a similar energy center or Chakra they play on.


 Mushrooms greatly helped me with my addiction to opiates, LSD helped me realize that MDMA and amphetamines are a double edged sword to be used sparingly if at all. 3meo PcP is amazing in that it treats something that I thought I was gonna just have to deal with on my own : my predisposition towards alcoholism.


 3meo allows me to enter that "editing mode" that alcohol has allowed me to mess with for most of my life but I can REMEMBER EVERYTHING and my empathy towards humans and nature isn't muted into a dim whisper like when I am drunk. I become my most cosmic and unfiltered self on 3meo, and then I edit the useful parts together and "tone down" my anger, impatience and selfishness

Hmm while I appreciate this stuff a lot, it definitely doesn't make me feel like the 'real' me like LSD or best of all for that, mescaline, does. That whole manic thing etc is unmistakably unreal imo.


Is it different when you take so much that you get actual delusions of grandeur etc meaning that you can't tell the unrealness anymore? There have been enough posts that made it plenty clear people completely lose sight of that, but I would think that when coming down you'd realize.


For a while (probably a few years ago?) I thought that when I was relatively new to 3-MeO-PCP the state it produces at a pretty moderate dose was actual Zen. Later I seriously changed my mind about that, considering it is just as much a mistake as to have the classic misperception that 'meditating is about having no thoughts in your head'.

Low doses are "weirder" and feel almost "synthetic" or "unreal" because the energy from the mania gives the high an almost speed like vibe. I pushed the dose pretty high and had something akin to a drunken ayahuasca trip where I saw a billowing black demon of smoke that told me it was a manifestation of the darkest most intimate self serving parts of myself. It then explained if I wished I could "edit" myself on this level so as to have more or less of this darkness when I "returned" I have only had one trip this intense on 3meo and on it I could barely stand up and I ended up staggering into my back yard and kneeling under a tree to meditate. I felt a repulsive feeling in my gut and vomitted. I felt SO cleansed and immediately I felt all the light of the world and love I had felt throughout my live come raining down on me as the moon peaked out from the clouds. It was probably one of my best trips on anything ever. I woke up the next day and felt like I was finally an adult in some strange way I had always felt lacking. Just confident and cautious.

I seem unable to get the hypomania from this batch, unfortunately. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  Weirdly, I enjoy the acute dissociation of higher doses on it MORE.  It's very strange.  I need to find myself some of the same stuff I had each time before, I really mostly value the low-dose hypomania aspect of this drug the most.  If I had both I could utilize it either way.  This batch is still mildly euphoric, but just more sparkly, with an MXE-like twinge to the dissociation I have never felt from it before.  But the other 3-MeO I've had consistently produced a very specific, wonderful hypomanic euphoria at any dose, repeated countless times with great reliability.  The dose is the same and the feeling of it is very, very similar.  My friends all agree too.  I don't think I'm imagining this and I think it really is 3-MeO-PCP.  I want to send it in to be tested, but I don't want to spend the money because it's pretty expensive as far as I can tell (never actually done it, and I live in the US).

Yeah, I think testing stuff @ ecstasy data costs you around 100 bucks. 


The batch I have is kinda similar to what you describe, or at least the effects in your last post reflect what I get from it. I still get the hypomania, but it comes at random.


I wonder what is it with dissociatives and different batches. I have not heard of other classes of drugs giving so different effect profiles. Just differences in potency or such. With dissos the variability is wild. Could it be that taking breaks has an effect in the way they affect us ? Like, when your drugs are over you are forced to take a break, then a new batch arrives and the effect is different because the break caused something. But I don't know. I have leftover MXE from two different batches and I can tell subtle, consistent differences in their effects. 


I don't buy the crystal polymorphism  theory, doesn't sound like sound science .-. 


It's a mistery !

^ that's so interesting.

As i mentioned in the previous thread, i've only encountered the one batch of this substance, and it fits your description of xorkoth's recent batch - i never really got a lot of the manic stimulation you guys have been talking about, and wondered if it was just me.

Like you say, img_9999 the hypomania is random, i certainly can't count on it.


My way of dosing it corresponded with this - i was generally going for the 'hole' rather than tiny bumps because that's where i perceived the magic to lie - even though nobody else on here seemed to be reporting anything positive about higher dosing, and i questioned if i was just being reckless or that my relative inexperience with dissociatives (compared to say, classic psychedelics) was leading me to treat it like mxe (because it reminds me *somewhat* of mxe).


But your latest batch sounds like the only stuff i've had xork.

And though i've not experienced the 'other' kind of effects from this drug (assuming it is the same drug) i am very fond of it.

With dissos the variability is wild. Could it be that taking breaks has an effect in the way the affect us ? Like, when your drugs are over you are forced to take a break, then a new batch arrives and the effect is different because the break caused something. But I don't. I have leftover MXE from two different batches and I can tell subtle, consistent differences in effect.

Delsyd and I were speculating on that very question earlier today.  It's weird, but I notice it with various dissociatives.  Certainly MXE, no one is ever going to be able to convince me that different batches weren't different (in some cases quite different).  A lot of other peoples' experience corroborates this too.  At this point I'm looking for it to not be true but I can't deny it happens.

Active impurities seems more plausible than polymorphism...


As for regular PCP, several of the routes that make it can yield 1-phenyl-1-cyclohexylamine (PCA) as intermediate which is active, it's about half as strong. Perhaps the 3-MeO analogue is identical in these respects.

If hypothetically this is all true and 3-MeO-PCA is generally the culprit then it stands to reason that it is responsible for the hypomania or additional / stronger hypomania rather than the opposite possibility that it must be absent to get the hypomania, that it somehow suppresses it or prevents it. But technically that is also not implausible.


The furthest I can push that polymorphism theory is when solubility differences would affect absorption and pharmacokinetics, I find snorting it pretty damn different from oral just like with MXE there is a big difference... and the ROA doesn't change anything but the kinetics right?


So either of those explanations?

What about that HIV medication that only exhibits its intended action in one of its polymorphs?  I remember someone linking to that article some time ago when having this discussion about MXE.  To me that was evidence that it's possible for polymorphism to dramatically affect a drug's action.  Unfortunately I can't reference it, but I remember someone linking to it.

This white crystalline batch of meo is much more mongy and psychedelic than my tan batch, which is speedier and more manic. I prefer the white batch personally, but it's good to know we've got options.

I think that means you will eventually be fine, but you can never totally go back to a previous state because of the whole timey-wimey law-of-entropy racket. Your consciousness spectra and grey matter soup could be modulated in fantastic and scary ways that are hard to change without such a unique 'molecular swiss army knife', but the question of whether this tool can make swiss cheese out of one's grey matter 'a la' Olney's Lesions is speculative.


To actually answer your question (the comic relief should help heal and ground you, so keep seeing the funny side of life), you should be near baseline in a few days to a week. A month or two after that you'll be feeling 'dead sober' wishing you had some more 3meo to break yourself again (or is it simply breaking one's ego so the spirit can run free?)

Yeah when I have kept my runs going long enough, past 5 days, I start to feel a little unhinged.  I don't like that feeling, it's a little alarming.  I can remember sitting at my desk, trying to work, my head just whirling with noise.  


This batch hasn't been able to produce that prolonged hypomania for me yet.  I haven't been feeling compelled to take it multiple days in a row, instead I've been taking somewhat larger amounts in single nights and having really nice, euphoric and more dissociated-style experiences.  I'm almost surely going to take some tonight at a show I'm going to.  I enjoy this, but I wish I had the other batch too for that sort of effect as it's primarily what I want from 3-MeO.

You're talking about the batch I'm talking about, right?  Yeah, definitely more psychedelic, right?  I'm curious whether you get the hypomania from it.  I can't seem to get my brain to like me taking low doses throughout the day for multiple days.

The two batches are pretty different effects wise, although they share some staggering similarities. It's almost like the tan batch is "hotter" and the white batch is "cooler". I like both batches, both are mega potent active at 1mg. Effects take a very long time to fully settle in, doses can be titrated up to 30mg + over the course of several hours at which point it becomes incredibly ayahuasca-like from what I can tell. Entering the hole accidentally is very easy and almost always happens eventually. Typically a sober like state is achieved after sleep but the effects can tend to pick up where they left off upon re-administration. I may mix the batches and test the results.

Its safe to say that I use this substance functionally everyday with very little side effects. I go into a mild psychosis maybe once a week at which time i quickly become aware of the psychosis and it usually only lasts 20 minutes or so. This is when i feel like everybody is watching me and my whole life was a setup, which is a notion i've been having since birth either way. 


More to come.

The only side effect for me has been mania. I recognize it and it has been helpful actually but too much is too much sometimes and I need to take a break. Last time I was really manic for 2 days after last dose, I don't know what would have happened if I had taken more. Now it's time for a longer break after consuming almost 2 grams of 3meo this year.

3-MeO-PCP is among the best writing enhancers for me.  I get that slightly dissociated/free association thing, without a reduction in mental or physical functioning, and it always helps me to get into closer access with past memories, allowing me to relive them and thus describe more fully.  The hypomanic edge makes me feel creative with my word choices.  I'm working on writing a TR for a reallyimpactful trip of mine from over a year ago, I've been meaning to write it for a long time but I could never really get a start on it because it's a hard one to describe.  Well, last night I decided to take a couple of bumps of 3-MeO and give it a try, and it's coming along swimmingly. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hey, we don't use swim here! :D


To those who are taking this frequently - how is your sleep quality? I've found 3-MeO-PCP to be a relatively functional dissociative, but felt like it always disturbed my sleep patterns. I'm not using other drugs at this point so I'm wondering what would be the best course of action here. I'm thinking of trying small doses in the morning and riding it throughout the day, then possibly taking melatonin later if I'm still feeling restless (although melatonin sometimes makes me feel groggy/depressed the next morning). I'm hoping the urge to redose doesn't interfere too much.


There's been many times where I've tried this sort of regimen before and found myself redosing after 6pm and being unable to get to sleep until the wee hours of the morning. That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid this go-around.

I've slept well on it and usually can fall asleep 3-4 hours after last dose (nasal) especially with melatonin. No problem waking up either, weed is way worse in that regard.

I really can't take it after ~ noon if I want to have decent sleep, but other dissociatives like K or MXE when comparing the timeframe of their action cause ridiculous trailing insomnia for me while 3-MeO-PCP is not too bad it seems. It just lasts long so to me it's fair that I have to dose early in the day.


Absolutely don't or didn't understand how you take it at night xammy but being able to fall asleep 3-4 hrs later explains it I guess.


I took a little bit of it to day though I also have taken my dexamph, the doses are clearly low enough that it's not a problem but I wouldn't want to go higher. There is some weirdness here and there and I think my bp may be on the higher end.

Generally it doesn't make sleeping specially difficult for me, but during my 4 days experiment I did notice that my quality of sleep was shitty. I woke up earlier than intended, feeling tired but couldn't manage to get back to sleep (BTW, this seems to happen to me with alcohol too).

It interferes with sleep but only while I'm actively dissociated on it, once it drops off to the subtle effects I can sleep fine.  It may make my quality of sleep worse, it's hard to say, but I can drop off to sleep pretty easily.

Thanks for all the feedback. Solipsis, your experience sounds most similar to mine. If I think about it, I do recall more trouble falling asleep with MXE than 3-MeO-PCP. It's hard to say though, I was smoking weed in the past and that obviously affects sleep as well.  Anyway, I think I'll keep my doses to the morning and see how it works out.

Oh yeah for me I can't sleep anywhere near doing MXE.  It's weird because I feel more stimulated on 3-MeO than on MXE.

I think that it's just because 3meo doesn't get boring until it completely drops off and you can sleep? 


With other dissos like 2-OxO-PCE or 2-OxO-PCM I feel like wanting to go to baseline and get some sleep done before the experience is even near to finish, while on 3meo I just enjoy the 7-8h ride like if it was acid and don't even think or want to sleep until it ends ^^U

That was always the case for a few days, for me, following a heavy dose of DXM. Would wake up super early, super charged, and completely loopy.


As far as different batches having different effects, chirality, side reactions as previously stated and maybe due to the PCC impurity found in this class of compounds.


"As both the intermediate nitrile PCC **(2) and the final product (such as PCP) have similar basicity and solution properties, any incomplete conversion will result in a product containing varying amounts of PCC as a contaminant. This chemical may well be implicated in the toxic complications associated with PCP use[14](https://erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/pcp.shulgin.html#refs). Immense care is taken during illicit manufacture at the stage where this intermediate is collected and dried, more even than in the handling of the final product. Chronic exposure to this compound has led to an aggravated psychotic condition that has resulted in a protracted hypersensitivity to the chemical, as shown by skin-patch assay[15](https://erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/pcp.shulgin.html#refs). The extent of contamination of PCP with this intermediate is difficult to determine, as most analytical schemes (GLC, TLC) appear to promote its decomposition. A technique has recently been developed allowing estimation of PCC in PCP and TCP[16](https://erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/pcp.shulgin.html#refs). A major laboratory, which has had extensive experience in the analysis of street drugs, has found that in all samples submitted for analysis which proved to be PCP, approximately 20% contained detectable amounts of PCC[17](https://erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/pcp.shulgin.html#refs)." from **[h=2]Illicit Synthesis of Phencyclidine (PCP) and Several of Its Analogs[/h][h=4]A.T.

That one is supposed to smell like almonds though, it would be noticed?


Modern 3-MeO-PCP synthesis may not be comparable to illicit PCP synthesis in the 70s. Not talking about the strategy but the conditions.

Are you saying PCC is the one that smells like almonds? All batches of 3-meo I've run across have an almond smell to some extent.


@Xorkoth; Both batches I got in the last year were white and crystalline, though the more recent one is a bit more floury and soft looking if that makes sense. This newer batch does not seem to produce the same kind of mania for me, but its possible that it's just tolerance. Point being that I've got both sorts of the range of effects you describe from white crystalline material (I've never had the tan kind).

With increasing batches, i've found decreasing mania. The first actual crystalline batches were the ones that turned me into Terence McKenna. Then, my more later tan batch seems so be much more grounding and medicinal. I'm currently on my 4th gram of Meo within a year's span, the white fluff batch which seems to have a peculiar quality. 


This white batch seems to have mild anti depressive effects underneath 20-30mg, which is what i'm after. I think a lot of the way this is unfolding is due to tolerance, which is fine because ultimately I was looking for an anti-depressant that actually works. (Coming from a history of Heroin, Crack, MDPV, Phenaz, and a variety of other substances, I'm pretty happy to currently be using Kratom, Alcohol, Weed, and Meo as my medicinal regimen.) Once I get over the 30mg mark, incredibly strong mania ensues. This fourth batch seems to induce something quite undesirable at high doses, whereas my initial chunky crystalline batches produced a remarkably godlike mania at doses above 15mg. 


Overall, I haven't experienced any truly detrimental effects other than coming down which can have a slight rebound effect, yet the overall positives seem to very strongly outweigh the negatives since my life is improving on a grand scale in a way I would have never thought possible. I'm able to use psychedelic drugs occasionally once again to connect to my surroundings and have the best experiences imaginable which is what I was after in the first place when dabbling in drugs about 14 years ago. 


So, to conclude for now, psychedelics and dissociative drugs have saved my life and 3-meo-pcp has probably been the real turning point. I have about 250mg or so left of the tan flour batch, and have begun crossfading dosing into the white batch. More to come. . .


Side note - The current tan batch seems to be 2x as strong as the white fluff, and has a far more caustic/burning lasting reaction to the tongue (way more bitter). I much prefer the tan to the white batch, which has a strange mildewy trombone-like flavor.

I think we're on the same batch, Crashing. For me this batch is actually pretty psychedelic, but less easily so than my earlier white crystalline batch. Meaning that I have to dive a bit deeper, to get that same vibe, making it easy to overshoot. That said, overshooting on this isn't the worst thing in the world. This batch is a bit tricky dose-wise.


In lower doses it feels completely different, less sharp. A trombone is actually spot-on. I feeling I really like from this material is being completely in tune with the progression of things, and to feel that I need to go higher which also dials up the crazy

Yeah they're all good i just slightly prefer the previous batches at this point. The white does the trick for me though, I prefer snorting the white batch and lingy for the tan.

Yeah I like it too, it's just, for the life of me I can't attain the same plateau of hypomania with it.  I do find it more desirable to use higher doses on because like others have said it's definitively more psychedelic, reminds me of MXE kind of but less wonky.  Unfortunately for me, the main thing I'm after with 3-MeO is that functional hypomanic state, which I why I prefer the other batches I've had.

I fully agree. I can hole on the white batch but it's not as psychedelic as MXE or MXM, it's more of a DXE style void.

I think all dissociatives can feel anti-depressant just by breaking the cycle of rumination that drives a lot of depression and maybe resetting the default mode network a bit (ketamine has other special mechanisms for it's anti-depressant potential though), but I do not recommend using 3-MeO-PCP as anti-depressant because apparent AD effects are not sustainable in my experience, and trust me I tried to use if for those purposes for quite a while, dosing with much restraint focused on that purpose... Not that it is technically out of the question that there are other NMDA antagonists that are anti-depressant like K from mtor mechanisms via NMDA antagonism... but speaking for myself, in retrospect 3-MeO-PCP mostly helped me 'survive' a very bad time (paws and problems with housing etc) by a combination of numbing and stimulating. Seemed subtle and functional enough, but I got removed from myself more than I cared to admit and it costed me something else in the end.


I don't think it's responsible to wishfully think other batches may somehow be actually anti-depressant, I'm sorry. Please, be cautioned.

*The other strong characteristic of the combination is the incredible post-peak euphoria and afterglow. Once I hit a certain amount of ketamine (sometimes after the first dose, sometimes after the 2nd or 3rd), I feel an incredible pure happiness (once out of the hole), stronger and more "real" than any drug induced euphoria I've ever felt. The initial half of the experience - 3-MeO-PCP on its own - can be almost slightly dysphoric. The intense pleasure of the afterglow then persists throughout the next day, and sometimes the day after. Most powerful antidepressant effect I've ever felt.*


I have had similar experiences with 3-meo-pcp + ketamine, even though I haven't holed when I combined them. Well 3meo hasn't been dysphoric once I "got it", maybe in the beginning it felt clinical compared to MXE but now I'd prefer 3-MeO-PCP over MXE and ketamine. Except for holing of course. MXE takes the cake there.

Combined ~15mg with 150ug 1P-LSD last night... wow. 


(I know that 15mg seems like a large dose but I think my batch is less potent as all of my friends and I take at least 10mg) 


At first it seemed like nothing was happening, then it seemed like they were coming up independently of each other, and them bam! Melded into one beautiful feeling of bliss. Definitely noticed minor auditory hallucinations from people talking, but more importantly oh god music sounded AMAZING. I was at an event with a small music room, but the speakers are very powerful and high quality. I felt totally immersed in the sound and captivated or even imprisoned by it. I couldn't stop listening to it. 


Also hooping was incredible, not surprisingly as I love to flow on most psychs and dissos. But I felt more in my groove than ever, total effortless flow. Definitely noticed mania from the 3-meo at this point because I wanted to ask my friends things like "don't I look really amazing hooping right now?" and I craved an audience. 


The comedown made me feel a little listless, but that may have been in part because I spent most of it in a car driving home from the event with the rest of my friends pretty quiet.

I would strongly recommend **against** using this drug for the most part, because it definitely costs you some karma points in some very important places as Solipsis mentions. This is definitely a functional anti-depressant for me for the most part but I feel like 90% of people who I give a small dose of this to will have an unpleasant reaction. This is really kind of garbage head territory imo, and best left for people who are desperate to overcome desperate times. 


Otherwise, using it functionally can work for a few people and I think that's fine, i just don't think this drug is anything we should be promoting at all. While my bandmates all agree I play like Geddy Lee while using it, ultimately my emotional shifts make it a little too much to handle in the end. After my current bag is gone, I won't be using any PCP derivatives for a long time. Gonna move to mellower substances. Probably just milder dissociatives, milder empathogens and psychedelics. I couldn't be more thankful for how its helped me though.

Yea I gave the rest of my 3meo to a friend who can handle it and told him to save me some for later. This is definitely not for the casual drug users, I would say that not for people without previous disso experience and preferably some tolerance (which doesn't 'protect' you against 3-MeO-PCP if you take too much).


I know a few guys who eyeballed this with benzos and alcohol and of course blacked out. Fortunately nothing irreversible or bad happened but these guys are examples of people who shouldn't go anywhere near drugs like 3-MeO-PCP. Another one took too much at once, like 20mg, and lost himself in a bar for a while.

Yeah, my social circle isn't trying to take any moral high grounds on me, but i'm just not around people that are totally cool with the mania (which I really enjoy) so I'm gonna slowly step back from it for now. It's definitely not causing me any problems, just depends on who your peers are and what they're comfortable with. Hopefully later in life I'll be in a place where i can really be myself, but for now I've got to attenuate some of the peaks and valleys.

Completely overdid this a couple weeks ago. Was dosing way too high on a daily basis and it caught up with me. Totally paranoid delusions etc


Mindset wasn't great at the time anyway which didn't help, really glad I had someone around to keep me grounded seeing as I was convinced of some pretty nutty shit...whoops!

Yes, it is apparent that this is a very potent substance and can be used a way that is either therapeutic and constructive, or in a way that is destructive, and the line is not easy to ride for many.

For seasoned heads, it is a terrific tonic.  Im using as such right now....I'm thinking of ditching my suboxone regimen for good. I have been tapering the past month, and yesterday I didn't take any. Still feeling good today. I'm going to ride this train out into new territory this time. I dosed about 8mg a couple hours after waking today (about 45 minutes ago, I think its starting to work) to keep the withdraw at bay. I hope it works, wish me luck!

I loved reading the previous incarnations of this thread and tracking each prolific user's progression with 3-Meo, many posts were rife with reproach and 'never again' moments, yet a few months down the line they always came back, spanning years of commitment to these threads. It takes a special kind of drug to do that!

Haha, yeah. :D


I should be getting some of that tan batch that is allegedly the same as the batch I had before this white batch, that I preferred greatly for the hypomania-inducing aspect of the drug, but which I find less psychedelic.  Really hoping it really is, because I miss that low-dose regimen.  I don't really do it much with this white fluffy batch because I can never get to that hypomanic phase.  Hopefully with both varieties I will be able to fully utilize this drug, because on the tan batch I never really liked getting dissociated, but I enjoy the dissociation from the white batch.

Really hoping it really is, because I miss that low-dose regimen.  I don't really do it much with this white fluffy batch because I can never get to that hypomanic phase.  Hopefully with both varieties I will be able to fully utilize this drug, because on the tan batch I never really liked getting dissociated, but I enjoy the dissociation from the white batch.

It's actually my first time doing it, many experiences with many other dissos but 3-meo was banned quickly here. Fluffy white batch, smelt a little like solvent but a bit fragrant too, dosing it is a pain even with a scale. Nose is numb, teeth a little bit too. It's pretty damn cold in my room (I'm shivering a bit). Maybe it's cut with a -caine? Don't have great control of my limbs (in terms of fine motor skills). I felt a little bit of causticity but nothing awful (intranasal). As of yet I feel all the hallmarks of a dissociative but not too much has happened, taking it slowly. Feeling dat dissociative noise though.


I'm feeling quite reserved, I can certainly imagine a hypomanic batch being a wily one though assuming they vary.


Have done about 8mg in total I think

I don't think it's a thing (yet) except for maybe some hive/hyperlabs experimenting, neither is PCM itself which you could say is at least as suprising - although PCM is also known as the morpholine, so the better name would be NMPCA.


Some predictions:


3-MeO-PCM or 3-MeO-NMPCA may be like a more anaesthetic MXM, 1-2 times as potent simply looking at PCE, 3-MeO-PCE and O-PCE but it could also be several times less potent looking at very different results for NMPCA in rats and babboons - and yes that is indeed adjusted for *relative* potency and thus metabolism.

Wow this stuff really is a potent mood enhancer (at about 7-9mg), more apt for me would be cognitive/social enhancer.


It certainly took me for a ride albeit in a demanding and challenging way. Though it was very functional and rewarding, it made me feel like my old curious happier self a few years back (incidentally /s before I started banging drugs lol).


As to my experience of 3-Meo as a 'dissociative' I cannot attest to its prowess due to the low dose. Can't say I got much euphoria even from music tbh.


Do some people find that the drug has something to offer past the 'functioning, enhanced sociability' stage and into the realms of a more classical dissociative (like dose-related euphoria or stuff that ket has to offer)? In other words, what are heavy doses like?

- I think it's unsurpring that people are so impressed by it's immediate effect on mood, but want to impress myself that it's something far different for that to be sustainable or therapeutic. Although I certainly couldn't exclude the sheer possibility for everyone but it's easy to be fooled.


- No this is very different from ket or other 'classical dissociatives' you might be thinking of, although of course not in absolutely every way. It is still dissociative. Hoping that it can deliver the same things if you just go higher with the dosage is a grave mistake in my opinion. A good number of people do things like that, possibly encouraged by the enthousiasm of the mania once the drug takes effect... This mistake can range from a junky move (trying to abuse a drug hoping that it's something it is not) to just misled or ignorant. Because of course it isn't strange or silly to expect similar things you found in other drugs in the same category, but it is important to get the hint quickly and not be in denial about that.


Higher doses in my experience don't get more and more pleasant dose-dependently but certainly do get more disorienting and can have a strong impact on the very fundaments and groundings on which you stand. I guess it may get technically get anaesthetic at some point but likely not before it gets quite dangerous so it's best forgotten that it might be able to do that. Because in your fantasies you may imagine a ket-like slipping into some deep and heavy-bodied hole, but the reality is more likely to be a frazzled mind still sitting there in a body but just utterly lost without a soul.

Yeah on K that has been a whole experience that was pretty good, but also mixed with other nice aspects of the state of consciousness but those bells and whistles aren't really there for me on 3-MeO-PCP.


IMO high doses are just nothing at all in best case and terrible misadventures or accidents in worst case.


Moderate doses would be pushing a little beyond functional and enhancing effects but just leaving it at just partial global fuzziness and confusion. It's.... ok, but not superb for me.


Others may find it pretty nice there, but if you read around on the forum you will see very unfortunate things happening to even very seasoned trippers, accidents really because they are so without themselves. Such an easy mistake to make and nothing any experience or confidence can solve, only going very slowly with your titrations and especially just stopping before it gets away from you. It's better to be skeptical about it an opt for just giving it a miss to proceed, than to "go for it".


If my tolerance makes me more insensitive and jaded about going much much further with it and has helped save me from disaster (although other very tolerant people still managed to fuck up), perhaps that is possible but remember that it would not mean you would run any less risk, just that it is more likely you may be willing to put yourself at greater risk with it.

Shrubbity, your description makes me thing we have the same batch. It is quite well tuned, currently buzzing like a bee with it, and I really appreciate that it substantially obliterates any degree of suboxone withdrawal I would normally be feeling right now nearly 3 days since I dosed any. I think I may have successfully biohacked my way out of the dregs of opiate withdrawal with this magic. Not dissimilar to how people describe the ibogaine flood dose to rid themselves of opiate addiction. Time will tell if the effect persists and allows me a relatively smooth readjustment. I have some thenodiazapine at hand if I need to turn the buzz off and get some good sleep tonight. I'm pretty optimistic right now.

I find 3-MeO-PCP to be a very different sort of drug from any other dissociative I have tried.  For me, moderate doses (like 15-20mg) can be interesting and intense, but not really in a way that I care to do more than every once in a while.  There is a strong element of mania which can lead to some psychotic kinds of places, it's a really strange manner intoxication, and you're really barely physically impaired at all so you can do pretty much anything.  I really prefer it in low doses for the mood enhancement/hypomanic effects, it really shines there as long as you keep it to only a few days in a row and take breaks.  Sometimes I'll get to 15-20mg in a night in 3-5mg doses, and it starts to get wonky, and it's pretty fun, but it's nothing like ketamine or MXE, or really anything else (except it's pretty similar to 3-MeO-PCE).

Excellent replies Solipsis and Xorkoth.


For clarification, when I was referring to 'heavy doses' I was referring more to an intermediary between moderate and heavy (say 15-20mg). Not something excessive like 40mg. The reason for my asking is I've yet to experience anything in the realms of full-blown mania, it was certainly very low down on the spectrum but I'm curious as to how far you can push it (in terms of dosage) before it becomes a negative experience (i.e. psychosis) in a one-off scenario.


NB: bit wonky at the moment so not sure if my posts relates to the topic at hand.

I remember back 2014 i had one grams of 3meopcp, at this time, well i had a big break from mxe after the ban and some other problem but just before receiving the 3meo i had consumed a grams of mxe over a week or two, anyways the thing i remembered on my binge on 3meo even if it was not really a bing compare to the fact that i dont remember "feeling" any really effect, but well i didnt have my scale at that moment so i was eyeballing really low cause which sometime after i could weight was suppose between 5-7mg, prior to this my tolerance to dissoc was extremely high (2 years of daily mxe made the trick ) so it quite interesting to read the thread and see people talking about more a "longterm" disso and moodenhancing which wasnt really noticeable for me when i was doing 3meo but compare to the low dosage/tolerance it maybe made sense that it did something, i remembered finished the gram over maybe 1mouth half or two and was not so impressed but i didnt push the dosage in anytime, beside doing multiple time a day, didnt suffer any problem after 2mouth of daily use weirdly, the batch i had if i remember correctly was extremly sticky and was burning nose a lot i mean nothing compare to some 4fa or stuff like this but still for the low dosage u could feel it keep in your throw for a while. 


Anyways im like thinking about ordering some and would like to get the woman counterpart 3meopce as well but im quite extremely cautious with drugs since a year after a trauma caused by an amphetamine binge that im still not covered, was really weird all this year any substance i mean really any, alchohol, weed, cafeine, include even an inactive amount was causing panic attack which im recovering mostly even though i didnt took any drugs since beside i can drink cafeine and alchohol and even smoke some pot in really low quantity without any panic attack since mouths,  make me a bit scary about doing back but well im not like hurry at all and waiting for a full recovery and some trial with less powerful drugs but well i have good feeling when the time will come disso will be the end of the healing, sorry about long thread and all details it not the recovery place but i think i had to mention all this though

Ended up doing loads and loads of the stuff, my 500mg baggie is now down to 150 and I don't remember the past few days. I'm still wonky now.I really need to be careful and save this stuff only for times of dire need functionally.

Does anybody notice something different about the latest batches of 3-MeO-PCP?

Has anybody tried the most recent batch of 3-MeO-PCP that was tested on ecstasydata? This batch was thought to be descholoroketamine and confirmed to be 3-MeO-PCP by ecstasy data.


I have read on the forums that different batches produce different effects, with the general consensus being that the latest white fluffy batches are more psychedelic and require a higher dose for mania or hypomania to become present.


I'm stoned as indica dabs on cannabis at the moment but ya know!


Is this variation in effect between batches due to active precursors or residual solvents? Are there other arylcyclohexylamines present?


There appears to be a real variation in effect according to the anecdotes.


I have noticed THE SAME scent on three batches once I allowed the molecules to air dry. All batches were brought into solution and appeared to be similar yet unique.


One of these batches had a strong odor that left quickly upon effort, low dose functionality that graduated into enough mania and not so psychedelic appeared to be the case still. In other words, typical 3-MeO-PCP as far as comparing anecdotes.


One of the batches appeared to PRODUCE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESULTS but still physically completely the same. Scent and all…..


Does anybody have anything to comment?


My understanding of the anecdotes of others is that the more psychedelic 3-meo-pcp is… sedating, stoning, visual… maybe produces blackouts or feels like another nmdar that is just heavy and stoning instead of manic.


This is the strongest convincer yet for independent research and testing…. How do I start a company to help out the community with testing and being aware of what to test for by simply having an interest and going through the forums…


tl;dr pretty sure there is some less manic and more stoning stuff going around according to the forums. Anybody?


Would love to hear more on IV.

Rectal appears to be way more "psychedelic" and stoning than any other route IME. Very different via this ROA… but the variation in batch effect scares me. It's over evident because I couldn't find mania in whatever case.


I'm retarded on indica dabs right now because ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) how do I start a GC/MS company and help the brotha's out?

Plenty of speculation on that already in this thread... solvents: no. active precursors or impurities? possibly? enantiomerically pure batches (isomers): quite unlikely. Other arylcyclohexylamines? Hmm of course could be but I don't know of any that would be like 3-MeO-PCP but less manic, 3-MeO-PCE for example certainly wouldn't fit. So if we can't really offer a candidate it would have to be a rare or unknown one making it such a longshot.


There are already testing companies so why start one? It would require a lot of money for the equipment and knowing how to operate them and a way to avoid getting busted for possession of the samples etc. I think you're just stoned.


I can get mine tested for free in this country but it requires a fair amount of powder and I don't really feel like sacrificing most of my small batch sorry guys.

Everytime I use 3-meo-pcp I come up with a new invention that my lazy arse never follows through with, or a plot for an amazing story I never write...lol. If only 3-meo-pcp could make me follow through with my creative ideas. For me this chemical has a strong effect on the creativity part of my mind.

I think xorkoth did it, enjoyed it but also ran into problems which I think were then mostly attributed to dosage (according to him, seems hard to say if it meant anything). But I still think it's questionable because of the SERT involvement but not sure how big a deal that is. Probably would mean that you'd go easier on the dosage IMO. I wouldn't try it out at a concert personally, that seems like a bad idea for a place to discover drug-drug interactions that are not 'tried and proven'. So it should be okay generally but I would be careful.

LMAO I love the word stoned. Yes I was super stone bone last night… Micro-ing on ALD-52 today as I was extremely emotional this morning, figured I needed some healing!


But really it's THAT hard to start an ectsacydata on my own? I thought I could buy older equipment from ebay and learn from the community how to operate and interpret read outs! LOL I mean couldn't I study organic chemistry and learn quite a bit fairly quickly? It seemed so!


So chances are my 3-meo-pcp is just different. Nobody knows why!?!?! I have to spend about $100 to identify if any other molecules are present in my specific baggie?!


Thank you for the replies! I really felt like this 3-meo-pcp was SO DIFFERENT. I mean it felt like I couldn't get the same mania or rushes or anything. Totally different beast this time around, way more "fuck you up and even hole" as opposed to "enhancement with risk of mania good luck holing"...


IMO reagent testing is just that… "Hey look my batch showed a slightly different reaction than yours, so now what do we assume?!!?!?" Don't get me wrong I understand reagent testings role… but in this case… I could have 8 different reagents and we may never figure out why the subjective differences. I have never went on a two day 3-meo-pcp binge with blackouts like this. I used to assume the stuff had a high risk for mania, this batch lacked almost all mania. There is nothing about it but a "cleaner" smell to imply anything different.


More trials, reagents, testing, and research lies ahead of a BREAK because I feel like I used something WIERD. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


Good day bretherns!!! I read most of the big and dandy's for most of the dissociatives….. Still wanted to bring it up though...


What happened!? Did something happen or am I just tripping?! :D


Gonna have to report on ald-52 micro dosing compared with LSD in a month or two because I couldn't find too much info on the differences between analogs with micro-dosing.


Something about this batch of 3-meo though… I WAS CHASING THE DRAGON and it never came. Smoked dabs and the best I got was paranoid about taking an unknown impurity on top of what smelled/tasted EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER TWO BATCHES OF 3-MEO.


I'll have to start being more articulate and organized around here but I just got up ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^^I have drawn the same conclusions about the latest batch of 3-MeO I got, it's absolutely for 100% sure different, but I am pretty sure it's 3-MeO, it's not drastically different but it's somewhat MXE-like in its level of dissociation/weirdness, and the mania is significantly less pronounced, though when I dose enough in a night I can get there, even though it's still a more controlled/muted thing.  I have grown to like this new batch better for larger-dose one-night experiences.  Last night I had one of the best 3-MeO nights ever, went out to a show with friends and one of the bands is some of my best friends.  I was giving everyone 3-MeO including the band and it was all indescribably fun, everyone there was awesome, made a bunch of new friend-types (people I'll be like, hey, what's up, how you doing when I see them in the future), and danced like a madman.  But, I can't get that real hypomanic state from it like the other batches I've tried, where I can low dose for days on end, never actually get intoxicated, but I'm in the best kind of place the whole time.


I'm about to get some the same older batch I had before, so I'll be able to test whether 3-MeO is just changing for me or if this new batch is legitimately different.

This new batch is literally kinda not so good. For me, it basically provides zero effects until I hit about 30mg +, then i just get paranoid. That's it. That's pretty much the whole story with it, so I think i'll try to go back to the tan batch or seek out a crystalline batch and go from there.

WOW I just typed up all that only to have it all deleted? I'll keep it short now. Have you guys seen Hamilton's new stuff from Vice? Totally up our alleys.


I'm so pissed my entire wall of text got deleted. WTF. I had all kinds of my anecdotes typed up. UGHHHH REALLY.?!?!?!


So basically this batch is garbage and CANNOT be 3-meo-pcp or MUST have other active impurities.


Thanks rich ass vendor!!!!


I'll come back when I didn't already spend 30 minutes typing up a reply with links and videos. WTF blue light?!?!?!


And what's with the auto save? I couldn't get my original post to come back!!!! What a way to start off my micro dose. I blab on and it's pointless.

Damn that's frustrating.  Were you on a phone?  Mobile BL has some issues.


I usually type up long posts in a text editor, so if something happens I don't lose it.


Anyway I have gotten to know this new batch and I do like it for sure.  Just not the same thing.  I definitely prefer the other stuff.  I want to get this tested, and the other batch too so I can be certain they really are both 3-MeO.  Could be something about different ratios of the 2 isomers?  MXE batches have variance too, seems like dissociatives, at least some of them, are like that.  It's beyond a placebo/expectation effect, I have enough experience with this drugs and drugs in general to be able to discern differences.

Yeah, i have no doubts that it's 3-meo-pcp due to the unmistakable flavor. I believe it's a polymorphism issue. I will probably save this stuff for combinations and not use it daily.

I think my one and only batch is the same. I had no tolerance and found myself dosing up to 20mg in a day sometimes. Although I did have quite a high K tolerance at the time.


Tried smaller doses to achieve the manic vibe you all talk about but found anything less than 5 - 10mg and I wouldn't feel a thing. The batch was a pure white colour and quite sticky in the bag.

It was the most amazing feeling at first, killed the psychosis and then suddenly I started feeling very unwell.


Ketamine didn't seem to be doing much as the 3-Meo was still dormant in my system (also the reason why the pill messed me up so much)

For me, 3-meo and amphetamine are a big no-no, even a couple of days apart.

Thanks for the replies guys, I think I'll take 3meo on Friday and 4-FA on Saturday so, and don't mix them up ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 3meo and 4-fa are really winners on their own without needing to combine.

I've been to punk rock shows on this stuff and enjoyed myself, but i wasn't slam dancing or anything like that ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Other forms of dancing though? Amazing!

And i don't mean the stimmy-sounding stuff either - i never got much mania from the stuff i sourced a couple of years ago.


I don't know how taking 3meo the day *before* amphetamine alters the effects of the amphetamine, but when i've had 3meo a day or two after dexamphetamine a couple of times, it's been a bit disorienting and not as euphoric.  A little unpleant really.


Other people may fare differently, but it didn't feel completely right - or safe - to me.

A bit psychotic.

In my experience amphetamine + 3-meo-pcp has been anywhere from not having synergy and being meh, to unpleasant, to downright "fuck this combo I'm never doing it again". I've found stimulants - MDMA/APBs/etc aside - to just not mix well with dissociatives.


Also back when I was taking Adderall everyday, no more than 15-20mg in a day, and taking 3-meo-pcp every couple of days, I started having weird circulation issues. My right pinky toe developed a numbness that ended up not going away for a year plus.

Literally just finally recovered after doing an unknown quantity of 3-Meo whilst blacked out benzos, finally back to reality after about 5 days being off my rocker.Dosing it is the difficult part. I literally haven't been able to speak up until a few days ago. 


This stuff is crazy and I don't even remember half of it, I feel like my cognitive faculties were/somewhat still are severely impinged.


I've now addicted to benzos though that I needed to bring me down. Hope my brain recovers, couldn't process concepts for shit today (at uni). I literally can't think.

Thanks for the advice. I have a scale but it's a little unreliable due to the inherent 0.001 cheapness. The main issue was that I must have snorted a lot of it and it's still in my system. Aside from my dreams being really fucked up I'm almost back to sanity.

Not that I'm aware of.


I was using the white fluff batch I've been talking about all weekend (starting Wednesday actually, but much lower dosing Wed/Thurs), and by about halfway through the weekend I hit an amazing stride.  Saturday and Sunday were some of the best days I've had in a long time, it was insane how perfect everything was.  I find that once I get a little short-term tolerance from a couple of days of low dosing, I can take higher doses of this batch and reach that hypomanic state after all.  Just have to take a different approach with this batch.


Now it's time for a break, I definitely have to recuperate from this, though other drugs were involved too including methylone one night.  yesterday I felt pretty bad, also like I was fighting off a cold, but today is a lot better after sleeping for 11 hours and doing nothing to exert myself yesterday.

Literally flushed my 1g/50ml Everclear of 3-meo white fluffy MXEish and JUST IV'D some of the baggie rinse(slowly for fun, I already had played with this)…. And took a dab.


Oh.. I do like this. WTFFFFFFFF I thought it was crap. Is it good though for real? Depends how I feel tomorrow. Apparently I need the other batch then, with some DCK.


I felt bad the day after and had GI issues and all kinds of stuff I thought with my previous experience. Read some stuff in this thread and was like YEAH IT'S BAD AND NASTY….


I hope it's bad… No no I hope it's good… IDK but it's totally different. I do like this but the other stuff felt much better I thought. Hmmmmmm… Gonna have to explore the other dissos too… I would love to take real PCP and end up like Steve-O's "PCP saved my life"


Now I'm mad at 3-meo-pcp. I'm gonna have to hit the freight train one 8(

The white sparkly MXEish stuff is not bad. Just different. It's more intoxicating and trippy. I still enjoy it a great deal even tho I prefer the more manic clear headed batch. 

I haven't tried IVing this new batch but really liked the last stuff. Perhaps a bit too much. I've sworn off needles for the time being but I did find myself fantasizing about the other day.

Does anyone else get really horny on 3meo? It's not the same kind of horny as stimulants where you feel like jerking off to porn or fucking for hours. This feels more primal and probably induced by mania. 

I was buying lunch the other day and the girl ringing me up is not someone I would normally find attractive but in that moment I did. I flirted with her for a moment, being extra friendly and making lots of eye contact. Then while eating lunch I fantasized about having sex with her in great detail for a few minutes. It felt dirty and perverted. And i really liked it. 

Then I finished my lunch and went back to work. I didn't feel compelled to masturbate like stims would make me do. It just kind of passed. But I have moments like this more and more frequently the deeper in to my binge I get. It makes for great sex at the end of the day.

When Vice interviewed the chemist who came up with mxe, he mentioned this particular bit: "3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCE are simply incredible drugs. They have a true  capacity for healing, as the 3-methoxy group infers µ-opioid receptor  affinity3 and removes the manic pressure of  thought that can make PCP quite a disturbing and unpleasant drug. With  the 3-methoxys there is such incredible laughter and boundless sexual  energy."


***************************************************************


Ok, unrelated. I gave 3-meo-pcp a whirl (a dozen or so 10-12mg doses) about 6 months ago... maybe a dose every 3 days? I loved it, but gradually I found myself with muscle constant twitches in my right leg/calf/arch of foot and an occasional rapid stutter while talking (sounded super silly, but only happened maybe once or twice a day). After about 2-3 weeks these symptoms both went away and in the last few months I've convinced myself it was probably just a bad batch so I'm about to give 3-meo-pcp another whirl.


Question, this new batch is very sparkly under good lighting. It almost has a similar look to that 'fine crystal sand' batch of what was supposedly "s-isomer" European grade MXE that came from a certain vendor who I won't name but based on the description I just gave you know who I'm talking about. Does anyone know much about this batch? Granted there are probably several batches similar to this so my question is perhaps silly, but if there's any known connection between dirty batches and product with this ultra-fine white sandy texture that sparkles it'd definitely give me caution before using.


Thank you in advance

I wouldn't say any of the batches I've tried have been "dirty." The one you're describing by appearance sounds like the most recent batch which has more psychedelic qualities and is reminiscent of MXE in some ways. 

The previous batches felt more clear headed, manic and maybe slightly more potent. The powder of the previous batches was more flour like with big clumps that you could squeeze between your fingers and it would break up in to powder. 


After writing out this response I realized I'm not sure exactly what you're asking.

Your answer makes complete sense. The first batch of 3-meo-pcp I tried was exactly as you describe the previous batch(es) being, flour-ish and clumpy whereas the new one is sparkly and ultra-fine granular. To hear any mention of this new batch being remotely mxe-ish is music to my ears. mxe will forever be the holy grail for me.

I loved MXE. I don't know if I like this "new" batch.


I received some in the beginning of October from a different vendor than the "new" stuff I just received.


I swear to god… I actually believe I hid my last batch somewhere and I can't find it. I keep looking for it at times like a crack head. I almost have the whole house searched through thoroughly hahaha! I was coming down from meth clean from 3-meo and got paranoid(I always do when I do too much, I think I have long term benzo withdrawal from cold turkey high dose with alcohol so many times from like 19-23)… I like to talk about myself apparently though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I've been smoking dabs and this new batch wasn't the same which played with my expectations…. It'd be different I expected this totally different feeling and hadn't had the previous clear headed experience.


It feels way different I think…. But my mind perceives that effect how it does. Subjectively right? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I wish I could throw myself into relatively safe hypomania. We gotta figure out how. I almost had it going but did meth… But who knows what would have happened after my clear-headed 3-meo days...


I'm totally retarded compared to where I was a few weeks ago… Was around the wrong people and did way too high of doses...


Damn them! I was on my own shit! The devil tempted me to smoke and shoot after 3-meo blessed my soul with a promotion I was so happy I quit 3-meo so I could try meth. 300mg shot while taking propanolol. Fucking adrenergic storm and hospitalizations(48 hours post last dose… yeah even dosed more within hours and hung out with a dude who actually had me convinced he was an undercover cop. My friend passed out and I got STUCK with this dude for HOURS thinking the weirdest shit…) and no 3-meo and damn.


Meth. Not even once lmfao no really just start low and slow and research. I really hadn't researched it that much... I went high dose thinking the addicts are just fine… no hello full blown meth experience.


![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) so off topic but it's always fun to read the big & dandy's!

Do you think this drug can have any benefit to someone with depersonalisation?


Used responsibly of course.


Theory is due to narloxone (u-opoid inverse agonist) being theorised as a potential avenue of treatment for those with depersonalisation.


I have no medical background so might have no link whatsoever.


Nothing physically wrong with my brain after an MRI but I've felt blunted and had no inner monologue for a year or so. 


When i last took this stuff it was amazing, I felt as if i'd returned to my old self, my speech facultites and inner monologue had come back. Only issue is it was a messy ride as I was a fool and mistook it for something else whilst blacked out on benzos so it was when I started recalling that I felt this way.


Though I suppose self-medication is not something to be encouraged, I'm curious if anyone has any experience in this.


EDIT: don't actually have DP, was just still a little manic

Pretty sure that turned out to not be true. But we shouldn't forget that NMDA receptors these dissociatives act on are very closely hooked up to opioid receptors, so there may be indirect activity involved.


I don't know of either 'dirtiness' or any pure isomer being associated with these newer white fine batches. You would expect that at least someone would be aware of a fact like it being a pure isomer being passed along from the source, especially since it would make more money. I don't think it's particularly likely though, because it would have significant consequences for potency, which are not being reported.

Instead, my own source doesn't even know anything about there being different batches since the previous time when I had more manic effects from it. Yeah many people insisting that it's quite a sudden and considerable difference makes it pretty hard to ignore, otherwise the best explanation would still be that we are getting a skewed view from the only people reporting on this developing tolerance or something like that.


So sorry, seems to remain a mystery for now.. but it's pretty fascinating isn't it :D


Trying to use this for depersonalization seems to have no proper reason as opioid inverse agonists and antagonists are pretty different (the NMDA system and opioid being intertwined is not a good enough reason), and I think it's pretty risky considering how dissociation is most likely to exacerbate depersonalization or derealization. So I wouldn't do that.

3-MeO-PCP is the last thing you'd want to take for depersonalization. It would just amplify it 1000x.

I'd say that 3-MeO makes me more into sex at times I would normally be into sex.  It's really good for erotic endeavors for sure, one of the best.  But to me it facilitates that in the same way it does everything else... basically I feel 200% into it with all available energy and excitement and an open, creative mind.  That's why I like it for music, that's why I like it for dancing, that's also why I like it for sex.  For me 3-MeO just kind of brings out what's inside, but draws it out much more powerfully.

I will say that just like it took a while for 3-MeO itself to grow on me, it took a while for this new batch to grow on me too.  Last weekend I had a drawn out weekend-long experience that ranked up there in greatness with any 3-MeO experience I've ever had on any batch.  This batch is different though, there is less mania.


3-MeO is a really fascinating drug.  There's a lot to it, more than first meets the eye.

That's my intuition as well, but really I don't think it's relevant to speculate about the theoretical effects of drugs. Even drugs that have been scientifically proven to alleviate certain disorders like depression are not necessarily effective for every individual. The only way to find out if 3-MeO-PCP works for DP is to self-experiment, IMO.

I've tried the fine white crystal batch and I have to agree with Delsyd, very psychedelic and thought provoking.Also warm and comfortable in that mxe way. I find dosages between 20-30mg is where it's at, so it must be less potent than other batches.

It is very  distorting of my spacial senses. Everytime I hit that 30mg dose ( I usually do 5 mg bumps every 10 minutes over around an hour) I get that beautiful sub hole feeling of floating about 1 metre high and I feel very big compared to everything else around me.

I'm running pretty low on my white fluff. I want to say a tolerance is developing but I'm not sure that it is, I think the white batch just requires 20-30mg in general for a good effect. Seems anything over that is for veterans with little to do that day. 


I guess I'm clocking in at around 1g of 3-meo-pcp every few months for the past year. I might switch up dissociatives, or try out a different batch when this ones gone. It's really helped me tremendously in transmigrating through a rough patch in my emotional life. It has tinkered with my social life somewhat in ways that I wouldn't call positive or negative, some of my friends that come into contact with me more often are somewhat concerned for my mental health and i appreciate that. It's good to know that people care. I tell em don't hate on it until you try it, and don't try it when I'm not around. 


One thing that seems to be a common thread is that people who are new to this drug refuse to take a proper dose at first, and often take too much and miss out on what it has to offer. It's kind of nice that it's somewhat limited in that way though, if this were as accessible as MXE we may have a real problem on our hands. It seems to be staying in the shadows well enough for now.


If you share this substance with people outside of this community, i recommend giving them a single dose to play with. That way, they won't be able to take 2-3 doses when you aren't looking. Not to say i'm learning this the hard way, just don't wanna see anybody get hurt.

Good advice, especially considering how long it takes to kick in, and how miniscule a single dose looks to the uninitiated.


As for the 20-30mg dosage comment - it's interesting that you should say that, because i've only obtained this stuff once - and while i consider myself pretty familiar with the stuff, all my experiences have been the result of a single order - and it definitely fits the "fine white powder" with the "more psychedelic, mxe-like" description (as opposed to the stuff which people describe as inducing mania).


For a while i was concerned  that i had been dosing far too high - or had particularly impure product - because a lot of the reports, especially in the previous thread, warned against dosing above 5-10mg, whereas any time i took it, i would usually exceed the dose experienced heads were referring to as dangerous territory.  I've never used dissociatives in a way that would account for a huge tolerance, so i was a bit unsettled by the slight differences in my experiences in comparison to others'.


It's interesting, because it is only in recent times that i have found other people's descriptions to be comparable to my own experiences with this stuff.  I thought that effects must just be very subjective or highly influenced by physiology and metabolism - so i'm really intrigued that people have noticed their recent purchases have been qualitatively different to earlier ones - especially as the stuff i had was *not* purchased recently.

But i found that i didn't really hit my "sweet spot" with doses on the lower end of the tiny dosage scale, and would agree that with the material i've come across, slightly higher doses were significantly more forgiving than some of the reports of the *other* type of 3-meo-pcp.


i think anyone inexperienced with this substance would be wise to keep their doses under ~10mg regardless, but with the "less manic variety" 

Talking about the *batch* seems like the wrong word (to me) - and i kinda think comparisons to mxe, or saying "more psychedelic" are maybe a little too subjective, which is not to say that i disagree with them; my first really enjoyable experience with 3-meo-pcp was very 'trippy' and definitely reminded me of mxe. 


While i've only obtained 3-meo-pcp once - and therefore have only tried one variety, i've no doubt whatsoever that at least two different "types" (with slightly different effects profiles) are doing the rounds, because my experiences were a bit different from the reports on Bluelight, until recently - as people's descriptions of the "new batch" match the stuff i got almost perfectly.


I have absolutely no insight into what could be causing these variations, but am following the discussion with great interest.

Thanks to Xorkoth and others for describing this different material - i never would have thought to mention that the stuff i got is quite different, because without having any other 3-meo-pcp to compare it to, my assumption was that i responded to it differently, or perhaps what i had obtained with some other obscure member of the arylcyclohexamine family.


Fascinating stuff.

It is this kind of insight into these novel psychoactive compounds - and the globally collaborative nature of the conversations around them - that reminds me yet again what an incredibly valuable resource BL is - especially with the input of some of our brightest members weighing in on the chemical/pharmacological side of things that i've no academic background in, and only a basic understanding of.

Yesterday I attempted the low-dose "hypomanic" regimen. I put two milligrams in my morning cup of tea, and two in my afternoon cup.* And, well, it sure as hell isn't for me.


I can see its potential for productivity enhancement; it seemed to induce a kind of fast-paced workflow in which I rarely paused to second-guess myself. But, it simply wasn't worth the tax levied on my cognitive abilities -- not to mention the creepy, sinister, Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers feeling of being a slightly fucked-up clone of myself that 3-MeO-PCP consistently gives me. By the time I went to bed last night, I couldn't wait to wake up sober this morning.


I might be able to enjoy using MXE in this fashion, if I were so inclined, as long as I treated it with great respect and used it quite sparingly. But 3-MeO-PCP is not the drug for me.


*I feel more comfortable taking arylcyclohexylamines with green tea based on [this research](http://www.urol-sci.com/article/S1879-5226(15)00415-7/abstract), which I discovered thanks to Vortech's MXE e-book.

Ok so for daily dosing on the white fluff, I'd say like 20mg 1-2 per day. That seems to be working my cogs pretty smoothly. The best effects are going to be found with infrequent dosing, but if you're looking for a potentially unsafe mood stabilizer, this works halfway decently. I take it for 2-3 days, then take a day off etc. Any usage beyond this equals utter meltdown. 


So, meltdowns are good at first. Best to attenuate thereafter.

Anyone on here with a high opioid tolerance who can share how this has affected their tolerance? I'm not a current user, I just have a perma-tolerance ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I've had great success using dxm during the acute phase of WD, but the tolerance drop never seems to last. It affects the GABA system too iirc, so has it had any effect on benzo tolerance for any of you? I'm talking about long-term tolerance, not a quick and temporary reduction in tolerance.

High all!


Well seeing as I have burnt myself out on this stuff by taking it for over a month straight I need to take a break again, maybe for a long ass time as it lost its magic and now all I get from it is stimulation and some mild psychosis. I tried about 20mg tonight after being off of it for a couple weeks and my tolerance is still not lowered. 


Has anyone else binged on this stuff for 30+ days and come back to it and found it was as good as before as a dissociative? I'm really scared I might have overdone it this time and it won't ever have the same effects.


Does anyone know if I should preserve this stuff in a small chest freezer or how long it will last in a dark place? I have been keeping it sealed in a foil bag within a metal safe but i'm worried about it degrading. I have another unopened multiple gram bag of it so I need to know how to properly preserve it for when I will start consuming it again occasionally. 


Thanks for any help my kindred spirits.

I'm pretty sure it's quite stable, I keep mine in a vial at room temperature, before that I kept it in a bag at room temperature.  Never noticed any sort of degradation at all.

Never flush drugs, you'll pretty much always regret it later. In twelve years I've never done that once. Getting a bit of 3-MeO-PCP very soon. Can't wait I'm very excited since its been awhile without it. Will probably dose some with pregabalin and DOC as well. Get super weird! Pregabalin and disscociatives is awesome, they potentiate eachother very nicely.

I almost flushed 10g's of 3meopcp, 5gs of 2oxopce, 5gs of 2oxopcm 1g of 3meopce, 1g of ephenidine three months ago. At the end I only flushed the 2oxopcm and don't regret it, won't touch the stuff again. The wiser decision was to give my disso stash to a good friend that is giving me only a monthly dose of dissos.


By the way, recovering the magic with this one seems hard, doing it only once a month my tolerance still feels like when I was doing it multiple times per week. A batch that on the past was magical and manic is now really lackluster each time I indulge ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

That's my philosophy.


If you have to flush a drug to keep from touching it, what does that say about your willpower? No praise, certainly.

Meh.. I've flushed drugs and only regret 1 of the 2 I ever flushed. It was super inferior mxe but once mxe disappeared I figured I'd still like the yellow china garbage over nothing. No tears shed.

None of this is actually an argument not to flush something to protect yourself. Not having a lot of willpower etc says something about the problems you have. It says nothing about whether it can be a compromise solution if you don't have the willpower to just keep away from your stash. It's not like compulsively continuing abuse is a good alternative, because that's what you'd be defending. Of course you should combine flushing with doing everything you can to avoid getting more, otherwise you might as well flush your money down the toilet right away...

But we don't live in an ideal world, so if you actually have problems with a drug any such decision to resist it is admirable especially if it helps lead to discontinuation.


Flushing something because you're high and paranoid is a different matter though, it's not a decision well considered with a clear head.

I've only flushed drugs once, and I deeply regret it, but it only happened because my ex made me do it under the threat of leaving me.  And then a few years later we broke up.  And I realized we should have just broken up then, and I could have kept my stash... had a bunch of really cool stuff in there such as 4-HO-DMT (synthetic), and DOM.

Wow Xork, tough luck right there. I woulda talked you out of it man! 


I flushed one drug in my time, Dimethylone. That's not something I'll ever regret. And I'd flush another trash-hybrid-poison labelled 'drugs' if I had to. The first two hours were awesome, though. Insane euphoric rush. 


Tonight it's 10mg 3c-e and 50mg 4-emc. Wish me luck! I'll probably work on a crossword, do some knitting, or just go to bed. I've got work early. And as much as my George Forman is crying out for some walmart beef, I think i'll leave it to the pros this evening.


My latest batch of 3meopcp soon to arrive. Cross your fingers for me, I think it's tan! Thank god for the use of recreational substances on your days off in the privacy of your own home without bothering anybody else using proper safety measures. Woot!

So I ended up dosing one last time on the 3-meo before I lock it up for a few months, dropping a bit onto my scale that ended up equating to 27mg. I mixed it into some gingerale and it dissolved rather nicely with some agitation. 


After chugging it down I had noticed rather minimal effects until about T-1:30 when I was kind of caught off guard playing some MMO game; it hit harder than I expected with a lot more dissociation. I eventually packed a bowl of some medicinal buds and took a single hit (a pretty hefty one) and as I blew it out the world became a vaccuum of existential angst is the only way I can describe it. I had to retire to my bed to sink into this state of being as it demanded my full attention. For a while I was caught up in this state of gloom and doom but eventually decided to just accept it and the bubble of fear and despair was dissolved. The 3-meo was trying to get my attention and now it had it. 


It carved up my psyche and shook me up. It wanted me to confront my often ill-informed drug usage and get serious about my life. I had no role in this lesson but to pay attention to it. I felt possessed but in a healthy healing type of way. Once it was clear my subconscious had accepted the sliver of wisdom the compound bestowed upon me the despair and gloominess disappeared and I felt cleansed with no reserve to deny and twist the lesson I had learned. The lesson ended and I was left with a feeling of contentment and everything sparkled anew. I finished off the rest of my bowl of weed and sank into a hypnotic state resembling sleep and got a fine next day afterglow and overall I feel a lot more optimistic than I did before. I hope this lesson sticks with me and I have the strength to change my world the way I should, but I feel like something finally clicked and I will be healthier in my ways from now on.


I have been reborn in a way and have no desire to dissociate for a good long time. I have much shit to work through and some homeostasis has to be achieved from all the other drugs I was recklessly indulging in these past few months but i'm ready to take the pain this time around. 


This stuff really is sacred and has a great potential for healing, even if it is made in a lab and pumped out en masse'. Was thinking about aquiring ibogaine to reach the same state I feel this stuff has put me in. Can't compare the two as I haven't tried the latter but 3-meo does a fine job of forcing your flaws in front of your eyes and etching the realization into your psyche.

Yeah 3-MeO-PCP is pretty special.  It really gets in there.  Very unique drug, subtle and very powerful all at once.  Also, it combines with ALD-52 and I'd imagine other lysergamides incredibly well, but watch out because it's going to increase intensity over what you'd expect very dramatically.  Both times I've combined them, I took pretty low amounts of both and was blown away each time.  The first time, I took a half of one of the slightly wider edge hits from the sheet, so probably 75ug 9I'm guessing the edge pieces have 150 instead of 125ug due to being proportionally wider) plus a few small bumps of 3-MeO beforehand and had a very strong trip where I ended up quitting using tobacco products except very occasionally.  Last night I had one of those larger hits and a small amount of 3-MeO and it's the hardest I've ever tripped on LSD/ALD.  Really intense visuals and an expansive, confronting and challenging headspace which led me to resolve to reduce my frequency of drug intake, one of those important reminders I occasionally need as my usage slowly slides towards too much.

 I can confirm amazing synergy with ALD-52, ETH-LAD, 2ci, 2cb, DOM, 4-ho-met and 4-aco-dmt. In fact, I don't consider to trip anymore without preloading with treemeow. Also I lowered my drug intake after 3meo experiences, it really helps with addiction. The problem is I only crave for 3meo this days in exchange

Do you dose the 3meo at the same time you drop the lysergamides?  Or stagger the dosing times?

The 3-MeO seems to allow the lysergamide to just really get in there.  Each time I've done it I've been amazed and even a little overwhelmed.  What really amazed me is that the second to last time I did it, I took about a half hit of ALD-52, the slightly larger piece when I cut it so about 70ug I'd guess, and had a very powerful trip that hit a pretty transcendent place for a bit, and caused me to quit using tobacco products.

Excellent, man!


I'm in the camp, if there is such a camp, that would ideally take a sniffed dose of meo or two to get all loose-y goose-y in the mindbrain before dropping a trypt or phen. Then I would do another bump at the peak and then come and go as I please for the rest of the experience.

I should mention in here since others have mentioned; 3-meo did help me quit smoking cigarettes like nobodies business. I have no clue why it works so well as an anti-smoking aid but long before it helped me get a grasp on my other addictions nicotine was the first to go. I had half a pack of cigarettes sitting around when I dropped the first of my newest batch of 3-meo and the nicotine cravings just weren't there at all. I quit cold turkey no problem. 


I've read somewhere it antagonizes NaCh receptors to some degree but i'm not sure how powerfully. It's definitely got some effect on them I believe as it seems to shut down any psychological and physical cravings I would have had had i been CT'ing cigs without it. I've tried quitting cigarettes without the 3-meo before and nothing shuts down the cravings for cigs like this drug. It's another really strange but useful effect this compound has.

Previously had poor results combining 3-meo-pcp with LSD, but tonight it just synergised so well. It's like the 3-meo just got my brain all loose and let the acid seep deep into the folds of my mind. I thought I would have a pretty good tolerance from my last foray five nights ago, which was also a much higher dose, but I was pleasantly surprised with how strong and complete my tabs felt tonight. It was a really great combo for seeing my favorite jam band (The Werks).

^^ Yeah that's how it is for me too.  Oddly the first time I tried combining them I felt they combined terribly.  But after that it's been crazy how well they synergize.  It's just like how you describe, it's like the 3-MeO opens your brain up and allows the LSD to seep into every crevice.  You can trip really hard off a small amount.

Regarding the tobacco cessation, a resounding YES for me as well. It helped me cut down or quit for a period a number of times, nearly every time I cycle on with it, and the same thing happened this past week when I cycled on 3-Meo-PCE. Persisting with the tobacco-free initiative after cycling off the tweetmeow is another matter entirely, but at least I cut back a lot to just 2-3 cigs a day. I know it is time to tweetmeow again when my tobacco use starts to increase.

This appears to be a lot stronger orally or is it just me??

How long do you guys think should you wait in between dosing to keep tolerance at low?

So I guess you cant really hole on it? Havent tried high dose yet at a right setting because Im afraid of it being too uncomfortable.

Appearantly this is like a disso-stim. Nice as a escape from reality but no dis compares to mxe though, cant feel that impossible new dream reality feel it used to give me... dont want to believe the magic is lost just yet!

I really wouldn't, that headspace appears to be a lot more tricky than with something like K or MXE (I find MXE to also often be particularly insane when holed though). It's not just some insanity that can be interesting, but an awkward mix of losing oneself AND one some level remaining up and about much longer which instead of a fully immersed state can lead to dangerous behavior or just freakouts. I had to bring a bro down when he dosed way too high (he was having difficulties with stuff) and just forgot himself. Was way more problematic than anything encountered with something like K. If you're just completely gone and immobilized enough then it is a special state of mind, but if you're gone in one sense but still here in another sense that can be as difficult as psychedelics can be if dosed too low, but more serious.


I had to help manage his gear and lock up my own after that (we agreed).


But don't take my word for it - just check out the things that happened to people on too high doses of 3-MeO.


Not sure if it's a good idea or alarmist, but what about adding a short synopsis of those incidents to the OP to let people decide for themselves if they wanna risk that with high dosages? You know, for those that aren't willing to dig through multiple big and dandy threads or even social threads for it.

Yeah this on is not for holing. I really wanted to hole and took a big dose because I haven't had MXE or ketamine in a long time and it just isnt the same at all. It is truly insanity to take high doses of this and even though some part of me enjoys it in some way this is for low doses and the mania. Only because a lot of experience with dissociative states I'm able to navigate through the insanity but I wouldnt trust myself to take higher doses again. It's just not  worth it.

I will also chime in and caution against trying to hole on this. For me at least, and it sounds like my reaction is different from most, it will leave me debilitated for many hours afterward, like a crazy mush-mouthed drunkard unable to speak properly or handle simple tasks like walking. But my holes have also been completely immersive and while not dysphoric, were definitely not euphoric or even something that I would consider valuable experiences because for most of it there wasn't a *me* to experience it. My loss of bodily control could have led to me to pretty serious physical injury especially my first one where I was sitting next to a camp fire. Luckily, I had friends there to take care of me until I got back but another time it could have been much worse.

I would call high dose positive outcomes with this as breakthrough experiences, but the term 'hole' just doesn't match the phenomenology. Its more like reaching a singularity of consciousness and letting go into a high vibrational evolving energy system. Letting the ego out of the way accelerates the evolution and further collapses the singularity. Its an exercise in letting it happen and just observing the incredible energy manifestation. Lord it is hard to put it into words, Ill give it another shot someday.

That's actually a really great way of putting it. I've never holed on K and DXM is the only other disso I've tried (not even nitrous) so I just assumed my experience was analogous to a K-hole.

This is definitely a functional anti-depressant for me for the most part but I feel like 90% of people who I give a small dose of this to will have an unpleasant reaction. This is really kind of garbage head territory imo, and best left for people who are desperate to overcome desperate times.

While my bandmates all agree I play like Geddy Lee while using it, ultimately my emotional shifts make it a little too much to handle in the end. After my current bag is gone, I won't be using any PCP derivatives for a long time. Gonna move to mellower substances. Probably just milder dissociatives, milder empathogens and psychedelics. I couldn't be more thankful for how its helped me though.

I kind of agree with this. With 3-meo-pcp, there's no "there" there. It's like a template for a dissociative that's yet to be fleshed out. Yes, you can crank it up high and get manic, but virtually any chem in this class can do that with better results. I lived almost 9 straight months in mxe mania, but it was warm, textured, euphoric mania. I know it's cliche but I'll say it again: mxe had magic. There's just nothing behind the eyelids of 3-meo-pcp. You take it, you sense a familiar dissociative feeling creep up and you prepare for the 'here it comes' moment but it never arrives. Dare I say, it is somewhat boring once you peek behind the dissociative sheen of this one, surprisingly uninteresting at its core.


The search for a successor to mxe continues.

^^ Agreed, as a dissociative I think there are many better alternatives, but I still use 3-MeO-PCP more than any other dissociative because I don't like getting fully dissociated very often, but the ability of 3-MeO to unlock a subtle and magical mania, that is extremely functional, is better than any other dissociative I've tried.  It reliably gets me to this flow state when I use concurrent tiny doses where music, expression, and confidence flow strongly without any amount of impairment, it's really valuable to me.  In essence it functions more like a stimulant the way I use it than a dissociative, without any amount of actual stimulation or any of the negatives of stimulants.

Yeah, spot on Xorkoth. I still have a couple of grams of MXE stashed away, but I'm using 3-MeO-PCP much more often. Even though MXE is arguably more "magical" and psychedelic, I think 3-MeO-PCP fits better my casual drug use.

Yeah I would never suggest this as a successor to MXE.  But to reply additionally to the post above my last one, you don't have to dose high to get manic from it.  Concurrent tiny doses spread over the course of hours will also get you there.  I like to do little 2mg bumps, every 1-2 hours, and by the evening I will be very nicely manic but not at all dissociated.

How do you guys feel about 3-MeO probably having the same long term effect potential as PCP considering how similar it acts?:


- "Runs" - Chronic users may binge use PCP, taking it repeatedly for 2 or 3 days at a time without eating or sleeping, followed by a period of sleep. These runs may occur as many as four times in a month.
- Impaired memory
- "Flashbacks" similar to those experienced by chronic LSD users
- Persistent speech problems, such as stuttering, inability to articulate, or the inability to speak at all
- Chronic and severe anxiety and depression, possibly leading to suicide attempts
- Social withdrawal and isolation
- Toxic psychosis may appear in chronic users who do not have a prior history of psychiatric disturbances. The symptoms of toxic psychosis are aggressive or hostile behavior, paranoia, delusional thinking and auditory hallucinations.

These runs may occur as many as four times in a month.  Yes, runs for sure, except I have no impairment of eating or sleeping during them.  Well my sleep quality is probably less but I still sleep, and I have absolutely no problems eating plenty.  I actually will go for 4 or 5 days in a row sometimes.  Keep in my when I use 3-MeO-PCP I only use it in 2-3mg doses separated by 1-2 or more hours.  I will use like 15mg total in an entire day.  I feel no urge to use more than that, except once in a while I will purposely take larger doses and get "wonky", but maybe once a month.
> - Impaired memory  Yes, I get word recall issues during usage that become worse as the run becomes longer.  Not too bad.  Again, I use pretty low doses.  But frequently.
> - "Flashbacks" similar to those experienced by chronic LSD users  Never had such a thing from any drug
> - Persistent speech problems, such as stuttering, inability to articulate, or the inability to speak at all  I get minor stuttering when I become dissociated on 3-MeO.  When I dose normally (for me), I never become dissociated, I do it because it gradually builds a really lovely and inspiring hypomania and I like that state.  Any dissociative makes me stutter/slur when I become dissociated and this is no exception, MXE does it quite a bit worse.  I have a friend who does a lot of 3-MeO who slurs very badly on it.  She tends to take much larger doses than me.
> - Chronic and severe anxiety and depression, possibly leading to suicide attempts  I have gotten worn down from it which leads to feeling flat emotionally, but I would say various other drugs produce much deeper lows for me after abuse.  I have had months where I low-dosed 3-MeO probably 6 out of every 7 days, and had surprisingly few issues.  Once again I want to emphasize that I use it almost as sort of tonic or something, for me it is not a drug for getting fucked up on.
> - Social withdrawal and isolation  I generally don't like using it anywhere near as much except in social situations (I enter social situations most days of my life).  If anything, the hypomania from it makes me want to be social more.
> - Toxic psychosis may appear in chronic users who do not have a prior history of psychiatric disturbances. The symptoms of toxic psychosis are aggressive or hostile behavior, paranoia, delusional thinking and auditory hallucinations.  Never had this from it.  However I have never had this from anything.

Pretty much same as Xorkoth. I use this for the mania, eat well, sleep well, live well. This drug has caused me the least problems of all drugs I've used. But I'm sure it won't work like that for majority of people. You need a certain amount of experience and wisdom to use 3-MeO-PCP like that. Most importantly you need to have your life in order to use it like that. It's still probably the most dangerous and potent drug I've used.


I probably used over a gram of 3-MeO-PCP over the summer and fall - experienced no problems. Another gram over the spring. Which has ruined most drugs for me because this really gives me no negative effects I can notice if I take breaks and sleep well.

Yeah, when they mentioned the flashbacks thing I instantly got the impression that the source isn't very serious. 


Besides that, the "negative effects" mentioned are for the most part behavioral, which I think are a risk for any drug of this class. Dissociatives can make you socially isolated, can impair speech if used chronically, etc... But staying in check with oneself is something we must all practice if we choose to overindulge in drugs. Be honest with yourself and try to stay away from self-destructive patterns.

I would imagine if taking this in large doses frequently, it could cause a lot more problems.  It seems like generally when you hear about PCP users, they're getting all kinds of fucked up on it.

I think it mostly has to do with the fact that typically, unknown doses are being smoked. 


I guess If I was using 3-MeO-PCP always eyeballing it, I would have certainly run into some problems by now.

I eyeball it sort of, but I use this tiny scoop that holds about exactly 2mg so it's not really the same.  I used to weigh my dosages.  Sometimes away from home I use a tiny bump on the end of a key so my dosages vary slightly but certainly far less than with dipped cigarettes or some such, which really leaves you with absolutely no idea what you're taking.  Also, 3-MeO-PCP and PCP, while certainly sharing similarities, are also most certainly distinct drugs with different actions.  But who knows, maybe someone with pure PCP powder who dosed 1-2mg at a time would experience similar reactions?  I honestly can't say since I've never seen PCP, even in a dipped cigarette or something like that.

Been really digging this one lately, very hard to resist the temptation to use daily.  At the end of the day I know that I would rather not do anymore, but then  I wake up and it's like why not? Taking the path of responsibility with this one though, not gonna ruin it for myself haha. I promise! 8(

I agree with you, Xorkoth, that 2 or 3 mg. is a great dose. Even up to 5 or 6 mg can still be highly funtional, but I learned a valuable lesson when I took a 13 mg. dose and tried to be fuctional, and while I was still able to pull it off, I was close to going over the edge to non-functionality. I won't be doing that again. I now stick to 2 or 3, even though it's kind of a pain dealing with that tiny amount of powder, the effects are well worth it.

It's just like how you describe, it's like the 3-MeO opens your brain up and allows the LSD to seep into every crevice.  You can trip really hard off a small amount.

As stated before, I find this drug is truly special when using it on low doses. This is not an MXE/K substitute. I am even pondering whether to catalogue this as a "dissociative", cause it just does not really feel the same. Most drugs known by man clearly fall into a specific category and there is no doubt they belong there. Psychedelics, stimulants, delirants, empathogens, dissociatives, opioids... you name it. But every now and then some drugs just don't completely belong to any of those pre-existing categories. Yes, 3-Meo-PCP does feel like a dissociative somehow, but it is also a strong stimulant and many other things. And the head space is NOT the headspace I would expect from other dissociatives.


I think we are limiting the experiences we can get from this drug because we are forcing it inside the category of dissociatives, but we should not do so. It's the classic example of when expectations destroy something. Even if that something was even better than the expectations themselves (yet unexpected or different).


For instance, before MDMA was used recreationally, the concept of "empathogen" did not really exist. Not even Shulgin mentions the word "empathy" in his PIHKAL entry for MDMA. It was a new feeling, and people tried to force it inside an already existing category such as "stimulant" or "psychedelic". And yes, in a way it's both of those, but it's also more. MDMA is an empathogen.


The same thing happens with these powerful arylcyclohexylamines such as 3-MeO-PCP. We can fit them inside the "dissociative", "stimulant" or even "delirant" categories, but they just don't belong there. In the same way eugeroics are not stimulants, this is not just a dissociative.


It's time to invent new words to describe new concepts, instead of trying to fit new concepts in old drawers.

^absolutely this chemical is its own beast. I wonder what it could be considered to "do" if it isn't a true dissociative. What sets it apart in you all's opinions?

Well, it's a dissociative anaesthetic, it's just not that anaesthetic...


Nitrous or K will knock you out, DXM will also immobilize you in steps - first screwing up your gait.


Things like PCP, 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE i guess, in my opinion R-ketamine, and probably the xphenidines don't really seem to do this but make you lose your mind before you lose consciousness or most of your motor skills.


What is a true dissociative? One that anaesthesizes you or starts to at reasonable doses while also being psychedelic and scrambling your cognition and memory?


What something like 3-MeO-PCP does seems complicated to answer, especially how it does it and why other dissociatives don't do it or vice versa. I've tried discussing it in NSP / ADD forum multiple times:

[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads...ead-Part-3?p=13830337&viewfull=1#post13830337](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/806952-The-Big-amp-Bangin-Miscellaneous-Chemistry-Pharmacology-Odds-N-Ends-Thread-Part-3?p=13830337&viewfull=1#post13830337)


But I'm honestly not satisfied with this.


Is it really just reuptake inhibition and that sort of thing, that keeps you up and about? Same for diphenidine. For starters, it doesn't feel like that to me - things like DCK or S-ket feel to me like they just have activity that things like 3-MeO-PCP don't. Activity that makes me feel heavy like a bag of bricks. I'm pretty sure that adding a monoamine reuptake inhibitor to that doesn't make that feeling just completely go away? Taking a stim and a sedative together does not feel like being sober either.


How it feels is never any good evidence though.


> Although the precise interactions between ketamine and NMDA receptors are still being elucidated [21], enough evidence suggests a relation between ketamine's analgesic and anesthetic properties and NMDA channel blockade [21-23] to consider the NMDA receptor ketamine's primary site of anesthetic action. However, there are interactions with other systems that may also be relevant.

Considering 3-MeO-PCP acts as a potent antagonist at the NMDA receptor but doesn't produce anaesthesia quite as much... the big question is: which interaction with other systems is responsible?


Oh I may have one answer:

Whatever it's classification I find 3 meo pcp to be on par with if not more psychedelic than MXE, it never felt like hollow hypo mania to me, in fact I treasure many of my experiences on 3 meo as some of the most positive, downright spiritual experiences I have had the pleasure of having! It may be worth noting that I almost always combined kratom when I was using 3 meo which I found to heavily alter the nature of 3 meo in a much more positive "glowing" fashion. In fact I would place some 3 meo in a 2 oz shot glass with a gram of finely ground kratom. This ritual took on a religious feeling after many successful positive trips.

I'm in love. I find it very psychedelic as well. SO functional though. I've been pushing it lately, and so far it's been forgiving. Taking a break soon. Combined with etizolam is almost too blissful. I've kept it going all day, seriously considering not sleeping to keep the feeling going...MOORISH. I know this is the honeymoon phase but I'm loving it. Such a wonderful compound. I wrote a mini TR in the smoking DPT thread, but last nights experience with a pretty large dose of 3-meo and and freebase DPT was hands down the best combo I've ever tried.  Maybe the timelines of each separate substance just lined up properly, but I've read a few reports of that combo being lackluster and I urge those who have it available to maybe give it a try.

Got a new batch recently. It is like the first times. I described it to a friend as such: 


"Feels... softer. More subtle. Sneaky. Not really less strong just hits me with fluffy cotton ball gloves on."


Every baggie I've had is the same, white fluffy crystals. This time had a couple large shards but otherwise similar. I've had varying effects. 4 different batches. First one was as described above. I put it into vodka in a 3mg/ml solution and my friends called it liquid love. After we went through that, I got a sharper, more psychedelic batch which led me to my  "hole" experiences. I was more irresponsible with this in my personal use, eyeballing doses of powder, it was more mechanical and less magical but more compulsive. Third batch was the same, now back to the fluffiness. The batch I have now acts like a binder, a connector, or a glue when a group takes it together. Mild telepathy has been experienced with 3-meo-pcp. It seems to elevate its users to a state of collective consciousness to some degree. This is with my closest friends, mind you, so we already share a bond, but this substance strengthens that bond to an uncanny level. I love this drug.

I haven't tried it in a group setting yet. I have some friends that are willing to get pretty weird, but I feel like as soon as I say "PCP" it would be game over haha. They are not familiar with analogs, and not interested, I tried to explain 4-aco-dmt to them once and they just said "oh, chemical from the internet with a long name? No thanks" Bummer ?

Yeah a lot of people are like that.  I knew this girl who asked me if I could get LSD.  I could get 1p-LSD, so I went over there and told her about it, and she and her boyfriend were like, oh, we don't do synthetics, and threw me a bit of scorn.  I was like, you realize LSD is synthetic, right, and so is MDMA?  They were like, uh, no.  I was like, uh, yeah. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


LSD and MDMA could both be research chemicals right now if they hadn't been discovered a long time ago... They could have discovered 4-MMC a long time ago and that would be the big rave party drug, and then MDMA came out and a bunch people would be like, "ugh, no, that's a weird internet chemical".  Or ETH-LAD could have been the lysergamide that became popular first and LSD could be a research chemical.  It's so arbitrary.


But yeah, the PCP in 3-MeO-PCP freaks a lot of people out.  I did, however, introduce many of the members of my friend's band to it, and once they got past the initial squeamishness, they love it a lot.

The only (mild) argument the natural vs synthetic people can make is that naturals typically come with a long history of use. The assumption is that with enough time, the proper correlations of effects and risks will just clarify by themselves. Which yes usually happens I guess, which makes it somewhat of a valid point.

But none if this really matters if you're not also aware of a bigger argument which is what synthetic means and why for a big part, the distinction can be meaningless.


If the notoriety of PCP would be true, the PCP in 3-MeO-PCP should probably freak people out. It's just that with alcohol or weed you get so many accounts of people who have a positive result with it, but with PCP *never* except from Steve-O ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) . But you do hear about the babies and the faces getting eaten. So unfair. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Haha yes! I mean 4-aco-dmt has been consistently synthesized since what, the 60's? And luckily somehow it's remained on the market, but it's been around, and tested, I would say almost as much as LSD. I love it "we don't do synthetics". I wouldn't feel so bad about it if people didn't show me some "scorn" like you said. 

Also, one time I let a friend of mine (that doesn't want to dabble in RCs) hold onto my stash for a night or two cause I didn't want it at home. He and another guy I know got

bored that night and mixed what they told me were "scoops" of 4-Aco and DPT into a water bottle and split the whole thing between them. They had an awful time, and blamed the "dirty, internet chemicals". When I got my stuff back I realized they must have put at least about 150mg of each chem in that bottle no joke. 

It's people that give the substances a bad name. Same with PCP. If it was never abused so heavily, who knows if it would have ever gotten the stigma it had today? Not saying I'm in a hurry to try it, I've personally never even seen it in real like.

I do synthetics either if your synthetics are just randomly shuffled organic groups. But if it's an ester of psilocin which IS natural, and partially or completely turns into psilocin in the body, it's more trustworthy than your randomly shuffled organic groups.


As an example ketamine or DXM which compared to natural products are pretty alien substances, are harder to just predict what their issues might be. By now, fortunately numerous related issues have become clear anyway... but with something like diphenidines or even NBOMe's things are only *just* starting to nearly become clear. Or not even probably.


PCP used as a niche dissociative in a psychedelic scene is possibly also used differently than some random guy living in a ghetto. Maybe random (and not to their fault drug-ignorant) guys in the ghetto are just more likely to get into trouble with it producing those stigmas compared to the rare random "psychonaut" wanting to try the fabled pcp.

The apprehension is understandable I suppose. Current stuff can give off a scary vibe to the untrained eye & ear.. In the end, them turning down 1p I'd imagine is their loss.. I've never done it but I reckon it to be on par with "the real deal" although I know it probably has its own unique values to it.

Sheeit though if someone offered me something of that caliber and I hadnt heard of it I would be quick to say "well hold on, let me look it up real quick and are you sure of it's authenticity?"

I certainly wouldn't shrug it off in the brave farcery of wearing "natural" on my sleeve. Fuggin dolts.

I'm in a "city" but not necessarily a big city (sandwiched right between 2 big cities though) and the real scenes seem to be happening there. Where I'm at, even the real drug users are pretty conventional. Prefer their drugs to be monosyllabic and tried and true.  Also know some people that pride themselves very much on being "that guy" that knows "the guy" that knows the family and all that to get psychs.  Which is why I love the internet. I had a falling out with the local let's say family member and now have a hard time getting access to certain substances. Hate the hierarchy associated with LSD and the like.  It's not an all exclusive club. Still carry some bitterness about that. I guess what I'm saying is I get the feeling some of these people won't try different substances because they have access to LSD and feel a sense of superiority and are "above" RCs.  of course LSD is amazing, the alternatives can be as well. Like I said I can't help being bitter

Oh boy, how I love those igorant drug users. I once had a friend declining my amphetamine paste while he was doing cocaine because he "don't do synthetics". Because of fucking course cocaine is a natural compound extracted from the coca plant. I still smile today remembering that.


Back on topic, I want to suggest that the effects variation between batches you people are posting about lately could be related to set&setting, tolerance and lose of magic instead of related to the batch itself? I'm saying this because I have 3 different batches of 3-MeO-PCP that were pretty similar on effects during my honeymoon with 3meow, and half a year after I'm not getting at all the effects I had back then (With every one of the 3 different batches). Mania and magic are gone, and I feel more letargic, less creative, and a bit of mind fog when I take it (Since September that's only once a month, but I binged like if tomorrow would be the Apocalypse for a while)

No, I've been using this batch for about a month and it is consistently and markedly different from my middle two batches. This is not just set and setting. Certainly not tolerance because this batch has a certain magic the previous batches lacked. My friends agreed, this is better. 


And I'm pretty sure it's all been 3-meo-pcp because aside from the differences we noticed all signs lign up. Haven't had any lab tested cuz that's expensive here in the US.

I just read this entire 3-MeO-PCP thread.  Though I've never done any, it sounds remarkably seductive and forgiving for a PCP analog, with a rich texture that keeps the users going back for more.  Maybe one day I'll try it, but I doubt it:  both k and mxe induce weeks long lasting, post trip psychosis for me, though I love the seductive siren call of the proverbial disso as much as the next guy.  One thing I've noticed is that ya'll's 3-meo seems to act like a trur nootropic on some levrl  causing nuanced, smooth text to spring forth from you, its usets, like Marcel Proust writing about the reminscent smell ef tulips as a child on the streets of paris 200 years ago in Swann's way.  Oh yeah, I found some good cocaine powder yesterday and somr blue ice methamphetamine, which I'll think I'll stick to.  Everyone considers meth to be synthetic and harmful but the best stuff is actially derived by the all natural ma huang plant after de-oxygebating it with a little kitchen chemistry.  So while you search for the elusive hypomania of the earlier tan batch  I'll be flirting with the full blown variety.  Just me and my simple, elegant 2-methylamino-1-phenylpropane.

Yeah if other dissos lead to post-trip psychosis, definitely, definitely stay away from this.  As for the meth, to each his own, I've never liked meth, I get way better effects from 3-MeO and basically no downsides except if I go for too long.  Cocaine however, that's a nice drug.

Probably not, arylcyclohexylamines are remarkably stable, it seems. Anecdotally I can say that I've had my MXE for years stored at Room temperature and have noticed no decrease in potency. 3-MeO-PCP for less than a year, but same story.

Maybe it's the batch I have but this stuff is so hit or miss for me. Or maybe it has a stronggg cross-tolerance with other dissos? 


Did some DCK on Wednesday and then felt almost nothing from 15mg oral of 3-MeO on Friday. 


It's a bummer because when I have felt this stuff in the past it was amazing. I love the manic aspects, it felt like rolling to me at points. Had the most wonderful experiences at a couple festivals. Now I feel like I'm chasing those feelings with no success ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Hi guys, I went through the entire thread and it sured piqued my curiosity. I was wondering about the idea of hypomania, what does it mean, exactly? And also is 3meo moreish? Not in the "take it til my gram is gone" kind of way, but in the "keep taking little bumps til you're too dissociated to care" way. I'm concerned that it will trigger some selfdestructive behaviors on me.

Mania is an 'extreme' state of elation - feeling on top of the world, very confident and optimistic, often hyperactive and can involve behavior that is dangerous or that one might later regret. When taken to most extreme points it can mean delusions of grandeur or indestructibility etc. Plenty of people have come to the forum in such a state to post things like the hilarious 'we did it' thread: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads...i-it-we-all-believed-in-in-him-and-he-did-it-](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/720647-God-has-done-it-he-fucking-didi-it-we-all-believed-in-in-him-and-he-did-it-)!!!!!


Hypomania is the milder, more or less benign version of that. It does not involve dangerous behavior and the positive feelings don't take on a delusional character that can make you a threat to yourself or others.


3-MeO-PCP is a bit 'moreish' but compared to plenty of stimulants it is not in my opinion too hard to resist the urge, but it can seem attractive to many people. A difference, in my experience, can be that you must come to terms with the fact that it is not hypnotic like ketamine is so you don't go into a hole in a similar way, but you do 'lose yourself' mentally. So it's important to fight the idea that there is even such a thing as an ideal completely holed or dissociated state you can take bumps towards as such a state can be uncomfortable and dangerous with this drug. Nevertheless some people still do it, but has led to dangerous incidents and frankly doesn't even sound that appealing. I have went up with the dose but not to such dangerous levels.


Hypomania* inducing drug? Well psychedelia inducing drug >> psychedelic so hypomania inducing drug would just be a hypomanic.

That post was so fun, and very representative of what mania can be. I myself fell in that state a lot of times, but always was very physically impaired to be able to write anything about it.


3-MeO-PCP big&dandies have a lot of posts that scream mania and hypomania too, a lot of them from myself when I was on my honeymoon with the drug.

Regarding how this affects writing, that is one of the most intriguing bits about this chemical. You can often guess whether the author of a post is sober or high as a kite not by how sloppy their writing is but by how florid and flowing their text becomes. This is the new poet's drug, move over absinthe!

Yeah I consistently write in a particular kind of way on 3-MeO, it's one of the reasons I might choose to use it on any given day.  Like [this short little piece](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/803288-2C-T-2-3-MeO-PCP-Very-Experienced-Soliloquy-In-Blue?highlight=soliloquy) (sort of a trip report but really short) I wrote on it one day.  Very interesting effect indeed.

If it's the white fluffy batch, I felt the same way about it, it does seem less mania-producing than the previous batches I've had but as I've used it more I've sort of figured out how to use it and now I really like it, though I do wish I had access to the previous batch as well.  I find that it's more setting-dependent than the other batch, but that by repeated dosing of slightly higher amounts over a night, and with sufficient external input (like social activity, or music), I can reach an absolutely hypomanic and magical/sparkly place that has led to some of the most fun nights in memory.

It's not more-ish in the same way that stims or even something like ketamine is.  But I find it very easy to rationalize daily use since it's so benign.  


It's important to note that this disso is very much different from other ones.  It's not really very good for getting dissociated in my opinion.  Rather, it's a modulator of mood and mental processes, a subtle thing that can lead to some profound alterations.  If you keep dosing more to chase a hole it's going to disappoint you.

About addiction, I feel this one is easier to tame down than any other disso, because of the long-life and stimulating properties, I usually reach a point after a few days of binging where I need to stop, both mind and body ask for it, and effects start to become disgusting. This is a point I will never reach using ketamine or 2-OxO-PCM for example.

Yeah I can vouch for 3meo improving creative writing flow! When im sober or just in my pothead routine I don't ever write anymore. That all changed when I got a half g  of this lovely stuff. Most trips on 3meo I would crank out poems, prose, journals etc. They would come to my mind and out of my fingers as quickly and intuitively as breathings. It felt so natural and therapeutic it is one of the aspects of this chemical that blew me away. Playing the drums became second nature as well on this compound.

Yeah I use it for musical inspiration too.  I haven't painted in years now but I'm sure it would be a boon there as well.

While I'm usually really bad at FPS games, while on 3meow I'm the fucking boss, I usually open up Battlefield 1 and own the game, reflexes and response time are really improved, and I find myself making complex strategies.


It's also very good at improving creativity and bringing fresh ideas and aproaches while doing music.

So I've been sick, lost my voice for the past 3 days after having a cold for over a week (so a week and a half I've felt sick), but it's back today and I finally feel better!  I just did literally between 1 and 2mg of 3-MeO, and those nootropic effects are really kicking in right now, I'm doing an intense work thing that I've been doing for the past 3 work days (worked 29 hours already in Sunday-Tuesday on this same project/task), and I'm making little games for myself and having fun with it despite wanting to punch a hole through my monitor yesterday.  I'm making plans to do things I've been needing to do later, like laundry and cleaning, and those things sound nice too.  Man, what a great drug. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Haven't done it since I got sick.

Glad to hear it Xork :D gotta love when mundane tasks become fun. Whenever I get a cold, I never feel like myself, especially if I can't breathe through my nose. It really is a wonderful little compound. Does anyone notice much difference between sublingual and oral dosing? I honestly don't notice that much from nasal to sublingual, just have been steering toward nasal because I enjoy that method with most things ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I found oral to be much more "complete" and psychedelic. Nasal dosing felt moreish and a bit artificially stimulating and more ego driven/immediately task oriented. 


I guess it could be said that oral 3meo makes me wonder why I am who I am. Whereas nasal makes me want to get immersed in a process or task in this day in the moment without as much concern for philosophical and existential queries like oral dosing. If I'm eating this stuff I wanna lay back in the dark with earphones in and melt. If I'm sniffing I wanna talk my friends ears off about relationships and society and art (and flirt with pretty girls if the option arises)

Haha, that sounds about right. Maybe I've just been going a litttle overboard lately and it's building up in me system. I haven't noticed any uncontrollable mania though, even in larger doses. Maybe it's just the batch like y'all are saying. This is the only batch I've ever had though

Magically with ETH-LAD, LSD or ALD-52. AL-LAD never tried, but 25 blotters are coming soon, so I'll probably try it before the years end, and in combination with 3meo of course (Since I discovered the combo of tryptamines and lysergamides with long lasting dissos this year, I don't do psychedelics without adding dissos anymore)


Both on low and higher doses, but bear in mind I'm a hardhead and have got permatolerance with dissos in general, really used to the feeling of beeing dissociated 24/7. I like either to take the 3-meo first and experience it on its own and add a few hours later the lysergamide, or take them both at same time, as the onset and duration are very similar. Always oral, I only like the snorted route for a stimulant-like experience, like FuckinAcidMan described pretty well before.

Thanks MSK, I was kinda hoping for your input since I remember your post about only wanting 3-meo plus lysergamides anymore haha. I've been pondering this one. Haven't tried ALD on it's own yet, but this combo is so tempting....had plenty of LSD in my time though. So I'm sure nothing unexpected, just seen ALD's potency is pretty intense at 125ug

Yea 125ug of ALD-52 on it's own was a great experience for me, just the right strength.


3-MeO-PCP definitely adds to the experience. Priming with 3-MeO and then taking 14mg of 2C-B led to a totally cosmic psychedelic place that I'd never been with 2C-B before. Xorkoth mentioned in the past few weeks doing I wanna say half a tab of ALD-52 on 3-MeO-PCP and having a strong reaction. It's definitely a good and strong combo.

2C-X are lovely with 3meo as well, I forgot I had taken 2C-B and 2C-I with great success while on 3meo, thanks for remembering psy997 ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It for sure elevates the psychedelic experience to the sky, and at the same time the 3meo adds that dissociative attitude and relaxed feeling of "I don't give a fuck" where is nearly imposible to have a bad trip, or to care about having one at least hehe. Also, as the 3meo is not as physically and mentally impairing as other dissociatives tend to be, I don't get confused at all and can remember all the experience afterwards, unlike ketamine.


I love both lysergamides and 3-MeO-PCP because of the hypomania and euphoria they produce on me, and they go so well together!


Also, talking about the visual aspect of the combo, it's insane. I should have eaten more than 500 blotters of LSD on my life, but never managed to have OEV even on 5 blotters of the stuff, until I took 3 and 15mg of 3-MeO-PCP. Will always remember that day, everything had an aura, all my room started to move, letters melting down on the computer before I could read them... What anybody that hasn't tried any psychedelic thinks the psychedelic experience is like ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

The combo with ALD-52 is really intense and synergistic, I took a half tab (~65ug, maybe more) on top of 3-MeO and tripped hard, ended up quitting all nicotine products (from being a daily dipper/near-daily smoker) from that night on.  I took a whole tab (125ug) another time after that on top of 3-MeO and it's the hardest I've ever tripped on "acid".

This batch I have is so much more forgiving on the psyche. If I take too much, as I did just a while ago, I just melt into a puddle of love. The previous, more psychedelic batch, would shred my ego with the winds of a dying sun. I swear there's a yin & yang to 3-meo-pcp batches.

Yeah there absolutely is, everyone seems to notice it.  When my friend and I got this current batch, we all doubted it was even 3-MeO at first.  I certainly don't doubt it now but the difference is extremely obvious.  MXE is like that too.  I can't say why but it's true.


With other drugs I've had batch differences but it only centered around how strong it was.  For example, the first batch of DOC I got was tiny crystals, just like the batch I got my lifetime supply of.  It's strong and full-bodied, great stuff.  The second batch I got was a flour-like powder, and it required higher doses to achieve the same effects, but the effects were the same.  I figure it was just cut a bit or something.  But some dissos seem to actually have different effects.  The two 3-MeO batches are about equipotent, they just have different characteristics.

Yea I've literally had very little mania. Source is very trusted. But like I said I can't compare to other batches, still love it, just doesn't seem like what's been described many times in previous threads. But the potency, and some other effects match up. Very lucid dissociation, along with stimulation (nasally), very pleasant bodyload. I always seem to get a little warmer when I take this

Gotta wonder if it's due to variance in ratios of isomers... it could easily be that one of the optical isomers is very mania-producing and the other is more psychedelic.  I wish it was easier to be able to determine these things.

PCP itself is not chiral as it possesses a symmetrical plane. Same goes for 3-MeO-PCP... I missed this in previous posts but it means no isomers!


I already commented on the possibilities for this strange difference reported, giving my opinion on isomers among other things (although at that time I didn't go which isomers there would actually be if any).


Also, I asked my source about this and he said it was the same batch that I got both the more manic and the less manic stuff from... so go figure.


Some say that stuff like 3-MeO-PCP is primarily an NMDA antagonist and other action should hardly be considered seriously, others suggest it is the explanation for particular effects not seen in others - I'd give diphenidine as an example which is not hypnotic like ketamine and more psychomimetic and amnestic getting you utterly lost... but I don't actually know that diphenidine is all that manic at any reasonable dose.

i've been wondering for awhile about whether you guys are actually getting different batches.  its easy to not recognize tolerance for what it is, and assume that a new batch isn't as good as the old batches.  seen it happen many times to many people with many substances.

How do you explain the magic coming back with a new batch? Ive gone through 3 grams this year and made a good start on the 4th. I wish lab testing was cheaper. I can get 3 grams or more of this for what it would cost to have a sample tested. That's an easy choice for me.

Thing is, I was doing one batch for about a year, very frequently, at low doses, and getting exactly the same effect every time.  Then I ran out for over a month, and got a new batch with a more flour-like consistency, and from the very first time and every other time I've experienced different effects.  I can't produce the same level of hypomania.  If it was tolerance, why would my final use of the old batch have been a certain way and then after a month off, the effects were different and always were from then on?  I had come to rely on every single time the effects of consecutive low dosing to produce a certain effect, and with the new batch that just changed.

That doesn't explain why they would vary in effects, it would then be something like impurities either from side-reactions or a precursor (the nitrile is supposed to be active I think, but toxic though and may smell of almonds), impure precursor even, that consists of not only the 3-MeO but 2-MeO grignard?

We can guess, but it would kind of require someone submitting a sample to the lab. Maybe I'll do it. Didn't want to before, because it may take most of my small-ish stash but I'm not using it much. It's a non hypomanic product if I had to choose but it's supposed to be the same as the previous time I bought it, and I think I got hypomania from that. Fortunately there are no stereoisomers cause I doubt they test for that.

Thank f*** it's finally happened for a compound without isomers so that we don't have to spend 500 posts discussing whether a new synth is stereoselective for once. 99% chance this is tolerance. Happened with MXE, happens to people with ketamine. Tolerance doesn't just mean people need a higher dose, it changes the qualitative effect too.

I told you guys, I've been indulging on the same batch all this year (I bought 10g's) and along half this year I also was using two other different batches, that felt the same. Now I only have got 3meow from the bulkier batch, and effects are tooootally different to when I was begining, even if I take 1-2 months breaks between doses. Tolerance, and lose of the magic for sure, as the powder is the same as a year ago.

Then why would I be getting the exact same effects every time for months and months with one batch (that had a different appearance/color), and then after 1-2 months (can't remember exactly how long) of no 3-MeO or other dissociatives, I get a different batch with very noticeably different effects?  The effects are actually stronger in terms of intoxication, but there is no prolonged hypomania, just some hypomania short-term during the effects if I build it up enough.  The last batch, I could 100% of the time build up a hypomanic state lasting for days and reaching an intense peak if I went long enough, using 1-2mg doses separated by hours.  Just doesn't happen with this batch, never has one time.  It seems unlikely to be tolerance if the one type of effects persisted until the very last dose of a batch with a different appearance, and then disappeared after a month or longer break, never to return, the only difference being a new batch.


And I mean, yeah, okay, maybe it's the power of suggestion or something if I'm getting really high and feeling like the high is different.  But in my mind, a threshold dosing regimen resulting in reliable hypomania is not quite the same.  I can tell whether I am experiencing hypomania or not, it's pretty objective and clear-cut.  Am I talking non-stop, feeling euphoria for seemingly no reason, feeling uncontrollably inspired in art and music, and having a lot more energy than normal, or am I not feeling those things?  It's pretty easy to tell.

^ the thing that i find interesting is that i've had one batch, and one batch only (largish acquisition) - and that has the effects noted only recently in this thread.

For a year or so i thought i was having weirdly exceptional results with this one - never any mania, and i found there was magic to be had when upping the dose rather than taking small doses like xorkoth had.

I never take it too regularly, i never had a massive tolerance to dissociatives, but i did play around with MXE a bit a few years earlier.


Then suddenly - long after i got my stash - a bunch of people start reporting a drug that behaves (and looks, fwiw) exactly like the stuff i got - which is different to the stuff they were getting previously.


I'm not qualified to even assess the arguments re: isomers and so on - but i'm really glad we have those sorts of minds here.

This is a pretty fascinating phenomena.

And my results with a new batch are the polar opposite from Xorkoth. I know tolerance has some role but this ain't just mild differences.

I acquired some 100mg of 3-MeO earlier this year and about half of the stack is gone now. No hypomania, no speedy effects, no insights, just feeling wonky, calm and functional - that's it. Doses ranging from 3 to 12mgs. No previous disso experiences before, so no tolerance. So odd. Btw, tried MDMA for the first time - no effects, nothing. Better to stick with shrooms, I guess.

I find that for me hypomanic experiences are related to the set & setting and not to the batch itself. The days I'm luckily gifted with an hypomanic, positive and creative experience are those rare days that I'm totally zen with all aspects in my life, a hard one hehe

There are no stereoisomers but there could be isomers, when you want cheap product, you buy cheap precursors.

I remember the mephedrone time, it was said that each batch was a different mixt of 4MMC and 3MMC.

Perhaps with 3meoPCP we can find some proportion of 2 or 4 meoPCP in it ?

Not sure when you ask for analysing a sample if the lab push the test so fare to discremenate the position of the methoxy group.

Considered that but 2-MeO-PCP isn't a heard of drug like 3-MMC is and 4-MeO-PCP is a very different beast which doesn't match the descriptions of others nor my own experience. Adder has reported on 2-MeO-PCP once I think (said it's very weak) but that's about it afaik - maybe some underground hyperlab chemists made it..


Stimulants being commonly misadvertised as other stimulants is different from 'accidentally' having unheard of positional isomers in your product.


Yes a lab should be able to see that difference, but mostly if they have the reference sample.

I've been discussing with a friend that tells me snorting this for him is more potent than oral. I'm convinced oral is more potent than snorting. I say this because of personal experience, aprox. I find that for aiming to have a similar experience, I need nearly double the material of the 3meow to reach the same level as orally. This is true also for 2-OxO-PCM, 2-OxO-PCE, and 3-MeO-PCE, at least in my case! What are your insights about this matter, fellow angeldusters?

I actually find oral to be stronger by dose too, but I prefer nasal because I like the stimulating onset.  I like the stimulating nature of this drug more than the dissociating nature.  Either way puts me in that magical inspirational place when dome right but my oral experiences are always heavier, less functional, more personal, less external.  That's why I prefer nasal most of the time.

I myself like it on the hard side, but usually snort it in low doses because of work, responsibilities, and those shitty things in life that keeps one away from enjoying the hedonistic life so much. My dose with 3-MeO-PCP "for the flow" purposes would be 15mg snorted, but I would get the same effect with 5mg oral and it would last longer. For a heavy dose I would use 25mg oral, and I would reach a level I wasn't able to reach snorting it recklessly eyeballing.

Yeah, oral it is always a stronger drug experience to me, more psychedelic and dissociating, also longer lasting. Sometimes I snort it in low doses (lower than 10 mg) because it will just give me the stimulating side of it, but generally oral works better for me. I've noticed that if I take 5-8 mgs orally and redose the same amount three or four hours latter, when the second dose hits me it becomes similarly stimulating as If I had just snorted it.

After weighing my doses many times, I now use a tiny scoop that I know will provide around 2mg if leveled off.  Or something if I don't have that scoop handy, I will just get a bit on the end of my car key that I estimate to be around that same amount.  Before I started actually dosing it this way, I practiced doing it and weighing it and so I know what it looks like, pretty much.  I know that my estimated dosages could be off but I am very experienced with the drug and I take tiny doses at a time so I don't feel irresponsible for doing it.  If I am trying to take a larger dose to actually experience it as a dissociative, I will weigh it because I feel it's important to know exactly what you're taking when moving into dose territory.


I certainly strongly recommend anyone who is trying 3-MeO-PCP and/or reading this thread to use a scale because 3-MeO-PCP is very potent, it's not the sort of drug to go taking willy nilly, you need to be very conscious of your dose.

Is there like a tripsit type area of blue light where I can go when I may not be feeling so lucid but coherent enough to type some legible sentences?

3-meo-pcp (eyeballed, but under 20mg, with tolerance) + 3mg DOC was one of the most all-encompassing trips I've ever had. I think I tried to nap while letting the DOC come up; as I regained some semblance of self, of ego, I was squirming around in my blankets, sort of a sense of birth. I almost wish I had my go-pro set up for amusement purposes, but I'm glad this trip was taken alone because someone else might have been worried by my exaggerated movements. It took some time to remember and realize that I had taken the combo. I was significantly physically impaired, very wobbly, and my visual field was just blasted with psychedelic patterns of color and twisting shapes. A shower helped to ease the transition to a more normal state of trippiness. Actually I think what triggered my switch from a cosmic or even subatomic perspective back to the mundane was an instinctive urge to get to the bathroom before soiling the bed. My memory of this transition is a bit fuzzy. After settling back into reality, although seriously distorted still, I was able to get myself down to my basement man-cave/hippie hole and put on music, a Spotify playlist I created to help myself overcome depression with all kinds of uplifting, inspiring music. As the 3-meo-pcp subsided, I regained functionality and spent much of the morning chatting with friends in a group messenger while watching a Netflix series called Lady Dynamite with Maria Bamford that I find to be hilarious but also uncomfortably relatable. I ended up taking some etizolam to knock myself out later on because I had to work that night. This was by far my best experience with DOC, although I would never consider doing this combo in a social situation. The 3-meo-pcp smoothed out the jitters that I normally get from DOC although I still felt like I couldn't stretch quite enough and there was some low-level energy throughout the entire trip just waiting to be utilized. 


On a side note, for those of you who insufflate 3-meo-pcp, has it had a deleterious effect on your nose? If I snort anything it usually goes up my right nostril, but today I put some up my left, and boy did it hit quick and hard. I also often get some small amount of blood from my right nostril when blowing my nose after putting just about anything up there, but lately nothing much after some regular small bumps of 3-meo-pcp and the high is somewhat lesser. I think it might have fucked something up and I should give it a break and just do oral/sublingual.

I definitely feel like it's not good for my nostrils, it doesn't burn for long, but it does make my nose run and often makes me sneeze, even 2mg bumps.  I have to imagine that it's doing some sort of damage, I'll probably have to start using oral more often. Seems rather caustic, if I hold it in my mouth it feels like it causes a slight burn on my tongue.

I don't feel any burn in the nostrils just an irritation that leads to sneezing and mucous production.

I have a friend who seems to like to plug it pretty much exclusively.  Personally I have not, probably won't bother trying.  Oral is quite good, but I like the stimulation aspect of nasal, and plugging is unlikely to provide that, it should be closer to oral, at least going on how it is for most other drugs.

Yea plugging this one is pretty dissociating. There's been a few times it's left me in strong dissociative general what the fuck ness for a couple of hours before dropping back down into the desired manageable effects.

On the subject of eyeballing, after 50-100 doses I would say one could be qualified to give a well-enough educated guess (if sober), also because at that point there is likely a tolerance that is forgiving of a few milligrams of deviation. Until you get to that level a proper milligram scale is a must, or at least one of those tiny scoops Xorkoth mentioned.

One the subject of ROA, nasal and oral is all I find worthy, but I agree about what other users are saying about snorting- it can't be used as a primary ROA if you use it more than sparsely because even though I haven't experienced nose bleeds on it, I have 2 friends who said they have, at which point I recommended to stick with oral, and frankly it is a more therapeutic effect overall when taken orally. If you are inclined to hedonism don't even consider insufflation- the quicker onset and ensuing stimulation/mania can easily lead to a 'too much of a good thing' situation. Oral is much less stimulating and more of a full-bodied experience.

For sure it's easy to fall into compulsive redosing with snorting, and end in a dark alley. I've got a friend that only uses this ROA and a few times lost the plot because of a dose that wasn't needed at all.


I, myself, when using it snorted, usually redose at least one time, while orally I commit myself to the 8 hours experience without even thinking about a redose. It's more therapeutic for sure, orally I usually end thinking about myself, my future, my present, my past, and addressing some issues, while snorted it's all an hedonistic, creative, social high. That could be of course because of expectations (Taking oral when I want a psychedelic experience, snorting when I want to be more grounded to the floor)

I find that it's more setting-dependent than the other batch, but that by repeated dosing of slightly higher amounts over a night, and with sufficient external input (like social activity, or music), I can reach an absolutely hypomanic and magical/sparkly place that has led to some of the most fun nights in memory.

The batch I have been using is definitely bright white, not sure how fluffy though. I would describe it more as fine. How much do you usually take though? Initial and redose wise? Maybe I just need to find the right amount to take at a time. Otherwise I'm going to slowly keep increasing the amount I ingest from 15mg upwards.

I take 2-3mg, then after an hour or 2, 2-3mg more, repeat until I am where I want to be.  I don't like getting dissociated from this drug usually and this allows me to get the stimulating, euphoric, loosening, hypomanic effects I desire from it.  By the time the night has really gotten going, depending on the frequency of my dosing I will be in one of the most ideal states I can think of for pretty much any activity, immensely social and fearless and full of energy.  I use it like a stimulant, and for that purpose I prefer it to any actual stimulant I know of.  Over the course of a day/night I'll use 15-20mg I'd say, depending.  Sometimes just 5mg even.  I rarely dose above ~3mg at a time, every once in a while I want to get dissociated so I do 5mg bumps instead.  Any more than that and I find the onset of dissociation uncomfortable and offputting.  The same is not true of things like ketamine or MXE, with those I seek the dissociation, just don't care for it much with 3-MeO-PCP.

For sure this one is a better stimulant than any real stimulant, at least for me. Having ADHD stimulants only put me in a sober more focused state of mind, but with 3meo I can get the euphoria people talk about with stims, and that I didn't experienced except for smoked cocaine or meth. I've been refering to 3meow as psychedelic cocaine xP

Thirded, I tried an actual stimulant recently, NEP, and gave the rest of it away after a night. Made me feel good in a way but also felt a tension that 3meo never provides. Pure dopamine releasers are definitely not for me.

Yeah the issue with actual stimulants is that most of them produce sketchy/lossy/comedown feelings at some point, or tension, or underlying anxiety, or jitters.  3-MeO produces none of these but gives that energy, inspiration, euphoria, confidence, etc that you want from stims.  Ie, the perfect stim!

Getting ready to place a nice size order for some 3-MeO this weekend. Been looking forward to trying this disso now for various reasons, and really feel it has the potential to change my mindset/life in general in positive ways similar to how MXE did.

It definitely has the potential - 3-MeO-PCP is a revolutionary drug. Treat it with the utmost respect and it will change everything. Be aware to the change, it can only work as a catalyst, the power is within you.

I'd say we are probably just still too dissociated to really be bothered by jitters but if I pay a little attention imo they are 'present' especially if you have chronic mega tolerance to dissociative activity perhaps, but not the same tolerance to the monoamine activity.

I don't think 3-MeO is really dopaminergic in any way though? Rather serotonergic... but that study often referred to might have screwed things up with the DAT screening. It's likely that similar to regular PCP, there is some unusual DRI activity on the dopamine transporters associated with NMDAr [source](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.850.7256&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

That would mean that 3-MeO is an SDRI.


It's worth noting that dizocilpine does not raise dopamine levels like PCP does, diphenidine type compounds also may not raise dopamine levels - it doesn't seem to give big hints that it does... maybe MXP does tho?

Have anybody of you ever tried to purify this substance? I tried to do an acetone wash, the same way I had successfuly done before with MXE and others... but 3-meo-pcp proved to be too much soluble in acetone, so I lost most of the substance. But the few milligrams left after the wash were much more enjoyable: less mania and more clear-head dissociation.

 So I wonder if it could be washed with some other solvent than acetone.

Yeah my impression of the dissociation of this one is that it feels cold and clinical too, that's why I like low doses.

For me it goes pretty well with weed. Indeed, I normally mix all my dissos with weed, or at low dosages I wouldn't be able to feel much from them. Weed really potentiates the dissociation.

Weed potentiates disso hugely.  So often I dislike weed with them because it makes things too intense.  But with low amounts of dissociation I find they combine well.  Or like with my low-dose regimen of 3-MeO where I never get dissociated, weed is totally fine, it acts normally except maybe a bit stronger which I don't mind since I like weed.

It's really improbable that you would be able to change the duration of a compound by purifying it. The duration of a drug is what it is. 3-MeO-PCP have got some stimulant properties, and the duration of effects can be about 7-8h orally (Snorted I find that sometimes I can fall asleep pretty soon, at +3h if I'm tired).


You are going to still have got troubles sleeping with 99% pure 3-MeO-PCP. What I usually do is combine with some beer, weed, and even put myself to sleep with 1ml of GBL if needed at +4-5h if I need to work the next day. If not, I just enjoy the long effects and comedown, it's lovely.

When I was doing 3meo I was working 3rd shift and I would have a coupled drinks on the ride home, then snort 10mg....smoke a couple of hitters and then make a stuff drink

The morning would be glorious

But the most suprizing part was I'd go to bed at noonish sleep for 4 hours and awake with the most amazing feeling 

If I ever get anymore I am for sure going to try zorcos script...3-4mg bumps every few hours

even when i dose in the morning i have trouble falling asleep in the evening so i no longer even bother to try. its from the nature of the chemical itself not from any impurities which in most cases aren't more than 1 or tops 2% so for a 10mg dose that would be like 100 micrograms (is my math correct lol ? )

I recently received a half gram of this substance to finally cross off my bucket list of dissociatives to try, this was the only one that really really interested me other than MXE.

But it came as a tan powder, has anyone ever had tan 3-MeO-PCP and was it's potency the same?

MSK has good points, and it's not really possible to purify unknown impurities in a targeted way... but if you do, apply a solvent that 3-MeO is insoluble in and just hope that your impurities do dissolve. For the HCl salt of course that would be ether, hexane and perhaps acetone if very cold works as well (assuming properties are similar to those of PCP). I suppose also napththa instead of plain hexane.


More sophisticated ways of purification require knowing the properties by which you separate. But there's always recrystallization of course.


But as argued, you might be basing the idea of impurity on a false premise.

Honestly I've had many batches of 3-MeO, almost all of them were white except for one batch which had a tan/brown tint to it. The tan powder ended up being the best stuff I ever got. YMMV though.

 Thanks Solipsis, MSK and the others.

 The fact is that I noticed a big diference after washing that batch of 3-Meo-PCP (though I lost 80% of it becuse of its unexpected solubility in acetone). It is not exactly about duration, but more about avoiding over-stimulation and excess of mania, so I could sleep better the same day. But I really don't know what the impurities were. The idea of washing it came after some discussion in a spanish forum about the possible impurities in the synthesis of this kind of substances. Someone pointed that a common impurity was active in micro-grams and it was responsible of excess stimulation and mania. If I remember well, it was speculated to have similar structure to MDVP and similar substances.


I also did the acetone wash with O-PCE with even more awesome results, converting the substance from shit to a jewel, and without much loss of material this time.

Finally, I also did an acetone wash with DCK, but in this case I didn't notice any diference.


 So my renewed interest in this issue is beacuse I am waiting for a new order of 3-Meo-PCP and maybe I decide to wash it again. In this case maybe I will follow Solipsis advice of using cold acetone... at least with part of it to minimize the loss.

Don't throw away the acetone if you do that (also make sure you work quickly as the acetone warms up fast), in case a lot still does dissolve - then you can just recover it.


It would be much appreciated by a lot of people here if you had the info of the spanish forum, I'm sure... because there is interest in the manic side effect (which by the way cannot be completely eliminated because substances like PCP have stimulant monoaminergic activity themselves), we're curious what this supposed impurity is, at least I am.


Some people here would kill to swap their less manic 3-MeO with you ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Well, the forum was cannabis cafe, but not in the public area (where I have not entered in a long time because it is a mess like MSK points), but in a private sub-group. That is also the reason why I cannot place a direct link to that discussion.

 But the discussion itself referenced another thread here in Bluelight:


[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads...y-of-a-major-methoxetamine-synthesis-impurity](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/643419-Possible-CNS-activity-of-a-major-methoxetamine-synthesis-impurity)


so it is something that many of you may know from time ago.

And the impurity we were talking about is mentioned in the last page of this DEA report:


[https://www.dea.gov/pr/microgram-journals/2012/mj9-1_3-17.pdf](https://www.dea.gov/pr/microgram-journals/2012/mj9-1_3-17.pdf)

Wow, that compound does indeed look like it *could* be some kind of DRI, I wonder if there's literature on it. I'll check latter. Could certainly solve the mistery of the qualitative variance between ACHAs batches  - **But**,  I think it is unlikely that it would be active in microgram doses, so unless we are getting pretty fucking impure batches, then I don't think it would be active, even if it does have CNS activity, in the quantities found in your typical 3-MeO-PCP dose.

That is about MXE which follows a different synthesis pathway. The precursor to PCP is PCC and so should it be the precursor for the 3- and 4-MeO analogues - just a different Grignard reagent. It's active but certainly not in the microgram range iirc. Couldn't say if a little bit of it could be responsible for the presence or lack of hypomania.

A stimulant that would be active in the microgram range would probably kill people because the difference between a slightly terrible synth and a really terrible synth would then be a truly massive overdose of that compound. OK maybe you don't know for sure it kills people but mania and hypomania would be the least of your worries?


I thought maybe you were referencing a side-product but the grignard seems pretty selective. It's the difference between a primary (even aromatic) nitrile and a non-aromatic tertiary one.


PCC remains the major concern for PCP and close analogues, it's really not safe to leave unreacted.

Yeah, I was thinking about that - A stimulant active enough in the microgram range to feel it when taking low doses of MXE would have killed people with tolerance trying to hole. Seems unlikely.

Yeah, I suppose you can do a 10+ x dose of some stims and be okay but I would think that if 1 dose is noticeable, 10+ would be beyond mania or whatever you consider a sideeffect of your 3-MeO, it would be stim pandemonia most likely. With SRIs or SDRI's involved it can be hold even less accountable.

Are there any known differences between the fluffy white powder, and the salt-like crystals of this substance? Is one the HBr and the other the HCl? I still have some of the former, but I am receiving a sample of the salt-like batch this week.


Also, has anyone had success vaporizing this compound? I know this has been asked before, but searching through the archives just confused me. I know it's a misnomer that only freebase chemicals can be smoked (take methamphetamine HCl for example), but I have very little background knowledge on the chemistry of piperidines.

It appears substances like PCP are pyrolyzed way too much if you try to smoke / vape it so it sems so lossy that you'd have to convert it to freebase. PCE-based compounds should be vapable in salt form though.


I actually don't even know if it's appropriate to smoke these PCP compounds as freebase. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6852274](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6852274) 40% may be absorbed as PCP and 60% turns into more or less toxic compounds, some also active but less so. [https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+6472](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+6472)


I doubt the 3-MeO added onto PCP helps with anything here. It increases the molecular weight so it likely requires more energy to vaporize, and it is no particular benefit to stability afaik.


Careful with the batch / ID discussion please. No conclusive info should be expected from comparing notes on appearance of your powder or crystals.

First experience with this substance, really overdid the dosing (don't eyeball this shit) and had a pretty manic episode, all the post-exam stress probably didn't help.

Honestly this substance frightened me, and it's not often I feel the need to say that

This is definitely not one to eyeball when first testing the waters. Use a carefully measured dose! I also was not enamored with 3-meo-pcp at first, but I had a gram and a lot of free time. I eventually came to love it. I think you have to build a relationship with this drug to get the most out of it. Just be careful and don't go overboard!

I just wrote this in PD social, but I feel it fit here in this Big and Dandy-


3meo is back in my head, and I couldn't be more appreciative of it. I look forward to the coming days and years in which it is utilized as a tool in both therapeutic and creative capacities. It is a multi-tool, I call it. When it becomes integrated, elegantly, into the fabric of one's life, the full spectrum of its potential begins to awaken. After so many cycles, I like to think I have become intimately entangled with its powers, and the experience compounds on itself. I remember years ago, when I was using it while editing my 45-minute music video 'Serendipity' (available on archive.org and vimeo.com), I saw the first glimpses of its potential to streamline creative processes, and its ability to see beyond the box. As psychospiritual and creative technologies continue to evolve and unify, from a mess of chaos into a divine manifestation of order, I see 3meo as an integral and formidable tool for the ages.

You are really positive! My believe is that in the coming years 3-MeO-PCP will be banned as was MXE, because of its great potential and popularity. It's currently in the process of beeing as popular as MXE was, and with a compound as potent as this, I can only see kids overdosing and dying from combining it with a shitload of otter drugs.


BTW I didn't know you was into music production and video editing! Could you please PM the link to the video?

So……. Well let's just say I have a suicide problem when something real bad happens….. or whatever it was. I turned into a SUPER IV ADDICT of 3-meo-pcp and DCK with some hash.


I feel like I rebooted, but I lost TONS of old memories. I high dosed DCK and 3-meo over the course of however long my brain… What happened to my brain? I feel like I'm fucked.


I had multiple trips to the ER. I had a schizophrenic friend in my life who controlled me just recently during my binge.


Long story short, I played with the dose a little, volumetrically. I knew what I was doing...


I ended up having some major retardation effects. I holed on 3-meo HARDCORE. I think about 100mg's IV over the course of 5 maybe 10 or 15 minutes looking for a manic rush… I made it to the floor and TRAVELLED. I came out of it retarded. TONS of bad thing kept happening and I destroyed my brain with some kind of DCK IV addiction and 3-meo-pcp and some super high doses I would dose and forget and still try chasing something that didn't exist. Like I was trying to destroy myself instead of using it to heal. I became INSANE with wanting to stay buzzed high fucked up beyond belief accident, opening apartment door to a knock during a dose and going to ER and just NO MEMORY...


I last fried my brain Tuesday with a manic dose with hash.


I understood how I needed a relationship with this chemical, like LSD or even weed… I had a REAL fuck up. I get that PLEASE hello nobody sits there and abuses drugs like that without some kind of FUCK UP.


Last time I used this drug I got offered a promotion nine days into some use.


What happened to my brain? I feel confused as fuck and have. It was SO BAD at some points. This may have gone on for a few weeks I have no idea. I can't remember A LOT. I feel super ADD… My brain has just… I know it's only been some time.. Clearly I have an underlying drug problem but damn I just wanted a "cleaner" IV high I didn't want to eat it! What the fuck….


So yeah. Brain is heavily destroyed. What kind of damage is that? I feel very confused and ADD. I was doing great until I ate a bunch of wheat last night which fucks with me… I mean doing great as in I had a handle on my life again for sometime after last dose.


Maybe it's wearing out… but I feel like I dropped so many IQ points. I became suicidal, you wouldn't believe how I did my last dose… insane way to get residue and 5 separate ml shots.


Something happened that made me suicidal and my first trip got ruined by a girl who turned pretty schizo and manic. It's a long story… The entire goal WAS HEALING and I ended up going nuts on DCK and plenty of 3-meo-pcp.


I had pcp retardation at points, like a 4 year old with down syndrome….


I was doing a valium taper with pharmacist, med student, doctor, all kinds of meetings, I mean every day for at first, for the last month and THE last two weeks of that had been awesome with a 25% dose reduction at week three. Doctor said I'd been on over 100mg's diazepam if it wasn't for the intuniv I have been on(4mg's). I was doing pretty damn great until this friend took me to the ER and turned actual schizo and did a lot of things that really hurt me. I mean the police were involved and all sorts of things ON MY END TRYING TO GET MY STUFF BACK LIKE MY KEYS.


I'm telling you, this drug helped. My life is forever changed and this person HURT THE FUCK OUT OF ME but...


What happened to my brain? I feel like I'm fucked.


To Vortech above, I've had those thoughts since I first started studying Jason Silva and the technological singularity and Joe Rogan and stuff like that… Super futurist fan of technology and my history of drugs and medical literature obsession and being in the RC seen...

I don't have any more drugs and my plans are to stay sober from everything for awhile….


Did I do anything specific to my brain with the "pcp retardation" effects?


I mean, will healthy eating and exercise, increasing BDNF…. be enough or am I looking at long term symptoms like from cold turkey benzos…..

^3Meo, i'm thinking you should be alright. I went on many binges with this compound, every day for a month at a time, and I always heal up fine. You're probably in for about thirty to sixty days of fuzzy memory, short as shit attention span, dips into alternate states of hypomania/depression and possibly some lingering psychosis. I don't know if you have all the symptoms I always got when I used to do extended binges but they were only frightening the first time around and the subsequent times I knew they would end so they were just mainly annoying, so keep your head up! You talk mainly about the feelings of being intellectually compromised and having ADD type symptoms and for me I had those too but the psychosis was the major symptom for me, so be glad that isn't bombarding you too! I hope the fact that it's temporary will give you some peace of mind too! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


This stuff is really great, it has amazing healing potential, you just have to pace yourself and not over-indulge; it has an alternate face like opposing sides of a coin, though, and if you have too much of such a great thing it will force you to respect it. I learned my lesson from my overuse and now I only use it in the same context as something like mushrooms or LSD, to improve my life and cultivate a happier and more tuned psyche. It is more versatile than psychedelics are so it is easy to go overboard with it because its got more to it than a mindblowing trip; it has so many different shades. I will still use it at low doses when I need my mind tuned up just a little bit and higher doses when I need the full dissociative overhaul, but i'll never again abuse it.

hey 3meo. good call on chilling out for a while. I don't believe there are any dangerous withdrawal effects to worry about. you will probably just start feeling more and more on solid ground each day. I wouldn't go looking for supplements or nootropics for recovery, that can be a slippery slope and just re-engage the compulsions you're trying to quiet.


in my experience the first few days coming out of a disso binge you may think you're closer to normal than you really are.


someone gave me good advice once, a good antidote to dissasociatives is to get "associative" I.e. engage with family and friends, connect with the concrete  reality around you. 


you're gonna be ok, don't be scared.

Risks were listed for PCP earlier in this thread and should also apply to 3-MeO-PCP.


Dissociatives can have quite some effect on cognition, part of which can take months to reverse or more if you overdo it. Psychosis, anxiety or depression may be possibilities.


Doubtful if nootropics ever made me get into drugs more. But in my opinion 3-MeO-PCP is not something to abuse, even for abuse standards. As for recovery, it takes time but also a commitment to only use with moderation, and if that isn't a real option for you (which is what it sounds like, ive been there many of us have), abstinence. Took me a while to figure out what is and isn't worth it for my health and what to just cut out and how many positive things I want to be doing before any drug use is permitted.


I may do a little at some point in the next week..

So the story really follows quite well until a friend went into psychosis/schizo effects by not eating or sleeping for about two weeks that well. This person was my ABSOLUTE best friend and we had plans of dosing it properly and all volumetrically prepared with syringes and IM syringes and oral tests, allergy tests.


Oh and onto the beginning of the use… I was so god damned careful with the dosage trying it out…. Then I went for a big dose days later which was JUST FINE until that schizo friend sent me to the hospital thinking I NEEDED to go because I needed a psych ward for three days. I had to use the cops to get my keys when the hospital let me go WITHIN THREE HOURS. I told them I knew what I was doing, I could talk about the NDMA receptor and all kinds of stuff it was fine… This friend blocked me while I'm in the ER at 3:30 AM telling me I need jesus, she had already been telling me about the messages she hears from the radio and TV. This person was trying to control me and get me on a three day hold or something. It was real fucked up. I can't remember everything that happened the right way, even the beginning of the use is confusing because I remember trying low doses just to gauge effects and what not. I remember being fine for days until… something and that girl.


It's hard to piece together what happened exactly.. the timeline and everything…


This person had a lot of issues going on but to make a long story short she kind of fucked me over real hard…. Completely left me as a best friend after going out on a date with a girl, and she hadn't been with a girl in years and other things… Basically I got suicidal and had the drugs on hand… I ended up having to go through A TON OF STRESS to get my belongings back and another person who had been in my life started staying with me.


So I ended up with a bunch of DCK and 3-meo and went on some huge binge for however long it lasted… Maybe two weeks… Maybe four.


I stayed high as shit on DCK and 3-meo fluctuating between addiction, being suicidal, being over stressed, feeling HEAVILY fucked over...


I last used tuesday and felt great until I ate a bunch of wheat christmas eve. Cannabis seemed to be helping until the wheat.. I must have still been high.


So I want to quit every thing and just deal with it.. I'm so glad for the replies though. They REALLY help. I'm very ADD feeling and everything that was said was so relevant.


So I'm just gonna have to deal with the symptoms, not treat them with anything? Not even magnesium malate? I was JUST using this prior to the 3-meo incident with great success for feelings of anxiety and ADD. I have a real anxiety problem and it was getting better. There's something about magnesium and calcium levels and ADD.


All I know now is that I REALLY want to achieve baseline with healthy eating and exercise. I've been into conscious eating for a long time now and it's the only way I feel good. I get actual symptoms from foods like peanut butter and wheat and so many other things.


Anyways… Are you guys sure there is nothing worth taking for helping my brain heal quicker? I know bacopa could be messy. Lions mane some other memory enhancers like PRL-8-53 or something that makes sense with positive reviews. Magnesium makes a lot of sense with ADD people, especially with anxiety. The doctor already prescribed magnesium oxide which I haven't even taken because…  Well I'm sure you know. And those binders and fillers…


I want to try something simple that heals the brain… Lions mane, some of the russian stuff. I know this isn't the right thread to ask these questions, but you guys helped tremendously so far.


3-meo changed my life for the better every time I used it until this time. I figured out quickly how it's a molecule that needs respected and that you start to get to know it because it's so subtle...


I'm going to have to say goodbye to drugs, aren't I? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I had a friend that overdosed on 3meo and was fucked up for a couple weeks.  He said when he looked at someone talking to him he would just like catch the end of their sentence and "missed the rest of it.  Or if someone was talking to him all he would see is a part before they were making eye contanct and not the part wherre they looked.


he said it stopped after a week or two.

Fuck.

It kinda bugs me seeing this stuff become the flavour-of-the-month chem.

People that dose recklessly (not aimed at anyone specifically - just mean that generally) would be better off not being able to get it so easily, in an ideal world.

I mean, a lot of people seem to agree it's special stuff - that deserves *massive* respect.


I don't think it's been said enough in this discussion lately - **do not eyeball 3-meo-pcp**

You're right. It seems that the 3meow lovers that are usually arround here (myself included) are in general semi-responsible adults with massive disso tolerance and experience. Most of the time we are talking about our huge dosages, our eyeballing and the huge devotion we have got with the substance (Nearly deifying it) without talking about the harm reduction, and that can lead to some bad times if an inexperienced user read us and thinks that our behaviour patterns are normal. They are not.


This is not ketamine, this is not MXE. Start as low as 1-5mg for your first trials with the substance, and titrate up your dose very slowly. 3-MeO-PCP lingers a lot on the body, and it was the cause of some psychotic episodes that ended on the hospital or the psych ward.


This is not a substance to take daily, and it can be really addictive. Treat with a lot of caution and respect. It deserves even more respect than DMT IMHO.

"He said when he looked at someone talking to him he would just like catch the end of their sentence and "missed the rest of it."


Exactly what's happening to me… Okay it'll go away. Wonder if I try noopept anyways. I'll keep updating with my progress to baseline. I was terrified of permanent brain damage.


Remember back in the day when it wasn't all over reddit?!?! Even in 2012 I was part of private forums with just 20 members or some that were bigger.


It really is too "out there" now. This drug is GLORIFIED and although in the past it has been life changing, this binge was just RETARDED. My last uses of this drug lead to a job promotion with no negative after effects, and a great trip with cannabis that allowed me to deconstruct my life and so much more. Prior to this binge I had used the drug less than 30 times but really got a feel for it's subtleness…. I can't believe I fucked myself up because a girl and being suicidal….


I even treat weed like LSD most of the time(set and setting and having plans for hours and aligning "energy" before dosing even if it takes days)...


Lesson well learned. I will get better!


Love you guys though.. Love the insights of reading here. Maybe in a year I'll try this, maybe not. I don't really care about anything but getting my intelligence back and nootropics at the moment. Health and consciousness, meditation.


When I holed on this stuff I went somewhere.. I could write about it… It was INTENSE. The binge left me with a lot of insight and a strong will to live and do the right thing.


I could start to go to NA meetings for some kind of drug problem, or I could continue to talk and read and connect and follow the advice already given.


I think the scene NEEDS A BIG CHANGE. I left the scene for a couple years and came back in august TO REDDIT… What a joke! Too many people are buying cheap grams of 3-meo and other drugs and there are all kinds of reports of "I didn't buy a $40 scale".


I made volumetric solutions and had syringes for perfect dosing oral or not and still made mistakes. We gotta change the scene!! I've been thinking that for a long time now. We need to promote more than harm reduction. People are going to make mistakes and do what they want and barely read before taking a drug.


Even spending months and reading all the info on 3-meo, somebody could still make a mistake because of the drugs effects, such as redosing or daily dosing even though they had no plans to.


What is the solution? Who knows, but I think it'd be great to own a company that does CoA's, NMR's, GC/MS testing for the community. Selling reagents and scales, everything needed for a person who is researching NOOTROPICS since the goal of the company could not be to help out the RC community most likely.


Hope I'm not going too off topic or anything for this thread. I'm really considering ordering noopept from a great website with CoA. What if a 56 day run after this binge leads to me a place of massive healing?


I had a three month binge multiple drugs, ended up with sobriety and a plan to heal with 3-meo or DCK. Turned out to be a disaster. Just want to heal and avoid narcotics or highs, just heal!!!

3meo, why not leave the noots alone as long as you're getting better? you're coming from such a low point, your brain  will do a lot on its own with just rest and exercise. noopept is kind of inconsistent in how it affects people. some report that it gives them short-term memory issues and word retrieval problems.


let each simple step be in the right direction

Thank you.


I wanted to update with… I was pretty shaky and whatever else was going on. I felt like I couldn't go outside… I have things I need to do.


I did a plug with magnesium chloride oil and diluted with water, and then proceed with some sprays after the shower. About 550mg elemental magnesium… This is what I was using twice per day on a regular schedule during the valium taper and it appeared to help a lot. With the pharmacist and med student I was meeting with daily, I don't know, I have studied pharmacology enough that I can usually say something relevant but damn am I fried.


I started feeling much better and decided that lithium orotate has helped me in the past tremendously when used acutely. I believe it's something that doesn't need dosed every day btw, and I will tell the doctor that Wednesday.. And tell him about the magnesium… 


I feel functional. I can think and I have been doing things that make sense and the ADD effect is down. The magnesium started to help with everything and the lithium topped it off. I hope the lithium stays in me for long enough that I am able to go outside tomorrow and do what I need to do. I couldn't do it today, I was SO ANXIOUS until now. Now it's too late to go to where I wanted but I can go tomorrow. Thank god I see my doc wednesday and I can grab what I need to for that appointment for him to fill out.


I think magnesium could help, along with all the other steps in the right direction. Just leave it at that, no nootropic is going to help. No drug use will either. I could smoke weed if I wanted but… is it really going to help? Maybe on occasion to tweak my perception but travel can do that as well...


The doctor may or may not want to do something about the racing thoughts. The lithium appeared to work. I can't go on for weeks or months unable to live. I'm going to update maybe in a week or two? Should I even bother?


So rest and exercise… I should just tough it out and tell the doctor… I mean he may want to prescribe something if I'm all shaky and nervous and can't focus. He may not.


I appreciate the feedback, it helps me stay grounded and there is nobody else to talk to about 3-meo abuse, there was the DCK too… So return to baseline with food, exercise, rest, and every step be in the right direction. I was already going to groups and all kinds of stuff.


I think I'll try to relax and just… damn. I hope my comments help somebody out. I know I've read about certain drugs on forums with posts like mine and it showed me "clearly you do not want to abuse that". Obviously like I said before, I got suicidal and tons of stressors came up. I became an instant IV addict with both molecules and stayed suicidal or got happy and crashed. Whatever happened…


RESPECT it like everyone says. Respect anything… we all know what we need to do in life in every second, we often don't listen. I mean really in a lot of places of my life I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO almost all the time. Like eating certain foods, not hanging out with certain people, being real quick with certain people because I live in a downtown.


Alright time to find a CBT therapist or some kind of support group while I am having major confusion, memory problems, forgetting what people are talking about while they are talking. I mean it's beyond ADD and short term memory loss.


I pray for you homeostasis!! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Perhaps after the doctor or a couple weeks I can make a brief post that is more tl;dr and maybe it'll help somebody. Maybe I'll come back with "groups, meditation, healthy eating, and forcing myself to do things and write things down to stay grounded"


Alright, LATER!

Well, I finally got my hands on the old tan batch again.  Hypomania city!  Hooray!  The effects of the two batches are absolutely different, no possible way I am deluding myself.  I have both now and I use one or the other for its own range of effects.


Glad I have this old batch again now, I really like the tiny bumps all day to produce a reliable state of hypomania.  Gonna be great for band practice in a bit. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm not too sure about acute usage of lithium: as I recall it can do some very strange things to sodium excretion/the kindeys if misused. Part of why it's dosed regularly when used theraputically is to avoid a peak-and-trough effect and maintain a reasonably steady blood level.

Is it also more difficult to monitor the levels when you take lithium acutely or intermittently? I thought it was very important to monitor those levels because of small therapeutic index?


I have some 3-MeO which is supposed to be non-manic, but I haven't taken it in a while and that makes me less certain of it. Someone should probably submit for testing who's confident of the kind of batch. Maybe if i revisit.

Cheers to the magical molecule that is 3-meo-pcp, it has helped me get off of opiates for good this time, no more relapse cycles, I've done it two many times. 3meo is such a pure inner light, a great tuning tool for rediscovering life after so many years dulled by opiate maintenance.

Congrats, how so? How did it help / how is it different? I did use some after I got off opiates for PAWS, during withdrawals I only tried low dose DXM which alleviated things a little.

Solipsis, bro, the inner light is so much more pure without sticky opiate in my brain, I don't really know how to say it, it is more of a feeling and a sense, smell, synthesis of something magic (that which can not be explained with current science)

Only think that works with me is having two different stashes: One for my dissos, one for everything else. I can have got access to everything that is not a disso and control myself pretty well, but with my disso stash I can't. So since three months or so, I gave my disso stash to my flatmate, and asked him to hide it far away from home, and only give me a monthly dose.

I have been playing with this gem for a while now and thought i should post up some of my experiences.


I have had  a lot of wierd experiences with higher end dosing and feel i should first warn people that my intention isnt to glamourise this substance.


i rececently recieved some white, almost fine ground salt like consitency 3-meo-pcp.


at first i thought this stuff was fairly predictable in effects but i swear almost everytime ive played around i have hit a different high.


i have had the reasonably dissociated 15-20mg effects that inspire 'mania' were i think my idea/invention/story is going to save the world/make me millions of dollars/ improve my life for the better, that leaves me super stimulated and a little dissapointed that i didnt just get that little bit more dissociated.


btw anyone with experience with this stuff will understand what im talking about in this post, the effects of this substance are really hard to put into words, im just feeling the words right now and seperating them into seperate paragraphs.


i dosed really high and had a bad night a few days ago, about 50-60mg, snorted and oral, a little at a time, i could feel the dissosiation in the background but the stimulant and mania effects were highly pronounced, which left to all thhe good feelings kinda being shadowed. after about 5 hours i got that mxe kinda feeling were you think you can see through your eyelids or a photographic memory type thing. it got more pronounced and very vivid and lucid, to the extreme that everytime i closed my eyes my eyelids were, in effect, pretty much a projection screen for this vivid, lucid imagery...super crazy cinemagraphic imagery just appeared within seconds of closing my eyes. i had to work the next day and needed sleep so it was almost dysphoric because i just couldnt shut my mind down.


my latest experince was pretty much hole territory. i started doing 5mg lines and after 20mg it felt like i was snorting icing sugar, i guess my brain was in rewards mode (this also happened every now and then with mxe, sometimes i dosed orally and it tasted like sugar, **I'm pretty convnivced our brains really like dissociative drugs**). i ended up dosing about 35mg over around 5 hours. it was super euphoric, i was so dissociatied i felt like a wieghtless floationg boulder (i really love the way dissociative drugs fuck with your spacial awareness) i was in a hole for sure. but heres where it got bizzare, it felt like the slow titration of my dosing left my body completely flooded with 3-meo-pcp. pretty much i dosed the 20mg and after that every hour i did a 5mg bump which just put me right back into the hole, i only had 3-4 more bumps so 35mg is a guess. Back to my body being flooded with this stuff, after about six houirs i drunk a 500ml bottle of cold water and that put me back into the hole. and for another two hours after that, everytime i i had a smoke, it ended in me being laid out on the floor in my highly dissociated state, almost like just consuming anything flooded my nmda receptors. i slept for a bit and went out to do stuff the next day, i grabbed a coffee and had a smoke, i had to head back home cause it had me all fucked up again. really really strange peoples.


when i got home i thought i should post my strange last couple of weeks here on bluelight while im feeling  in the mood to type my story. im gonna probably have a good giggle at this post in a few days when my brain feels slightly less like 3-meo-pcp-jelly.

Happy New Year all! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I have a day to myself with no pressing responsibilities in the immediate future and a week off to think about my plans for 2017 and decided to make this a 3-MeO-PCP day.


Unfortunately my trusty milligram scale which has served me well over the past 4/5 years or so has just started to fail, nonetheless I decided to press on with my malfunctioning equipment as best as possible, using some test weights to calculate the apparent disparity in the displayed value to the true weight. Once I was satisfied I had a reasonably accurate and reproducible measure of the deficiency, I measured my dosages each 10 times, resetting and recalibrating the scale between each measurement until I believed I had things weighed to a pretty high accuracy.


Anyway I have dosed 7~8mg 90 minutes ago. 60 minutes later (30 minutes ago) I dosed another 9mg bringing my total dose over the last 2 hours to probably 16-17mg.


Confounding factors are that over 24 hours from December 31st to January 1st around 9 PM I probably consumed 1500mg of Ketamine - I use arylcyclohexylamines very rarely however so have no long term tolerance as such (although perhaps I have a lingering acute tolerance from my very recent session). Additionally I used NA-Selank approximately 38 hours ago as a dissociative antidote to enable me to attend a last minute NYE event, which I know does have a long half life and may be a complicating factor. Perhaps unwisely, I did dose 1mg Xanax at T-4 hours also for no real reason other than to make the morning a bit more fun. I have no benzo tolerance but a seemingly naturally high tolerance to the amnesiac effects of benzodiazepines and GABA agonists.


Anyway what gives? I am hesitant to redose with my malfunctioning equipment and the apparent risk of psychosis at 20mg+ doses. I think I have a reasonably robust method to manage any abberant indicators of encroaching psychosis and last dose was about an hour ago. Feel like I might be getting some first alerts but nothing too tangible so not really sure how best to proceed. Might be best to just wait another hour or so and if not then try again tomorrow. Any input would be appreciated. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Volumetric dosing my friend. Weigh a large amount and put it in something alcoholic to keep it sterile, I use vodka. 3mg per ml works super well for me. An oral syringe to measure dose and you're golden.

Yeahhh, I know that would be the ideal way, am just being lazy about it as don't have a suitable container or sterile solution at the moment. Fortunately I think my somewhat questionable process of extracting accurate measurements from my dying scales seemed to be, subjectively, not too far off the mark.


Anyway I have to say at T+4hr 40min from my last dose this a very bizarre substance and not what I was expecting at all. I think that I do like it but I don't even feel especially like I am on a drug. I just got back from a walk around the streets even though it is both dark and freezing at the moment outside and I usually am pretty strict about my rule about not going outside if I am alone and experimenting with a new substance, but I judged I'd be OK to do so. I just thought about stuff but honestly I can't even put my finger on where my mood is right now. I think I feel good and I think this would definitely be a pro-social drug, but equally there wasn't the same social pressure and subsequent anxious boredom like there would be from doing cocaine or a classic stimulant type drug alone.


I don't actually even know if I am at baseline or not. I am debating redosing 15mg and seeing how that goes. I had zero feelings of impending psychosis or mania which I do get on other arylcyclohexylamines (well, I use the term loosely in this sense because I have never felt in actual danger of losing my mind but I can definitely identify strange thought patterns), coming up or down from heavy K doses alone I can catch myself thinking that other people are with me, asking me to do stuff, or I'm waiting for them to do stuff, and that I've got to do some stupid shit or other, usually I just spend 20-30 minutes doing menial pointless shit moving around my flat switching lights on and off having forgotten what the hell I was trying to do walking around in the first place, or accidentally turning the light off in the bathroom at night and then spending 10 minutes thinking about where I am and what's happening... I digress but anyway I got none of this on 3-MeO-PCP which is contrary to my expectations given the apparently increased propensity to induce psychosis and manic thought patterns. An interesting substance indeed.

Be careful with that rabbit hole. Peek inside but don't tumble down. Add a max of 10mg if feeling adventurous.

Thanks for the advice, actually 10mg would probably have been more sensible in retrospect.


Apologies all, I don't intend to keep using this thread as some kind of running commentary/blog but I will just share my final experience of yesterday evening.


It does seem like 15mg for me is when things started to get weird. I was having a conversation over text with a friend of mine about our ambitions for the future, and fortunately what I was actually saying wasn't anything too weird but I remember my thought process and it was definitely starting to border on mania with some delusions of grandiosity about how I was going to change the world... despite the fact I was typing on an onscreen predictive text smartphone keyboard, which with K would quickly become incomprehensible and result in messages littered with spelling mistakes and nonsensical autocorrected word substitutions, it was like I couldn't get my ideas out fast enough but was still able to type with perfect accuracy using language with perfect clarity. I keep comparing this substance to K because it's really my only reference point but it really does strike me that this substance could not be more different to it's chemical cousin.


Anyway at about T+2 hours I distinctly remember the experience took a sudden and unexpected turn... suddenly I couldn't remember how to spell a word, I literally stopped what I was doing mid-sentence and the fact that I couldn't do this seemed to take on a huge significance. Over the next 20 minutes to half an hour (I know this from reading back my strange mid-sentence break in the conversation) I remember feeling distinctly uncomfortable and different, I could hear an incessant loud whine, almost like an alarm, like the characteristic otherworldly buzz of K turned up several frequencies and massively amplified.


I remember feeling like I was observing my own self-awareness, but also feeling very strongly that this sense of self awareness was not actually myself... like I was a being that had suddenly gained awareness of it's own sentience, and was able to observe the feeling that previously I had believed to constitute self-awareness... I remember thinking something like "if this (or that) is not me, then what am I?" ...or something along those lines, it's very hard to actually properly convey the feeling but I believe it was still a verbal thought (as in, spoken in my own internal monologue rather than a feeling alone).


This was a hugely bizarre sensation, and like nothing I have ever experienced before. I guess this is what would be called true "dissociation" but it's not something I've ever felt, at least not so acutely and in this way, on any other dissociative or indeed any other drug. It was not a pleasant sensation and did have quite a sinister tone to it, although I cannot put my finger on exactly why this is. I remember thinking also "so THIS is what psychosis feels like", although in retrospect this was almost certainly because of all the warnings I had read about 3-MeO-PCP's propensity to induce psychosis, so I don't know if this is actually what psychosis would feel like... anyway for reasons I am not exactly sure about, except perhaps an awareness that I was in a very atypical and uncomfortable state of mind I went digging in my drug stash for a 2mg bar of alprazolam, I broke it in half intending to take 1 mg, but then thought better of it and just set it on the table in front of me, and just made myself sit down in silent contemplation.


I couldn't say exactly what happened or what I was thinking after that but the feeling gradually subsided and I gradually came back to myself somewhat and tried to sleep a little later... I remember lying there feeling quite blank, buzzed and with occasional rushes of just maniacal happiness about nothing in particular.


Just as a brief addendum, at T+4.5 hours I unwisely decided to take 20mg zolpidem as it was late and I couldn't actually sleep (I don't usually have this many pharmaceuticals just lying around, I just happened to recently acquire a few things I have always been curious about).


This is something I will most definitely not do again but I ended up having a very bizarre but I believe mercifully brief trip where all the furniture in my room was moving around on it's own accord, or being moved by some faceless nameless entities. I don't know when this was, but I have a memory of overturning my coffee table, knocking a bunch of stuff on the floor, at which point I actually asked the entities, I believe out loud, to stop doing this and to please put everything back to how it was. Obviously they did not respond or do as I had asked, and I believe I realised at this point that obviously it was actually just myself moving things (possibly just the one aforementioned coffee table in a misguided effort to stop or undo the other imagined movements) so I sorted things out as best I could and finally stumbled into bed.

3-MeO-PCP is weird in that you're really not quite aware of how altered you are.  I've had many instances where I felt like I wasn't on a drug at all, or just a bit, but in retrospect my behavior was altered quite significantly.  Definitely need to be careful with it.


The other night I decided to take about 5mg of 3-MeO-PCE at the same time as 3mg of 3-MeO-PCP, and then I smoked 2 hits of strong weed (after not having been smoking more than twice a week for a few weeks).  For a couple of hours things for really intense, I was nearly panicking at times.  I had intended on reading my book for a few hours but instead I spent 3 and a half hours reading posts in here, found some really interesting stuff in some threads people brought back to life that I had never seen, but it took me so long to do so.  Pretty weird mind state, it was a reminder to me of how much marijuana potentiates dissos.

That's interesting, I remember thinking yesterday I wonder how this substance would combine with weed. At the time although I didn't have any I thought it might be quite fun, but actually I think now it might not be very fun at all. I combined MXE with weed a few years ago, twice, with low doses of both, and both times it produced a very unpleasant feeling of impending doom. Actually MXE for me is quite unpleasant anyway and I am prone to anxiety on weed so in retrospect it is maybe not too surprising that this would be the case...


I can see what you mean about 3-MeO-PCP being altering in a way that you are not actually aware of it. I would love to experiment with it in a social setting as it does seem like it would be highly pro-social, but obviously this is something to bear in mind. I am very curious if low doses would even be nootropic and would like to try using it on a normal day, for example at work, but I will probably not actually do this for the same aforementioned reasons. I have read reports of people using MXE in this manner which previously to me was incomprehensible but after my experience with 3-MeO-PCP I guess I can see why people would try it if they don't experience the same fear-stricken confusion that even low doses of MXE gives me.

Yeah I find 3-MeO-PCP to be extremely pro-social.  I actually use it more like a stimulant than a dissociative, I like taking multiple consecutive tiny doses (2-3mg) nasally, it builds up this great hypomanic, inspirational, lightly stimulated state with none of the downsides of actual stimulants.  To me this is where it really shines.  If I take very low doses like this, there is no intoxication or dissociation, I can function perfectly normally but with the aforementioned enhancements present.


Occasionally I take larger doses but I find other dissos better for that.

Still weirded out by my current batch and/or tolerance. 


Went to a warehouse show on Friday, took ~22mg 3-MeO a couple hours before leaving so I would really feel it when I got there. And I did feel it, subtly. You'd think at that dose I'd be manic out of my mind, but I was just enjoying hooping (maybe I enjoyed the crowd's attention a little more than usual?) and chatting with my friends. It wasn't until I did a bump of DCK that I felt really dissociated. I was super spun for about 1.5-2hrs of the show, during Crystal Castles' set - so it was quite intense. Give their music a listen and you'll understand ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) but then for the headliner I evened out substantially. I returned to a feeling of a kind of heightened sobriety? Or maybe stimulation is a simpler way to put it? 

Then on the commute back home I kept demanding $1 pizza, so maybe there was still some mania there ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


Maybe that infamous dissociative tolerance is finally settling in for me. I keep trying to get back to the experience where I took ~12mg of 3-MeO (same batch as the one I currently have) and it basically felt like a speedy roll. I'm also wondering if a new batch would have better results.

I honestly don't understand how you guys are taking 12mg+ doses and not being dissociated out of your minds. Maybe it's because it was in the beginning of my use with it, but the 2-3 times I got past the 10mg point I've been very, very dissociated and reached the uncomfortable state of blankness, even one time feeling the sinister-ness described above, and feeling like I was fighting for my life against an evil entity attaching itself to me.

Yeah that's how I feel about it too, I dislike high doses of it, I find them uncomfortable and highly dissociating but in a weird way.  I've had months where I took it the vast majority of days, in consecutive low doses like I described, and I honestly feel like my tolerance hasn't gone up at all.  Still taking the same dosages as before.

15 mgs is my absolute max with this one. My current pattern of use is two 7 mg doses divided by a couple of hours appart, to get a nice dissociated stimulation, or (pretty rarely though) a single 12 mg dose with some cannabis for some weird trippy disso times.


I dose more or less once a week with a couple of two week breaks in between.

With my current tolerance I'll usually go with 10-15 mg as a starter. If I get a little excited I might take the same again after a while, and so on. While I do sometimes get dissociated like crazy, with this batch I just melt into a puddle of love.

I enjoy 30-50mg of 3meo over any other disso for relaxing. I find high doses, when used to the effects, really enjoyable.

I am at a loss to describe effects to people even after all this time. To say it induces mania is not always true and not a full spectrum of whats going on. Relating it to ketamine is useless. Even comparing it to MXE is useless. The first time I took some after only having toyed with it once or twice, I felt an LSD like intensity with mania and had a good run for a while, higher than I've ever been in a way I'm at a loss to describe. I get none of that now unfortunately. Not sure if it will come back or if my material is just crap. I miss the mania, I just feel sedated or out of it when I take it now. Are other people experiencing downer effects from some batches? Not trying to be specific at all, just wondering about the range of effects. It used to stimulate me so much, Im wondering if its because it's a different batch or if my tolerance is just fucked.

Yes one of the batches is sedating and psychedelic. My current one is way better than any stimulant or cup of coffee. Very clean energy without the jitters and crash.

Without a doubt, one variety of 3-MeO-PCP is not hypomanic to any particular degree, nor stimulating, and is more psychedelic.  I am hopefully going to get some GC/MS results soon for both batches, and I'll share with the community.

So I holed on a very large dose...


I was sitting there IV'ing it, 15mg here… what the fuck let's get manic, do another 20mg or so from solution quickly….Load up another huge dose...


I'm guessing after days of doing high doses with some DCK use.. I ended up doing about 100mg's in a short period of time, <10minutes. I was insanely messed up in the head over something and turned into an IV freak. I've had experiences of over amping on meth because… I have no idea...


Anyways I TRAVELED to "the nurses station" after a series of intense tunnels.. It was as if I had died and knew about my life. Like I knew I wasn't dead and didn't want to leave my life like that.


I woke up not far from where I was in my apartment. I had strong visuals for a long time.


Lot's of things happened, you can find my posts earlier in this thread.


I want to do it again!!! I know I shouldn't touch it for a very long time if at all… currently prescribed Vraylar as of two days ago. Thinking about stopping it because I want my 5ht-2a receptor left alone.. Interesting pharmacology on that atypical though.


The medication was prescribed for mixed episodes bipolar, after telling the doctor and lead pharmacist I've met with everything over a period of time… like months now.


I'd rather self medicate with cannabis and caffeine and food….

^ After what you told us before, maybe you should come to realize that moderate, "innocent" dissociative or other drug use leads to some moment where you make the decision to dive off the deep end (I know how that works), which then escalates even further beyond belief (I myself don't know how that works fortunately).


Not to mention what manic episodes even without 3-MeO-PCP can lead to in general, you certainly don't want to trigger that - what people usually are looking for in this thread is hypomania, the difference being basically that hypomania is more or less harmless where mania is not. 3-MeO-PCP can lead to mania, but typically people don't come back perfectly alright from that, to say the least.


Maybe antipsychotics, antagonizing 5-HT2A and antipsychotic side-effects are the least of your worries?


I know it must be tempting to let yourself go and run with it, but keep focusing on the really messed up shit that happened that you told us about before to keep in mind why none of those enthousiastic feelings are in proportion.


---


I think personally I have semi forgotten about 3-MeO-PCP - i never think about it these days really, but come to this thread because I am a PD regular - because it's mutually exclusive to the dexamphetamine I am prescribed and am taking very frequently, and I'm loving what I am achieving... almost like I regularly have hypomania just coming from "drives" inside myself.

Maybe I will do 3-MeO-PCP one of these days, but I really don't have quite so much to win with it unless there are bodily sensations I would rather numb the fuck out of if that numbing doesn't lead to me worsening my bodily issues. It gives me a nice feeling, but much more than that messes with my functioning, as opposed to dex.


If 3-MeO was used primarily as a hypomanic stim and you are using other very good stims sustainably, the 3-MeO becomes obsolete?

I don't know about that, Soli, I don't really like stimulants much because I don't get much from regular doses and "euphoric" dose are not worth chasing in my opinion as they come with too much side-effects in my case... But 3-MeO-PCP, on the other side, apart from giving endless energy gives me a sense of "magic" and "hope" that I've never gotten from stimulants. Like it makes the future look brighter haha, not sure how to describe it. So I wouldn't say it becomes obsolete, but maybe it does if you want to use it in a purely functional way. 


A couple of weeks ago I took some 3-MeO-PCP at a rave, and when I was coming back home I had this feeling that everything in my life was going to be okay, and that all I had to do was be optimistic and patient as things would turn around at some point. At the moment it was really powerful, as I had been having a pretty rough couple of months, frustrated about many things and generally hopeless. But after that night I've been feeling a true change in my attitude, and generally things have actually started getting better. I, of course, can't attribute the "good fortune" I've been having recently to the drug-effects, because it would be irrational to do so, but I think that the attitude shift maybe did influence in some way the decisions I've been making, and therefore the general outcome of things in my life. I don't know, it's like that particular 3-MeO-PCP experience gave me new hope and new strength and that was a big role in breaking a months long depression. I've never gotten that from stimulants before, but as always, YMMV. I understand is not responsible to promote this drug as an effective cure for depressive thought loops, but I can say with all certainty that in my case it was a huge aid - Although maybe any positive experience could have been?

3-MeO-PCP has had such an impact on my and my loved ones lives. I see a huge therapeutic potential in it I will never stop the project of making dissociatives a legit treatment for major problems that humans experience, from depression to drug addictions. I will continue the work vortech started with him this year - these substances need to have the respect they deserve. There is already a lot of research going on about this on the academic field.

Indeed, after smoking ganja and drinking beer daily for like 15 years, 3-meo-pcp helped a lot into taking the decission to stop the abuse and spare the usage only to very special ocassions. Also it helped with the regulation of dissociative abuse itself, before 3meo it was a nearly daily thing for  5 years (fucking ketamine and MXE), but since a hard binge on the stuff at the middle of past year I'm only taking them once a month now. I can see the light now after years of bad habits and depression thanks to this unique, wonderful drug.

I see a huge therapeutic potential in it I will never stop the project of making dissociatives a legit treatment for major problems that humans experience, from depression to drug addictions. I will continue the work vortech started with him this year - these substances need to have the respect they deserve. There is already a lot of research going on about this on the academic field.

Indeed, Xammy and I are working out how to make a guidebook/reference manual etc. Like how to handle hard trips using all different kinds of tuning devices to create beautiful light and equilibrium. Music is a big one, especially the chill stuff that can help bring down the brightness of 3meo and fill it with a consistent flow. Another subject to tackle is integrating experiences and encouraging positive resonance that rings true long after the dose wears off. Battling demons with mantras, words as spells, to help people and put the shadow where it belongs. Fighting fear with love, fire with water, ya know, create a balance and order from the chaos. First inner peace, and then the purpose of helping others reach their own peace. Stuff like that is what we have been talking about today.

A similar story to my own! I have also put down the tobacco and alcohol unless for social ritual and lubricant for opening connection. I don't seek out ganja, but when it is passed to me I smile and take the medicine. Seeing everything as tools for what they are best for. It takes a lot of experimentation to figure it out as you have noted, MSK, but it is noble to take the path of self discovery and ultimately find your personal keys to creating a brighter future ahead. Another thanks to 3meo is in order. Like you MSK, I will likely be just fine keeping my usage cycle to once or twice a month.


Someone mentioned we should name it some other than its chemical name, but lets not get ahead ourselves, it is to be respected for what it is.

With that said, when I am in a funny mood, or around people who ought not know its nature, I call it tweet meow.

I love to call it "treemeow" as it sounds funny, but I'm usually the kind of pedantic guy that like to name drugs as complex as possible. I saw myself in the past refering to MDMA as 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (what a lame way of wasting words) or MXE as 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE. 


Nowadays I only do it when it makes sense, or if the nickname may lead to confussion, as calling 2-OxO-PCM desclhoroketamine/DXE or metoxphenidine MXP. That's just marketing to catch on non-connoisseurs.


I like to brag about my poor chemistry knowledges as much as posible ;P

Has anyone ever taken kratom on this stuff? All dissos seem to have a stimmy phase, but when taking 3-4 grams kratom, it can be terribly stimulating, like it hammers your adrenals somehow. Just watch out if you do.

I've decided that weed brings out the best in this chem, at least for me. 


Last night I took 25mg (I know, I know - either this batch is not potent, or I have a crazy tolerance, or I'm just hardheaded to this particular substance or some combo of the three) and went out to a show. I was definitely feeling nice, that subtle kind of almost rolling feeling I enjoy so much in 3-MeO. But after taking some hits off my oil pen is when I really hit a sweet spot. The dissociation was still nothing overbearing (especially compared to something like DCK) after smoking, even at this dose. I felt very clearheaded, stimulated, and uninhibited. I love the manic edge, it brings me out of my shell and makes it easier to strike up conversations with strangers. I was just really feeling myself in general all night, and didn't even struggle too hard to get to sleep! 


Also, I always love hooping/flowing on dissos, and this one is no exception. I felt sooo smooth and on point. And the mania makes me enjoy the performance aspect of it when I'm in public as I was last night :~)

It's funny that you guys are talking about it, because I also wanted to write about a recent 3 meo and dance party encounter in the nightclub.


I recently did a combo of 3meo ~20mg (4bumps) and ~1,2 and 1.4ml of GBL. and holy shit at one point **it was like a religiuos experience**.

I remember shouting random shit, curse words or ideas and concepts to random people. It was manic fun. Strong ego booster, this crazy low memory confidence boost it was absurd.. These two create an extremee euphoria that they are unable to create each on it's own. But at one point it felt like it was missing something and even thought of taking md or some other stimmy crap but hopefuly the sane side of me won. 

At some point I got worried I might be in trouble because of some unknown factor which wouldve made this experiment unsafe but I was ok.

How really dangerous is it to combine depressand like  booze and ghb with dissos?

It did have some uncomfortable comedown actually. similar to stimulants but I was able to fall asleep in like an hour. **Feeling like a piece of metal**. This metalic feeling. So weird so cool %)

I don't really think GABA agonists and dissociatives present too much of a danger, if any, besides the sloppiness that can sometimes ensue from confusion. That sounds like an absolutely righteous time though, nice!

My most manic experience to the date was with 5mg DOM + 15mg 3-MeO-PCP. Hours and hours of laughting to everybody and giving away dogmas I was the only one understanding. Crazy fun. DOx or 3-MeO-PCP could already be really manic on their own, but oh boy, in combination they made for one of the better drug rushes I went trough in my life.


I have got a lot of GBL arround, but I see it like if it was some medicine and only took it for knocking myself out for sleep if needed. Need to try the combo as well, seems interesting! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

This compound gives me a headache everytime on the comedown.   MXE and k never do this to me even when used during the same time period.

I drink an electrolyte preparation several times a day, I find it hard to remember to drink water and I sweat a lot at night (anxious) so it feels useful. I don't tend to get headaches from 3meopcp. Maybe try bananas and electrolytes. 


I also think these drugs do cause a bit of msucluar tension, or the holding of muscles in awkward positions. I try to stretch regularly when dissociated. It often feels really fucking nice too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Okay, I wasn't too impressed by this stuff at first but now it's making its way into my favorites. 


I think it is the ideal drug to use in combination with others. It brings out the best of anything I mix it with. 

Last night I took 1 tab of LSD and ~10mg 3-MeO-PCP. I definitely felt psychedelic, but the 3-MeO brought a level of clarity that made it so much easier to talk to others and not get stuck in my head. Also I find the mania suits my personality amazingly as I am naturally introverted. It's a great confidence boost, and yet I don't feel like it makes me very prone to reckless decisions, as some might worry about when mania comes into play. It seems like a perfect balance.

Well, I got the GC/MS results back from the two batches of 3-MeO (the white fluffy trippy calm one, and the tan, hypomanic, stimulating one).  Identical results, both indicated only 3-MeO-PCP was present.  But two distinctly different effects as we've been discussing.  Also they taste and smell different.  The tan batch has this aura of cocaine taste to it, and it's the stimulating one, so I had been wondering if it was cut with something but looks like not.

**Wow! **


Thank you *so much* for submitting the samples, i can't tell you how grateful i am that you did this.

...where does this leave the discussion about different types?


I seem to be one of the few people that has only come across the "calm one" and not encountered the stimulating 3-meo-pcp !


The stuff i've got is white and fluffy, and has *trippy and calm* effects.  In a way i'm thankful (because it's magic) - but i am very curious about the reportedly "stimulating" batch.  It hasn't changed properties, for me - in the sense that it's never really given me mania, my responses to it have been consistent and the effects have not changed dramatically as tolerance was built, so i don't think it is tolerance, i still think it is batch-related.


Where does this result leave us?  Can we say with confidence that neither sample has been adulterated or contaminated?


Great work, Xorkoth!

Yes I was told (as I don't understand how to read GC/MS results) that both samples showed only 3-MeO-PCP present, no contaminants.


I like the calm, trippy batch too.  I'm glad I have both as they're both great but I use them for different things.  If I want to get MXE-style trippy while still remaining functional and sociable, like for seeing a show or something, and actually get dissociated, I go for the fluffy white batch, and if I want to feel hypomanic and stimulated and use it for functional purposes like playing music or going for a hike or something, I'll use the other batch.


If it's placebo effect, I'll eat my own foot.  For starters, I had the full expectation that when I first got the white fluffy batch, it would be identical in effects.  I had gotten multiple batches before, and they were always the stimulating/hypomanic variety.  I kept trying to convince myself it was placebo, but it's always the same.  I've done more than enough drugs to be able to identify different effects that consistently appear over many uses of a drug.  If I had done each batch a couple of times, I could easily chalk it up to just experiencing different aspects of the same drug due to set and setting, etc, but when something consistently always behaves a certain way over many, many uses...

Yeah, there is something going on with this stuff which i'm not qualified to speculate upon...but i know the stuff i've encountered is decidedly of the non-stimmy variety.

Yeah I wasn't sure which result I wanted more.  Would have been cool if one was cut with a stimulating drug or something, would have been an easy answer.  But I like the mystery, to me it reinforces that the mechanism of drugs and the effects they produce is more complex than we understand.  We understand a lot but we don't have the whole picture.  There is *something* that is making the two batches behave differently.  Now we know for sure they are both in fact nothing but 3-MeO-PCP.

GCMS analysis would likely not involve looking for the negative counter   ion mass since they generally only look at positive ions.   They probably only look for free PCP + H mass and fragments thereof, or they functionalize the amine then run it....neither of which would tell you what salt it is to begin with

I used this stuff everyday for 3 and a bit weeks, about 60mg a day, it was blissful. I know it was silly and I absolutely recommend against it! I am now about 99% certain it's extremely bad for you and I am not going to touch the stuff for 4 weeks.


During the experience I was having intense euphoria for almost all the 3 weeks, Towards the end I had 5 days of total dissphoria. Really bad horrible time. Just wondering will the magic ever return? After a 4 week break? I think this stuff has the potential for huge positive impact on society if used with absolute caution and respect.


Please nobody every binge on this. I am generally really healthy, I look after myself in almost every aspect. If I stopped after 1 week it would have been perfect. I was in an incredible, life changing headspace. But i just felt so good I continued. Anyway now i am feeling worse than before it, lost many of the positives I gained. One good thing is I know I won't do this again.

Yeah this one isn't good to take for so long.   I will do it for 5 days in a row sometimes, 5 days is about my upper limit.  And I do 2mg bumps throughout the day, I find it's more workable and after a while you get some serious hypomania.  Very useful and nice.  But it makes you crazy after a while which is why I don't go over 5 days.  Lately I haven't been doing it much.

Yeah CG?, I also remember the same thing was happening with MXE; and people came with the "crystal polymorphism"  theory, which I don't really buy ... but seems to be the only theory left before getting into the magical energies the chemicals have been blessed with and whatnot.

I think I have the "white crystally". Sometimes I get a little bit lost with the aesthetic categories: Salty, sugary, fluffy, floury, sandy, granular, chunky... lol. 

Mine certainly isn't as fine as flour. White crystally sounds fitting. 


Oh, and it's moderately manic. I can get manic if I spread my dose, but it's not guaranteed.


EDIT: After posting that I rethought the last line and maybe the difference between batched does indeed have something to do with the absorption ? Like, if your 3-MeO-PCP it's so fine as to look like flour maybe it will get better into solution and would be absorbed faster or something ? Whereas the more "crystal" batches maybe take more time to dissolve and therefore absorb ? I'm not sure that makes sense but I was thinking that, if the type of dosing regime determines the effects achieved (Like I have noticed that if I redose, I get more hypomanic and less disociated that if I took a single euqivalent dose, or Xorkoth says he spreads his small doses through the day to eventually get to the hypomanic state) then maybe it's not that far out to think that if one batch is getting absorbed slower through the grastrointestinal membranes it has an effect similar to "Spreading the dose" which results in more reliably hypomanic and less dissociated states ???? Like a slow release 3-MeO-PCP vs a hard hitting highly available one ?? Don't know if I'm making sense, its fucking 37°C here and my brain is exploding but it kinda sounded convincing when it crossed my mind.

After a 30 days binge on this stuff is it ever possible to return to the good effects? I am planning a good month off but wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and can offer any advice?

everything will be fine, just take a break, chill and reflect what happened. I've gone through many dissociative binges and after a while you will always be fine. what kind of doses have you used?

Sugary, definitely.


And this is the only batch I've done (besides a friends', who obtained from the same source around the same time - likely the same batch) but it definitely has strong manic qualities.

How long would you recommend me taking a break for? Do you think it will be ever possible for it to the intense euphoria I was feeling then to return? I have never felt so close to a worry free, enlightened being. Everything was in flow. But I just held on to it for too long and ruined it.


I only just bought a microscale and was just doing then tiny end of a key before. The scale is telling me doses were around 10-15mg a dose. I just prefer insufflation and have no idea how to dose otherwise. Is there a general consensus on how to dose and when? 


I think I was doing around 10mg every hour sometimes upping to maybe 15mg. Can I ask how much you dose? What your breaks are, what method you use? 


Do you have monthly breaks inbetween?

Breaks won't take the magic back. 3 years after a ketamine abuse break didn't lowered the permatolerance at all,  I'll never feel it again. Now I'm doing 1-month breaks for the 3meo and the experiences are not hypomanic anymore and very lackluster even at 20mg

To everyone taking a lot of this and developing tolerance... I've been using this pretty frequently, sometimes almost every day for weeks, for I think about 1.5 years now, and I use 2mg bumps every 2 hours, maxing out at 5 or 6 a day.  It produces the lovely mania eventually but I never get intoxicated and if I take a day or 2 off after 5 days I don't get crazy either.  Best of all, I have experienced no build in tolerance in that whole time, I still take the same doses.  I'm just gonna recommend again that people try this method out.  If you've already fucked your tolerance maybe it won't work (although keep in mind I am not trying to get dissociated but instead reap the "medicinal" benefits), but if not, maybe you, too, can avoid that fate.

Fine.  Between some orders I've stopped for up to a month, didn't notice anything off.  I don't feel like it alters me a whole lot, mainly it makes me feel significantly more confident, euphoric, inspired and energetic without really altering my behavior or functionality much.

I've noticed some mood changes after stopping but I can't really say it's because of 3-MeO-PCP. Still trying to figure out the after effects after prolonged use...


I heard someone used this like 4 grams over one year - his blood test came out fine. Positive news. Do you know your total consumption over that 1.5 years Xorkoth?

Someone wrote a report of their friend accidentally ingesting 125mg at once, the person who wrote it was a nurse or doctor or something and said their friend was definitely mostly catatonic or anxious and had very little recollection of the experience, but that the vital signs didn't get alarming at any time.  It's on Erowid somewhere.

This was IV MXE+MDAI and probably something else if I recall correct, yeah it was in Sweden.


Swilow, don't wait too hard, going to probably take a while to do my master's thesis. :D We'll see what will happen.

I've been using this pretty frequently, sometimes almost every day for weeks, for I think about 1.5 years now, and I use 2mg bumps every 2 hours, maxing out at 5 or 6 a day. It produces the lovely mania eventually but I never get intoxicated and if I take a day or 2 off after 5 days I don't get crazy either. Best of all, I have experienced no build in tolerance in that whole time, I still take the same doses. I'm just gonna recommend again that people try this method out. If you've already fucked your tolerance maybe it won't work (although keep in mind I am not trying to get dissociated but instead reap the "medicinal" benefits), but if not, maybe you, too, can avoid that fate.

That is good news. I think I did nearly a g in just over 3 weeks! I was in the middle of 2 projects when it arrived and I was pumping out the best videos & websites I have ever made. I wrote my first poem since I was a kid. I was in a state of flow for basically the whole 3 weeks. Then my body gave me one hell of a kick. I felt like my blood pressure rocketed or dropped (not sure which), at the same time had a mad delusion and all of a sudden started seeing the numbers 11:11 and other synchronicities at the same time. I have never really believed the numbers mean anything before, maybe my subconscious was reaching out, a higher being I honestly don't know but I am talking every single time I looked at the clock (which isn't that frequently). This has continued to this day and I am no longer taking it. 


I would never usually be so reckless (well, at least I usually research more). But I was in such an intense state of euphoria and flow I just kept going. Very very silly. Luckily I learned my lesson. Please please please anyone wanting to try this, read the forum first. Listen to the experienced users and do not abuse it. The therapeutic effects far outweigh any potential high you can get from it. I am taking mad creativity, incredible euphoria, increased sociability, kindness, the need to help people, to change the world (at least for me).


I am just really hoping this binge hasn't ruined the therapeutic effects I can get in the future. I am trying to weigh up how long my break should be, I was going to do a month but now tempted by 2 or even 6 months. I really want to start learning an instrument (I was inspired to do so) and wanted to have a day or 2 with this stuff early on while I was learning. Any advice here on how long my break should be? 


FYI I used to have quite a lot of MXE, maybe 10gs over a fair while so I think this could have hit my tolerance. I also used to have a lot of ketamine back in the day but have been fairly dry for about 1 year. I think my doses on this stuff were around 5-14mg every hour as I now have a scale and that is what it is telling me. Is it actually possible to eyeball 2mg? I don't think it is. The scale I got was not too expensive and I am not sure on its accuracy. Seems to start picking up weight around 8mg...


Sorry for the long post.

I used 3 grams last year and started on my 4th recently. I'm using 10-15mg doses usually twice a day,  before and after work. It gets me to a flow state with much more natural feeling access to energy than any stimulant could ever provide. The anti depressant effects and hypomania are still very present. At times I will take much more if I want to get wavy, maybe twice a week.

Nice. Do you take orally? 


How would you say the effects differ from when you started? 


Have you noticed a tolerance build up?


Do you ever take breaks?


Has anyone started a document of quantitive research here? If not I might start to look into creating one. Get all the facts in one place...

Playing music is my favorite drug.  I sometimes use 3-MeO to enhance that, but honestly if you're inspired just focus on that, take 6 months off, play, practice, just get into it.  It's really cool to find people to play with too, it makes it even better.  You should definitely take a long tolerance break.  The numbers thing is honestly the gateway sign to a period of psychosis, honestly.  I've seen it play out so many times on here and even in real life.  Read back through the 3-MeO Big and Dandies, you can see when someone has gone a bit off the rails and that's one of the signs.  Not just with 3-MeO but with any drugs that can cause psychosis.

Ahh man, you are right. You are both right. I will get back to meditation, exercise, creating and get the instrument. Wishing you all the best and I will visit here from time to time to drop some knowledge/help.


Please anyone reading this do not start administering before reading these threads. I lived and learned. Luckily without any lessons too difficult. Thank you for the help!

 Yes I usually go with oral. Nasal tears up my nose, decent amount of blood, & it also makes me sneeze a bunch at first. 


I don't have so much trouble anymore firming words on the peak lol. Other than that I'd say the main difference is just thst I'm more accustomed to the effects and can compensate better when dissociated. 


Yes some tolerance, I used to be able to to use less than 10mg to get decent effects.


I've dine breaks before, because of caution earned from these B&D threads but I think I've found a good therapeutic balance and the benefits far outweigh any good a break could do for me.

Right.

Just because something is widely available, sure as hell don't make it safe.


I must admit i cringe a little bit whenever people talk about a PCP analogue being "therepeutic" in daily use.

Not directed at anyone, it just sounds very risky to me.

Yeah, we are just starting to understand the therapeutic potential of ketamine so let's not get ahead of ourselves, these studies will take time.


In the meantime, anyone reading this should treat this chemical with extreme caution. It's one of the strongest drugs available.

Yes, definitely treat it with caution.  It's easy to use it too much, or use too much in a session, because it feels pretty benign generally and you feel less altered than you actually are.  I've never gone off the rails with it but I take a cautious approach with my dosage levels, I specifically try to avoid becoming dissociated.  Despite that, I still have had a few times, several days or even a week into daily use at those low doses, where I started to get a little unhinged and had to cut it out.  Also, besides weed it's the only drug I ever feel like taking daily for periods of time.  It's because it's so subtle and functional the way I use it.  Even so, I will find myself taking it on days when I wasn't going to, because it's pretty easy to do, and pleasant.  So a strict approach must be taken.  if you're prone to going on benders and pushing dosages, I can't recommend venturing into 3-MeO-PCP territory because the potential for full-blown mania and/or psychosis is just all too real.


I do find it to be a tool of surpassing usefulness for a variety of things, and I think there is good therapeutic potential in it too.  But it's really easy to be cavalier about it, and that's a mistake.

^ I prefer nasal administration because I feel it's easier to control it. It has more powerful effect because it comes up faster and stronger and doesn't last as long. Taking it orally I often notice that I am more altered than I realize.

I prefer nasal also.  Oral is more dissociating/intoxicating for me, while nasal is quicker and has more of the stimulating edge to it.  I actually find oral stronger by dose, but I desire those effects less.  Easier to titrate and a more convenient duration.  It does make me sneeze a lot of the time.  It probably isn't good for the nose which is a concern of mine since I dose tiny amounts 3 or more times a day when I use it.

Yeah nasal can hit instantly but there are some funky effects with your nasal passages. Lots of sneezing and mucous production and eventually blood. Not recommended.

I've never had blood despite lots of snorting over a fairly long period of time, but I am sure it's bad for your nasal passages.  Definitely doesn't feel benign.

I got a couple nosebleeds on this doing 20-30 mg a day for about three months daily. Suspected 3-meo played a role cause my nose was starting to feel irritated as well. 3-meo seems to leave a bit of residue in the nasal passages for me several hours after insufflating. Started irrigating my nasal passages with saline about an hour after my dose and it helped a lot, but not completely; nose feels a bit stuffy and irritated after a while regardless but no nosebleeds. I've slowed down my use to almost nothing last couple months and nose isn't 100% yet. Still feels dry and reduced airflow. Purity of product is probably a big factor as well. I suspect mine isn't top grade product. Moderation and nasal is probably fine.

No trying to use it therapeutically is not safe. When I tried that - daily microdosing or lowdosing - I figured that I could tell it didn't disconnect / derealize etc me that seriously and held that as a sort of safety margin to stop it immediately if it were to get dubious. That never happened, but I also did not get the kind of benefit from it that I was hoping / expecting / looking for either. The benefit you do seem to get is IME relatively temporary especiallly compared to the long half life and not like ketamine AD potential.

When I stopped, it was clear that I had been more mentally absent / removed though mood-stabilized (or rather without much mood) than I realized at the time, typical. So I guess that is part of what the margin was for, but still serves as a warning.

My dosage was under 5 mg a day, 20-30 mg seems like way too high and I don't think you'd be able to justify that as "therapeutic", nor am I saying you made that claim, LB.


I took it sublingually.

I find my mood is heightened with 3-MeO even during multi-day runs.  It amplifies all my moods and thought processes.  When I keep it to the correct duration, I notice I am mostly feeling really great things, euphoria, confidence, inspiration.  Like when I play music, I get so worked up with inspiration that I have to calm myself down afterwards and it can be difficult to talk to people, but damn if it's not the greatest feeling ever, and the ideas just flow so effortlessly.


When I go too long, I start to get easily irritated and upset and the confidence remains so I can get pretty confrontational which is unlike me.  I have never noticed a flat effect though, personally.  Quite the opposite, which can be a good or a bad thing.

3 CAT post

January 28, 2017


[NOTE: tried to post this to Bluelight.org thread but even after logging in it takes me to page that says I am newb “greenlighter” yet I find no reason I cannot post.  Maybe should drop it?]


So far I have been finding 3 Meow or CAT or even now the PCP term "angel dust" has resonance , for it seems to take me to a deep long wave flowing where I feel like my angelic high spirit side can navigate through the waveforms of Mater ("Matter".


I mix it with water 100 mg with 100 ml water so it is easy to measure out 5, 10, 15 mg CAT. 


I get somewhat paranoid on acid: while it is revealing to me that I AM the one dreaming my existence, the constant "tipping over" into new frames of time, moment on moment as my mind rushes through a hall of mirrors fractal tube Me layering upon me up me upon me... it is exhausting, but sure cleans out the psychic plumbing.


When I use MDMA as a grounding, it removes the fear and I can enjoy the Rush of Gnosis of Self-simularity packing down Light into Matter like endless Russian nested dolls, an endless zip file compacted by Phi waves recursing back into infinity.


So my practice over the last few years is MDMA plus whatever, trying to just go to the edge of the envelope so I can come back and remember where I went. It's like digging progressively in a mine: I want to get out all the recalcitrant hidden imps of the Shadow self and reclaim them in Love; to take the sad child back into my heart to increase COUR-AGE and Wholeness.


When this last year I found the CAT (a pun I will develop below!) I loved it absolutely for the disso and relief it gave me from the "problem" of "me." It help cut through the Gordian Knot tangle of all the bullshit in me I want to expose, but am naturally ambivalent about becoming the helpless Fool of my own imagination!


I have been developing an alchemical model of these different Soma medz which can be overlaid on the chakras:


MDMA is the Heart, the Center, the Safe place, the Middle Original Lotus wherein the androgyne of pre-pubescent polarity sleeps in Mother's Love. Love is the Balance between, the Scales of Libra in the Heart.


I see the chakras “below” and “above as mirror images of each other, emanating out of the Heart Lotus in pairs: navel/throat, genital/pineal, root crown.  Interesting that the genital pineal is clearly reflected in Mantak Chia’s Taoist model too. So I think I ‘m onto something.


In the same mirroring fashion, the I AM at Repose in the Heart has emanated out higher and higher spectrum of frequency wave forms in the upper chakras [“North half”], and they are mirrored in the lower spectrum of the “South half” chakras, which pertain to ther body and personal world of sex, territory, and little self.


You may have seen images of the Hindu model of creation: the Churning of the Milky Ocean, where a Buddha man in state of repose sits in his Balance Chair, while there is a tug of war going on: to one side a line of Asuras [“bad” guys in polarity] are pulling the rope against their counterparts emanating out on his other side, the Devas [“good” guys]


In Reality Cosmos is a perfected balance of forces in Vector Equilibrium, but as the balance tips from side to side, we, the I AM or Viewer in us, begins to “fall” and start “tripping.”


Here’s how these med mixes has affected me:


One day I did low dose acid “Light Streaming Down” so I equate it to North Half frequency observation, plus some MDMA.  I rose higher and higher and right out of any of the fractal spin from “Dove” [another name applied to this high freq energy coming “down” like the Holy Ghost] [p.s. I now see a  pun in being called a hippy freak! = freq]


Suddenly I went into perfect balance, or Repose as IT told me IT was. This was Samadhi, and it fulfilled a desire to know what that was. It’s not a negation of cosmos into emptiness, but a perfect balance of all forces. A stillness. I felt I could gently tip to either side and fall into “tripping,” a stumbling conCATenation of endless causality.


Eventually I could see how this would be boring to the “Godhead” and so began the Great Scroll that keeps on unrolling!


Next day I was out of MDMA and mixed about 20 mikes Dove with 10 ml CAT. Nothing seemed to happen in the first two hours. So I doubled down on both. Now I had been experimenting with CAT before 10-15 mls, and loved the ride. As one post says, it makes me very articulate and loquacious, with Logoic Word spilling out in puns nested inside puns. Words seem to decode themselves down to root gestures, and the World is the Word made visible, a pleasing Joke hidden in plain sight.


But now, in this mix of OPPOSITES [ for I am provisionally cat-egorizing CAT as low end of the spectrum waves in Mother Substance, a pleasing roll out of Light made Flesh] when that double dose kicked in at about 4 hours to my great surprise, I sudden found myself riding two Great Entwined Serpents up and up.


This seemed to me to be the fundamental nature of Cosmos, which I realized is depicted in the Caduceus, and is discovered to be our fundamental energetic form as in the ida-pingala currents, the Tree that the Chakras grow on as fruit.


If you know the Electric Universe model ([www.thunderbolts.info](http://www.thunderbolts.info) which is my guiding paradigm these days) you’ll see that all of Cosmos is an interconnected mycelial web of electrical flow. When electrical currents flow through space they tend to braid together in what are called Birkeland Currents, and they  pinch together and form “plasmoids” in the Cross-over pinch; just like chakras on the crossover current’s of Ida-pingala. So this is the root model of how matter manifests in this basic Trinity.


Likewise consciousness is a flow of knowingness that touches the “other.” Mind, which organizes consciousness into Self vs. Other, is dual or polar, the result of these opposite entwined Flows. The Self is the plasmoid that forms like a bead on a chain, just as stars do.


So.... background lecture having been established.. !  When I rode these two currents “up” I saw they were the basic alchemical model of the Two-Thing, or Rebis. God in Polarity. While these “serpents” were polar opposites and thus in competition with each other, snarling for supremacy, Light into Matter, Matter back into Light, it was a Flaming Revelation of the Rawness at Root. I suspect that was also some form of a classic kundalini initiation wherein one has to confront non-judgmentally how the Force works.


Frankly I saw it as an endless Chain of Being, a food chain in which those above are authorized to feed and then fuck those below, Predator and Prey. Each of us stands in such a chain. As long as the  Flow moves through the Circuit brings Life to each. This Chain (Aurea Catena in Rosicrucian speak) gave punning depth to Con-CAT-enation which I see in the TreeMeow!


But this was raw. Scary. We are each one the bitch to someone who is bigger and stronger. We find out niche.

________________________________________


What was missing was the MDMA, the X or Cross-Over force that would marry these two. The Gnostics have a story that after the “first” creation which is pure instinctual forces working it out, the 4 EL-ements as represents in the Tetragrammaton YHVH; G*D the Good took a look at how it all was going, and made a “second” creation; “HE” sent in the Christos as mediator, to bring the Right Hand path together with the Left Hand path. I like that story. That there has been an “intervention” as the System Self-corrects. If you like Xtian Kabbala, it is said that if you insert the Hebrew letter Shin, which is a triple flame letter, into YHVH, you get YHSVH, or Yehosua, Joshua, Jesus, the anticipated “messiah” or balancing Vector to the Two-Thing in its perpetual Wheel of Love-Hate, Attraction-Repulsion, the Binding force which Hindus call the Skambha, Egyptians the Djed.


All right enough of my “revelations.”  I have the idea that the “true” SOMA is a mix that blends a high frequency soma with a low frequency soma, PLUS the addition of a Heart pivot soma such as MDMA.  Perhaps the poppy served as that in older Mystery mixes. Thus one would amplify the Full Spectrum of Consciousness. This was my next test.

________________________________________

SOMA?  High Freq + Low Freq + Heart Blender


Once ounce low dose Dove (approx. 20 mikes) + 15 ml CAT + 125 ml X.


 This took me into a playful deep meaning world of decoding the fractal Mind. 

I began “lensing” into everything I saw, I guess this is the “hole” {never did K].  It was fascinating that I could telescope time back layer into layer, but would it end? Would there be a resolution? Or just a loop I might get caught in?


As fate would have it, I just got in the mail that day a book, the Heart of the Master by Aleister Crowley. Lately I have been hearing expositions (Michael Tsarion) on how he was misunderstood and categorized by the Dark Side he sought to penetrate and unravel, as being the horrible Evil one himself. Being an egotistical wit, he took on their pejorative name calling, much like we old hippies adopted the insult of “freak.”


Whatever may the full and unknown story, I was drawn into the book, and came away feeling Crowley was honest and authentic in following his inner Star... BUT something made me hold the book at arms length. At the end I felt sad to him, that he had dove into the Belly of the Beast to pull out Its guts and reveal the rot. This may have made him a sacrifice on the pyre, or he may have been swallowed up by it. But he was certainly authentic.  Nonetheless a Dark Force came around me an gave me creepy B movie horror dreams of sad sack freaks (think Pizzagate) who chained young women up in their basement. This inverted pervert was trying to recruit some of us into his sex dungeon cult. I awoke with the feeling I should not have been in “lensing” mode when looking into Crowley and all the psychic effluvia that has coiled up around his ghost.

________________________________________

Next day I strongly cleansed my house with sage and sandlewood, and called up all positive forces for protection. I was worried I would be open to evil in the astral and have dark dreams. But as it turned out my protection worked, and dreams were reassuring.


My take now in review is that the CAT and other mix opened my third eye very strongly, thus giving me a “lens” effect which allowed penetrating into layers of the Akash memory, but being naively open and not taking protection, I dove also into some Evil which had attached itself succubus like to the Crowley to turn his work into a honey pot soul trap. I will be much more conscious in the future about entering the astral levels.


I’m OK now. I see it again as a challenge to take a hard look at the Darkness that has grown up like a cancer in our world. I hope positive forces are working through Trump to counter this, and that his Leo ego nature won’t trap him; he will certainly be surrounded by backstabbers and liars seeking to derail and counterfeit with Fake News any attempts to gut the Beast.

The dose-response curve of this stuff is really steep. I took 3mg a while back as a test dose, and barely felt anything; maybe a vague sense that something was off. Took 5mg earlier today; there wasn't much dissociation, but I felt a remarkably strong mood lift and confidence boost, bordering on hypomania. I'm not sure I like it, as it seems a bit too unfocused and "muddy" for regular use, but I certainly see the appeal. Had a lot of fun trying some new recipes to cook for the week's meals.

That also sounds a little like what some nootropics can do, doesn't it?


I have a lot of irritability / impatience / low frustration threshold issues lately by the way.


On the other hand, yesterday I took 3-MeO-PCP and then dropped 2C-B and among other activities watched a movie about losing a close loved one and it was really touching to me and I got into this whole thing of feeling like those kinds of unreal things (movies, dreams etc) prepare us for the day that we will have to let go of e.g. parents ourselves, like I had to let go of my niece who passed away at 3. I felt really sorry for the fear and grief that little girl had to go through before her life ended so very prematurely. It got pretty real, I am thankful for those kinds of touching experiences because it feels healthy as part of life and it is normally very hard for me to deal with difficult emotions, likely since I have ASD.


On the comeup it was a bit stimulating which I don't think is all too good for me since I take prescribed dexamph and sometimes have things like burst bloodvessels in finger or eye, so I took a sub-mg dose of etizolam to take care of the extremes.

Not sure how I'm going to try other stimulating psychedelics but ok.

Same.

So, combined with ALD-52 - i wasn't sure how it was going to work out.

The synergy, however, was absolutely breathtaking.

It's hard to explain how well the two combined - but the analogy that comes immediately to mind is that the 3-meo-pcp was like a solid canvas that the ALD-52 visuals were painted upon.


It felt as if as the 3-meo-pcp was some kind of foundation that made the trip just shine.


Took ~5mg of 3-meo orally about 2 hours into the trip, and it went from slightly lacklustre to totally sublime as soon as it kicked in.

Also, the disso smoothed all the physicsl edginess off the acid.  As i've said before though, the 3-meo-pcp i have is the tripp 

The cocktail was *way* better than the actual peak - the visuals took off and my mind and body settled and i felt relaxed.


I have some crazy round 1930s art deco light fittings in my bedroom.  They remind me of flying saucers, and are made of mottled, pink frosted glass.

When the 3-meo-pcp effects came on, the light fittings appeared to be rotating, warping and sort of floating - as if they were made of pink smoke.


Prior to that, the visuals were fairly subtle - some mild distortions and patterns, a few flashes and shimmery floating patterns that weren't particularly interesting.

Being my first experience with ALD-52 (which i bought ages ago) - i wanted to try it on its own. 


I took the 3-meo-pcp after a good while with just the ALD-52 - and while it was very nice, i wasn't blown away by the 250 ug of ALD-52.


When the 3-meo-pcp came on, however, i vaped one bowl of cannabis.

This synergised with the others - and i was very, very impressed.  Magnificent cocktail ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I used to **love ** mxe combined with tryptamines (namely 4-aco-dmt), but never tried combining 3-meo-pcp with anything (i've always treated this stuff with a lot of caution) but it seems like a heavenly match with lysergamides.

Will most definitely be experimenting with this combo in the future.  Just beautiful.

Isn't the combo incredible?  It's hard toi explain, I agree.  I feel like the 3-MeO provides this perfect space for LSD/ALD to reach its absolute full and most wide-reaching effect.  Like it just suffuses everything completely.  I can get a satisfying trip off a third of s 125ug blotter when I add 3-MeO.  I have to be careful actually,  a whole 125 wth 3-MeO is too intense for a lot of settings where 125ug of LAD by itself would be fine,

^ excellent!  I'm so glad you guys mentioned this!

I would have been reluctant to experiment with the combo if i hadn't heard that - but you're absolutely right. It made the experience so much easier to navigate.  Which is great, because i have a sadly small stash of ALD-52.

Really forward to mushroom season though!  I got out of the habit of tripping after a series of life events led to a really difficult LSD trip exactly 2 years ago.


Feeling happy and positive again now though, so it's been fun to dip into my stash ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


3-meo-pcp makes it so much better though - as soon as it came on, the trip just went from "good" to "great". It's like they're made for each other - but having said that, i'm talking about the **non-stimulating** "type" of this stuff.

I can't speak for the mania-inducing stuff a lot of people talk about.

Mania is something that is impossible to realize without prior experience of it and noticing it. That's what makes this one of the most dangerous substances imo.


I wouldn't say there is a "non-stimulating type" 3-MeO-PCP. It is stimulating, just like every hallucinogen is. But I know what you mean.


I'm glad you had a great experience ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I sent some emails to neuropsychiatrists last week. I got the answer today. I'm one step closer to finding out about the Finnish research of arylcyclohexylamines. They are studying at least ketamine and nitrous oxide, I am waiting for an answer to my question if they already study methoxetamine and 3-MeO-PCP. There are at  least three different universities doing research. If I understood correctly, one is focusing on the anesthesia of electroconvulsive therapy, one is focusing on the ketamine infusions on clinical level for depression and one is studying ketamine as a part of other studies, I am not sure of these particular studies yet.

3meo is the perfect fuel for lysergamides indeed. For years I wasn't taking acid because it was lackluster and wasn't worth it anymore, but that changed past year when I discovered how a low dose of 3meo could make me enjoy tripping again. 


Long life to the treemeow! I wish I could use this stuff daily ala caffeine, but I'm afraid my mind would be burned in less than a year.


For tryptamines I prefer 2-oxo-pce though.

I was loving the 3-meo-pcp + tryptamine combo for a while.


Finally got to try a 'new' batch, very distinct from the original one doing rounds years and years ago. All I can say is definitely isn't as strong, stimulating or manic. Whether that's a good thing or not I can't really say, mostly just wondering what the hell is causing this difference.


Also newer batch is much harsher on the nose, causes bleeding and sneezing whereas my original batch was smooth as butter.

My bad - I was waiting to see those results come back, very confusing indeed.


Original batch was the floury, fluffy, white clumpy powder, newer one I've got is slightly more tan and crystalline/granular and has more of an odour/taste.


Mystery goes on.

Are most batches these days the less manic version of 3-MeO-PCP or is there an equal opportunity to get either batch at the moment, in general?

@Bella Figura - The only stuff i've ever had is much more hypnotic (is that the right word?) and psychedelic than it is stimulating.

When people started reporting there were different batches, it all started to make sense to me.

Previously i was questioning whether it was the same substance - the duration of action and potency were the same, but the effects i got were very different.

Pretty fascinating.

Yeah I've got both... the more dissociating one is white white and has an almost sweet mixed with clinical smell when I snort it.  It also makes me sneeze quite a lot compared to the other batch.  The other batch is more stimulating and manic, very light tan, and it smells a lot like cocaine when I snort it.  Or rather, something about that initial wave of scent/taste reminds me of cocaine.  As stated in the last page, both test via GC/MS as containing only 3-MeO-PCP.

So, you have two batches supposedly containing only one and the same molecule but they look, smell and feel different? How do you explain that? I'm really curious. I mean, do think the tests missed something or do you just like have no real clue what the hell causes the difference (cause I truly don't)? I read the whole thread and this batch-topic really got me because it very much opposes my (scientific) view of how things should be ^^

I don't know how to explain it.  I trust the guy who did the GC/MS, a capable and intelligent (and learned) individual.  Myself and all my friends agree the batches have different effects.  They're both clearly 3-MeO, but one is sparkly and dissociating and not manic, and the other is stimulating and manic.  I have no idea why.  The color can be easily explained by a minuscule leftover side reaction product (even an insignificant level of something leftover from synthesis can produce color), might also explain the smell, but the GC/MS only had 1 peak on each, and it was the 3-MeO-PCP peak.


It's a mystery.  The fact is, we don't have the whole picture when it comes to drugs and how they work in the brain and the resulting subjective experiences.  We understand a lot but to claim we know it all is arrogant, IMO.

Going a bit offtopic, but could these subjective differences appear in other drugs, even common OTC ones like acetaminophen or ibuprofen? Maybe someone who works at the pharmaceutical industry could answer that.

Not necessarily placebo. It is known that generic or "bioequivalent" meds sometimes arent as effective as their branded version, even though the active substance is the same. Generally the cause seem to be binders and other stabilizers but honesty havent looked to much into it

There's a medication, I believe an HIV mediciation, that is polymorphic, and only one of the polymorphs actually works for its intended purpose.  Someone linked to a research study about it in one of the MXE threads, which is where I heard about it, can't remember anything specific about it right now though.  To me that suggests that polymorphism could actually have an effect on the subjective effects of a drug.

No, that study you linked talks about genetic polymorphisms, not about structural polymorphisms in the drug. I also remember there was as tudy on alprazolam polymorphisms and how they affected absorption. I'll have to look for it.


EDIT: I found this thought, the FDA definition of structural polymorphism:


[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/02/briefing/3900B1_04_Polymorphism.htm](http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/02/briefing/3900B1_04_Polymorphism.htm)


They do say that differences in the morphology of the crystal could affect stability and even bioavailiability, which makes sense to me. But the fact that the effect's vary wso much between batches seems difficult to explain just by differences in bioavailiability. I would expect only differences in potency. But, like I pointed out a couple of posts ago, differences in the dosing regime (Single high dose, vs small doses through the day, etc...) seem to have an effect in the subjective effects, and considering this molecule is already absorbed pretty slowly judging by it's long winded oral come-up, maybe is not that surprising that differences in bioavailiability and therefore absorption kinects would affect the effects to such an extent. Pretty interesting nonetheless.

Maybe this stuff is so subjective that one would get a new batch, try it, and just by chance it's a rather non-manic trip and one automatically makes the batch responsible for it and then the rest is self-fulfilling prophecy and the whole batch will stay non-manic because one expects it to be non-manic...Well, I obviously find that highly unlikely, but it's just so freaking illogical to me that the same stuff would act differently. I haven't experienced any batch differences myself since I thoughtlessly mixed my batches. But I do recognize a change in effect over time and over situations. Sorry if this is a repeated question but what is the main difference? One batch stimulates and one sedates?

Still feeling quite flat days after use. Do we know what receptors these use and how to recover them? Just general eating healthy, good diet and exercise enough? I am picking back up, slowly. Exercise and meditation is helping lots.


I definitely found this stuff to be quite subjective. But i imagine it's a combination of dose, currently health, wellbeing, mood, exercise, diet, etc etc. I do think it's possible to have some at least minor influence on the effects according to expectations etc. The problem with this stuff is even with a 0.001g scale I think there can still be variances relating to amounts and because it takes so long to get out our system and tolerance I feel like there is a huge margin for error.

^ while this seems interesting, any such properties should be lost, when the compound is in solution. Furthermore, this article I found [http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/01/26/scientists-unveil-new-form-of-matter-time-crystals/](http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/01/26/scientists-unveil-new-form-of-matter-time-crystals/) says that you have to put in energy to make the thing do something in time, which is logical, because initiating motion (acceleration) without putting in energy is not possible.


All I know about chemistry and physics lets me doubt very much that this has any effect on the mechanism of auch action of drugs.

Those time crystals sound pretty manic...


But seriously, I don't see how it's related, and I'm still having trouble with the crystal polymorphism in solutions thing.

The only difference there should be in such a case is for dissolution rates which perhaps may make a difference for whether sublingual absorption or general absorption is rapid for favorable kinetics.


Snorting MXE is so different to oral IMO (seems more like ritalin to me that way than dissociative, at least up until a certain point), of course the main explanation seems to be first-pass metabolism difference between enteral and parenteral, another one could be the kinetics.


All that should be possible to negate by giving your material time to dissolve before taking it, like putting 3-MeO in water before taking it sublingually so that densely packed crystals have been given time to dissolve entirely. If that doesn't solve the different batch mystery, I don't buy that it could be polymorphism.


Those time crystals should lose any such property upon dissolution and how do you expect to pass into the brain and act on your NMDAR etc if it's not entirely dissolved? Also, I really don't think there are accidentally time crystals all over the place?


Just like with DMT etc it's not a good idea to suspect that there are fantastic and secret material / physical properties to a drug because of how astonishing it's actions are in the brain. It's belief that the substances would be astonishing in entirely different ways like that, but very dissatisfying an explanation to a pharmacologist I expect.

Haha true dat


Can't wait for you to share your insanity, is it infectious?

I thought your resolution was to cut back..


I myself am cutting back on even the tiny bit of 3-MeO i use, cause it really appears that my blood pressure gets way too high from the combination of dexamph, even though it's not on the same day. Let alone coming down from an incidental dose of a downer, which also elevates BP. I got popping blood vessels and stuff, it's no bueno. Actually no idea if that also means I shouldn't take DOM or TMA's, not many things have the long half life of PCP compounds.


edit to comment on below: it's not perpetual motion because that kind of motion is not the same as molecular motion. Any substance that is not at absolute zero temperature which is a mythical thing by the way will have moving atoms or molecules and it will have perpetually.

The motion mentioned for the time crystals seems to be a motion seen even at absolute zero, since it does not get it from the environment it seems to be a sort of motion that resonates through time. i think

Aside from the question how perfect zero was achieved, if a laser has to be kept firing then it's not strictly as I say, but I assume it was calculated to have that additional resonance.

This is incredibly fascinating, thanks for that.  It says he's hard-pressed to come up with a practical use for them, and of course I don't really understand the properties of this thing at all, but it seems that it's a perpetual motion machine basically.  I guess it depends on how quickly it moves though.  But if quickly enough, it seems like you could somehow use arrays or structures of them to produce perpetual energy?

Oh I thought it was saying that it has a structure that fluctuates across time in a pattern, like it has a 4-dimensional structure instead of just 3-dimensional.  Which I took to mean that it sort of dances without any input.  The discovery of perpetual motion structures.

It's interesting, it quite feels the opposite to me. During the high I feel active, creative and electric. But when the effects fade, the next days, I'm quite optimistic and happy. It reminds me a little bit of the K / MXE afterglow.


At the beginning, before I found my sweet spot with this drug (1-2mg snorted), I even preferred the afterglow to the effects themselves!

I haven't tried to make a solution with 3-meo-pcp, I'm interested in how doses like 100-500µg would work. Anyone tried?

I have snorted a tiny little bit, I have a tiny, tiny spoon that weighs out to right around 2mg, which I use to dose most of the time, but I divided that into 4 piles and just did one, so estimated around 500ug.  I felt it, it was very mild, and I ended up doing the rest of my 2mg dose.

Curious on anyone that has any experience with 3meo and MDMA/Apbs     Not stacked but staggard, ie taking APB on the tail of 3 meo or taking 3meo on the comedown of APB.


There are a very small number of reports that seem to say doing this is ok.  but I am curious to know if anyone on here has experience.

I've done it staggered both ways and found no reason to suspect danger. 3-meo on the tail end of huge night on 6-apb sure as hell made the comedown mind bending though. While easing the negative effects of the comedown it also made things 10x more strung out in a way. Although the shit ton of good weed probably played a big part of that too...

isn't the main negative effect of a comedown the strung out feeling? what comedown effects did the 3meo help attenuate?


I'm more curious about the mdma on the tail end of 3meo.   As after mdma and the like, I am to spent to do more drugs except downers.  was the roll any different doing it like this?

I think MDMA on the tail end of 3 meo pcp would be fun. You are still kinda disso'd, stimulated, energized, and heeeeeerrrrrrrssss MDMA. What do you mean by tail end? As in T+Xhours dosing schedule.


MDMA/mxe/ket combine wonderfully simulataneously btw (best to add a high dose tryp/phen to take advantage of the situation)


What type of situation/etc are you trying to time this combo for?

I think I have mixed 3-MeO-PCP with almost every drug (MDMA, 4-FA, mephedrone, alcohol, heroin, weed, amphetamine, cocaine, tripts, phens...) without any strange reactions or negative side effects. Of course, the dose of 3-Meo-PCP I usually take is very low (1-2 mg snorted), so this might not hold for higher doses.


I just feel it polishes and smooths the crazy spikes of the other drug. Makes the experience more controlled, less anxious, more euphoric, more "intelligent" and less inebriating. It might be merely due to the positive psychological effects of 3-MeO-PCP, that make me feel more confident and comfortable, or it might be a true neurochemical synergy. I can't tell. 


I also find it very soothing during the comedown of stimulants / empathogens. It just adds a kick of optimism and makes the end much nicer.


I also wonder, being this drug a NMDA antagonist, whether it has any effect in reducing or controlling the tolerance of other substances. I personally don't feel like my tolerance to other substances has decreased, but neither can I say it has increased.

The compound that makes ketamine such a good AD seems to be hydroxylated norketamine, for PCP to turn into PCA (basically nordeschloroketamine) it is only one of many routes of metabolism, and then it's not even hydroxylated yet. And think of the timelines of PCP / 3-MeO metabolism.


Of course there are enough reports of feeling magical or transformed or just plain hypomanic with 3-MeO, but do people also report chronic relief from anti-depression that persists when even the long legged dissociation has worn away? These things are not related and it does not appear that the same sort of mechanisms are responsible at all either.


If you want an anti-depressant like this just micro-dose ketamine. Maybe MXE had the signs but that is already speculation.


Do not use the pleasant feeling from this drug to justify it as a therapy

I think this drug actually can be used therapeutically, but not in the same way as Ketamine is used in clinical trials. Which to be honest, I wouldn't even call therapeutic, more just band-aid-ish. There's no anti-depressant effect on a chemical effect as far as I can tell like with K, and MXE did in fact have it for me as well. I think this is more useful in regards to breaking old habits, starting anew, having the confidence and enthusiasm to really push forward, and that being what causes a therapeutic and lasting change.

I've combined it with a lot of drugs too.  I find that when combined with psychedelics, even in low doses, it will greatly potentiate the psychedelic, to the point that ~65ug of ALD-52 has multiple times sent me into deep trips, one of which resulted in me quitting tobacco.  Mixing with stimulants seems to just make the stimulant more comfortable.  Mixing with alcohol will intensify the alcohol.  Mixing with weed greatly amplifies the weed.

Totally, xammy.


In regards to mixing this with amphetamines, has anyone else besides Solipsis had issues? When I first got my baggie of this stuff about 1.5-2 years ago I started doing doses of 2-6mg in a day along with anywhere from 10-25mg of Adderall, and after a week or two I noticed I'd developed numbness in the two smallest toes of my right foot, as well as numbness in my fingers. The fingers only lasted a day or two, as I only realized I had numbness while tripping on MXE/4-ho-met actually, stopped, and then it went away. Having intuited it must be a blood pressure / related issue having to do with the Adderall and dissociatives. But then the toe numbness lasted for 9-12 months afterwards. It's gone now of course, but it was a bit unnerving.


And that aside, I honestly just have yet to have a good experience comboing either adderall or vyvanse with this, or back in the day, MXE. It's just always seemed to produce this really weird headspace that I don't like at all, where I'm stimulated and my thoughts are moving quickly, but there's a confusion or dumbness that makes everything more difficult than it should be?

The question then is what is hydroxylated norketamine doing in the brain to achieve these antidepressant effects? As far as I know it is about interacting with the 2B subunit of NDMA receptors. Not only ketamine metabolites have these properties. Just look into the novel NMDA antagonists that are in research right now as antidepressants (for instance Rapastinel - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapastinel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapastinel)).

Via mTor 


[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26782056](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26782056)


I'm sure ketamine or rather its metabolites are not unique in this, as I said I am curious about MXE.. But nothing points to 3-MeO-PCP doing this. I've microdosed it for quite a while and it's effects on mood were transient. The typical dosage level and the difference in metabolite alone may make it unsuited as candidate, I guess even though not all that high doses of ketamine are needed for AD effect.


I suggest to be skeptical about it, not despite the signs missing to experiment with it in those ways. To really microdose 3-MeO-PCP would probably run into microgrammage if you make it equivalent, otherwise I think you should be careful not to exacerbate things like depression on a much longer timescale.

It's not a smart idea, seems like you would be better off trying it with very low dose IM deschloroketamine or something.


3-MeO can certainly be magic, but why would you get that enthousiasm mixed up in wanting it to be an AD when there are other options that make more actual sense? Think twice about any 'wonder drug' fantasies.


It's also worth knowing if permatolerance also implies resistance to this mTor mediated AD treatment. Then it would really matter whether you are a long term disso user to even be a real candidate. Does anyone know? Anecdotal evidence would be interesting to hear... I really wouldn't know, it seems permatolerance can partially mean resistance to hole (apparently via hyperpolarization channels with the NMDA antagonism), but not necessarily as high resistance to getting your mind wiped like on diphenidine.

Well, mixing 18mg of 3meo with a few lines of ketamine and two weed joints with my cannabis tolerance lowered was disgusting. It was like the ketamine high was fighting with the 3meo high, and potentiated x10 by the weed, and ended beeing a confusing, dumb trip. 


My mind racing at the speed of light and not beeing able to stop it or canalize that energy because of the ketamine confusion and slowness wasn't fun at all.

Adding just a bit of MXE to 3-MeO turned it into an almost overwhelmingly dissociative trip, too much.  Well it was fun, but damn, unexpectedly intense.

When the dissociation wears off in combos, like 3-MeO-PCP + ketamine, the afterglow is something incredible. I remember laughing until I had tears rolling down to my thighs. Probably because I had just came home from a party with almost all of my close friends present whom I hadn't seen in a long time.

Man, I wasted 500mg ketamine trying to hole like 5 hours after 15mg 3 meo pcp. 200mg ket usually puts me borderline amnesiac. 


I was pissed, 200mg this time just felt like taking another 15-20mg 3 meo pcp. I smartly decided maybe I need another variable, plugged 40mg MIPT and sniffed 250mg more K.


Nada. Ive read others reporting similiar experiences.

> In regards to mixing this with amphetamines, has anyone else besides Solipsis had issues? When I first got my baggie of this stuff about 1.5-2 years ago I started doing doses of 2-6mg in a day along with anywhere from 10-25mg of Adderall, and after a week or two I noticed I'd developed numbness in the two smallest toes of my right foot, as well as numbness in my fingers. The fingers only lasted a day or two, as I only realized I had numbness while tripping on MXE/4-ho-met actually, stopped, and then it went away. Having intuited it must be a blood pressure / related issue having to do with the Adderall and dissociatives. But then the toe numbness lasted for 9-12 months afterwards. It's gone now of course, but it was a bit unnerving.

Yeah, i find that taking 3-meo-pcp even a day or two after dexamphetamine gives me a really unpleasant, confusing dissociation.

I would never combine the two after having this strange effect.

Your last sentence describes it well.

I agree it doesnt mix well with stims. It feels clunky with cathinones, no synergy at all. 


Also the therapeutic benefits are amazing, it really removes all fear.

 I was able to approach an alcoholic issue that has been plaguing me for 10years. Im not yet completely through but have days without alcohol that i couldnt have imagined before 3moepcp ...


Mdma is special for therapy such as understanding and empathy, but this really helps one make a leap of action by removing the fear.

It's very strange.  I need to find myself some of the same stuff I had each time before, I really mostly value the low-dose hypomania aspect of this drug the most.  If I had both I could utilize it either way.  This batch is still mildly euphoric, but just more sparkly, with an MXE-like twinge to the dissociation I have never felt from it before.  But the other 3-MeO I've had consistently produced a very specific, wonderful hypomanic euphoria at any dose, repeated countless times with great reliability.  The dose is the same and the feeling of it is very, very similar.  My friends all agree too.  I don't think I'm imagining this and I think it really is 3-MeO-PCP.  I want to send it in to be tested, but I don't want to spend the money because it's pretty expensive as far as I can tell (never actually done it, and I live in the US).

Hmmm, this thread has nothing to do with meth, this is about 3-MeO-PCP.  Questions about meth should be posed in [Other Drugs](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/forums/58-Other-Drugs), but we don't really allow drug ID threads here since there's no way for anyone to be able to tell.  My best advice is to get yourself a test kit.  If you need detaiuls on how to test meth yourself, go ask in Other Drugs which I linked to.

That's how I felt about it at first too.  I don't really like the dissociation from it, I like low doses.  But it's also probably not for everyone.  It's way different from other dissos, I almost don't even consider it a disso the way I use it.

I don't know if I have the right stuff, or if it's a more sedating batch:


5mg is great for getting stuff done/socializing 

10mg makes me feel a bit drunk

15mg impairs my motor function and makes everything seem like a dream


i haven't insufflated 20mg, but I was expecting some sort of mania.


Is my stuff weak, a different batch, or what?

I think it's really important to remind people using 3-MeO-PCP potentiates other drugs very strongly. I don't smoke weed, drink booze or use other chems except psyches and rarely, and find 20 -30 mg to be sort of unimpressive in effects when snorted. Considerably stronger when taken orally and a richer, wiser overall experience IMO but slow onset and more likely to affect sleep. I usually snort in morning, don't redose and often use it daily for weeks at a time when using. This is an unadvisable regime and there is no good reason to be doing this really. I have a lot of experience with dissos so beginners will find those dosages way too strong! Tolerance is a real thing with these. It didn't produce some of the psychotic or manic symptoms for me in general. Tolerance breaks bring back the magic and it is totally worth it to take week+ long breaks when dosing. I have a lot more fun with it nowadays that I don't use it on weekdays. Great when combined with exercise and or yoga.


Makes me a bit forgetful and confused during the first 3-4  hours, upbeat and mystical in though process but not really manic. Definitely affects my overall intelligence to my detriment, but instincts are good and attitude good natured. It's fun and habit-forming for me and ultimately not worth it when used the way I tend to use it. When mixing that same dose with a psychedelic however, OMG. Be careful. Just wanted to add those disclaimers since my other reports in this thread were a bit more careless.

Spot on mate, that's a pretty much mirror experience of my experience.

I will ad a few pointers too.

Sometimes it can cause very disphoric dizziness. Sometimes I get the munchies on it, sometimes it turns me off food but at least it doesn't make me lose heaps of weight. 

It might be a bit bad on the renal system but if I drink lots of water it seems a bit easier on the renal system.

I get really vivid dreams for the next two nights after a session.

I get hypersexual too.


Be careful with the mania, I've had some really good ideas, and some really good ideas, at the time, which later turn out to be bad ideas. Just hold that thought until your sober.


My favourite thing is what I call 'big hand' when I'm real fucked up, after the initial high wears off i get this feeling when holding things, that there as big as a boulder, but as light as a feather ( I think that is a good description)

Xorkoth had the supposedly 2 different batches analyzed and they were both quality 3-MeO-PCP. I really don't think he is the sort of guy who goofs on judging drug effects either, to put it mildly.


So maybe focus more on the different effects in different people, the role of tolerance to part of the effects, that kind of thing... instead of obsessing about batches. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So whatbdo you guys like so much about 3-meo-pcp that keeps you coming back for more? I tried it in various doses and found it dysphoric, slow and robot like and no "afterglow" that people speak of. I have used real pcp and it is much better than 3 meo. 

    I know alot of people cant get real pcp but a.f.i.k this isnt the best substance to 'hole' on either. So what draws you back to use this? Is it all about the afterglow?

I can't remember it ever being dysphoric for me even though I haven't gotten hypomania from it in quite a while (would be interesting to hear about how many people have first taken 'non-hypomanic' 3-meo for a while and then the 'hypomanic' version - because of tolerance)...

That hypomania made me a big fan, I find it much less interesting now, but it can have some 'magical sparkle' that is just wonderful.


Certainly not for holing, please forget about that and just choose other dissocatives for it.


Afterglow? meh not really for me, coming down can range from smooth to uncomfortable and chaotic for me and can make me insomniac. After that yeah the numb bubble of dissociation can still linger for quite a while which can be pleasant in an analgesic way but it was mostly the hypomania that helped as a pick-me-up.

 The first is a fluffy white crystal powder, and the second be either identical (in my experience) or tan and sandy, which several others on here, including Xorkoth have had. 


The GC/MS report that Xorkoth had done did not show any difference between them, so it's inconclusive at best. I've had both kinds; every batch I've had looked the same.


@Bigazznugz I enjoy it as a stimulant and anti depressant, and it also potentiates psychedelics greatly. It can be recreational on its own but only once you either get accustomed to its effects or gain some tolerance. For a while at the beginning the afterglow was also all that I found useful or enjoyable. And it is generally agreed that seeking a hole with 3meopcp is unwise.

I'm all out and have no intention of getting more, think I've gotten all I can from it. Was nice in low doses or psyche combos, but I'd prefer to just stick to standard psyches, dissociatives were never really my thing anyway.

But IME/O, with cannabis it really shines.

And with psychedelics too.

After mxe went away this was everyone's go to substance as a replacement. It's not even close. It acts more like a manic stimulant at higher doses than a true dissociative. Lost a few friends over this stuff. It's not even very fun and seems to always catch up to everybody in a bad way. For the good of this board I hope this stuff goes away soon. Too many analogues not to find something better without the mania that causes so much destruction in people's lives.

The problem is not the drug, but the people using it. 3-MeO-PCP is an amazing substance if used wisely, one of my favourite ones and really unique, why would you wish any drug to dissapear, just because some of your friends didn't treated it with the respect and caution it needs?


And I'm the worst at managing dissociatives, I need my flatmate to keep them far from home and to just give me a few doses per month. I know I can't control myself, and I would ruin myself if I had free access to my lifetime 3-meo-pcp stash, but not because I have a problem I would hope substances I can't manage to dissapear. It sounds as stupid as wanting alcohol banned worlwide just because I'm an alcoholic, that's selfish.


3-MeO-PCP is fun if treated like it should be treated.


3-MeO-PCP doesn't catch people in a bad way if treated like it should be treated.


Chasing the MXE dragon is worthwhile though, people need to move forward.

I'm sorry this happened to you, but could you elaborate on how this made you lost friends ? Did they became addicted and their personalities changed ? Or did they just got so manic you got into a fight or something ? 


This is a powerful drug for sure, should be respected, but I don't think it is all too dangerous if the necessary precautions (i.e: Don't eyeball and always measure your doses, avoid multiple day usage unless you keep dosages reaaally low, try not to exceed 15 mgs if you don't have a tolerance, don't try to hole on it, keep an eye on your frequency of usage) are taken.

I love this stuff. However, whenever I order some I can't stop myself from getting through 500mg roughly in two days. So I am not letting myself order any more at the moment. I prefer this to my experiences with PCP itself, vastly. Would love to save it but I think recent use has driven my tolerance sky high so I can take a lot without getting totally fucked up. First time I ever took it I took 25mg insufflated, connected with ancient non-human ancestors, realised the nature of reality and couldn't talk for about a day! How things have changed...

^ woah man, that's some serious usage.

I considered 5g to be essentially a "lifetime supply", and i have no compulsion to use it regularly.

Horses for courses, obviously - but christ!  That's a lot of 3-meo-pcp ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

I know. Too much. Which is probably what sent my tolerance skyrocketing. Also, I have very little self-control when it comes to drugs I really appreciate/get a craving for, which includes dissociatives. Except of course sertonergic psychedelics, which i never get a craving for, just a realisation that it is the right time to take some. Sitting on some freshly made DMT at the moment, might give some of that a try.

I can't imagine how you could even take that much in 2 days.  I feel like I would die or become catatonic at least before then.  I've been using this for like 2 years now, pretty regularly, and I still use no more than 15-20mg in a day if I'm going hard and trying to get really weird.  Usually it's 4-6mg.

Well, doses are usually very spaced out and I do give a few lines to mates. Might not be that much, maybe the last 500mg I bought lasted to 'binges' of about 2 days each. Certainly way too quickly though. I was definitely very out of it and probably fairly manic! But when I started things were exactly the same. My usage of DXE and ketamine has also increased a fair bit recently. I like DXE too, but it doesn't have the magic of this one. How are you doing Xorkoth, happy and well I hope?

Fwiw I blacked out on the second day of a 3-meo-binge (lots of consecutive low doses) after mixing with a load of beer and came to after some very confused tripping to find I'd gotten through nearly a gram minus some spillage. I suspect i took it as one massive dose, as the peak effects actually only lasted about a day although I was feeling off and incredibly depressed for about a week. I don't have much memory of the peak apart from some vague recollection of stumbling about thinking I was in a dream - no idea if I was holed or just stumbling about really fucked.  I had some very serious kidney issues in the first couple of days following where I couldn't urinate at all and started to get a red puffy face from toxin build up. Seriously horrific, but I made full recovery quite quickly.


Still though, point is doses this size *probably* won't kill you but very nasty health complications start to show up at this dose.

Do any of you folks taking masses of this stuff (and other dissos) ever get bloodwork done to check for any issues?


Specifically, vitamin b12?

Deficiencies of that can be really serious, and dissociatives are known to deplete it...which freaks me out as a person that lives on a plant-based diet (vegans also risk this without taking dissociative drugs) - so i got my gf who is a nurse to give me a shot of b12 not long ago.

Yeah, I am definitely not recommending ploughing through anywhere near as much as I did in such a little space of time. I am not always particularly smart when it comes to disciplining my drug use. But never had symptoms like you ordinary mind, they sound really quite serious!

Fuck, I'm  a hard dissohead, but half a gram should last like a year not a weekend!


I could snort half grams of ketamine and don't feel anything, but NiceEnough be careful with this shit, you can end in a veeeeery dark alley easily! It's not as friendly for the body and mind as ketamine/MXE/2-OxO-PCM could be, such high doses of 3-meo-pcp could provoke some serious damage.

Thanks mate, I do realise that (should know better!), been using for a fair while. I don't think I ever took more than 100/150mg over the course of 24 hours, with regular gaps of 4-8 hours, thinking about it. But still way too much for sure.

Very few dissociatives do much to me these days. Which is why I am going for ultra potent stuff like DXE or 3-Meo. But Ketamine kind of buzzes me a bit if its good quality.

It happens the same to me, but I don't feel 2-OxO-PCM (DXE?) potent at all, and tried a lot of batches. For sure, more potent than ketamine, but I still need to take huge doses to feel anything. I go with 20mg 3-meo-pcp or 25mg 2-oxo-pce oral dose usually and it does the trick ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I just feel it is essential to remind casual lurkers of this fact.

A lot of the warnings about the serious potency and risk of this stuff is buried back in previous threads.

...now we're getting the train wreck stories (typical for RC dissociative threads, sadly).


20mg for a first-timer could be absolutely disastrous.

Luckily mines not a train wreck story, just a tale of lack of self-control and the necessary steps needed to regain itl. But yeah, these are not starting doses. 5mg of 3-Meo-PCP still has an effect and a much better place to start exploring. After allergy test of course

Great - that's good to hear.

I figured a supplement  (administered IM) couldn't hurt in my case because my diet has little in the way of b12, and[deficiencies can cause some really nasty health problems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12_deficiency), and you can't have too much - but it's definitely something for disso enthusiasts to be mindful of.

So, I decided to give this stuff a little test run. I have zero tolerance and practically zero experience with dissos.

My scale had no batteries so I ended up eyeballing a tiny amount with the tip of a knife (I know, I know, I won't do it again, but I just thought "what the hell!") and insufflated it. I could feel a slight burn, so I don't think I will be snorting this anymore when upping the dose. The headspace kicked in 10 minutes later, a floaty dissociation, not unlike ketamine. No other effects noticed.

I have the tan sandy batch. I also noticed a slight chemical smell.

Keep going. Do bumps like that every 45-60 minutes until you reach a place you like. It burns slightly for all of us, but it doesn't seem to cause any acute adverse effects.

Psy997, i agree with keep going for an experienced user wanting to push it, however, i disagree with this as advise to someone new to this wonderful chem.


I would maybe try a second dose 45 min later of similiar size and stop again.


Wait another session and dose slightly more and see. This chem take at least 3 or 4 goes of someone experienced with many differing drugs to start to understand. Because it is bit harder to work out, the worst thing to do is take bigger doses. BE PATIENT, and learn through at leadt 3 or 4 successful sessions.


This is easier if accur6stely measured but still applies.

Something about 3meopcp, it really takes several (more than 2) successful experiences to start to understand. 


I specifically say start, as it does take more than this to love and work with easily.

Please, don't recommend to someone that tried 3-meo-pcp eyeballing it, and without dissociative experience or tolerance, to keep doing this. This is not good advice at all.


3-meo-pcp is a powerful chemical, and abuse or misuse can lead to some important problems. Even a disso hardhead like me, with a scale and redosing just 10mg after some 5-10mg bumps, ended up in a state that I don't desire to anyone. I have seen friends having hard, really nasty experiences with just 15mg of this chem.


This is not reddit and HR should be our dogma, don't encourage anyone to do crazy stuff.

I was advocating bumps of 1-2mg every 45-60 minutes, not 5-10mg bumps. I should have added more a disclaimer, but I really don't see any problems occurring for anyone if used this way. It's simply too little of a dose each time to ever amount to a negative or overpowering experience, if kept to the schedule.

I've had some strange things happen while using large doses of this stuff, a lot are not good but this is the second time this has happened in about ten days. ASMR, ive left a link here for everyone. [https://healdove.com/disease-illness/ASMR](https://healdove.com/disease-illness/ASMR)

There might be more to this mania thing than just some recreational drug users sharing experiences on bluelight.


My asmr experience could be a secondary effect because of finally sleeping after the insomnia caused by 3-meo-pcp, either way it was a very pleasurable experience

Yeah sorry, this appears to be a general bug: afaik when you try to press edit the command is not interpreted correctly and you exit the screen deleting your post. Not sure if I can speak for bluelight but at least for PD: if you are on mobile just make new posts to point out what you wanted to edit and mention 'am on mobile'. A mod should realize that when this is done *within reason, when fairly big posts are concerned*, an exception to the double posting guidelines can be made. I don't want to be spending my nights and holidays merging you guys' posts, but having a fairly large post disappear is bound to be much more frustrating.

I'm toying with the idea of trying this again. My trials several years ago were cut short after an IV dose of 15 mg humbled me.


One interesting thing about that experience though. At the time, I was addicted to heroin. One thing I thought about a lot while I was tripping from that shot, was how I really needed to quit H. And, somehow, I was able to not use any for three days after that 3meopcp experience.

If you do, I suggest trying consecutive low doses, much lower, like 2-3mg each.  Titrate up.  Although if you plan to IV I wouldn't really recommend IVing yourself over and over.  I like titrating via small snorted doses.  Makes it a lot more manageable, no big surprises if you leave 2 hours between doses.  You build up to a great place slowly.  You can go a little higher with the doses if you like getting dissociated but personally I prefer this one for the stimulating/functional properties, the way it alters your cognition and energy in a subtler way, and using others for dissociation.

My favorite way to take it is one 5-6 mg oral dose followed by a second one two hours latter. 

When the second dose kicks in, the second peak is much more energetic and euphoric.


If you take it orally the come-up can take up to an hour and a half, so if your plan on redosing you better dose early in the day or prepare to be up until pretty late.

It totally does, much like other arylcyclohexylamines, have the ability to attenuate opioid withdrawal symptoms like some sort of 'grey' magic. I went through suboxone withdrawal in December using 3meo on-and-off during the first week of withdrawal. It was super spirit-lifting, energizing and anesthetic. I was singing like I never have before, soothing my heart by channeling songs from my soul that had been crying to be let out for years, but the suboxone kept me from reaching that level of personal connection. It was very bright in every way...until New Years day. I had too strong of a trip, a story for another day, and had to lay off it for awhile. I've only used it twice since then but remain off suboxone. 

It was a reminder that 3meo is not as therapeutically forgiving as ketamine, MXE and friends, especially after consecutive days of use. But at the same time, it tuned my inner light right quick, and for that I cherish its power.

So much happened on that night...the crazy started before midnight on the new year. I woke up from a nap, pondering the concept of polycarbonate dreams. Visions and sounds of celebrating with bubbly drinks and fireworks, lovers embracing lovers, cliche stuff, but it was thick in the air that night. Every hour I felt another time zone in the collective conscious erupt in celebration, and this became more intense after midnight on my end as my redose of 3meo took my trip to the beyond. At one point I had a battle with my shadow and ended up with a busted lip...some hard realizations/downloads I was given by what I concluded was my higher power, that there was only one path and I need to get with the program, lest I continue to lose my battles with my shadow. By 4 or 5 AM the psychosis was becoming ever-more hard to manage. I had not been sleeping enough the previous week because of the suboxone withdrawal. My psyche was wide open to anything, and my body was somewhat weak which did not help the color of the experience. I started hearing things, like a constant 'wee-ooo wee-ooo' that made me think there was some sort of extradimensional spacecraft orbiting me, maybe keeping me safe, maybe waiting to harvest my soul if I ended up dying. LOL, like I said, my psyche went every which way, often simultaneously. When I turned on music, that helped greatly- I highly recommend some laid back grooves if you are having a hard trip, it really helps to pace it and distract the mind from looking too deeply inwards. As the sun rose and I was greeted by a new year things looked up for a few hours, until I came down from the residual high of feeling reborn and began to experience a very harsh physical detoxification process that hit very quickly and intensely. A week of drug use and not enough sleep or food, and the peak of sub withdrawal all at once, combined with trying to resolve some of the darker parts of the trip became just too much. For instance, in visions I gleaned some of the my many possible futures, including one leading to my death. On a positive note, I saw on my horizon that I would be moving back to Tucson AZ in the spring- as long as I survived- and sure enough the plans solidified just 2 days ago to leave at the end of this month. Cheers

I holed on this drug yesterday.  didn't think it was possible but it is.  It was an oral dose and i had been dosing the past 3 days prior.  It was very much like an mxe hole.

This thread has been real quiet lately. Has it lost its luster and everyone is onto newer analogues? I agree that it can quickly lose magic for anyone who uses it too frequently. I'd put this drug in the dose timing similar to classic psychedelics- after the honeymoon, the best effects can only be achieved if used only sporatically, like once every few weeks or so. I jumped back into it a couple days ago after months of abstinence and it definitely got me to the outer realms on the first night (WOW!), but re-dosing doesn't even work as well as it used to. I took more today and it barely gave me a ping. Looks like I need to hold back for at least a few days, or more like a week. Its one of those drugs that I wish could be used semi-regularly, but the reality is that after hitting hard., it takes quite a while to get tolerance back to a place that makes it worthwhile.

I was gonna cop this but out of fear of going ballistic like last time i had a gram and upcoming piss tests for employment (I probably will have to work again at some point, I was gonna retire but SSDI is kind of low at age 30, I'll probably just take a break and work again under the limit + under the table on side) I went for the 3-meo-pce. The O-PCE made me sleep through alarm clocks, I gather the 3-meo-pce is more stimulating. I could wake up after 2-4 hours sleep no problem with the 3-meo-pcp

Yes it seems the 2'-oxo's including ketamine have a bit of a trend of being anaesthetic. Apparently because of affinity for hyperpolarization channels, going by K.


3-MeO-PCE is rather stimulating yes - gives me mad mania actually, but then again PCE itself is also supposed to be stimulating and some say 3-MeO-PCP and PCP are quite comparable.


I hated the stoning tail end of O-PCM / DCK... it was a short trip and a really long physical debilitation and shit feeling. Coming out of such anaesthesia is not usually considered recreational unless there were opioids involved, things like propofol and halothanes aside.

I find myself having a similar reaction.  I feel like taking it less often now because it's better if I do it less often.  Also, I don't seem to get the increase in positive hypomanic feelings in successive days as much.


I bet plenty of people are still using it, but maybe there's just been so much said already.

Yeah, probably that. I used it two night ago, actually. Went dancing with a girl, had lots of fun. Before going back home we smoked some cannabis and things got weird for a while, we had to sit on a bench and talk about how the street lights change the colors of the world at night.

It takes me to a nice place, but i don't really have a whole lot to say about it.

The way i've found use for this stuff is pretty solitary (and interesting) but not really something i have any urge to try to articulate.

Also; i seem to have unusually trippy/dissociative material, as opposed to a lot of people who use it like a stim.

Makes it hard to discuss because it is like they are two different drugs.

I treat it much like i used mxe - as a dissociative psychedelic (always with weed) which seems kind of anomolous.

Indeed a weird drug.  What doses do you use?  I like to do literally 1mg at a time, it's very subtle but the alteration it produces is useful.  I find 2mg at a time good too, but a little more drug-like.  1mg is quite subtle.

Yeah stacking doses is also how I usually do it. Hoping to get some in the near future so I'll revive the thread with my manic insights and generalized views if I do get it! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) SJ your stuff sounds very interesting.

I've got some of that batch, the one that reminds me of MXE kind of.  It still feels like 3-MeO also, but much trippier and more dissociating in a way that reminds me of MXE.  Got both samples GC/MS and both were pure 3-MeO-PCP.  See further back in the thread for that.

Huh, weird, I have never noticed any bladder issues with 3-MeO despite using it quite a lot.  Maybe because my doses are so low (1-2mg per bump).

I always make sure to drink lots of water, it makes me feel pretty dehydrated.


I feel like I've explored this one enough / isn't going to offer anything new - not something I want to do on a near-daily basis anymore (namely because I borderline lost my shit for a couple of weeks due to my own recklessness) - but it's still nice in sporadic low doses here and there.

I kind of have to hold myself back from using this whenever I go out. I love the way it provides just the right about of social lubrication without feeling too spun (unless I take too much, which I've done on several occasions). I'm still definitely an outlier as I regularly take ~12mg.


This past weekend I took that amount and a half tab of acid for a boat party, and after smoking some weed it felt like I took much more than the half tab. I love the way these drugs combine.

Wow, 3-MeO-PCP is something special.


I dosed 5.5mg early afternoon Sunday to see how it fares for outdoor activity, my second dose in the last couple months. Went out for a bike ride on a fairly long local trail, and felt a smooth and steady buildup of confidence and euphoria, to a plateau around 3 hours in, where something just clicked. I felt absolutely content and just happy to be alive, but without overwhelming energy—I was able to channel the hypomania into my exercise routine. Got home and spent some time chilling in bed, listening to music, before spending the comedown prepping dinner.


It’s a bit challenging to articulate. I’m not normally a confident person—I tend to hesitate and second-guess myself when confronted with just about any decision. 3-MeO-PCP obliterates that feeling and replaces it with a profound, self-affirming attitude—“I love life. I love myself. I’m motivated to do more.”


I was sorely tempted to dose again Monday, but avoided doing so. This is a powerful drug for introverted, less self-confident people; I plan to watch my use very carefully—once weekly at most.

Malmet, welcome to the magic that is this holy trinity of you and me together into we. It has been an essential supplement the last few days. I take back what I said about using it sporadically. Sometimes its the perfect remedy, continuously in-taking can be spiritually regenerating.

its been with different batches also. I threw another batch away thinking it was just that....but nope, other batches do it to me also.  It only seems to happen if I do it a few days in a row but still troubling.

So I placed an order for five grams of 3-meo today and am a bit apprehensive about which type I am going to receive. I have been wanting to explore this compound for quite some time now, but am uncertain whether I am going to get the fluffy white substance that is known to produce more sedating, dissociating effects, or the tan sandy substance known to cause more of the manic, less dissociating stimlike effects. I understand that they are both stimulating, but am hoping to receive the white fluffy as opposed to the tan sandy.


The reports/experiences I have read about on here throughout the various megathreads written about 3-meo seem to vary greatly depending on the individual, the dose, and the type injested. I understand that this is not a drug that can be considered a replacement for MXE, but I have tried various different batches and although they were always a bit different in effect when compared side by side, there never was a batch I can say I particularly did not enjoy, though I certainly preferred the more sedating, floaty ones compared to the more stimulating, glidey versions.


3-meo has been around for a while now, and I am wondering what batches seem to be the most prevalent these days. Also I have a scale that I weigh my RCs on, that being a Gemini 20, but it's impossible to accurately weigh out a dose as low as 1-2 mgs on it. Would it be safer just to make a solution and dose orally with a syringe? It seems many experienced users here prefer to insufflate 3-meo, which is not my usual preferred ROA when it comes to dissos or tryptamines. I have always had much more profound experiences just simply eating MXE as opposed to putting it up my nose. Same goes for tryptamines such as 4-HO-MET or 4-AcO-DMT. Why do people like insufflating it so much? 


My motive in ordering this specific disso is actually to help with some issues with depression and anxiety I have been having. Even when I did use MXE daily it was never to hole on it, but for the therapeutic benefits I got from it by microdosing. I also did enjoy the recreational value it provided in higher doses ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) But I understand 3-meo isn't like that, and I plan on proceeding with the utmost caution. I also have a large order of various lysergamides and tryptamines coming my way soon, and after reading the reports here about the beautiful synergy experienced when combined with compounds like ALD-52 and 1p-LSD, my interests have peaked.


Thanks for taking the time to read this and any feedback is greatly appreciated ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I also find that MXE is far better orally.  I also find that 3-MeO-PCP is a better dissociative experience at higher doses orally than nasally, however, I like the fact that nasal admin is more stimulating and kicks in quicker, for small doses for therapeutic/motivation purposes I like it better.  It's also less wonky and more physically enabling nasally.  It's more potent orally IMO, like MXE.


Not everyone even agrees about the batch variance, but for me it's pretty clear.  Can't comment on which is more prevalent, the first 2 times I got it it was hypomanic and stimulating, then the next time it was more dissociating and wonky.  Then my friend found the stimulating batch again and I got a bit from there, it's been a while even since that.

I've only taken the manic batch. I must say, recently ive found the mania a bit uncomfortable. I've gotten to quite dissociated states from it and enjoyed the stimmy afterglow but often need a benzo or GHB to settle. 


I'd like to try this more trippy batch, it sounds interesting.


 I don't understand how two different batches of the same drug exist...

sounds like a good idea, and probably much more accurate than what i sometimes do, which is to weigh 10mg and divide it into 4.

i dislike snorting most drugs, and this is no exception.

i personally think the effects of orally dosing this one are far, far superior - you just have to be patient and aware of the long come-up.

for me it generally seems to take between 75 and 90 minutes to kick in, but if you plan ahead, this should cause no problem.  it actually can be quite handy - if you're going out to a club, for example, you can dose at home and arrive at the place, get through the door staff/security etc and into the club, whilst showing no signs of intoxication (and not be carrying anything), only to have it kick in a little later.


not that i make a habit of doing this (done it once or twice) -  but it's just an example.  

frankly, it makes you pre-plan your 3-meo-pcp trips, which isn't such a bad thing; it's not something i tend take on a whim, but having said that, it is fairly versatile, and i've had good experiences with both low doses (as i go about my day or take it to 'enhance' my experience of something else, such as taking ~2mg and meeting a friend to chat over a coffee) and high doses, lying down with my eyes closed, listening to music.


the latter is definitely quite a commitment of time, so i treat it like a psychedlic trip, rather than an enhancer of more mundane daily activities.

each to their own though, obviously.


just be careful and treat it with great respect - as you will have noticed reading this thread, it can really turn on you if you don't.

i've never tried the 'speedy' stuff, but i really love the batch i have.  i got 5g years ago, and at the rate that i use it, i suspect it'll last me for decades, because i don't binge on it for days or weeks on end.

i've never taken it more than twice in a week, i don't think - and usually go weeks, even months between doses.


at that level of use, it's lovely stuff.

i personally have no desire whatsoever to "push" it to see what the limits are, because IME it is nowhere near as forgiving as something like MXE.


i'll be keen to hear what you think of it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I also think 3-meo-pcp is a lot better orally than snorted. This really applies to all the legal dissos. I take it like if it was LSD, plan my day arround it, do only one dose and commit to it without redoses. Snorting is handy on some ocassions without free time or for a less potent high.


I don't believe on that thing of the two batches. I tried 4 different batches before buying this last one that should last me years, and all they were very manic and stimulating. This last batch evolved from manic and stimmy to more dissociating over the months, and I believe it has something to do with the lose of the magic, tolerance development and higher doses.

^ maybe you've just never got your hands on the non-stimmy stuff?

the stuff i have isn't stimulating in the slightest.  it's a dissociative, with a real psychedelic edge.  it's reminiscent of mxe in some ways (in my opinion, at least - though my arylcyclohexylamine experience is really only MXE, ketamine, DXM and 3-meo-pcp so i'm far from an experienced connoisseur of the dissociative class) but with some very big differences too.


the effects, for me, haven't changed a great deal since i tried it.  and yeah, i've only tried one batch from the single, large (in terms of number of doses, not quantity) order i made when i bought it.

i've tried xorkoth's method of snorting small amounts throughout the day, but it didn't have the effects he describes.


i assumed that i had either got some different or contaminated drug - or that there was some metabolic reason for the fact that my stuff seemed to have different effects, but still in a very low dose range with other similarities to what other people report - like the 1-1.5 hour come-up.


it's got me totally stumped, but i know nothing about pharmacology.  it seems to me like most people encounter the speedy manic stuff, and i'm one of the few that hasn't come across it at all.  to me, 3-meo-pcp is a fairly lucid but still very powerful dissociative.


i wish i could try the speedy stuff, but i'm perfectly happy with what i've experienced with the stuff i've got. 

RCs can be tricky/risky to import into australia (customs seize a lot) so i stopped doing it, so i suppose i won't be able to see if other batches give me manic effects, which is a shame.

The only reason I almost always dose it nasally is because I hardly ever use it for dissociation.  I don't like feeling dissociated that much usually, it's a rare thing for me, but the stimulating and motivating properties of it really appeal to me more regularly and those properties are brought out more by nasal admin.  I totally agree that as a dissociative it's better orally, and also more potent.  Much fuller effect in the body and mind, just like MXE.  But it makes me feel more intoxicated which I'm just not usually going for.  I prefer MXE for dissociation and I still have a little bit of it so on the rare occasion I go for dissociation I tend to use that.

Yeah dude, Xorkoth and I share I dare say an affinity for how we supertriangulate with this gem, the method of ROA speaks for itself, something about it and the ol'factory sustem, stimulating to an N'th degree, like nine inch nails erasering, seeing a new era of pentatonic hexagonic merkaba'ing. I'm vortechsing.

A few years ago, I IVed about 15mg of this and had a little mini freak out. I wound up making a thread here while I was still zonked. Everyone was super nice, and helpful (unlike reddit assholes). One person suggested square breathing and ever since I've used that a lot to deal with anxiety in my daily life.


I was in the middles heroin addiction at that time, but somehow manged to stay off h for 3 days after the trip. I had such intense feelings of guilt due to my h use while I was tripping. I am still impressed by that and it makes me think this compound might have real therapeutic potential.


Anyway, enough time has passed that I think I'm ready to try it again, but obviously a lower dose and different roa.

How much did you take, what happened and how do you figure it's neurotoxic?


I agree though that it can cause serious fuck-ups which have been reported on this forum, and yeah drink a lot of water. Convulsions require very high dosages and many of these compounds can cause that, except ketamine. You make it sound like it's impossible to use responsibly, yet I have been fine by just lowballing it virtually every time. But yeah if you aren't careful it can wreck your life.


I don't really use it anymore though, it lost it's sparkle...

> 			I just want to warn anyone who might want to try 3-MeO-PCP that it is EVIL. Any light you gleen from it is a carefully crafted and dangerous lie. Dont let it trick you. It is from the dark side and if you are predisposed to any mental health issues, well here is a great way to trigger them. The bliss you might experience from this drug is not worth the extreme risk it carries. It only takes a little to cross the threshold, enter complete psychosis, and totally lose yourself. It can destroy a person's life in one night. Unless you want that, I highly recommend you steer clear of this drug. There are enough analogs that you can find that dont carry the same dangers. Please be responsible if you do take it. Only leave a small amount out so, in case you redose without realizing, you won't overdose. Make sure you have someone looking out for you. Make sure you don't have anything breakable or important in the room. DO NOT DO THIS DRUG IN PUBLIC. Stay somewhere safe. Ideally, you should be wearing comfortable clothing and have lots of pillows or rugs around in case you go into convulsions, which can last for hours. Drink lots of water. When you come down, do aftercare for yourself, too, especially for your brain. Omega 3s, ginko biloba, green tea, etc. The neurotoxic effects are real. This drug is no fuck-around. It demands respect. It is a slice of heaven and an eternity of hell. It destroyed my relationship and I wish I had never heard of it.

Honestly, this drug is nice and subtle when used responsibly. One thing is to take 5-10mg of this drug once in a while and another thing is abuse the shit out of it like if it was ketamine, like your boyfriend did, and take 50mg doses (I can't even think about what that dose can do, at 20mg I lose my shit completely rubbing the overdose, and I would never go higher than that even if they paid me... That, with a very high permatolerance to dissos)


Also, this drug has got long legs, so it's not for taking everyday if you love your mental and physical health. Reading the big&dandies about this one will teach you that a lot of people here were already warning about those issues, it can for sure be taken responsibly.


Sorry if I'm sounding harsh, but the whole "alcohol/heroin/ketamine/cocaine is EVIL" thing just angers me, drugs are not good or wrong, drugs are just drugs, and there is up to the human beeings to take them in a "benign" or "evil" way.


I'm sorry about your boyfriend addiction and lack of self control, I trully see myself reflected there, I was there, done that. But I never blamed drugs, only myself was the problem.

Uplift you gotta downshift responsibly to avoid hitting yourself head-on with a tree...no differently than alcoholic spirits which humanity still has trouble wielding after millennia of fermented fleek...I'll give you that, you have half of the story, and it bears repeating for HR's sake: reserve this pig-in-shit for well-tuned set and settings, I.e. a healthy dose of dissociate experience...welcome to folding...respect it like a church just like your body, a molecular sacrament describbling the Blood of BuddhaChrist and the fucking Lucid Light of Luciferian Technology, all rolled into one...try putting this cat back in the bag, like substance D from A Scanner Darkly. Seriously the potential to accelerate conscious evolution, it has already made it Mark, spelled out in coordinates, a delivery from a stork, it will go down in history as divinity and infamy, the holy grail of chem-trail yin yang water-dowsing flames. PKD, I wonder his experience with the progenitive relative of its time- PCP- as a starring role in his novel inspirational musings. PCP, as I understand, it is even harder to triangulate. The 3-methoxy provides some sort of ethereal bass-toned base foundation for 2020 revelation...like hula-hooping kundalini chi. It will be a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, a Care Bear stare of Voltron assembling, Vytear-piercing high-frequency waves when we come together with the pieces of this puzzle. 


In the wise words of an Imagined Dragon (I'm paraphrasing) 'Welcome to the New Age', feeling the all-chemical reaction filling our phallus like a chalice cup of offering, audiences everywhere- ladies and gentlemen- we are sipping radioactive cancer-killing creativity.

I've been using a decent dose every couple weeks to treat depression. Its like clockwork that the depression returns a week or two later almost at once and persists until the next dose.   Does anyone think that the 1-2 week lasting antidepressant effects from a single decent dose are due to residual 3meo or some kind of lasting modification in brain chemistry?  What are the theories for why this works?  


I guess its the same way they are using ketamine for depression.  But pcp has that added SRI and DRI activity and is harder to eliminate. What are the reasons for this effect?


I wish there was something shorter lasting that worked (maybe I should try K) this way. I would often prefer to fix my depression without having to be intoxicated for 6+ hours on 3meo.  I'm not messed up too badly but reading comprehension can be compromised on the day of 3meo...does K get you back to a totally normal brain function more quikcly? If it does it might be too addictive...the deterrent of not being able to sleep on 3meo and "wasting" so much time treating my depression keeps it to be used almost mainly for that purpose...unless I'm doing fun or "going out" but I can't get the dose high enough in that context to get the full antidepressant effect

I was just talking about this, how the brain circuitry persists for days, trailing off over the course of a week, maybe two if you tune it right. When I get my church off the ground, I think it would be a wise thing to help the community, to or each using the sacrament, say, once a week in a spiritual setting, collectively, in a way that creates a strong resonance that rings for the entirety of the rest of the week, building up circuitry gradually, responsibly, in a way that lets us more easily integrate it into our 'default' lives. 


Another experiment I have been working on, and I recommend others take a look, is timing my cycles of use with my biorhythms. 'Personal Biorhythms' for Android, using the 'more precise algorithm' has been the most consistently accurate for me and other subjects I do readings for. For instance, the last week or two my biorhythms were in a big rut, and it was synchronistic that the timing aligned with my disso and psychedelic 'on' cycle, supplementing my energy levels in a way to bring them up to speed. The next week or so I'm having a peak alignment, so my levels will be just dandy as a lion, mane-lining source code 'naturally'...a word I use loosely. For instance, tramadol- a molecule that was thought to be exclusively synthetic (meaning not occurring naturally)- was discovered recently to be present in some African plant. I'm just wildly speculating here, but how is it not possible that 3-meo-pcp could be a naturally-derived molecule on an extraterrestrial planet, and when we ingest it, our 'akashic neural lace' interfaces with a sort of non-local quantum-entangled extraterrestrial consciousness...and even if it isn't naturally derived, this mechanism could still be possible if there is an alien race that happens to share our affinity for dissociatives...I mean, it would perfectly explain some of the weirdest downloads retrieved in these altered states...Dissociatives by their very definition have the ability to tune us into out-of-body consciousness all around us and in (I believe) non-locally, meaning any fucking where in time and space, ancient and future, so it really isn't that unbelievable...one specific effect dissos have is have to put me in an undeniably-real flow state, where part of me is ahead of time, enabling me to freestyle with musicians or even the radio and complete people's sentences in a way that is nothing short of mystical, like I'm at the point where songs I've never heard before I sing along perfectly to, the words, rhythm AND melody... food for thought!

I want a few grams of 3-meo-pcp for when I'm old and dying. Better yet, 3-meo-pce (and hey, some mxe, while I'm dreaming) to alternate and combine with it. Go out like a fuckin comet.


Probably I shouldn't have it on hand in the interim though.

In another Dimension, space and time cease to exist, only *3*-meo-pcp remains. The structure of all existence is based on this molecule, Gods and Mortals are the same. 


A **Divinity** **trio-circularity**. *33* mg every day for the past *3* years. You get *333*. 


Phantasmal experience, otherworldly. 


Perhaps an extraterrestrial race is based solely from the etches and rivers of 3meo bliss.  Perhaps Oblivion is the only reality. 


                                                                                                             Based around an ever increasing energy, we find matter and energy are the Base of All Creation in this known reality.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gods are with me now

Whoa, amber is the color of 3meo energy

whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

you glide through my head blind to fear

whoa, amber is the color of your energy

whoa, like ET's sky lights above AZ

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy

3meo rings like a bell anyway

don't give up your independent research

I really don't get how people are getting so far down the rabbit hole with this stuff... Granted, my experience with 3-MeO-PCP was somewhat limited, but it really didn't feel divine or spiritual in any way. If anything it was quite the opposite, and quite dark, almost mechanical in nature. I didn't dare try to hole on the stuff but I can't imagine the 3-MeO-hole would be anything but bleak terror, and very far from the inspired psychedelic poetry in this thread.


Also, what is the deal with the different batches? Do we have any theories? If it's the same molecule, the batches can't be different, surely. I think I might remember reading earlier on in this thread that someone had 2 different batches tested, and they both came back as relatively pure 3-MeO-PCP. If this is the case, then the difference in effects must be something isomeric, right?


Going by what we know of ketamine, one could surmise that S-3-MeO-PCP is the more psychedelic variety, and R-3-MeO-PCP is the more stimulating, less psychedelic variety. Does this make sense?


Either way I am feeling like I missed out because I definitely got the stimulating stuff (R isomer or whatever it might be) and based on the descriptions of others in this thread, this seems to be the colder, scarier, and far less entheogenic variant.

There are no S and R isomers of due to the cyclohexyl ring effectively being symmetrical on both sides with respect to that carbon center.  Thus there is no possibility of different enantio- (or stereo) isomers.   


Positional isomers are a big probability.  And since a positional isomer is likely the same exact mass (and mass fragments) as normal 3meopcp and shares similar chromatographic properties, there is a very good chance it could be going unnoticed during GCMS/LCMS analysis.  also, 3 OH PCP is a candidate for a different mass culprit I believe.  I doubt that these analytical labs go through any kind of rigor trying to ID positional isomers or synthetic byproducts.  Why would they?  They are getting paid to tell you which designer drug is present, nothing more.


and the 3meohole is beautiful, total revelation and bliss, a feeling of coming home.  I've only holed on it once but it was actually more 'comfortable" than an mxe hole to me...but yet thats probably because I had the hindsight experience of many mxe holes before i holed on pcp


granted mxe just feels safer and better overall by far

I tripped far out last night.

Still getting a grip on what happened.

Was almost ready to commit myself to the asylum.

Was pretty damm sure I died.

I'm still here.

Be careful if you can't handle hard trips on this stuff is all I can say.

What a good night...only the hard trippers will feel what I'm saying.

3-meo-pcp what a wonderful beast.

Lol 30mg is full on.

I read this during "some challenges " from diphenidine so felt somwhat in line!


Glad you ok, was it 30 mg straight up? If so thats massive.

Can you post details?

Did about 30mg.

Thought I was edging from mania to psychosis.

Holed really hard, not ego death, literally thought I was dead, afterlife sucked really bad too. 

I'm still hear, and loving life.

Go hard or go home...very bad way to put it considering harm reduction and all that. 

Great trip to be honest. But you get what you give.

I don't like being so vague when posting but I'm high on life now and last night was really hard to put into words.

A very psychedelic experience too, fine line between the hole and the astral plane. Wow. 

I should dig up that thread about having your ass kicked by a chemical.

I was googling should I commit myself to a mental institution before I thought I had died.

Sounds wild man. I had a good night too with some of the clover's cousins, first time combining o-pce and 3-meo-pce.


Hopefully I'll have some 3-meo-pcp soon too. dont know if ill ever dare 30 mg tho. that a lot!!

And since a positional isomer is likely the same exact mass (and mass fragments) as normal 3meopcp and shares similar chromatographic properties, there is a very good chance it could be going unnoticed during GCMS/LCMS analysis.  also, 3 OH PCP is a candidate for a different mass culprit I believe.  I doubt that these analytical labs go through any kind of rigor trying to ID positional isomers or synthetic byproducts.  Why would they?

Ah, I see. My knowledge of chemistry is not that great but a little googling seems to reveal that when you speak of a "positional isomer", this is essentially a different chemical, ie, 2-MeO-PCP or 4-MeO-PCP, am I right? Neither of those 2 seem to fit the profile however. I actually agree with you following a little research that 3-HO-PCP (Methoxidine?) is probably the best candidate as it is active at a similar dosage range to 3-MeO-PCP and generally more sedating and/or psychedelic, however I have not tried this chemical myself.


Can anyone who has experience with a wide range of x-PCP/x-PCE type chemicals, and ideally, 3-HO-PCP/3-OH-PCP itself, confirm that their experience matches that described by many people in this thread?


Also, LucidSDreamr, when you talk of the the 3-MeO-hole, which variety of this chemical was it that you are referring to?


I think that as a community we really do need to get to the bottom of what is going on here, and people really need to start clarifying exactly what variety of alleged "3-MeO-PCP" they are talking about when they describe their experiences, because it seems to me quite likely that we are actually talking about 2 distinct substances but referring to them with the same name... one of them likely incorrectly. And these substances I think are different enough in their effects that if the distinction is not made clear, it could actually be pretty dangerous if people think they are gonna get a beautiful psychedelic dissociative trip and instead end up inducing some entirely unexpected and maniacal psychosis.


I only allow myself to do dissociatives every 6 months or so now but in a couple months, if no-one has cleared up this mystery before then, I will see if there is any of the less manic variety of 3-MeO-PCP floating around, and if so I'll get some of it and try to get it properly tested.

get an almost table salt like 3-meo-pcp, it is very varying in its effects, I find that the first few days of doing 5mg bumps nasally totalling 15mg kinda has a stim effect, but pushing up to 30mg starts to get really psychedelic, the dissociative nature is always there. I have to take a break about every three days.

Hope this helps

If 30 is full-on, like volume 10, what about *33*? It's like an amp that goes to 11! Just kidding, 33 is like level 33 masonry, only for the well-versed initiates. Lets bring the volume *down* to eleven, in 3x11mg increments throughout if you like going hard all day. It's like that song 'Down' by 311.

I'm pretty sure an amp that goes to 33 would blow its circuitry, unless it is heated slowly, achieving a tolerance level of 33. Too much at once can crack your bulb(ous) head, unvacuuming your vacuum tube, and that's a mess. Metaphorically, pour hot coffee into something glassy, guess what happens? *snap crackle pop*, or think of that egg-frying your-brain-on-drugs commercial. 'Any questions'?

Im not sure I've only had two different batches of 3meo and they both seemed about the same in effects to me despite being different in appearance. Plenty psychedelic at high enough doses. 


I don't think any analysis lab will care to get to the bottom of figuring out why there are nuances in the effects of different batches, its quite far beyond the scope of what these labs do, and what they care to spend time doing.  Same thing goes for the MDMA discussion in the other forum of ppl wondering why things that test as "pure" mdma have dramatically different effects.

I had the same problem analytically finding the differences in batches of MXE, leaving me to theorize with only basic knowledge of chemistry. Best I can describe different 3meo batches is the color of their 'spirit', I.e. 'red' 'white' and 'blue'. The blue and white are fully good, blue being my favorite punch, its the more 'MXE'-like, peaceful and maneagable hypomania. The red has fire in it, much more likely to lead to those 'dark' or 'evil' experiences recent posters are reporting. Of course in the end it is all about how the tool is used, the set and setting etc. I don't think any batch is good for people with too many skeletons in their mental closet...

^ I find the shit makes me more sane than I normally am minus the intoxication.   Anxiety, obsessive thoughts, depression....all gone with 3meo or mxe.  wish i could always feel like I was on a subthreshold dose.


it little outspoken during high doses, but more positive and "mentally healthy"

^Are you being sarcastic?


I don't mean to be rude here but although classifying batches of drugs by "the colour of their spirit" might work well for some people, I don't think it has any use whatsoever as far as making sure that people are as informed as possible about what they are taking.


Regardless I guess it might be the case that there are no real differences between batches, at least none that could be discerned in a blind test. I have only ever had the one batch so I can't personally comment but I thought there were a few more experienced dissociative users who had sampled both batches earlier in the thread and thought there was a difference. For some reason I find it much easier to dismiss the idea that different batches of MDMA would have different effects, although MDMA has been around for a while and presumably if there were significant enantiomeric differences or something these would be known about by now, assuming we are not just talking about different MDxx compounds. 3-MeO-PCP is much newer and it's conceivable the testing process is less sensitive, but I guess the placebo/set/setting/suggestion effect is a powerful thing as well.

Well I agree it isn't sticky-worthy (but thanks for the nod). My musing enjoys riding the line of controversy (and edging the cut of off-topic social commentary). No fear nor judgement, just hear to tickle your noodly appendage (bonus point if you got the pastafarian reference).


I like the theory posited about positional isomers, given that it is established there aren't 'R' and 'S' isomers a la ketamine/MXE. Can we get a chemist in the house to break down the possibilities? There's the 'psychoactive byproduct of synthesis impurities' theory which certainly holds some weight if we know the synthesis route labs are taking. Most my other theories lie in the more metaphysical realm, like 'vibrational memory' of the precursors (read ' The Living Energy Universe' for that), and the possibility that the finished product can store information in the way that crystals can- like how quartz crystals are used as timing components in electronics, maybe different qualities of arylcyclohexylamine crystals imbue different timings- this is all probably considered pseudoscience or fringe quantum physics/mechanics, but like I said I'm just an imaginator, and on a good day I aspire to inspire, at least a laugh or smile.

What I meant was to use quartz crystal timers as evidence that different matrices of structure have different resonant frequencies. Quartz is a consistent matrix so an ideal candidate. The theory is that this structure hits our physicalpsychospiritual systems with this energy intact, conserving that memory as it breaks down. So, variances in how the crystals form in synthesis could explain different results.

Also, recall that Xorkoth had two batches tested that were subjectively distinctly manic and non-manic and they came back as high quality 3-MeO, not one being impure - or the impurity would have to be insanely potent to still make that difference, which wouldn't make much sense cause then you could easily overdose incredibly on the impurity.

Ah yes, that is what I was remembering. I think this is surely a solvable problem though. If both tests came back as 3-MeO-PCP, then obviously we need more details about the accuracy of the testing process. It seems there are 3 possibilities here... Either the test is not sensitive enough to distinguish certain very similar compounds, OR... the compounds are the same, BUT there is an important difference that us non-chemically educated types are missing, analogous to the S and R isomers of Ketamine, OR... there is actually no difference, and something about 3-MeO-PCP itself is just inducing this bizarre group delusion. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


Xorkoth, would you be able to provide any more information about the sensitivity of the tests?

Without knowing what the labs did (type of MS scans, chromatography, or seeing spectral data) taking their word that "its pure" I would be skeptical a bit still.


If there are positional ismomers they are likely getting put in there on purpose or accident not formed during synthesis.  If the standard PCP synth is being used there isn't much else that can happen to form products of the same mass but differing structure. 


Differences might be due to different salts of PCP being formed Cl or Br.  And causing different types of absorption.

I had my two batches, one clearly of the stimulating/manic kind, and one of the dissociating kind (confirmed by multiple very experienced users as to their subjective differences), done by a friend with access to equipment and a fully reliable skill in advanced lab work, and he determined that both were pure 3-MeO-PCP without impurities.  I wasn't relying on vendor information.  The guy who did it is a friend who I trust implicitly on such matters, and if you knew who it was you would too.  He's a fellow of ours whom we all respect so I trust his word.  I also viewed the resulting documents and the graph looks precisely the same between the samples.  I was assured both were pure 3-MeO-PCP with no detectable peaks besides 3-MeO-PCP.


For what it's worth this individual also bioassayed each in small amounts around the time of the GC/MS and said they seemed the same subjectively.  However to me this  is not necessarily proof that the batch theory is invalid.  I mean I am extremely experienced in altering my mind, and my expectation when trying that new, dissociating batch was that they'd be the same, same source, same appearance.  But immediately we noticed a slightly different taste/umamai when snorted, and the development of the effects was notably and significantly different.  As I said I had to convince myself over the course of time while using this batch regularly that it in fact was not placebo because I really assumed it was at first.  But no, the differences are clear and stark and as soon as I tried the other batch again, it was back to what I originally experienced.  My friends and I all agreed without a doubt that there were differences,  The first night we tried the dissociating batch we were all starting to doubt it was 3-MeO-PCP at all.  But both batches exhibit most of the same effects, it's just one never developed that hypomanic state when dosed in my typical fashion, and when taken higher, it's trippier and reminds us of MXE somewhat.  When you try something very regularly and are always able to achieve the same state, and then you try a different batch that you fully expected to be the same and you can never reach that same place with the same dosing, but you can reach some different places... well, you start to realize something is going on and it's not just due to placebo.  Something is going on here, even though both batches showed totally identical results in the GC/MS and so should, in theory, be exactly the same.  Something is going on, I've been doing this stuff for many years and I know my body and mind in relation to the effects of drugs.  I don't notice this disparity in batches really except mainly for the arycyclohexanines.  It's a mystery, especially for 3-Meo-PCP which has so sterioisomers to account for possible differing rations of isomers with different effects (which is a well-established way to have different effects, I mean s-ketamine is quite distinct from racemic).  We don't understand the full picture, IMO, just like we have never actually understood the full picture in science.  At some point there is always a paradigm shift leading to new understanding.  Throughout all of human history in the sciences this is true.  There is definitely something going on with 2 types of batches of this with quite similar but unique effects, centered on whether the batch has a tendency to produce strong stimulation and hypomania, or not, and be more dissociating.  We do not understand all of what's going on with how drugs interact with the brain, not by a long shot.  The next 50, 100 years will reveal so much more and they'll look back on our time like, oh, they really thought they had it, that was silly.  Brains are so immensely complex, we understand so little, and so it's imperative to view out current models of how drugs affect the brain as something that will one day be revolutionized, and then at an even later, revolutionized again.  And so on.  We know a lot but we don't know shit,  You know?


It's the same with MXE batches for sure, but at least there we have the differing ratio of r and s isomers, like with ketamine, that is based on the synthesis route.  3-MeO-PCP is weird since it doesn't have that.  But myself and many agree, there a batch variance.

For some people think this (colored acid batches back in the day for example), but clearly not all disso's and psychedelics have this batch mystery 3-MeO has.

I have only ever had the one batch so I can't personally comment but I thought there were a few more experienced dissociative users who had sampled both batches earlier in the thread and thought there was a difference. For some reason I find it much easier to dismiss the idea that different batches of MDMA would have different effects, although MDMA has been around for a while and presumably if there were significant enantiomeric differences or something these would be known about by now, assuming we are not just talking about different MDxx compounds. 3-MeO-PCP is much newer and it's conceivable the testing process is less sensitive, but I guess the placebo/set/setting/suggestion effect is a powerful thing as well.

Similiar arguments are underway regarding MDMA. Yes there are different isomers, however, the main argument suggests that MDMA is not the same as it was. 

Purist argue, that MDMA hcl of confirmed purity 84% is always the same.

Many (including myself) suggest this is not the case, subjectively the effects feel different than they used too.


Practically, it is considered that the manufacturing methods vary dramatically, including the main precursors involved.

Irrelevant of the actualy validity of the pros and xons of this argument, is it not indeed possible the same causes may affect the 3meoPCP differences?


Manufaacturing methods, precursors, etc?

The manufacturing  methods argument doesnt suggest purity differences, more simply a differing result from same compound.

Effectively, if homeopathy is even truly considered a science, then it may help prove this once and for all.


Just a thought...

This is different than what I was thinking.  I thought you had sent it to ecstasy data or some commercial analytical lab which wouldn't put rigor into such an investigation.


The only other thing that comes to mind is that this effect is of an ionic or metallic origin.  If one batch is full of metals left over from another synth in the vessel one batch was made in (which if you've seen video of these chinese labs is not hard to believe), a GCMS would not differentiate  such contaminants from the basline signal due to "leaching"  and ICP-MS analysis would be required. 


And its well known that metals and their ions can have acute physiological effects when consumed. 


This is a scary yet possible situation that can slip by a thorough lcms analysis.


I've often wondered how full these chinese drugs are of trace metals, especially the toxic ones. We could all be killing ourselves and not know it yet.  I really wish someone would ICP analyze a wide array of RCs and do a study on it.

Heavy metals, if consumed in such quantities that they affect your state of mind, would rather cause anxiety and depression, maybe tiredness and getting dumbed down - not mania.


Heavy metals don't seem too hard to wash / lose during extraction. But who knows right?

Heavy metals stay everywhere during organic synthesis. Aqueous extracts, organic extracts, and even leach everywhere during chromatographic purification.  There are NO economic ways to get rid of them. and you know the chinese don't give two shits about cleaning up their chemistry or equipment to make illegal drugs for westerners.  I suspect that toxic metals are be used in one form or another in a chemical reaction (perhaps unrelated PCP), probably in the same reaction vessels.  No "walter white" level of cleaning the vessel after each synth going on there. 


and yes a GCMS or LCMS analysis would not detect heavy metals.  I mean the detector (MS) would detect the signal from them, but it would be spread out over the entire analysis time about evenly thus the main operating principal of GCMS and LCMS by which different compounds are separated from eachother and concentrated at a specific moment they enter the MS detector would be absent and thus you would just see a Raised baseline signal instead of a sharp "peak" indicative of a molecule.

Yeah.  I mean I trust some sources (a few), but what do I really know even then?


Good quality RCs sketch me out a lot less than street drugs (besides weed, which is just a plant and it's all grown in this country pretty much now (in the US)).  I've sen coke a few times recently, and who knows what the fuck it is, but there isn't much coke in there.  There's definitely something else stimulating in there, but almost no numbing, it's not that lovely coke effect, it's an edgy stimulation/jittery effect.  Even with weed, I remember years ago there were postings on here of some weed going around europe I think, or the UK in particular maybe (I could be wrong about where) that had been sprayed with a bunch of tiny glass beads.  They looked a lot like crystals, but were added to make it heavier so they could sell more.  But inhaling them into your lungs was terrible.


I'd go with RCs from my few really tried-and-true, trusted sources over street drugs for sure.  But you have to be really selective...

Yeah you motherfuckers are stressing me as well. Now I imagine some dirty chinese chemists synthing my 3-meo-pcp using the same lab equipment they used for making fentanyl analogs without cleaning it, and now I'm just fucking worried.


Still, like Xorkoth said, I put more trust on my RC's than on any illegal street drug. I always analyze my product and worked with bulk dealers instead of small-time ones, so I always got my MDMA, heroine, cocaine, and ketamine over 80% pure without cuts at least, and my LSD batches were always arround what was advertised about dosage. But I saw so many bad things from some batches that came from small dealers that scares me, like 2-OxO-PCM beeing sold as ketamine, 10% cocaine with a lot of caffeine and lidocaine, 3% amphetamine with also a lot of caffeine, pills with piperazines beeing sold as MDMA, 25ug LSD blotters at insane prices... And I could continue.


 All my RC's came back beeing what I was sold without any cuts in 10 years of research.

There's wet chemistry tests you can use to determine the presence of heavy metals. Very time consuming and a pain in the ass and you don't get quantitative results. But if someone were really concerned, that might be an avenue worth investigating.

Ah and it becomes clear I have forgotten half my chemistry ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) . Question for those tests, dronelore, would be what is the detection threshold because if all it proves is that illicit drugs are not pure at a pharmaceutical level, not sure if that really tells you the concentrations are toxic.

Unfortunately I cannot remember that information. But you can look over the methods here: [http://www.pharmacopeia.cn/v29240/usp29nf24s0_c231.html](http://www.pharmacopeia.cn/v29240/usp29nf24s0_c231.html)


Since you are merely comparing the tint of your unknown solution to that of a known standard, the threshold can be whatever you dilute your standard to, I think.

Oh yeah, I've used UV spectrometers for that type of shit... I guess it will depend on their sensitivity of that apparatus cause you can't concentrate your sample beyond filling the cuvet with it?


Damn heavy metal toxicity, that is kind of a match for my issues iirc - tiredness and neurological issues, maybe some psychological ones... major hypochondria and general panic trigger looking at other posts haha


Should we all eat some chilating agents just to be safe? Then replenish the proper trace elements with some quality vitamin supplements.

Just received a batch of the fluffy stuff. Excited to start playing with it. Insufflated ~5mg, really curious to see where this substance takes me. Years ago, when I was much more reckless, it taught me a valuable lesson. What will the future hold? The fluffy batches are supposed to be the "more psychedelic" ones, yea?

try a couple beers with it....makes all the difference in the world for me to have amazing trips with euphoria.   I don't think I've done 3meo without a few beers on the come up since I had some dry and almost bad trips not drinking on it.

For heavy metals detox, look at the cutler protocol. It´s the only way to go. (Im doing it since two months and it´s working wonders).


Regarding 3-meo non-euphoria, it´s strange. You should get it on spades at 5mgs. No need to mix with beers or other stuff. Maybe a set&setting issue?.


Next time you will get the euphoria. Sometimes 3-meo needs 2 or 3 trials to do its magic

I mixed it with 4-aco-dmt and had a truly weird fucking night. the 4-aco-dmt gave me a kinda unpleasant tension in my body and there were some things that happened that caused me to stress out (just unlucky timing). I'm not sure what was the 3-meo-pcp and what wasn't tbh. I'm pretty sure the physical tension was from the 4-aco.

Yeah, i find the dissociation of 3-meo-pcp tends to smooth over most physical sensations like psychedelic bodyload.


Have you taken either drug on their own before?


Also, how did you time the dosage?

Because 4-aco-dmt comes on pretty fast IME (takes 30min or less to kick in) wheras 3-meo-pcp seems to take ~90min to come ln, when taken orally.

If you dosed them at the same time, i can see how the synergy might not quite work..

Yea, I'd done both on their own but it'd been several years. In the weeks leading up to last night I've been doing a lot of other dissos, mostly 3-meo-pce, o-pce, and dck. I dosed both the 4-aco-dmt and the 3-meo-pcp at around the same time (insufflated. ~5mg of 3-meo-pcp and ~10mg of 4-aco-dmt). Then an hour or so in, I took another 10 mg of 4-aco-dmt orally.


I was also doing some "o-pce" through out (to be totally fucking honest i'm not quite sure whether what I have is really O-pce lol... but I have used it enough to know how i respond to it, whatever it is)

I'm not sure when the initial 'this is weird' experiences turned into my new 'normal', but it happened, and every time I cycle it feels more like coming back to my vacation home. Beware, if you prefer the plain goopy banality of vanilla-flavored life, this isn't the cream for you. By comparison, 3meo is more like Napoleon style ice cream, the holy trifecta of vanilla, chocolate and strawberrry, topped with a popped cherry and sprinkled with cooked kooky cookie crumblings.

^

it sounds like you're taking some pretty scary amounts of the stuff.

i hope you're taking care of yourself amidst all this psychonaut hedonism..


remember that high-dosing 3-meo-pcp has *not* ended well for quite a few of the (very small number of) people who have done it, including some very experienced and knowledgable drug users.


these are pretty uncharted waters, so please respect this drug, as well as your body and mind.

this is where the "different batches have different effects" thing gets frustrating; my 3-meo-pcp isn't really stimulating at all; it's more downer-ish - so it seems fine to combine with weed, at least for me.

it makes talking about this stuff kinda complicated - especially when some folks are still sceptical that it is even possible for there to be different types with really different effects.


but you're also right that a lot of people don't - or aren't able to - enjoy weed.  but it works for me (with the more dissociating psychedelic type stuff)

Tried soaking a cigarette with 3-meo-pcp then drying and smoking it, but no major effects. My nicotine tolerance is low so I think that had more of an effect.

A more potent solution of 3-meo-pcp may have worked better.

If you have read reports of people experimenting with IM or IV 3meo, you will see the general consensus is that oral/nasal/plug are superior ROAs (i agree). I remember one person say it was like jumping straight into the mania phase without all the pleasantries of a smooth come-up,euphoria, and smooth tail. For some reason it misses a lot of the 'magic', and it also bothered my nerve pain, opposite effect of other ROAs.

The long come up via oral dosing is probably why I always ended up insufflating 3-meo-pcp. There are waves, pleasantries like vortech said, come-up, euphoria and smooth tail indeed. Don't know what extra the IV/IM/plugging rush would give with 3-MeO-PCP.


There are always tales with these novel compounds, my tale with 3-MeO-PCP has come to an end. 


Until next time fellas. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

That matches my experience IVing 3meopcp.


If your curious, I gave a live play by play here:

[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-669573.html](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-669573.html)


But I thought it was because of the high dose (I didn't expect the BA to be so much higher.) I don't really like IVing Dissos at all due to the rush which I find unpleasant. But IM is my favorite way to do them.

Agree...but then not everyone likes pot...or EtOH.  I like a beer but dont feel it mixes too well with dissociatives, but probably just personal taste more than anything.


For what it is worth...it took me a number of trials with 3MeoPcp to "get it.". I actually hated it at first.


The whole thing is mysterious to me...I have yet to get a batch that has the same superman/mania/dopamime rebound effects that I experienced when I got a gram of it in 2014.  Dunno if my body chemistry is just different now or what....but I am not the only one who notes this.


Also, the potency of what circulates now also seems off...before I got strong effects with even just 2.5mg....double checked my notes from back then and 2-3mg was a strong ++.


Stuff from 2015 and 2016 only seemed half as strong... and I have no tolerance at all...only take dissociatives a few times a year.


Might give some a spin Wednesday evening so Ill report back.  


Very mysterious....these quantitative and qualitative differences.  More analysis is needed.

Hmmm...well never plugged it or ate it...or IVed it....but snorted and sublingual for me was not as good as IM.  I will try other routes in the coming months and report back to see if that changes.

Well...I signed for it yesterday and now am just waiting on the postman. I don't know if I want to try the pcp or pce first...despite all of the sketchy subjects brought up recently about metals and lack of quality control being somewhat worrisome I'm still hell bent on this journey. I recently discovered plugging, well I didn't discover it I just tried it two nights ago for the first time with 20 mgs of 4-AcO-DMT and 25 mgs of MXE. 


Anyone here like plugging their 3-meo-pcp? I'm not interested in IM or IV and based on what I read above quoted by vortech It's no fun anyway. I understand it is impossible to give me accurate advice not knowing my batch potency, but I do have a very high tolerance to dissos.


I ultimately want to use the 3-meo-pcp for therapeutic reasons, but first want to familiarize myself with it by seeing what it has to offer as far as dissociation goes. That's kind of contradictory, it may not make much sense but maybe you know what I mean?


Based on everyone's experience with 3-meo-pcp, what would be a good dose to start with if I was to plug it? I know I can find these answers elsewhere, but you lot are well informed and experienced. I trust your judgements.

i would say less than 5mg

i'd probably recommend 2mg to start off with - as others have said, it can take a few uses to really get into the swing (or hum ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) of 3-meo-pcp, so don't go too deep the first couple of times, or it could be a little dysphoric.  get a taste of it before upping the dose at all - but it's pretty fucking potent in my experience.

i'd really advise you to space out your usage of this stuff.  it takes a long time to clear put of your system, and there have been reports of people taking it multiple times in the space of a few days, and getting hit by the cumulative effects of more than one dose.

taking too much of this stuff renders you completely useless for hours, which may or may not be what you're trying to achieve...


i've never plugged any arylcyclohexamines, so i don't know about dosing that way.

it's got great oral BA though fwiw - it just has a slow come-up


i can't stress enough how dangerous this shit can be, and how much respect it deserves - but i'm repeating myself - so have fun, play safe!

Oral has the most therapeutic effects. Smooth 2-hour come-on, 'full-bodied' anaesthesia, antidepressant effects, and a motivating stimulation smoother than any traditional stimulant. Brings the imagination alive.

I like Spacejunk's titration method. I forget it can take some time to 'click' with it. After induction, 5-7 mg is a good functional dose. 10mg is a standard dose for me though. The 3-MeO-PCE has some upsides to the 'P', but also some downsides. Overall it is less intense and less potent, kinda feels more serotonergic and a little less 'sharp'. I'd start with 10mg of it orally.

^ yea oral is the winner on this one (havn't IVed it since i put the needle down before MXE went extinct).


sadly ive only done oral once and snorted probably 50 times. It was a much fuller and less stimmy high.  Oral takes sooooo long to come on.

Does anyone here use daily? Should be aware that it's probably fucking you up.

Extrapolating from ketamine abuse aftermath:

Okay but my question is: if daily abuse = definite damage, then how much damage does a single dose do? Where does the damage start, at what frequency / total doses, you know? It would probably take a lot of tests.

First those studies are about ketamine and not about 3-meo-pcp. Second abusing just about anything will have a bad impact in your health.


Difficult to say which of those 2 will be more harmful for the moderated user. 3-meo-pcp is too novel too know about its problems even in the middle term. But we already know it can make you delusional at a very high rate when used too often or in high doses.

The little quantity needed for a normal dose of 3-meo-pcp might be good news for a few organs who have to pay the price, especialy the bladder. But in general it seems more toxic.


I think the body has a self-healing power so if you rest enough between dosages you probably won't do any real bad damage to it. It is as well truth that changing the chemistry of your brain might have some kind of permanent changes. I don't know about how negative or positive this changes can be. Probably equal to the responsability of the user.


Anyway we are all different and some people will endure more than others. In any case I think there is consensus that daily dissociative use is a bad idea if not used for medical reasons. People using daily 3-meo-pcp always end up posting a crazy story of what happened. Personally I don't find them very addictive and use very moderatly. Using once a month, or a minimum of a week break I don't think I am doing great damage. People consuming grams in weeks, they are probably risking a lot. 


There is an age factor too. When I was in my twenties I abused drugs in general much more and very rarely my body complained. Later on my body is much more susceptible to any kind of abuse. I don't know if the damage is greater later in life, if it is just a question of getting more sensitive, if just the body takes longer to recover or if the damage is about the same but as you get older you get more of a cumulative effect and you already started paying for past abuses.

Yeah start quite low.  My first dose was 10mg orally, and I found it uncomfortable and strange.  It took me a few more tries to "get it", very unique substance that doesn't necessarily reveal itself easily.  Totally different from "normal" dissociatives.

Im curious to hear more of your thoughts on 3meopcp vs 3meopce. The latter is becoming one of my favorites. I didn't think I would particularly care for it because I heard it was very heavy on mania but I actually find it to be very lucid and relaxing. Going to pick up another g of it soon. Do you find low doses of 3meopce can be functional like low doses of 3meopcp supposedly can be?

Small bumps work great. Be sure to space them at least an hr apart. 2 or 3mg is ok, i wouldnt bump more until you really learn about its nature. Takes 3 or 4 sesions minimum. 


Until you have had several sessions, keep to under 10 mg total of these small bumps.

After you understand it, everyone here says it takes time, seemingly more than most if not all other chems, then you can try a 5mg plus 5mg etc.


Most report igher than 15mg in a dose to produce more unpleasant effects than positive assuming no more than *normal tolerance.


I personally worked up to 12mg plus 5 plus 5. And decided to ease back to 3mg plus 3mg plus 3mg as my prefered dosing.

I'm gonna give the 3-meo-pcp 20 more minutes and if I still don't feel much I'm going to IM 20mg of O-PCE.


I am finally getting some first alert type feeling from the 3-meo-pcp though.

Perhaps most of your dose ended up oral? Oral comeup feels almost like placebo for me, it takes ages and extends the effects too once it finally takes hold. 


Let us know how the combo goes if you end up doing it. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I just put the O-PCE in my deltoid. Let's see how weird things get. I have been doing a lot of dissos lately so my tolerance is probably higher than it's ever been. I'm already starting to feel the shot of O-PCE. Next time, I think I will try IMing the 3-MeO-PCP.

Okay. Now things are happening. Letters are getting harder to turn into words. Things seem to drift in my visual line of sight. My mind is kind of blank. Nothing too intense, yet. Typing is a little more difficult. It feels kind of bland, honestly. Might be me burning out my NMDA receptors. Not sure if I should introduce more oral O-PCE, or a bit of 4-aco-dmt.


Edit: Just swallowed 13mg of 4-aco-dmt. let's see where this takes us.

edit2: another 23mg of opce @ 8PM. think well chill for a bit now. things are getting weird,

Likewise. I like their album White 1,.and Domkirke but I much rather Earth for drone. I saw Sunn0))) ten years ago or so. Fuck that was unutterably loud and intense. Made me anxious as hell actually...


I haven't had 4-aco-DMT in years, its a true gem actually though 4-ho-met is my favorite. I should be getting 500mg soon, I really want to dissociate with it. 


Enjoy your adventure friend ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

4acodmt is a sparkly precious gem.  Certainly no (pure synthetic) psilocin...but different enough that it doesn't have to be.


4-ho-met was for sure interesting and fun.  Couldn't put my finger on why...but I found it to be the "2C-x" of the mushroom analogues.  Just the way the visuals were....had a very PEA-like nature to them....reminded me of 2ct2 visuals. 


 Very recreational nature to it.  Was curious to know what 4homet was for you...ie what about it made it your favorite?


My favorite of the fully synthetics was 4homipt.  Most randy tryptamine ever....just a divinely sexy drug...literally as it always seems to lead to marathon kinky sex in my circle of friends w benefits or lovers.


Lost all of mine in a move and will for sure need to reup one day.  Gosh we love miprocin around here.

I may have once again overestimated my psychologocical fortitude. I dared to IV ~13mg of 4-aco-dmt and it may have been one of the most psychologically disturbing experiences of my life haha. It doesn't help that i watched Get Out last night and all that films psychological connotations got stuck in my mind. We're prisoners,  our heads are dungeons. It's kinda fucking with me.


edit: 3-meo-pcp seems to make me want to do silly things.

Mine too, fucking love that stuff.  It's very euphoric and loving and full of good humor, and I could see it being quite sexual although I have never explored that side of it.  I know 5-MeO-MiPT is, so wouldn't surprise me whatsoever.


I've got base MiPT, I want to try it at 50mg soon.  Some really wonderful reports of it recently, from Kaleida, also from another poster who took something crazy like 200mg and reported DiPT-like audio effects.

I see what people mean when they say it takes a few trials to understand this drug. It's very strange and a bit scary. I feel like I'm playing with fire. It seems like it can cause "delusions of sobriety" like some benzos do. Like, last night in pretty sure I was wasted and it should be clear from looking at my posts. But I didn't think I wasn't in my right mind. I don't know, I want to keep playing with it, but I'm also scared. It seems to have a dark side. As far as recreation goes right now I like 3meopce a lot better.

I'd say it has a dark side for sure.  I know some people who are intensely delusional/unhinged yet are convinced that daily 3-MeO-PCP is good for them, and they seem to have no idea they are delusional and are confused by why their life is crumbling around them.  I agree that it can cause "illusions of sobriety", I always feel less intoxicated than I am on it.  However for me, I've never lost it on it, I do keep my doses low though, but I have had periods of time where I dosed multiple times a day almost every single day for a month.  Not to say anyone should do that... I've never lost it on anything including massive doses of psychedelics and dissos combined, etc.  But for those prone to mania and psychosis, I would say this is a drug to avoid because it seems to bring on those states quite readily and sneakily.

Delusion of sobriety it's a pretty acurate description, but be aware, that happens with 3-meo-pce as well. Yesterday I took 30mg orally and 20mg snorted and I only could tell I was high because of the taste of cigarettes (They have got a really different taste for me on dissos) and the insomnia. If I don't combine 3-meo-pcp or 3-meo-pce with other drugs like beer, cannabis or psychedelics, it's hard to discern the high.

I get a lovely high from 3meopce, maybe I'm just lucky. Much less subtle that the 3meopcp, but combining 3meopce with opcm or opce is one of the best combos I've ever done.

Delusions of sobriety?


Using low doses of this (2 or 3mg) regularly through an evening stopping at or around 10mg daily over around 1 month saw me reduce anxiety suffered nightly for many years, to almost gone completely.


I also reduced my alcohol consumption from a, 10 yr daily habit of between 7 and 12+ standard drinks (or equivalent to 3/4 a bottle of wine to around 1 bottle and a 1/3.) To zero with no issues whatsoever. 


I also quit caffeine after 15yr of daily energy cans or coffee if cans werent available.

 Seriously every day a 250ml redbull to a 500mg rockstar either depending which band of the spectrum i needed, was stopped at the same time as using 3meopcp daily.


After withdrawing the 3meopcp (as i ran out) i noticed weekds before my anxieties appeared at all. In fact im 4 months down the track and still very minimal anxiety.

My alcohol and caffeine has returned to its previous usage but im still better off.

I was off both for alcohol and caffeine for 6 days and then over 28 days before i added caffeine back.


I had the most sober time i have had in over 15 years.


Delusions of sobriety? Damn a catasyt to teach about it more likely!!

I'm not saying it's not a useful tool that can't help, it certainly can.  I'm just saying that during the effects, I feel more sober than I actually am to other people, or to myself when I look back on it.  Like, I feel like I'm acting normally but I'm not.  Also, if/when people start getting into the heavily manic/psychotic realms from using too much or for too long, I've found that the ability to discern that is happening is quite difficult.  Hence the reason why it's really a pretty dangerous drug, if not used responsibly.


But yeah I'm not trying to say it can't be a wonderful catalyst for positive change, as well.

hahaha, we mean like with benzos, if you take them at low doses and are not suffering from anxiety or insomnia you can hardly tell they are doing anything on your body or mind. You could easily think "that shit is not working".


Of course, if you use it in a period of depression you will feel the effects for sure as you will change from a sad guy without any motivation to the king of the world.


I gave this drug at 5mg doses to a few guys without disso experience that just told me they barely could felt anything different from beeing sober. Like we told a lot of times here, it takes a few trials with the drug to start appreciating it's subtleties.


If you do a high dose or keep doing it regularly on low doses (the worlwide known *Xorkoth 3meo regime***Ⓒ**) though, the effects and benefits would be very obvious.


Like you said, it helps a lot with anxiety, depression, or addiction issues. You need to be careful to not trade an addiction with another though, as 3-meo-pcp is unknown territory, and we could all be killing ourselves slowly with this one.


The thing is that if you are already on a happy mindset a low dose will be hard to distinguish from beeing sober, if not for the creative boost. But it's not like an alcohol, mdma, ketamine or psychedelic low dose where you can for sure tell you are on an altered state of mind and body.


I'm usually on the verge of depression, with a very negative mindset, and without any will to do any of my hobbies after work, or do social life. This week I was playing a bit with low 3-meo-pce doses after work, and I opened Fruity Loops and made some awesome music again after months without doing it, played a lot of videogames, hanged out with coworkers to eat and take beers after work, and even programmed out of work on some personal projects. For sure that's not my usual week, and the 3-meo-pce helped here, like 3-meo-pcp helped in the same way in the past.


This year also I stopped daily cannabis and beer intake and just do them 3 or 4 times a month now, and that was triggered by a week binge of 3-meo-pcp on December. This drug is just fucking amazing and even a better tool for therapy than MDMA or LSD. Like I told to Kaleida today by PM, for me it's Huxley's soma. The drug I was searching for my whole life whithout knowing ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Nice, this is the first time for you, right?  It's a wonderful, potent little chem.  I'm taking a little break myself, I was noticing that after frequent low-dosing, I was having a lot of word brain-farts and stumbling randomly on words.  This was quite a long period of time of quite regular low-dosing.

Well I mean I've had little breaks, but have been doing it at least twice a week for like 2 years now probably.  At my heaviest it was 5 days on, 1 or 2 off.  Occasionally longer for a span, like 7 or 8 days.  Dosing was at 2mg in intervals throughout the day, up to 5 or 6 times a day (but often just once or twice).  Lately it's been less often, but I just feel I haven't given myself enough of a break and I can feel some cognitive effects.  I don't feel less intelligent or anything, and typing is actually fine, but my mouth will just sometimes slur up a word, or I'll go blank on a word, a really simple one I use 50 times a day sometimes.  


My tolerance has really never increased which is cool.  I don't think this is super sustainable for daily use even at very low dosages though... I can't imagine what it does taking big doses of it frequently.

I've totally sworn of this stuff now. For me, it got really anxiogenic and confusing, just racing foreign thoughts and crazy risky behavior. 


3 meopce may be the way to go, it doesn't seem as manic. But these dissociatives are getting disturbing for me. I feel empty and weird and somehow amoral. 


I think the trend towards flippant daily use is troubling with this compound.

The problem is restraining one's use to responsible limits. It became much too easy for me to ignore the limits I had set. I ended up flushing over 2 grams because even though I still believe that it has the possibility to do a great deal of good when used wisely, I had reached a point where that ideal and my reality had diverged. 


I know it has been said many times already, but please show this chemical the utmost respect.

I'm starting to this stuff just isn't me. The dissociation feels cold and clinical, it's not dyspeptic but there isn't any euphoria, the universe doesn't appear to be filled with new.meaning they way other dissociative alter my thought process. It lasts so fucking long and I feel stupid the next day, have difficulty spelling, etc. I'm very disappointed. I am not going to flush it or anything and I'll probably keep experimenting until what I have is gone but I'm not sure I'll be buying anymore after unless it winds up growing on me.

10-15mg line to start the day. This stuff is better than nothing, but I can really get into a "fuck it I will do anything mindset" too easy on this.


I went through a gram of 3 meo pce and I liked it more, but o pce is still way better than both. Waiting on my 500mg o pce so I can stop doing this every day.


Plus it raises tolerance badly, and ketamine a week or so from doing 3 meo pcp seems like a waste. I really wanna start IMing ket, but once I get past my needle phobia Ill end up with a bag of fent/fent analogue on deck and kill myself on a whim one day.


So beautiful today. Like 65 when it was 85 two days ago. I think I am going hiking

I agree with liking the pce's a lot.more. opce and 3meopce are like apples and oranges to me though. Have you tried combining them? Fucking fantastic synergy.

Recently tried 3-meo-pcp for the first time after coveting it for over a year, and I can't believe what I've been missing out on. I'm completely blown away. I don't want to go into too much detail but it was by far the most magical and healing drug experience I've had in years, possibly ever. Like my first experience on dxm years ago, it changed my perception of myself in a very positive way and I feel far more at peace. I had the fluffy white batch and it didn't feel stimulating or manic at all, and I did stagger my dose, but ended up doing a pretty decent amount throughout the night. I don't want to do it again for a while if only to not lose the magic, but all I can say is wow.

the after glow of 3meo is better than the peak as a high to chase in my opinion.  I so wish I could take a drug and instantly be in the afterglow....that would be a drug as addictive as cocaine or opioids

I'd dose really low (5-10mg) 2-3 times throughout the day for that continued afterglow thing, leads to mania after a few days easily though.

Haha wow, 10mg to me is far from low, 10mg is a strong experience, even one dose of it.  When I do 2mg bumps I can go for days without mania happening, except a light hypomania that leaves me entirely sane.

Checkmate! 1-3mg 2-3 times a day may be more appropriate. Unless you're trying to gamble with your freedom, and that's another whole co-dependency issue that's far too boring to discuss.


I've never even played poker though, so i certainly can't afford to be gambling.

That's what happened to me in my last 3 trials. Instead, my first 3 trials were truly amazing. It is like it doesn't hit me properly anymore. It is very strange... I was away for 6 months far from my stash, I came back really looking forward to get into 3-meo-pcp land and...boring...I am just giving it a very long break to see if the magic comes back.


And tolerance for sure is not and issue. I thought maybe it has degraded, but the only possibility is that 3-meo-pcp doesn't like perfect and freezing storage conditions. So my head is main suspect.

tested something new today, supposedly 3-MeO-PCP, from somewhere in China. Tasted much different than any I've ever had. It was the LEAST taste of almost any RC I know of- none of the 3meo bitterness. If this is analytically relatively pure material, then the batch variance is potentially much greater than I thought. It could be a legit synth but heavily diluted; I finally got something reminiscent of 3meo energy after taking 40mg orally (I titrated). I don't know how to go about purifying if it is indeed heavily cut. Tolerance shouldn't be an issue because it has been 2-3 weeks since using it. Anyway I could speculate all day. Probably worth doing a lab analysis on this...

Wasn't there a volunteer to test this at Energy Control? Not sure who tested Xorkoth's samples or where but hey I wouldn't be opposed to another submission... would be interesting either way. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I guess I wouldn't mind getting it tested for you, but now that I think about it... it wouldn't be so great regarding forum rules. Am gonna need another ruling on this, if it's worth the whole HR benefit of more information and the trust that it's alright to make an exception for this... iirc Xorkoth got it tested not via the forum??

3meo pcp has the weirdest flavor intranasal. Like a fucked up chemical god i wanna gag and puke taste

 even off 5-10mg. Worse than any other disso IN ive ever tried. Ive got two batches. I needa dig out my second and sed if its got the same taste. I went through a few g's before this, but never sniffed ot so I am not sure if it is batch dependant. Its def 3 meo pcp tho.


Also, finalky did enough of this to hole. Was at my brothers the other night, watching movies after a day of hiking with ~500ug DOC and many bumps of 3 meo pcp. Around 2am I was just in the zone, doing crazy yoga/asana flows, holding weird as fuck positions and they felt so good. He got pissed (i swear, he feels the drugs I take somehow, and when I take 3 meo pcphe doesnt seem to like it/gets in weird moods). I somehow lined out probably 30-50mg, sniffed it. Came to in his bathroom at like 7am after thinking I was dead for 5 hours. Come out like "wtf happened" and he just looked pissed and was like "go to sleep dude".


Would not reccomend.

I'm in love with what I call the 'blue' material and the smells it triggers. At first it stings a bit- one of my friends says it smells like 'new car smell', in a pleasant kind of way, faintly like the offgassing of VOC. From there continues to play with the olfactory system producing new and enhanced smells. One of the products, when the alignment of energy is just right, smells like the most beautiful dreamy scent I can imagine. Visually and conceptually it puts me in a space I can only describe as being on a fluffy cloud at the gates of heaven. Seriously, wish I could bottle that up and make it an incense!

As for this questionable material, at this point I don't feel it is worth testing. It is most probably inert. Any effect I thought was 3meo yesterday was likely a combination of placebo mixed with some kratom and exercise. No results today upon further inspection. Closest thing I can equate the material to is DL-phenylalanine, in appearance, water solubility, taste, and its subtle effect.

ok so tolerance is becoming an issue. I eyeball my doses and my usual doses arent hitting me hard and ive gone through about 400mg of the stuff in the last two weeks. How long does it take for tolerance to go down???

Two weeks after a run and I'm back to square one, or up to a month if I've been on a '3meo hookers and blackjack' bender.

I'm discovering netti pots are the best thing in the universe for 3-MeO insufflators. It clears out the passageways with epic snots.

I couldn't sleep a fucking wink last night. I had myself a little party, on 3-MeO-PCP, O-PCE, and 4-Aco-DMT (and kratom toward the end). Would it be a terrible idea for me to take a TINY bit of 3-meo-pcp before work today, to help alleviate the effects of sleep deprivation? I will also be taking more kratom, but that is just as likely to make me tired as it is to help keep me awake.

After hitting it hard like that, the next day would require me to come down a bit more smoothly if I needed to be on my game, and another bump of 3-meo-pcp for good measure is just the ticket in my experience.

Cool. I just took like 5 mg orally. I hope it's not too much. I wound up taking like 20mg last night. My disso tolerance is so fucked. But I'm going to be at work so I'll probably be more sensitive to any alterations than I was all comfy alone in my room.

not wishing to jinx you or anything, but i have to disagree that dosing another 5mg is 'just the ticket' for going to work.  3-meo-pcp really messes with my ability to articulate myself, speak properly and formulate words.

even quite a few hours after i feel like i've returned to base line.

i have no problem writing or formulating coherent sentences, but somewhere between thinking what i want to say - and forming the words with my mouth/tongue/vocal chords, the signal gets scrambled, and i spit out a bunch of slurred, whispered or garbled speech-like sounds.

i'll feel like i'm more or less completely sober, until i have to interact with someone...and find that i can't string half a sentence together.  it can be deceptively subtle IME.


i hope your job doesn't require too much verbal communication.  or operating heavy machinery, for that matter.


i really wouldn't recommend taking dissociative at work, the afterglow should be more than enough to get you through the day.  note also that 3-meo-pcp is thought to be reabsorbed by the bladder, and can stay in your system for a really long time.

taking additional doses can have a cumulative effect, much more than other classes of drugs, at least as i understand it.  again, not wishing to scare you, but this really isn't a 'hair of the dog' to help you get through the day sort of drug.  at least, not the stuff i've had (i get strong dissociating, psychedelic effects from the batch i have - it doesn't make me manic, and i wouldn't call it stimulating, except in it's insomnia-inducing effects)


wishing you the best, but i really don't think taking more is in any way advisable.  *could* be a terrible idea, but this drug is pretty unpredictable. sorry i didn't see this sooner to reply in time.


please let us know how it went... 


fwiw - many of these novel arylcyclohexamines seem to be negated - even blocked -  by certain nootropics.  

i once took a hefty dose of MXE after taking noopept, and it completely stopped it working.  something to do with the NMDA receptors i think - but that's off the top of my head and io don't know the mechanism.


i on't know if this would be a safe way to counteract the after effects of a big night of 3-meo-pcp or other dissociatives, but i just thought i'd throw it out there.  be curious to know what thoughts people have on this idea -  as i say, i have no idea if it's a safe thing to do.

Well, shit. Hopefully I'll be alright. My job does require a lot of "how are you doing today? Did you find everything alright?" Since I took it orally, it could take like 90 minutes for me to feel it right? It's only been an hour since I took it. I'll let y'all know how it goes. Would etizolam work to cancel it out at all?

A benzo wouldn´t cancel it, but a racetam partially could. Tell us how it´s going, this is quite interesting to know.

If your tolerance is as high as you claim I think you'll be fine. In the final month or two of my use with this chem I was dosing before work in lieu of caffeine and functioned perfectly fine. I don't recommend this but that was my experience.

Yes and yes. It is not recommended to try to hole on 3-meo-pcp. Other dissos are much more suited for it. It was also not a great experience for me.

There needs to be a certain delicate alignment of conditions to enable holing with it.

And yeah there is a way to use this drug as a supplement if you take it somewhat regularly and build up the dose from microdoses. Some people can stick to microdosing like Xorkoth, but my cycles usually involve me getting balls-out high for a couple days and then doing 5-10mg 2-4x a day for up to a week afterwards, and in that week it acts as a brilliant enhancer that I feel is superior to any racetam/nootropic or even microdosed LSD. Then I rinse with a few week tolerance break and repeat. Each cycle refreshes my spirit invaluably. YMMV.

Today I ran out of O-PCE, and so I took a little 3-MeO-PCP to make it worth while. I also think I took some 3-MeO-PCE. I really need to start writing down my doses. And taking dissociatives less often, to be honest.


Lately I feel like I've been treating BL like a blog because I've been rotating my use of OPCE, 3-MEO-PCP, 3-MEO-PCE, ALD-52, and 4-ACODMT so much. I'm a naturally anxious person so as I juggled my cravings I wanted to make sure I was being as responsible (lol) as possible. 


I am posting in this thread tonight, because I believe the 3-MeO-PCP to be the dominant player in my body tonight. I took about 12 mg, I think, and with it, maybe ~10 of opce, and ~10 mg 3-meo-pce. (Like I said I really need to start writing this shit down  especially since i intend to cut back). Many people have said 3-meo-pcp has to grow on you, and maybe that's what it is doing to me. Or perhaps it's that opce has lost its magic. I don't know, I don't feel that fucked up--I'm mostly stoned, and I love the synergy with dissos and weed, especially at low - moderate disso doses. I feel pretty good. Not amazing, not euphoric, not tripping balls, slightly stimulating, a little clumsy, definitely not sober but not "fucked up" either. I just hope I can get to sleep at a decent hour tonight. I just took about 7g of rad kali kratom, and I  would love to be able to doze off tonight without the aid of a benzo.

A friend and I were discussing holing on 3meopcp, and the way he put it made a lot if sense to me. You don't actually hole on it, you just kind of go bonkers while the rest of the world holes around you. I am in love with the synergy of 3meopcp and lysergamides. It's no MXE, that was a mystical nostalgic time machine...but it certainly has it's place in my book ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Start a drug diary, you won't regret it. I started noting down all my drug intake this January in a web app I programmed for the matter, and it really helped me noticing I was overdoing some things and needed to cut my usage.


Thanks to this practice, I stopped daily intake of GBL, cannabis, beer and alprazolam, and spare my disso and psychedelic usage once or twice monthly.

@Vortech: Nothing really special, just a chilly film-watching Friday night ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) With my permatolerance both ketamine and 2-oxo-pcm feel like toys. I need to get back to the 3-meo's or 2-oxo-pce, it has been a "long" time xD


@DroneLore: I definetly wanted either to make the app open source or to make a user management system so anyone could just register and use it for free. The thing is that I don't feel it's ready for any of that jet, I wanted to add more features like:

- Group drugs by their category/family in order to be able to better track problematic usage with specific families of compounds

- Expand the basic stats system I setted up in order to deliver some cool graphics about usage

- Make a trip report system to be able to submit them if I wanted to for specific days

- Beeing able to set up alarms if I exceed certain conditions, like "no more than half a gram of ketamine per month"


But if you want I can set it up for you in a free hosting in its current state, hit me with a PM ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) You can also use an Excel spreadsheet, or chemdiary.com (Their app is very similar to what I'm doing)

Wow MSK, that's lovely. I make myself a rudimentary diary and has helped too controling some things. I do myself the category of substances thing. I put some limits yearly or monthly so if sometimes I get over board I have to make for it eventually. Even if I break the rules I am concious of it which helps regulating.


I'll check chemdiary and wait for your complete version. Keep us updated.

I might try making a spreadsheet, it will be good practice to learn how to use excel too. I don't feel like making a throw away email just for chemdiary. Definitely let us know when your app is done though, msk. It seems to be coming along very nicely!

I'll try my best to put my shit together this weekend and at least release a beta version of the app on github. I didn't made a lot of progress lately on it because working as web developer 8h a day is enough for me not wanting to code at all when I exit from work or on the weekends, but there is a long time since I wanted to upload the code open source.


In order to not derail the big&dandy to the offtopic side of things I'm going to take some 3-meo-pcp and try to code on it. It worked pretty well on the past with creative work like doing music or writing, so I'm pretty confident it will help me with programming as well as low doses of LSD or stimulants did in the past ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

That's not true, they have got a responsive web design that adapt to mobile devices, so it can be used on any operative system, not limiting yourself to just use it on android, iphone, windows, linux... If you have got internet connection and a device with a web browser you can use it without problems ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Mine it's not different, I decided that aproach instead of making a compiled app just because the benefits of multiplatform over an offline mode. Yesterday investigating a bit more about possible mobile apps I found one called druglog on the google play store for android, very basic, but that can do the job as well if you prefer an encapsulated application ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

No worries about offtopic, everyone is loving it and anyway 3-meo-pcp thread is kind of the third social thread in the shadow for lots of you.


Going back to topic. I took 12mg of it and got back my long lost magic. After 4 frustrating experiences,it was again like I was remembering it from first 3 times. With the difference that 12mg felt maybe like 8mg from before. So I don't know if it is just me, a novelty impact decrease or if it actually lost potency storaged in the freezer. Novelty decrease sounds the most likely to me. Tolerance is ruled out as my dissos use is very occasional. 


I love how inspiring are normal doses of this. So much clarity makes up for the absence of a hole. For my intentions low doses are worthless, I just don't like that low dissociation without a proper switch in conciousness. It is the same with low doses of MXE, just don't see the point. Maybe it is something you learn to enjoy when you get deep into disociatives. I am not planning to go down that road, for some reason I control my dissociative usage better than any other cathegory of substances.

Last night I had one of the best disso experiences I've had in months. Took 17mg of 3meopcp and 10mg 3meopce, both orally. It was so euphoric,by far the best time I've had on 3-meo-pcp so far.


Also, my micron filters arrived last night, so I'm going.to try IM tonight. I'm not sure how much higher the bio availability will be. I'm thinking 5mg 3meo pcp and 10mg of 3meopce. Or is that too low, should I go with 10mg of each?

Never tried the combo, do you think the 3-meo-pce affected the high meaningfully? 10mg seems so a low dose of 3-meo-pce, I usually do 30mg orally and it's a soft experience compared to 10-15mg of 3-meo-pcp.

One time I took like 3 or 4mg of 3-MeO-PCP and I think 5mg of 3-MeO-PCE and they seemed to potentiate each other a lot, I was really intoxicated and dissociated to the point that it was making me nervous because it was unexpected...I thought it was going to be sort of like a halfway between a low dose of the two but turns out it wasn't such a low dose.  3-MeO-PCP also seems to massively potentiate other dissos like MXE.

3-meo-pcp potentiates negatively other dissos for me, the times I tried it along with ketamine, 2-oxo-pce or 2-oxo-pcm everything was very confusing, like 3-meo-pcp stimulation was fighting with the sedation and hole potential of the other compounds.


I can see how 3-meo-pcp and 3-meo-pce could be nice though, as both are stimulating. Need to try that ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Well I just injected 12mg of 3-meo-pcp into my deltoid, waited like 15 minutes, then injected 20mg of 3-meo-pce into my thigh. Not really feeling much... Weird. This isn't a new batch or anything, and I've been IMing stuff for a while. I'll wait 30 more minutes and if I'm not where I want to be, I guess I'll just dose some more orally.


This is very strange though. Maybe 12mg wasn't enough?

I found that the 3meos just don't work well IM, for some reason. Odd right?


My experience combining 3-MeO-PCP with almost any other disso is that the 3meo nearly blocks the effects of the other. Maybe it has a higher affinity for the receptors? I remember doing nitrous and barely getting a head change when I was already on 3meo. Same with DCK. MXE had some appreciable effect but could still tell that some of the effects were superceded by 3meo's effects.

I've IMed 3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCE and the latter was certainly quite effective for me, but as for the 3-MeO-PCP it did feel rather transparent which makes it harder to note the effects. When I drink vodka I get the same sort of thing compared to beer or wine... certainly ethanol's effects, sedating etc but quite clean whereas with beer and wine other things contribute to the buzz.

In what way does it not jive with women?

This drug had a terrible affect on my ex. It changed her personality and when high on it she would push doses pretty high because the effects were some what muted by the benzos she was on. The combo of those two drugs can get sloppy but also very pleasant. She was very addicted to 3meo. In that way it didn't jive. But I can see similar scenarios happening with both sexes.

I have actually followed delsyd's story and understand that this could happen with both sexes when used irresponsibly especially when in combination with benzos and the like. So here is my story with 3meopcp thus far...first disso that really has a pull on me. I bought five grams of the crystal white fluffy powder from China and love it, on its own and mixed with lysergamides especially. 


Last night my lady friend and I decided to drop 200 mics of 1p on a whim. Up until this point I had/have been dabbling in lysergamides at least once a week, occasionally throwing in a tryptamine here and there. I started carefully weighing out my doses but have gotten to the point where I will just rail up to 20-30 mgs of 3 tweet meow a day by the end of it, eye balling very irresponsible I know. The batch I have is very psychedelic and dissociating and potentiates everything greatly. Anyway, three hours in we are riding the cosmos seeing the same hallucinations convinced we have tapped into the spirit realm. Swatting at flies that aren't even there but we both see the same thing (how is that possible if a true alternate dimension/s does not exist???)  We decide to add a little propyhexedrine to the mix because I haven't been able to find pure MDMA in a while and though reluctant at first, she convinced me it will be dope. Party Monster Mode. I've candy flipped a bunch of times, and benzedrex is somewhat empoathogenic in its effects so I said fuck it and downed 250 mgs. 


Then, we each took 100 mic tab of Ald-52, followed with more tweet meow and shit got weird. My girl found a tick on her and bugged out. I own an Australian Shepard and a border collie, they like to run through fields and shit, its what they are bred to do. I buy them advantix and try to keep up, but I guess I lost track of weeks and missed their monthly dose (ticks are bad in Ohio this year). Anyway she freaked and I couldn't turn the trip around after that. She swears the 3meo makes trips dark for her but I get the opposite affect. It potentiates psyche greatly for me in a bizarre but fun way. But this is not the first time 3meow got dark on her or her other female friends.


I spoke with a colleague of mine who agrees that in his experience 3meopcp does not "jive well with the women". 


I know this is irresponsible and I shouldn't just be eyeballing 3meow but it's really got it's paws dug in real deep like...shit. 


Treat with the up most respect...I know. Bad judgement call. These 3meo's are good but certainly have their dark undertones you know? 


I've spoke with a handful of women who feel the same, they don't like it. No afterglow. Makes them think dark thoughts and trips seem to go south real quick.


Damn I miss MXE ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

jeez - i consider combining psychedelics and stims to be risky territory, and i don't think 3-meo-pcp mixes well with stimulants at all either (even taken the day aftter amphetamine IME).

i'm not at all surprised she had a bad time considering you combined stims + psychs + pcp analogue.  sounds like a recipe for a proper freakout.


theories about different sexes not responding the same way to a drug notwithstanding, that's a pretty iffy combo in my opinion.


i've heard people say similar things about feminine/masculine responses to drugs before (salvia, i think?) and while i'm sure it's possible, i think it is too much of a generalisation to say men or women are more or less likely to enjoy a certain drug or class of drugs; there are too many variables (physiological, psychological and social)

I feel really, really bad about what happened. Intuitively, I knew it wasn't a good idea, but she was having such a good time in the beginning, and honestly I just wanted to make her happy ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) she had all these activities planned for the day that we were going to do and I really just wanted her to feel good and to have an amazing time so I did what I thought was best to keep her vibe going and just went with it...Besides MDMA I have never mixed any kind of upper with a lysergi or disso, but she wanted to dance and have fun so I followed suit. It was all good, but then we found a tick on her...it hasn't latched onto her or anything, just crawling on her leggings, and I plucked it with tweezers and flushed it right away. Turns out she kind of has a phobia of ticks and for good reason, but the experience was tarnished. Started thought looping ticks are everywhere and I was tripping so hard I got defensive arguing about needing to quarantine my dogs who were upset because we were upset and they knew it had something to do with them... it was just a mess...bad times


Taking a much needed break after this. I finally got a decent job as did she, and I am really looking forward to focusing on what's really important.

As has been mentioned by others, mixing stims with tweet, because the meow is one of the most 'up' dissociatives, could end up overloading a circuit and turning the tone dark. As for the male/female thing, it really depends in the personality, but in my overall experience I find men have a slightly higher probability of finding an affinity with it and using it beneficially. It is a tough cookie to crack, and in my experience should be reserved for people who are true psychonatical explorers.

"tweet" = 3-meo-pcp?


yeah, honestly, it's not a drug i am comfortable giving to many people.  i only ever really played with it in a solo setting, and it was generally quite an introverted experience.  then again, i prefered to take singular, comparatively large doses (compared to the 'stimmy' variety that a lot of folks describe, which - like xorkoth - people seem to enjoy taking in small (possibly repeated) doses

it's not something i would give to someone that wasn't at least somewhat experienced with dissociatives or 'weird drugs'.


and i would personally never mix it with stimulants (and i've only tried the "batch" cozzie jeraph describes; the dissociating, psychedelic, not-so-mania-inducing/stimulating stuff) as i found it really quite dysphoric when taken the day after amphetamine.


psychedelics on the other hand seem to mix wonderfully with it.  so while i can see the reasoning behind such a combo,i'm not at all surprised things went pear-shaped (but i'm sorry to hear she had a bad time).

MXE, on the other hand, was pretty easy to appreciate.  but the long come-up, and the tendency for some people not to quite "get" 3-meo-pcp the first couple of times they try it makes me think it's a bit more "advanced" as far as 'psychonautical explorers' go.

it's fairly subtle - but also pretty fucking high-stakes on the whole mental health mania/psychosis front.  not something i think the general drug-taking population should really be fucking around with.  as much as i like the stuff, i don't really like the idea of it being the mainstream-ish research chemical it seems to have become.


that may sound elitist, but people really need to understand what they're fucking around with when it comes to pcp analogues - meaning they need to be well informed about the risks.  i treat this stuff with all the respect it is due; it's serious shit.

Agreed with the overall consensus that 3meo should be considered more of an introspective tool rather than a recreational party drug. I don't want to give off the impression that I or anyone else should just be going around and giving this stuff to people at random calling it the bees knees, because it is certainly not for everyone or for anyone that cannot or does not have the will to respect/see or understand it for what it is. The person I am referring to has read much about 3-meow, is very experienced with other dissos/psychs and has tried it in many different settings on several different combos including on its own and just does not ever seem to respond well to it. With that being said, she has chosen to never touch it again, and I have chosen to set it aside as I have been dabbling a bit too much lately and perhaps need to level out before I decide to pursue it further.

Yeah for me it's more of an enhancer, a social and active sort of drug, but I only really like low doses, and I prefer the kind that produces more hypomania although they're both good.  For me it isn't powerfully altering or at all inhibiting/intoxicating, but I'm taking 2mg at a time, a few doses spread over hours.  I have taken it at higher doses before and I definitely treat it almost like a different drug when taking higher doses.  I will also take low doses to potentiate pother psychedelics, it seems to work the best with LSD.

Oh, the 3-meo-pcp + lsd combo is god mode on. I don't even consider taking a lysergamide nowadays without preloading with a 3-meo or 2-oxo. Last acid trip combined with 2-oxo-pcm made for a very chilling, visual and introspective acid journey.

I see that LSD +3meow is a recommended combo, but what dosing timings do you recommend? Also, how is the interaction between psilobycin and 3meow?


One combo that I really like is low dose benzo + mid-high dose 3meow (~15mg for me).

i'd take the 3meo first, then wait at least 30 or 40 minutes, the the acid so they come up roughly around the same time.

i've only done it a couple of times, but i actually like waitting til the 3-meo-pcp kicks in (however long that takes - an hour or so) then dropping the acid so that it completely smooths off all the rough edges of the acid come-up.


it is interesting getting those first first alerts through a 3 meo filter (or 'canvas' as i like to think of it - a backdrop for your trip to be staged upon, or projected on/into

I usually took 2-3 78ug tested lsd blotters and 10mg of 3-meo-pcp orally, taking first the 3-meo-pcp and when I feel it making me happy like he likes, I take the acid. Preloading with a low dose of 3-meo (or any disso really) helps to don't giving a fuck about the acid intensity, coming up, or body load.


I'm an hardhead with psychedelics and have got disso permatolerance though. You probably want to start lower and slowly increase dosage in the next sessions to see where you can go.


I recently enjoyed the fuck out of 4 lsd untested blotters and an intense ketamine + 2-oxo-pcm snorting session. Strongest visuals I've ever experienced on LSD, with letters falling out from the computer as I tried to read them, walls melting, mandalas projecting into my floor.

I too recommend taking the 3-MeO first, and then after it's hit you, take the LSD (the same is true of any other psych combo with 3-MeO, or with MXE for that matter and I would imagine the 2-oxos also).  I found that MXE combines by far the best with tryptamines, my experience with 3-MeO and tryptamines didn't show a particular synergy and maybe they even argued with each other, but to be honest I haven't tried in quite a while.  MXE and tryptamines, on the other hand, is incredible.

Preloading with 2-OxO-PCM with acid was very nice. On the other hand, with 2-OxO-PCE I tend to combine it only with tryptamines, so I usually take them both at the same time, or the 2-OxO-PCE just half an hour before the tryptamine, in order to try to peak on both drugs at the same tame, what puts me in a trippy hardcore hole mode on for sure.

A few weeks ago I tried combining 3-MeO-PCP with acid for the first time. Took allegedly 100ug three hours after dropping 6 mg of 3-MeO-PCP.


HOLY SHIT!  


Had a pretty intense trip. Euphoria was though the roof. Full body orgasms in response to loud, textured music. Felt, unsurprisingly, pretty stimulated, but on the other hand headspace wasn't as scattered as I was anticipating it to be on this combo. Weirdly enough the visuals were kind of dulled, I would say, but the intensity of the tactile/mental psychedelia made up for it. 


Extremely pro-erotic too. I had a kind of funny/cringey situation hitting on a girl and getting all flirty and touchy with her, but then freaking out over the paranoid thought that she was feeling harassed by me and simply leaving without saying anything.

Haha ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)  Yeah, 3-MeO with LSD is one of the best LSD combos, honestly.  It really, really ramps up the emotional/mental effects and produces strong, impactful trips at pretty low dosages.  1 hit of ALD-52 (125ug) on its own is very nice, a nice little trip, nothing too intense, but a half hit of it with 3-MeO-PCP is stronger, and a whole hit is entering strong trip territory for me.  I have had some times (as on LSD itself) where the trip is quite visual and others where it isn't.  The first time I took a whole hit with 3-MeO, I had some of the strongest LSD visuals I've ever had, absolutely everything was moving, breathing, shifting shapes in complex ways.

A tiny bit of benzo can be nice especially if you need to chill out a little, but overall it's increasing the danger due to lack of impulse control.  If things start getting manic with the 3-MeO, the benzo will increase the likelihood of behavior you wouldn't want to engage in (like taking more 3-MeO).

I would recommend you DO NOT combine 3-meo-pcp with MDMA. It seems to exponentially increase the chances of something going wrong in my experience. That's part of how I got into my first "hole" and might have passed out in the camp fire if I didn't have friends to take care of me.

I can imagine that combo with MDMA 'boiling the brain' so to speak. Too much energy activation...too much serotonin for sure. Was the 'hole' more like a delirium effect or was it fully psychedelic?

I went further than any classical psychedelic has ever taken me, including DMT. thousands of years of experience in a few short hours; half an eternity in a formless void of pure energy, countless realities would emerge, converge, and dissipate, each with its own laws of physics wildly different from our own. Toward the end I felt like I was creating them. I was disappointed that I had chosen to return to Earth.

That may sound really cool but for most of the Purgatory stage (formless void of pure energy) I was in a state of near complete ego dissolution, it took a looong time (subjectively) to realize that I had an I, if you get what I mean. 


Then once I came out of it all, I experienced temporary aphasia and major difficulty with muscle control and had to be given help to get back to my tent. All very embarassing for me.

I just had one of the most powerful trips of my psychedelic career after dropping about 28mg of miprocin with some re-circulating 3-meo-pcp in my bloodstream. Was going to predose with some fresh powder but i'm glad I didn't, whatever was left from the dose I had the day before was PLENTY. I didn't even feel like tripping and had to fight against mental apprehension to do so as I was exhausted from the dissociative mind fuck I endured prior but had a hunch that an amazing synergy would prevail if I pushed on in my spiritually receptive state, and indeed it did blast my socks off! I'll try to tackle a trip report and post it in the appropriate thread but it was the type of trip where your intensity of thought reaches such dizzying heights that you become convinced if a good portion of people were also riding the same thought wave then reality and existence as we know it would cease, because the riddle would be solved. Existence is more or less the universe trying to gain full awareness and human beings play the lead role in that process because we're all mirrors of universal consciousness looking at different facets of itself; when the universe becomes fully aware that's when existence will collapse in on itself. 


At the same time why is it possible for anything to exist? Why is there more and more complexity building upon itself? It seems like it's because it has been described as being possible through language, its been programmed into reality either through linguistic narrative and/or mathematical formula but it's always programmed into reality by some language system. Science, math and the written word are like different programming languages that all define the perimeters of what is and is not. Molecules are hypothesized to exist through language, the blueprint for the microscope is written down and described through language and a molecule is perceived than solidified into reality via understanding through language. New layers to reality are programmed through language by building on the previously created reality of molecules existing and boom! suddenly we have atoms that expand on the molecule and add another layer to reality with each new concept. The reason why so many try and fail to successfully articulate the ultimate truth is because explaining such a truth through one medium is similar to trying to make a robot self-aware, an incredible and maybe impossible feat, you can't enlighten something while using that very thing as the starting point! Some sort of bridge has to be constructed to translate meaning through two different thought forms and then get interpreted. This is the same reason we might never understand the true nature of our brains 100% through mere human thought because we're thinking through our brains, subjectivity muddies everything. Just trying to explain this ultimate truth here myself and getting fucking nowhere, proving my point...I probably won't get very far in painting a clearer picture through a more polished trip report but i'll try.

I took 16mg 3-MEO-PCP a joint and about 25/30 mins later I took diclazepam 2mg. I found those two worked nicely together a nice mellow trip and decent head space. 


I'd be interested in mixing the 3-MEO-PCP with some say 1P-LSD but would imagine a lower dose would be required.

I mean, I scanned a few reddit threads and concluded that 5-7mg would be a good starting dose, but it's all relative to that particular poster's tolerance.


Yeah it was just... too crazy, I dont know what the point of an experience like that is, because you're not going to get into a hole, so what are you left with?

Eventually I had to take piracetam to abort mission, and hooray, now I can think again.

Yeah it was crazy. Never again lol.

If you really wanted a "low/medium" dose then 5-7mg would be perfect... orally. I know we say this all the time but do not underestimate this substance. Start small and work your way up carefully. It WILL bite back if you don't treat it with respect.

In my experience 7-8mg is a medium dose. There's a small pleasant rush followed by going straight to a hypomanic dissociated state. It becomes rather compulsive so I'd end up stacking doses and using a good bit of 3 meo on an IV binge sometimes resulting in an extremely hypomanic state who's tail end could last for days. 

If you become compulsive when IVing be careful with 3 meo. It's a lot of fun but can be quite dangerous.

I prefer oral, I commit to the experience like if it was LSD (and usually add LSD to the 3-meo, my favourite combo after 2-oxo-pce + 4-ho-met)


Snorted it is a more grounded, lackluster experience. Useful for partying or a more social setting though, oral is a more powerful experience that I prefer to take alone in my room.

I'm somewhat nervous about actually dropping this substance, been using it daily for well over a year now. The addition of methamphetamine and kratom had been significantly skewing my test results for the better part of a year but I'm just starting to realize how these three drugs truly interact and I gotta say.. I highly advise against the development of a kratom-meth-pcp codependency. It's enough to baffle even the most fluent of psychologists.

3 meo PCE is much more MXE like as far as the mental trip goes.

DCK is my preferred disso to hole on. Repeated low doses can get you to MXE like state too without the euphoria MxE provides.

Do you have any experience with O-PCE/Eticyclidone to compare to, Delsyd?

I do have some experience with O-PCE, though never a full hole dose. As a matter of fact I did it a couple times this past weekend, my doses were 20mg and 30mg, which are pretty high doses but did not do anything interesting for me, I did not feel as immersed in Bladerunner while watching it as I would have been on MXE, DCK or the 3meo's. I did like the tail end tho, which was reminiscent of an MXE high, with its energy and PCE touch. I think my batch of o-PCE is a little degraded or just weaker by weight because it is hydroscopic. 

I'm not writing o-PCE off but DCK has pretty consistently given me deep experiences with a nice afterglow to follow.

@crashing


Hope you can wean down a bit mate, youll need a break one way or another and if steering wheel is gone, hopefully some brake juice is left.


I need to stop after 14 days of 3meopcp and some poly drug use. Nothing in comparison tho! Best of luck

The meth has been very sporadic and I'm pretty much through with it. Ultimately the kratom has been my biggest downfall and currently I've got about a week off of it. Still dabbling with the meo though, maybe 20mg per day so I am weaning off of it. It just feels like without taking a tiny bit I have no motivation to do anything productive, but i'm sure it's entirely psychological because nothing is really stopping me for being productive at this point. I took time off of work to get clean from kratom completely and I go back this weekend and am looking forward to getting into the routine of spending the majority of the day sober and saving the nighttime for any psychedelic and or dissociative endeavors.

I'm working on cutting down on the GABAergics myself, I'm 18 days into no phenibut (after years on it every other day or less frequently), and working on reducing my alcohol intake.  Chilling out on drugs can be pretty hard.  I want to get to the sober weeks and druggy weekends too.  I'm glad the meth was sporadic, that shit can really fuck with you, worse than 3-MeO.


I ran out of 3-MeO myself, a little while back.  I have a bit of 3-MeO-PCE but I don't feel the same desire to take it regularly.

Yeah, i highly recommend steering well clear of the opiates and stimulants in the present day. Given the tumultuous nature of things.  The pot seems to be being perpetually stirred at rates that even the most loyal of Sears Credit Card holders are struggling to keep up with. Time to gather the remains. Get on the scrape game. Bump the jungle beats and clench down with spiritual vigor.

Yesterday after microdosing 2C-E (500ug) and not really getting where I wanted and finding the state not useful for intellectual purposes. I changed my mind and took 14mg of 3-MeO-PCP on top. That is the maximum dose I have done. I've been building 1mg at a time the dosage with 2-6 weeks between dosages.


I had never before mixed a dissociative with a psychedelic so I thought to check how the dissociative behaved during a very low dose of a psychedelic could be a good way to get my feet wet. I have already read multiple times around here how dosages of both should be reduced, but I thought due to my very low 2C-E dosage I could risk it. 


The experience was really good, I couldn't really feel the character of the psychedelic at all, just got a strong 3-MeO-PCP experience. And a longer duration. A bit on my limit. I have never understood the risks of psychosis with 3-MeO-PCP but they were quite evident this time. I really enjoyed the mania state and got good insights from it. But I feel like I am touching my glass ceiling with 3-MeO-PCP. 15mg on its own might be very well my limit. And this experience something not to repeat often.


For those of you that mix dissociatives with psychedelics could you report the dosages on their own and when in combo, so I can compare the differences. 3-meo-pcp+LSD dosages especially interested in.

I once microdosed 2C-E at 2 mg thinking it would be like a stim, and it just made me an anxious mess. My pupils were slightly dilated and that made me a lot more paranoid and anxious. I also was at work. Never again ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Answering your question, I recently did 6 mg of 3-MeO-PCP in two hours later dropped 100 ug of 1P-LSD. It was awesome, had a pretty euphoric trip. The visuals were dampened somehow, but the headspace was incredible, kinda manic but not anxious at all. What stood out the most for me was the euphoria, specially in response to music. I also got incredibly horny during the peak. Experienced significant time dilation. I would say I tripped harder, but not by much. Felt like, maybe 150 ug. But more than amplifying the trip, it kind of changed its character, but in a positive way. It was intense for sure.

^I had a very similar experiencing mixing 3-MeO-PCP with 1P-LSD (or was it LSZ? one of the analogs anyways), sooo much euphoria. I was at a show and music sounded incredible. I couldn't stop hooping and wanted everyone to watch me. The visuals were minor but it didn't matter because I felt so goooood. I think I wrote about this experience more in depth earlier in the thread.

Been messing around with 3meo for around 6 months now.


No other drug has me as perplexed and in love with it (as well as wary of my addiction to) as 3meo. Ive been experimenting with many different psychedelics for a few years now. But no other drug has caught my attention like 3meo.


I dont even know why i love it... cant explain it


Have experimented with most ROA/dosings from multiple days in a row, high doses (up to 50mgish), redosing, snorting, and oral consumption.


For anyone interested in trying it heres some things i noticed:

-**can be really addicting for some people (was for me). **If you are going to redose, know your plan before hand and stick to it.

-anything above 15mg for me produced a catatonic state, the higher the dose the more catatonic. (Mistakenly mixed it with psychedelics in high doses... 2ce more than once. Had a really strange experience where i did this two nights in a row and had incredible deja vu halfway thru the second night where i did the same actions as i did the night before, starting off the 3meo at midnight while still on 2ce taking a shower and a whole laundry list of other items, then 3 hours later the second night I saw it, deja vu, perspective on what I had been doing for the past 24 hours... 3meo seems to nullify the feeling of pain, so it wasnt painful)

-But needless to say complete confusion, oev and cev zooming in and out uncontrollably, partial to almost complete loss of motor skills, stuttering/incoherent words, minimal/absent memory were common/unavoidable at high doses. I mostly would sit and stare at my ceiling for hours when this happened. Do not recommend. I didnt gain much from it other than writing in my notebook more than one time things like "dont do this again" (when I do drugs it is common for me to write about my experience and note how I feel what I notice etc)

-i have noticed decreased enjoyment from drugs i always enjoy, acid/psychedelics in particular. Not sure why. Dont get visuals as much or lengthy trips. This may be because of heavy psychedelic use in general but even on t breaks, they still dont hit as hard. May or may not be from 3meo. I miss the WOW! effect ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

-when i dose properly there are very few noticeable negative effects

-every experience is so different on 3meo...

-i prefer oral consumption, hold under tongue for 5-10 minutes then swallow with sweetened or flavored drink (has a not so pleasant chemical taste). Snorting hits harder and faster but doesnt last nearly as long. Maybe 2 hours. 

-oral consumption often follows this plateau pattern for me: 

1. 0-1hrs: come up, noticeable within 5-10 minutes. Euphoria, loss of motor skills depending on dose. Sometimes uncomfortable. 

2. 1-3hrs: second plateau. In the 3meo zone. If dose is too high its obvious here.

3. 3-4 hrs: incredibly meditative third plateau. Some of my most cherished and profound insights always happen around this time... it feels like what it would feel like to be done meditating after meditating for hours

-i have noticed a marked change in my speech over the past few months, even when sober. Using the wrong words, stuttering. Doesnt bother me really but other people notice and im sure they dont like it.

-this drug is not for everyone. Start with another disso first (or weed psychs if you have not done those yet)

-marked anti depressant effects even when sober. 

-Ive been tempted to micro dose for weeks but ive opted not to do this more than a few days out of fear of possible long term damage, tolerance, knowing how addicting it is for me, and more


Oh, 3meo

Hey, welcome to bluelight ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

Thanks for sharing your experience. This compound is fascinating as it is puzzling (And maybe that's one of the reasons its so appealing). I've been using it weekly/biweekly on average for a year and a half now, and I still find it somewhat unpredictable. As you said every experience is so different. Sometimes the same dose has me manic and stimulated, and another day feeling disphoric and confused. Experiences for me have been mostly positive, and I use it at the lower range most of the time.

I haven't thought about this, but now that you mentioned it I must say I agree. It is more pronounced on higher dosages (13 mg is the most I've done at once iirc). That nice feeling of mental clarity is indeed akin to a long meditation session. What you describe as the "second plateau" is usally rather confusing at doses over 10 mg, but after that there some zen like stillness.

This on the other hand I find rather concerning. Which kind of dosages are you taking and how often? This is usual on dissos but not after coming down from them. I would take that as a symptom of accumulation of the material in your system. 3-MeO-PCP is supposed to have a rather long elimination half-life. I would encourage anyone experiencing this kind of side effects  to take a break from all dissos.

Wow, you describe the fun of playing with 3 meo pcp, perfectly.


I have used 1 grm over about 20 days, had a break of 6 months and 1/2 way through another 1grm.

Im discovering what you have described, except i have mi xed with either weed or low aphp doses instead of psychedelics

christ that's a lot.

i got 5g years ago, and still have most of it left.  it's equally wonderous and sorta firghtening i think.

i tend to do it irregularly, and take (inadvisably) high doses.


it's like it completely shatters your consciousness, and as the pieces start falling back into place, i get some pretty astounding revelations.

i don't take it as a functional stimulant, i do it as a psychedelic dissociative and generally focus on music.  it's sensational for that.


i've never had any desire to take it more than once or twice a month.

sometimes i'll do it a few times in a couple of weeks, then leave it alone for months.  for me it has no addictive potential, really - i can take it or leave it (which is not typically what i'm like with drugs - if i have weed or opiates around, for instance, i'll take them)


while it sometimes gives me wonderful reassurance that i'm on the right track in life, other times it brings me very close to an understanding  (and acceptance) of my own mortality, much like a traditional psychedelic.


unlike a lot of psychs though, as much as i enjoy the afterglow, i don't necessarily feel like i've done something that's gentle on my body or mind.  i kinda worry about the potential neurotoxicity of the stuff.


it can be insanely beautiful - but also just **insane**.


the only time i took too much, i was staying in a hostel, and had to check out by 10am and catch a flight later that day.  i had stupidly taken *all* of the small stash i brought with me - which was probably something like 60mg.

it was fucking terrible.  i had no sense of self or ability to function in any way.  how i managed to actually get home safely i'll never know.  i was alone at the time, but managed to call a friend, and she came and took me out to a cafe that had couches and a cruisy vibe, and we ate and drank coffee, til finally i was able to get to the airport.

one of the stupidest things i've ever done - redosing with a head full of 3-meo-pcp - and downing the whole lot.

i'm amazed nothing really bad happened - but i'm thankful that the dissociation eventually passed.

it's the only time i've fucked up with this stuff, because it does scare me, and it was only my dissociated state that led me to do such a recklessly dumb thing.


lesson learned, but i'm grateful it didn't cause any permanent damage - or worse.

i've known people that have ended up getting sectioned and locked up in a psych ward from this stuff.  it really deserves a lot of respect.

I agree with all what you said. Not addictive potential for me either, and I am known for my addictive behaviours. Dissociatives and serotonergic psychedelics are the exceptions. I kind of feel concerned about people abusing this stuff. My impression is that it should be treated with utmost respect. 1 gram in 20 days is asking for trouble. As high doses are. 


I don't like the small dosages (under 5mg) I don't get revelations there and I don't find it pleasurable.


I own less than a gram and it might outlive me. Extremely good revelations value for the buck.

Agreed that a gram in 20 days is a shit ton of 3-MeO-PCP, I don't even think I could manage to do that if I tried.  Even when I was dosing many days out of the month, it would take at least 4 months to go through a gram.

3-MeO-PCP is a great drug, but I have to say I've seen more people get crazy on it, as in, losing the plot, extreme mania followed by psychosis, than any other drug.  I've felt that a little myself, although I don't seem prone to psychosis as I've never experienced it regardless of some truly insane drug taking before.  If you're prone to mania/psychosis, I would suggest steering well clear of this drug.

Even using this at a rate of 1 gram every few months I can say that this stuff can really throw you off! If thrown off is what you're after, I still recommend using extreme caution. I am very thankful for this chem, but I think it's very specifically unique and shouldn't be messed with on any regular basis or in tandem or at high dose whatsoever. Beautifully insane, mostly insane. Best wishes if you have an addictive personality.

if i had to sum up my advice to people regarding this chemical in two words, those would be it!


i *definitely* have an addictive personality - very, very much so (!) but 3-meo-pcp is so fucking intense and weird and inexplicable that i have absolutely no desire to use it all the time.


having said that, the people who report getting stimulating, mania-inducing stuff (as opposed to dissociating trippy stuff, which is how i describe mine [i only ever bought it once, but see that 5 grams as a "lifetime supply"]) seem to use it much more compulsively that i do.

i've definitely redosed, but only in the one "session" - i've never found myself redosing days on end, or even the next day.


so some of these subjective things are probably skewed by the different effects people seem to get from different batches (to revisit that whole mysterious can of worms...)

Me too. I have only redosed a couple of times when it didn't seem to work. I can count with one hand the times I redosed a dissociative. Suppose I am too scared to abuse this powerful class of drugs. Or I just control it for some reason. Whatever might be, it is a blessing. A nice change for my irrational use of downers and uppers.


I have the same stuff that you have probably because I could never get any stimulant effect out of low doses. More like a drunk dissociation feel, very uninteresting. Don't like low doses of MXE or ketamine either.

I don't personally find heavy dissociative experiences addictive, in fact I haven't even tried to have one in like 2 years despite having access.  I find the low dose effects of 3-MeO pretty addictive though, it's not really intense at all, it just makes you feel really great, very functional.  


I ran out of this a bit ago, I've scraped the bag a couple of times over the past month.  Don't really miss it even though I have a tendency to low dose with some frequency when I have it.  I've got 3-MeO-PCE right now, a little anyway, but I don't like it as much for low dosing so haven't been doing that either.

did you find mxe addictive or compulsive?

i'm struggling to remember now, but i think i felt more comfortable taking that a couple of nights a week for months on end, but i've never done that with 3-meo-pcp.

for me the insomnia from certain dissos (mxe and 3-meo-pcp specifically) that keeps me from doing them too often.

disso mindset + sleep deprivation = mental health time bomb for me.

I went through a period of using MXE like 2-3 times a week, whenever me and my friends would get together someone would suggest MXE and we'd all want to do it.  These days, I have a bit of MXE still, I've used it like twice the past year, to combine with tryptamines.  Of course I would have used it more often except I don't know if I'll ever be able to get more.

Yeah MXE is amazing, really something unique and special.  It's so weird that no one is producing it.  It's not even illegal everywhere.  Not even if the US.  It used to get sold super cheap so it must not be that hard to produce.  And the demand is certainly there, imagine how massive a thing that would be if someone just started offering it again, it would sell out.  So what the fuck?


Did you know that a BLer who used to mod this forum invented MXE?  True story. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) [Here's his first TR](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/503180-(Methoxetamine-25-mgs)-First-time-Heaven-on-Earth?highlight=methoxetamine).

Of all powders, pills and potions I have taken over the years MXE stands head and shoulders above and beyond them all. To me there is a seriously spiritual side to this like no other..


From all the posts online about people lamenting the passing of MXE and waxing lyrical about how good it is I am confused as to why its not being made. I am sure some chemist from China could set themselves up elsewhere and churn it out by the bucket load, (like you say it didn't cost an arm and a leg leading me to agree with the ease of produce). The demand is out there so what the fuck, bound to be someone can make it.


Interesting about the BLer discovering. I am among giants here ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've been using it weekly/biweekly on average for a year and a half now, and I still find it somewhat unpredictable. As you said every experience is so different. Sometimes the same dose has me manic and stimulated, and another day feeling disphoric and confused. Experiences for me have been mostly positive, and I use it at the lower range most of the time.

I would encourage anyone experiencing this kind of side effects  to take a break from all dissos.

I will disclose here that I personally have been have been suffering from long term depression compounded by social isolation, lack of employment, a money source to live off (mom died when I was 10 and left me a trust fund) and in general a reason to not give a fuck about the damage that I do to my body for the past year or so especially (I'm 22)


I know the general advice is not to do psychs/dissos if you are not mentally stable, but depression, loneliness and boredom is magical in its ability to convince you that an RC called 3meo just might be worthwhile to do in your boredom (then again boredom and depression is magical in its ability to convince you to try anything to get out of this state of mind...)


---

When I first encountered 3meo back in Dec 2016 I started off small, 7mg. I had done ketamine before then (AKA: fell in love with, got addicted to, and eventually abandoned ketamine after uncontrollably absorbing 2g of ketamine in 2 months after first trying. bought two grams after getting a sample. I dont want to spill here what I did with ketamine).** I am hoping to find solace in my personal adventure through a confusing series of events that still has yet to explain itself to me.

**

The first time I did 3meo I stayed at home and was in love with how I felt. Carefree. Suddenly who I was in the past was thrown out the window. Smooth psychedelic distortion combined with slight amnesia, a frame of mind that I can't explain even to this day. I loved the music I listened to, the creative pursuits I found, the writing I spilled.


I was living by myself, I wouldn't see anyone else for weeks at a time in a busy city. Being lonely in an otherwise busy city is disconcerting and I know its my fault. Nothing is more alienating than being an unconfirmed disso addict shopping for groceries whilst other supposedly undisturbed individuals carry on their weekly grocery retrieval skills.


I had a friend and family that I could reach out to (they lived hours away) but what are they going to do? Talk to me on the phone and attempt to babysit me and tell me not to do drugs and seek help and get a job and be happy? They meant well but it just wasn't socially acceptable to ask them to solve my problems, namely why am I depressed and somewhat suicidal.


2017 starts and I find myself falling into spells of erratic 3meo usage. I did not keep an accurate log of the amounts I did, when and why.


Boredom. Isolation. A spell of passion convinced me possessing 5grams of 3meo was a worthwhile pursuit, lo and behold, I suddenly possessed enough 3meo to last any sane man a lifetime


And so I found myself falling into amnesiac fits of depression masked by 3meo.


I hope I don't appear as if I am bragging. Me writing this out is therapeutic in its own regard.


Whenever my situation became too much... I went straight to my plastic storage cabinet and retrieved my scale along with my Freedom


Looking back on it now I didnt see myself as an addict, I just saw myself as someone trying to get through the next day, to breathe and not feel utterly suicidal.


I have come so far in my understanding of myself, through LSD and many other psychedelics that I simply can't believe that I would be addicted to any one single drug, a dissociative especially

Yeah, i think that's about right.


Nice to see Xork planting seeds though ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

MXE was the first "research chem" i went out of my way to obtain, and i wish i knew then how prized, rare and sought-after it would become.

Thanks for posting that link to F'n'B's first trip report, also.

I didn't it was first synthesized/sampled as late as 2010.  I thought it had been around for a little longer than that.

It's a mighty special substance, and i hope to come across it again someday.

MXE + 4-AcO-DMT gave me a couple of the best trips i've ever had.

Nothing else i've had really comes close to a couple of those experiences.  Simply magic.

But there are people producing other illicit drugs that are banned in China that aren't the "main" illegal ones, MXE was very popular and probably one of the most pined-for drugs on the Internet.

Also, I'm sure it has the potential to become on the "the main ones" if it was more widespread and well known ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I think part of the issue is that there are not enough illicit labs with experience synthesizing ACHAs. Ketamine for example, the main illegal disso, comes mostly from parts were it is unregulated and is legally synthesized at pharma grade.

it sure seems to be, especially on bluelight.  


we'er going a bit off-topic here, i'm sorry - but it seems like 3-meo-pcp is the 'mainstream' arylcycloheaxamine of choice amongst the RC crowd nowadays - which is another reason i wish MXE was still around; it had a far, far higher safety profile, from potency to effects.


all these kids taking a super fucking potent PCP analogue is scary.  not just because of the reputation of PCP as being this evil drug that makes people into monsters - but the sheer intensity and potency of the material.

i'm **so** careful with it - i treat it with the utmost respect and care - but i've still had a couple of train wrecks with it.

i love it, but i can't remember the last time i took any, and have no real desire to any time in the near future.


far less dangerous, and from my experience, far more forgiving.

reading fast and bulbous' trip report reminded me of the first time i tried MXE. that 'wrapped in cotton wool' feeling - wow.

i feel like i pushed it a bit far in the end, but it sure was an incredible substance.


i do really like 3-meo-pcp too - it's pretty magical, but it feels much riskier.  i once got lost in my own house, and it took me hours to realise that i'd just been standing in the laundry in the dark... 


though, one time i took MXE  and couldn't work out what time it was.

i looked at the clock - it said 12:30.

but still - i seriously couldn't work out if it was 12:30 in the afternoon, or half past midnight.

...so i decided that if i walked outside my apartment, it would be obvious.


i walked outside, stood on the lawn outside my front door - but nope. 

still no idea.  (it was night time!)


dissociatives are fucking weird man :D

MXE is popular with RC community, but most people have never heard of it. 


Because of that, the demand is just not large enough to incentivize underground chemists 

to set up a lab procedure which involves difficult reactions and hard-to-get reactants. 


The existing facilities are just two or three labs in China, and they have switched to 

not yet illegal ACH's as noted before.

Heh, that's hilarious. Dissociatives are pretty weird all right.

Once I was coming out of a hole on MXE and tried to text a friend but the only thing I could type was "BOARDS ... OF ... CANADA" each word in a different text message xD

One time on MXE I was holding a can of beer in my left hand and a cigarette-style e-cig vape in my right hand, and the beer felt like it was as thin as a hair, impossibly thin, while the e-cig felt like it was gargantuanly wide, so massive that it made me anxious (for some reason).


Yep, weird. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Oh yeah, I've had the feelings where my hands are super small, or super large, I just rolled with it and noted yet another oddity in the land of many funny things. Not really with 3meo but definitely with more than one batch of MXE

I got into RC's because of MXE and its potential to create a spiritual expereince. Man I wish I had been able to stock up ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

For me a mix of 4-HO-MET/MXE helped along with a couple of joints brings me to an intense spiritual and ultimately life affirming place regularly. Pity more couldn't experience its glorious effects.

This is more a general thought rather than exclusive, but it occurred to me the other day that the headspace of 3-meo and many RC's don't seem as shallow as they used to. I remember listening to a Terence Mckenna talk where he recalls his experience's with ketamine being hollow or as though he were exploring an empty office building that hadn't been occupied yet and he mused that it could be related to these newer drugs not having been imprinted by the spirit of as many trippers, as though there was a collective identity being established after more and more individuals instilled their energies into the experience. Does anyone else feel the experiences becoming more rich with the passing of time? I clearly remember when I started exploring RC's that many of them felt more like cheap knockoffs of their classic counterparts, but now I seem to get just as deep and wholesome trips off of the RC trypts and dissociatives. Maybe it's just i'm not as biased as I used to be? ...then again I don't remember ever having been consciously biased towards anything or had any reason to believe an RC couldn't do what the classics could...interesting.

You may be on to something Phenpsycho. I have discussed this theory in the past with no ultimate conclusions, but I feel it could have validity with dissociative RCs due to the nature of their effects. At one point I thought maybe different batches of MXE have differing spaces because of the collective consciousness that had been entangled with the tuning of that particular batch. For instance, one batch got me talking with a British accent and saying all sorts of Brit colloquialisms. One batch was always very peaceful and spiritual, while another one got me hearing hard electronic music. Maybe those colorings have to do with the circles of people whose used those batches and left residual dreams or entangled consciousness on that particular 'aetheric frequency' for lack of better phrase.

I see it being a distinct possibility that both collective morphogenic fields surrounding substances as a whole as well as batches themselves are a real phenomena. It only makes sense, what with the patterning, re-patterning, and de-patterning nature of reality.

I am open to the idea that this exists, a sort of collective consciousness space we are creating through use and community.  Of course this could even be all or partly because of the community and discussion itself... if we're all talking about these experiences and especially if we're writing and reading detailed reports, it would make sense that our experiences would start to merge, since expectation is a powerful thing.  I mean, it's possible to have all sorts of deep and mind-manifesting effects from other mental states besides drug-induced.  I think it would be interesting to do a study where participants were either part of the community or just the types that know about mushrooms and acid, or psychedelic naive, and were given either the classic being compared against (say, psilocin, or LSD, or mescaline) or the research chemical being tested, or placebo.  Then give them a very detailed post-questionnaire that, if well-designed, could identify very specific qualities/effects.  Also maybe a written section that could be "coded" by humans into an effects profile.  I'd be curious how much the results for each substance would overlap in each group.

That would be an extremely interesting study, Xorkoth, yes! The same methodology could be applied to lots of different areas as well, neural association of images/colors with feelings, thought, or moods, association of environments with the same, etc. etc. That's a great idea for a scientifically minded probe into the collective consciousness of humanity.

It would be especially interesting to do the same study in 2 phases like 2-5 years apart, and see if the general trend of effects has changed over time to follow the general community-based trend.

Fair enough, but I present 2 cases that defy this theory. The first was 2008 on my first DMT trip. I had no expectations, and no prior reading of DMT trip reports. All I knew was it was a fucking trip, and the resulting experience was in line with what I would 'expect' now, given all my reading and additional experiences since that time.

The second was with, well, MXE. Had no clue what I was getting into, hardly even had experience with ketamine, but the experiences didn't feel different than those experiences I had after engaging in discussion about MXE within a year.

Yea I would argue pretty vehemently that morphogenic field based phenomena ala patterning, collective consciousness induced and modulating action, and the like are all existing phenomena. Shamanism is a great example of this, a seemingly latent and built-in capability for humans to travel outside of their physical body time-space configurations. The trends we see in ethnic communities when certain outside cultural norms or mores are introduced, directing leading to and correlating with rises in crime, poverty, and illness. Etc. Everything is a dynamic system, and each system a part of another, as well as a host to countless more. The microcosm shows the macrocosm it is a part of as the macro shows the micro. Look at Earth's weather patterns, it's a closed system with each part affecting the other. The metaphysical is undeniable if you allow yourself to go there, so to deny the possibility of certain attributes and aspects of consciousness modulated by substances to exist and then further, the use of said substances and consciousness's experienced to modulate those base aspects and attributes, creating in a sense a feedback loop or cycle of co-creation, is in my opinion ridiculous.


This is not to say it is ridiculous to claim otherwise, but ridiculous to claim it's impossibility.

There is no way to avoid the "mania" or "psychosis" (yes, they are just labels) because what will emerge is your own 

mind that has its own life and rhythms and you will just feel it in different way than you do in your "ordinary" 

consciousness. 


And because you have lived your entire life turning at the same time as your mind is turning, it can be 

a bit of shock to see that your mind is something, alive and separate from what you are...


But it can be very humbling, very liberating.. Or it can mess you up, unfortunately. That is why utmost 

care and a certain respectful attitude is necessary if you take these substances...

For me it was just that. I took strong+ dose and the feelings were unimaginable. I just cryed and laughed out of pure joy. After i wore off i took another similiar dose if i remember right these both were ~25mg so 50mg total and that snapped my brain completely. Took almost a week to recover.

Its a complex drug.


Im finding low doses daily ( around 3- 5mg) has lead to me being not as sharp as i was. I read someone else suggesting word recollection was dulled.

I agree with this, including slightly less memory recollection. And focus has decreased.


Sure anti anxiety effects are great. But i cannot even see the mania (which at these lower doses you feel you can control/enjoy) except several days later and it seems to pass...?


My first stint with this drug was amazing but i feel less praise for it now. Batch is good brw, just daily dosing experiences are less enjoyable.

@wiserthanearlier


In the spirit of harm reduction I cannot recommend daily dosing. However, it seems like you hit that weird gray area between a micro and a full dose where mostly the negative effects manifest. 


I've not tried microdosing 3-meo-pcp, but with LSD taking even a little too much got me way too jittery, tense, and mentally scrambled, while also never developing to the positive effects you would hope for in an actual trip.

Like others have said, the only thing to minimise the chances of manic behaviour is to avoid redosing or using on consecutive days. Also, some unwise people (ie. me) used it at the same time as potent stimulants - that's a fast track to a psychotic break. Also, using it at the same time as synthetic cannabinoids is a good way to go insane. One of the synths, MXE, 3-meo-pcp, and a-PVP was how I had my rubbing-clonazepam-in-my-eyes experience and then later coming to in the rain outside my house.

Wow mxe, 3meo-pcp, a random synth and apvp.


That tops my most extreme poly drug use for sure.

Does 3meo-pcp combinecwith other disso?


Been wondering about 60mg diphenidine with preload 2mg 3meo-pcp... lol


I must admit, 3meo- pcp, a stim and a little weed is very hedonistic for me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

No point in adding a stim to 3-meo, it feels unconfortable, 3-meo is highly stimulating on it's own.

Actually come to think of it, 3meo + DMT was one of the best psychedelic experiences I've ever had...


Unfortunately, since I'm balls deep in uni, I don't think I'll have the time to take dissociatives until winter break at the earliest ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I am back! After a 6 month break. Catching up on the forum & I just read over some of the manic episodes people went through. 


Man, I was SO lucky during the episodes I had! This stuff is amazing, when treated with absolute caution. Anyone that has an disposition to dose often should not touch this stuff! Or anyone with an unstable mind. I definitely felt like I wanted to dose often but luckily have a relatively stable mind which definitely helped ground me.


If you meditate, this stuff can really have an effect on you that falls outside of usage. During the time I was on it I was totally present, 100% of the time. I had no desire to project myself into the past or the future because I felt great (PCP euphoria feels relatively natural at times). Then even when I was no longer on PCP I was still way more present than normal! For probably weeks. I have a feeling this stuff acts in many ways similar to psychadelics, activating the right hemisphere and causing mindfulness. Granted I am very interested in Buddhism and mindfulness in general, which I am sure helped. Has anyone else found this?


I had 2 or 3 manic episodes during use and I still won't touch the stuff for another 2/3 months. If you guys want I can share those, but they are pretty intense to describe and as I said I was incredibly lucky not to have caused any serious damage to my life. In relation to my job, relationships & with police etc to be honest. Literally anything could have happened. I don't think you realise what mania is until you experience it.

Ketamine has earned a place among the psychedelics for healing.  PCP I have no experience with, eticyclodone (sp?) was not healing for me...so what of 3meopcp?  Lots of potential to heal or harm, lets all tread lightly!

all of the above, I would say.

I think it can certainly be healing, but it's a subjective descriptor.

I just see ketamine as very shallow compared to 3meo or mxe. It's the lack of monaminergic activity


I think ketamine rep has more to do with prevalence and pcps bad rep has more to do with ghetto ppl overdosing on smoked doses of it.

I see em as pretty different.  Ketamine is a reliable and safe OBE.  I don't connect with it being shallow otoh, I see 3meo as "more applicable" to everyday life.  I cannot explain what I mean by that, so let the meaning stay open....and apply as you see fit.


Anyway, I've reached a hole with 3meo but you have sooooooo much else going on with the stimulation and lack of anesthetic action....thus the 30min in a 3-MeO hole is.....not the end of story because then there is the 24hr superman thing next (assuming you have that batch.)  I'm never sure what they send me because of the lack of personal connection I believed I had with what I was eating from 2000-2010.  Id sware the 3meo of a few years ago is not what im getting now...granted Ive only had it three times since the superman stuff of 2014, as generous gifted samples.

I just had an episode on this last night (dosed 15mg in a gelcap then another 12(+,-)mg about an hour later) although I hesitate to call it manic, it was more like an episode of ecstatic realization ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). It was the type of experience where you realize everything about you is just an act and you get to come fully unhinged and be the 'real you' if you know what that feels like. You remember what it feels like to be a child of the universe, it's a better feeling than orgasm, better than railing a fat line of your favorite dope. I came out of that trance where I got to be free from being the pretend me shaking from the euphoria and realizing i've had that exact same experience before on this stuff but usually when I have that experience I forget what it feels like right away and fall right back into my neurotic thought processes, this time it stuck with me even upon sleeping and waking up. 


I remember now i'm just acting, doing an excellent job at deceiving myself to believe I should be miserable on some level because I feel trapped in the act, I need to find a different act and I know coming unhinged on 3-meo-pcp all the time isn't the answer nor is it sustainable, but the fact that it can temporarily make you remember you're acting is invaluable. I can't believe how easy it is to deceive ourselves into thinking the script is real. It doesn't matter who you are busy being, if you're not happy being that person anymore, you can change and choose to play a different role. I don't know how so many of us forget that so easily! 

I remember having similar sentiments during my first heroic mushroom trip years ago where I broke through, but 3-meo-pcp seems to be able to 'unhinge' the user much more easily and it's even a common effect for me at appropriate dosages except that amnesia seems to erase the memory of the experience as soon as it's over until the next time I have the experience; somehow this time I managed to remember it and remember i've had the same experience many times before! So i'm sharing it here for all the rest who may have the same experiences but quickly forget once they're thrown back into playing their regular roles. This might be the same thing people describe when they say they feel like they've "come home" after an absence from being in that mental space, now that I think of it there was a very comforting feeling of being at home in that space. 


It's beautiful to realize all the emotions we get caught up in while going about day to day life really don't mean much. It's so easy to get caught up in believing in our suffering. We're all actors playing these roles and if we take ourselves too seriously it can lead to suffering, we need to always remember to take a step back every so often and experience being a child of the universe again. I'm amazed something like 3-meo-pcp can help us get back home if only for long enough to come back rejuvenated and able to either play our roles even better or switch them up if we aren't happy playing the part anymore.


Now I have to figure out how to abandon this role I have been playing for so long without setting off the alarms 8(

I am talking about the effect 3-MeO-PCP has on your brain. For me, personally it seems to heavily activate my right brain hemisphere. I know this because it to pulls me directly into the present. I have no ambition to daydream (project myself) into the past or the future and find it easy to just do what I am doing and have a great time doing it. Not only that but I feel like I am in a permanent flow state. Creativity is massively enhanced, my ability to communicate and listen to others - enhanced. the list goes on.


This is low doses, I don't do any high doses. But even the low doses, with correct dosing has led me to psychosis after a few days in a row. All of my episodes have been positive. But they could have EASILY been the opposite way. 


Personally I recommend using this stuff for something creative, once a week absolute max, ideally once every month. Combined with meditation I think it's a tool for personal healing and creativity. But it's too easily abused because you can seemingly live a day-to-day life on it... until you can't (you have a manic episode). Frightening that it can seemingly happen out of nowhere, but it is definitely from re dosing over a few days to a week - so I think completely avoidable.

Thanks! Nice work. Every few months is even better!


It really has lasting effects. I think because it doesn't really make you out of it, at low doses you don't forget any of it - which is amazing. 


Can I ask what do you usually do while on it? Go out? Relax? Listen to music? All the above?

the majority of times i've taken it, has been in the dark, listening to music with headphones, eyes closed.


although, last time i took it was at an experimental music festival, which was *utterly mind blowing*!


one of the acts had a light show based around the brion gysin dream machine.  the music was incredible, and as the show started, the band recommended the audience 'watch' the show with eyes closed.  the light created full-blown CEVs (even for people who weren't on drugs) - which was pretty fascinating, given the nature of dissociatives.


it's a pretty amazing molecule - and a great tool for a lot of different purposes, but i prefer to use it, as you say, in a meditative  and self-reflective way.

i tend to treat it with the same amount of respect as LSD.  yes you *can* take it regularly, but i think it's best not to.

Yeah, I have done the same and it was extremely fun. Do you dose orally or insufflation? 


That sounds awesome! Just looked up the dream machine - looks seriously cool, would be amazing at a festival!!


I agree. I think that is where it can really shine. Or through creative practice. Made me realise how important a clear mind if for creativity. When you feel the euphoria from this stuff, your mind clears because your worries fade away, then it is really easy to find solutions or new ideas. Only thing is I have had a few instances of thinking I have the best idea ever, to return to normal thinking it's average.


Did you ever try MXE? This is really the only thing that has compared for me but I would love to try PCE at some point too.

I don't recommend smoking weed if you're on a hefty dose of this stuff. I didn't want to mention it in case it's just a personal thing but the few time's I decided to smoke weed while on 10mg+ of this stuff I got a trip straight to the depths of hell. Nothing made any sense and if I was in a bad situation I could have done some regrettable things in the confusion I would imagine. A complete loss of awareness of what was going on each time and nothing registering as reality. Think of listening to songs on the radio you've heard for years that suddenly seem like alien nonsense and forgetting that the feeling will pass which could cause a freak out, nothing seems familiar at all. It's easy to get completely lost in your head on the combo and if you're not vegging out on your couch/bed it could get dangerous i'd imagine.

orally, i hate smorting drugs (and especially this stuff).

It takes about an hour to kick in usually, but nevertheless the oral ROA is very strong.  Comes on hard when it does finally kick in.


I really like it with weed, but i've smoked weed for a long time and don't tend to get paranoid or anything negative from it.

I feel like some of my experiences with this stuff are influenced by the only "batch" i've tried -

I knos 3meo pcp as a dissociating psychedelic type of drug, not the manic stim that a lot of people report getting.

Seems like the effects and their implications can vary a lot depending on the material, but it's still a very murky subject, with no proof "speedy" or "dissociating" batches are even a real thing ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Yeah the audio distortion is a footnote compared to the more well known effects. I usually put on something I'd never heard before or at least didn't know well because music that I was very familiar with just sounded wrong.

You ever experienced the flanging/phasing effects of 3meo pcp?

I'd not really experienced that on drugs before, except maybe nitrous or something.

Pretty wild - sounds like some nasty guitar stomp box or something.

You ever been sitting there when it starts to rain heavily while you're on 3-pcp or high doses of MXE? I've had that a few times and each time it was like a computer which was glitching out. A kind of static, staccato blast of digital signal hits so you think the simulation you're living in has glitched out and you're "waking up".

Try taking a shower on 3-MeO-PCP, MXE, or O-PCE. It sounds like lasers everywhere around you.

Yes!

Great descriptions.  3-meo-pcp has such a "digital" vibe to it.

Never heard of 3-MeO-PCP being neurotoxic. I would imagine chronic NMDA antagonism can have the potential to "atrophy" your brain in the same way not using a muscle can atrophy it, but I guess taking it no more than once a week/ once every two weeks should be enough to negate any undesired long lasting effect.s

Agreed ! Specially at the higher, more dissociating doses, or combined with weed where it's psychedelic qualities shine in my experience. 

I haven't had it in a while now. Got a bunch of ketamine recently so that has been my go to disso; and even though the effects are VERY different I try not to use NMDA antagonists too often. Reading this thread made me miss it badly, it's one of my favorite drugs for sure.

Yeah, absolutely.

It's *incredibly* psychedelic, yet nothing like the classic serotonin psychs.

Seems to create some of the similar perceptual insights to LSD for me, just through very different psychoactive effects.


Defintely not something to do regularly though. High dosing should never be done frequently unless you're looking to turn your life into a car wreck.

Respect to the BL community. This discussion is something special. I have a little story to tell. 3-MeO-PCP is an amazing compound, it has incredible potential.but it also can get pretty hectic. I've been a BL member for a while, gone thru the crazy MXE days, was wild before that. This is my Disco Story...


I was just your average Opiate Addicted/Dependent American. I was on Buperenorphine maintenance for 4 going on 5 years. My life was messy but functional, I was getting by but unhappy as fuck. About 6 months or a year into my maintenance I discovered MXE and the digital universe surrounding it. MXE opened my mind in ways that I had always loved and had forgotten about, BUT.....I'm still a dope fiend drug addict. MXE reminded me that there is more to life than just feeling good, so I found my purpose - to help my Brothers and Sisters(Drug Addicts and Mentally Ill). I was still dependent on Bupe to function, and getting more and more frustrated with my situation as I was a walking contradiction. I convinced myself that Dissociatives were the secret cure to overcome Opiate/Opioid Dependency.........So, I decided I wanted to be clean once and for all off of all Opiates/Opioids. Jan 1st, 2016 I dropped off my Buperenorphine Taper, I was down to .5mg x2 daily sniffed, and started the process of becoming something different/better than what I was previously. I picked the first of the year as a true fresh start and reset, if there ever was a real new year's resolution this was IT! I Partied it up December 31st........after the switch I would not consume any Opiate or Opioid - but I had an arsenal of compounds to help me get thru the withdrawals, I was convinced that I had put together a fitting outro to transition into the next version of myself, a better self. more disciplined and learned.....Well, that confidence caught up with me.

I made it to day 10 or 11 of no Bupe, I was using MXE and 3-MeO-PCP to counteract the overwhelming depression that comes with a 10 year opiate habit......I was doing reasonably well mentally, It was combating the depression excellently, getting rid of the chills, making the aches manageable.......BUT MOTHER FUCKING SLEEP DEPRIVATION comes on like a bitch. During those days I was safe, comfortable, but unable to get rest - no matter what. I was lucky to sleep 4 hours in 2-3 days.....span that out to 10 or 11 days........You start to lose your g o d d a m n MIND. 

This is where shit gets bad. I started to think that there were people trying to stop me from detoxing, that they were people coming for me, I started to live in front of my peephole and I would occasionally see people thru it that I verified were not there. The paranoia got bad....I was alone for a majority of this time. I didn't have reference points or people that could bring me back to reality so I made a terrible manic decision.........


The only way to solve these issues is to Move To California NOW! RUN! Pure fight or flight response. In my sleep deprived state, combined with opiate/opioid withdrawal, and the MXE, Weed, 3-MeO-PCP the only option I could think of was to run. I packed everything I owned and that mattered into a bag and a backpack, put that shit in my car and I was out. I didn't know at that time, but I had been fading in and out of my body - I was going and chilling with friends and to them I was somewhat "normal" (whatever the fuck that is) BUT I WASN'T INSIDE OF MY BODY - MY BODY WAS ON AUTOPILOT. These blackouts had been happening and I didn't know because I don't like people being around me when I feel shitty.......SO, I put everything in my car and started to drive to California. Driving is fine at first..........sleep deprivation, fuck, there are SO many things that could've realistically caused me to be paranoid - BUT, does your state have those new call ### if you think someones Drunk/Drugged driving signs...Well, I must of cut off the wrong person for real because they utilized that number against me......A "concerned driver" chose to follow me and stay on the phone with police.......................The first REAL memory that I have is seeing a state highway patrol car adjusting to pull me over. I may be paranoid, but I know when shits about to get real as well - again FIGHT OR FLIGHT, I picked flight. The Cop hadn't even lit me up yet, but I knew what it was...So I ran.

I hit the gas and drove 2 tires in grass 2 tires on the freeway straight to 100-120MPH - If you had to pack up your possessions in a panic what would you have on you in this circumstance? I didn't care about anything except getting rid of felonies - so I started eating and driving. I had an amount of Alprazolam 2mg bars for detoxing that no one should ever have to eat all at once....but I did. I'd put an estimation but that seems counter intuitive to Harm Reduction. I could describe this part more...but probably should not. I took the Staties on a chase for multiple miles while disposing of contraband....once the contraband kicked in I pretty much PITed (PIT) myself (bumping the rear fender to change direction) my car stayed on the road, but spun out across 3 lanes - NO ONE was hurt, I did not hit another car, just a ding on the bumper of my car. It had been raining and the sides of the freeway were muddy -The sludge effect stopped my car in place on the side of the freeway.....But my car was still running - So, what do you do in that situation? In for a penny in for a pound?? I hit the fucking gas and tried to run again I was in the mud too deep. Police run up on both with tazers, they break both windows and shoot me with 2 tazers.........1 Missed 1 got me......BZZZZZZZZZZ - I ripped the taser out, blood and glass flying.........BLACKOUT.

2 Days later....I wake up in the county jail barely able to remember what happened. I did 12 Months in Prison for the story I just told you. I've shared a piece of myself that I've been scared to share, but it has to be told. These compounds are absolutely beautiful and are the definition of personal evolution. I suffered from IV Heroin Addiction for 10 years, I found Dissociatives and they helped point me in the right direction......I, and I cannot emphasize this enough - I DID THIS FUCKED UP SHIT, NOT THE COMPOUND, if you don't have the balls to own your fuckups and learn to do better DONT FUCK WITH DISCOS!

It's been almost 2 years since this happened - I have been clean off Opiates for almost 2 years now, I have my life and sanity back. These compounds are amazing for personal growth and development. Lesson learned. I just wanted/needed to put this into the disco universe. If you don't have respect, you will fuck your shit up.

Back and Better - Mr Meowfish


LUCKILY, No one was hurt during this manic episode. Stay safe Disco Heads.

Maybe not threatening to the brain, but I've heard of some muscle deterioration with heavy usage. I'm not sure how true that is, but from pure observation I've noticed myself get very scrawny after a binge (more than I would from other drugs) and the same to friends.

@LIT: Your experience seems to run counter to mine. I used nearly every day for a couple months and gained weight if anything. Disinhibition + hypomania = letting myself indulge in food more. I can understand forgetting to eat when high though, that's just not my style.

That is weird I had muscle atrophy. But it could have definitely been a reduction in the amount I was eating because I felt good.


Did you notice a big reduction in effects after the 2 month stint? I did the same and the effects were minimal towards the end so I took 6 months off and probably going to go another 3 months before I try again.

Tolerance certainly becomes a factor, but I just increased my doses. I don't recommend using it the way I did.

Makes me feel skinny too, but it's hard to have much perspective regarding your physical form when you use this stuff...

I thought the perceived weight loss (didn't weight myself) might have been related to the diuretic effects of it, and fluid loss.

So true. It's an extremely potent substance and you need cool down time between experiences, otherwise you risk getting delusional. MXE and 3-meo-pcp used together daily made me embarrassingly, stereotypically manic. I chose to lose contact with some people I really liked because I couldn't face them anymore after I sobered up and realised how I'd behaved around them.

I used it most days for like 6 months a good while back.  I almost always used tiny doses though, I was going for the hypomania and not the dissociation.  I'm talking like 2mg bumps snorted, 1-4 times a day.  I'd usually do it about 5 days out of the week, 5 days in a row and then 2 days off.  I experienced no tolerance increase that whole time.  I certainly did get quite manic at times, I enjoyed it quite a bit, I always felt in control of myself, no one commented on me being weird or anything.  I also experienced no muscle atrophy, I ate normally and worked out and probably gained muscle in that time.


I wouldn't recommend doing it so often, after a while I started to stumble around words and forget simple words briefly a little too often.  Which is odd because I loved the way it altered my writing flow.  That's the main reason I stopped using it, haven't had any in quite a while and I don't really miss it but I'll probably get some again sometime and use it much more sparingly.  I may be unusual in that I don't usually like its dissociating effects very much... I feel like there are way better dissos for that, for example I like the dissociation from 3-MeO-PCE much more.  For me, 3-MeO-PCP really shines as a low dose thing that reliably produces some pretty euphoric and subtly altered states, increasing motivation, confidence and inspiration.

@spacejunk: I used rather similarly to what Xorkoth describes except I would aim for dissociation a few times a week. I convinced myself I was using it medicinally (lol) and never went into full mania, always riding that magnificent hypomania that makes life feel wonderful and easy. I miss that feeling. As for after effects... I flushed my 3-meo-pcp almost 6 months ago, and at worst maybe conversational word recall is still a bit worse than before but really nothing major. Never felt any acute withdrawal symptoms either, just a longing to be back in that magical flow state.

Glad I'm not the only one who experiences this. What opened my eyes is seeing it happen in others.

That's why I mentioned b12 and CoQ10 earlier.

Meowfish! Thank you for sharing your story and always good to hear from you. Glad to hear you are on the up and up these days, I'm doing the same opioid-wise, thanks in part in 3-meo-pcp which helped me 'see the light'.

Have you guys ever found anything similar to 3-MEO-PCP for creativity and euphoria? Perhaps PCE or similar?

MXE is even better IMO, but good luck finding it.  MXE, to me, is the perfect dissociative, I've never felt such a "perfect" feeling from anything else.


3-MeO-PCE is similar, but not the same.  I find it more euphoric, but less functional.

MXE was easy-mode for creativity. I started playing the keyboard for the first time in my life about a month or two after getting some and remember playing absolutely epic 45 minute pieces, crying at times at the beauty of it. I remember knowing/seeing what every key would sound like and where it would take the music, as if I just knew where I should play and what would take me where, like I'd played since I was a child. It was incredible. Given, sometimes it didn't flow so easily, but wow. I won't say it was as good as what you'd hear in a professional performance, but I recorded all of those sessions, and I should not have been able to play like that. I can't even play to that degree now, years later.

I know what you mean, with MXE making music always felt right, creativity boosted to the top. But I must say 3-meo-pcp/pce are even better for those purposes as they are more stimulating than MXE.

I've found 3meo useful for being creative.  I have no experience being creative on MXE but my one attempt to make a record on ketamine was a disaster.  Holy shit Bradley....do you still have the multitrack of MGS singing "mailman" on K?  I know that's not in my selection....forwards him this thread.

Hard agree. If it ever makes a comeback, I'm stocking up like crazy. 


3-MeO-PCP does not feel like the perfect dissociative to me, but man, when I get the dose right, it feels like the perfect drug in general. The slight mania, euphoria, stimulation... so good for any social activity. I feel like the batch I have now is not quite as good as the one I had before (still super bummed about that vendor, who had amazing 3-meo, DCK and etiz, getting busted), but it still feels really good. My body is so weird with this chem though, I seem to have a natural tolerance (or maybe cross-tolerance from other dissos) and need to take at least 12-13mg to feel it. With this batch it's closer to 20mg.

Wow, I can feel 1mg, of course it's subtle at that level, but my most frequent type of usage is to take 2mg bumps every few hours and after about half the day I start to get hypomania, euphoric, inspired and energized.  I find its actual dissociation to feel too neutral or clinical or something to really want to go there.  Although I have had a few times where it was great when I went there.

I prefer to take a medium sized dose (8/10 mg or so) and combine it with cannabis, than taking a high dose (That would be 12 or 15 mg for me) on it's own. Feels very psychedelic and euphoric.


When I've taken more than 10 mg and combined it with weed it's like a lucid "hole" if that makes sense. Not like a K-Hole at all, but feels on the verge of an out of body experience while still retaining contact with reality. Interesting still, but I prefer the above experience.

Have you tried smoking it yourself? Interested in your experience.

About your other question; I don't know, I don't really find it that compulsive, specially because of the long come-up time (Maybe that's because I'm eating it vs smokin?). My personal rule of thumb is not to use it more than one day off the week.

Re: compulsive use/addiction, there is a strong pull for the people who love it most. The outcome depends greatly on the amount and frequency used. If you have no self control but absolutely must open Pandora's box, take measures to limit the availability before you dive in, or self-impose a schedule. Many of us have had to cross a line before knowing where the line is, and from there take a few step back. A number of us here have documented going too far and losing the plot. Ultimately I think one day a week is a hella sweet spot (ok...*maybe* two days if you got your shit together), or it can be microdosed with more regularity and fewer risks. 

Drugs demand respect. This one demands a special kind of respect, one that must be learned through direct experience. If you seek The Way, you may find a balance with this tool in your life, but it can as easily be a force of destruction. You can fuck the Universe, but at the flip of a switch the Universe can be the one fucking you.

In regards to smoking/vaporizing, people aren't doing it because it doesn't work well.


When I first received this one two years ago I tried making dipped cigarettes and joints a few times and found there was absolutely no effect that I could observe from doing so. I remember reading something to that effect at the time on here as well. It might be 3-MeO-PCP, but it's not PCP.

Regular usage isnt good, even for those who handle other strong pulling chems (think mdpv, ice or mxe). 


This drugs in low doses feels easy but gains and gains.

In higher doses, well it heads north quickly.


Breaks are important, even microdosing. 

I have done heavy and micro. You must have days of sobriety with this even though it is easy to become addicted  (only psychologically, it isnt physically addictive)

It seems there's a subset of people who find dissociatives compulsive. For me, dissociatives are the only class of drugs I find extremely compulsive to myself in general, but I don't find this with every dissociative. Ketamine and 3-MeO-PCP for example, I don't get the urge to do them just because I have them around. Whereas DCK and especially MXE I would be liable to do them everyday until it's gone. I've seen others who say that they do 3-MeO-PCP until it's gone, but they don't find MXE addictive.


So I think more than anything it has to do with your biochemistry, but self-control also plays a big role. This year I've been taking it a lot easier with dissociatives than I had the previous two years. The biggest thing for me was making health a priority. Once I started focusing on learning, eating healthy, and getting in shape, I would think twice about abusing dissociatives because I realized how much a binge would set me back in those regards. Other than that maybe give your stash to a friend, but have them store it somewhere that they don't have easy access to. This way you can't just go over to their house and convince them to give it right back.

I definitely agree that most people will learn respect for dissociatives through direct experience, mainly because the honeymoon period seems so innocuous that it becomes easy to justify abuse. That was the way I learned and personally I wish I hadn't been so stubborn and had heeded the warnings of dissociative users before me. Even if you simply tread the fine line of insanity you can't take back what you've experienced, and it can be difficult to integrate seeing in just how delicate of a balance our reality hangs. Personally, I would say if you're concerned about long-term brain health you really shouldn't be using dissociatives anymore than every 4 weeks, 2 at a bare minimum.

I had a friend who had never tried it and had a full on ego death and complete breakdown of reality on 10-12mg.


My girlfriend did it for around a week straight before she became convinced she had a demon on her back.


The one time I did 3-MeO-PCP for an extended period of time (like 2-3 weeks) was the closest I've ever came to psychosis, I started thinking I was seeing different realities even when my vision was totally normal which made me scared to drive for a long time. During that time I got to the point where I wasn't even using a scale and just dipping my finger in the bag which is totally unlike me, I think it took me a few weeks after cessation to totally come down.


So yeah, even if you have tolerance and can handles high doses (20-30mg+), that's not the most dangerous aspect IMO. When it starts building up in your system when your doing it everyday and you think your on top of the world, and then out of nowhere it's like a switch is flipped and you become totally crazy. I've done lots of MXE which I find pretty manic (10g in a month at my worst) but it never resulted in anything like 3-MeO-PCP, which to me feels like it could become dangerous once you cross that line.


I have been thinking about trying 3-MeO-PCP again, I never particularly enjoyed it, but the last time I took it over a year ago I spent the day riding bicycles by the river and it was definitely the best time I ever had on it. So I think maybe it's best utilized when you get outside and get active on a lower dose.

I've seen people lose their shit harder than on any other drug on 3-MeO-PCP.  I'd imagine PCP is like that too but I've never come in contact with it or users of it (at least knowingly anyway).  My good friend who died a little while ago went on a very intense downward spiral, there were several factors but she was IVing 3-MeO more or less daily for a good year or more.  She became like a different person, it was chilling and tragic to behold.  Kept up right to her drug OD that killed her too.  Meanwhile she was convinced she was fine, that it was good for her.


I was taking ~2mg bumps.  I did it nasally.  What I did was dose it out in various ways using a tiny, tiny scoop I have.  My goal was to see what the scoop weighed on average.  Turns out, a level scoop was right around 2mg.  My scale isn't amazing but I did a few things, I weighed that dose repeatedly and regardless of how heavy the tray I used was, it would tend to go up by 2mg.  Then I'd dump 5 level scoops on there, and it would go up by 10 or 11mg on average.  After I established this, I just went with 1 scoop=2mg, for that batch at least.  Not 100% accurate but it worked for me.

I got gifted a gram of this beautiful substance by a Chinese vendor when ordering some 4-aco

I preferred doing about a 10mg bump(nasally) to start and then 2-3mg bumps throughout the day

I once fuct up and did like 20mg which was cool until about 12 laters I stupidly did that again (after drinking booze most the day and smoking cannabis)

I ended up with a flare up of tinnitus that was mind wrecking, and had a lot of very bad thoughts ( like jumping into the lake and just snuffing it)

After several more attempts at enjoying this drug (which I never really could anymore cause of the tinnitus) I dumped the remaining ha,f gram down the toilet

Which I now regret (this was 2 years ago) because I may never be able to source it again seeing as almost all companies have went to bitcoin and no matter how easy everyone says it is, I have been on the brink of getting some (set up coin base account which I'm sure is no longer any good cause I never used it in 2 years)

And basically bitcoin like I said I don't care how many people tell be how easy it is I SUCK AT COMPTERS, AND IT IS NoT EASY!!!!!!

Will finally be delving into this substance most likely this weekend after sitting on a gram for the better part of a year. I read through this and all the archived 3-MeO-PCP threads during that time. You guys sure have a lot to say about this stuff.  


I'm planning on taking 2-3 mg orally for the first time, and maybe the first few after that, given what some have said about needing to 'get used' to this substance and me not wanting to waste material. 


That being said, I'm not sure that amount will be particularly interesting on its own. Would it be inadvisable to combine this with a low dose of MXE (15-20mg, also oral) after coming up a bit to get a feel of the 3-meo? Will almost certainly be smoking weed the whole time through as well, though I may abstain for the come-up. 


I also have a small amount of ketamine that I could use instead if anyone can attest to that being the better combo. MXE is more plentiful for me atm though so it makes more sense to go that route. 


If anyone has good suggestions for music on this stuff I would appreciate your input, been dying to hear something new, feels like I've already heard everything I listen to (I know how silly that sounds). The comments earlier about making familiar music unfamiliar definitely has piqued my interest even more in this chemical, if that's possible!

I would avoid taking MXE with it at any dose until you really understand 3-MeO.  MXE and 3-MeO wildly potentiate each other.  2-3mg might be boring, I personally love those effects but I had to get used to the drug first.  10mg orally was my first dose and it was uncomfortably strong, but I think 5mg would be reasonable for a first dose especially since you have dissociative experience.

I'm a little late to the conversation, but my advice for avoiding compulsive redosing is to avoid insufflation altogether. I started out with a carefully measured 3mg/ml liquid solution and dosed with an oral syringe. I never got compulsive until I got another bag and got lazy by not putting it in solution again and just started doing bumps. Even if you could smoke it that would probably be even worse for compulsivity.


This chemical requires respect. I lost mine and I'm going to be paying for it for a while.

This drug has been great in combination with magnesium for reducing the tolerance buildup to stimulants. What i've been doing is weighting my scale with a 2 dollar coin(after sterilizing it thoroughly of course) since it's a consistent weight(look up your coin of choice and they will have a precise weight since it's government minted). I will then using a mg scoop dip into my bag of 3-meo and drop the powder onto the surface of the coin. When the powder comes out it usually weighs in at .003 mg or so which is a perfect amount of powder for tolerance reduction purposes. I then lift off the coin from the scale and using the base of an empty gel cap I press it over the area where the powder sits and quickly tip over the coin, displacing the powder into the gelcap(some scraping while it's tipped upside down forces any leftover powder into the cap if any sticks to the coin). 


Using this method I can make a dozen or so doses of tolerance reducing gelcaps of 3-meo at a time and I take one every few days along with 400mg of magnesium glycine(which I take daily). I don't use this method if i'm filling caps with larger doses of 3-meo as folding up a card and tapping the powder into the caps works better since the diameter of the gelcap wouldn't fit around such a large quantity of powder. 


Also I want to bring attention to the potential of 3-meo-pcp to be used as a stop-smoking aid since it seems to block the effects of nicotine and eliminate cravings. It's one of the many uses this amazing substance possesses and it is how I quit smoking cigarettes. I believe it inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which would block an agonist such as nicotine from binding to that site, would it not? This is all assuming it has the same properties as PCP in regards to nAChRs...it seems like it does subjectively anyway. Whatever is going on chemically speaking, it's highly effective at mitigating cravings.

You find it to block the effects of nicotine?  Wow, not me.  Dissociatives actually make me want nicotine more than usual, 3-MeO included, because I feel they enhance the effects of it moreso than anything else.  However I can agree that if I have my mind set on no nicotine, dissos help me to stick to that.

Never tried 3-MeO-PCP for quitting smoking. I'd imagine it would help. Of all the dissos I've taken I still think DXM is the one you want for smoking cessation. It actually makes smoking slightly unpleasant if you smoke while on it and have no intention of quitting smoking. I used to smoke a lot less when I used DXM I noticed. If you quit smoking the day before taking a nice ~300mg dose of DXM, boom, you addiction is gone like it never happened. I'm amazed by how easy it is to quit this way.

I find for me it makes smoking have less of an effect than it already does, I haven't tried smoking when my nicotine tolerance was low enough that I would notice a buzz so I can't ascertain whether it is all psychological. When I was a daily smoker I didn't notice much from smoking cigarettes unless I smoked while drunk or nodding on an opioid to begin with, it was just satisfying the cravings. With 3-meo-pcp there is a distinct anti-craving effect I have noticed that lasts for sometime even after the main effects have worn off which makes me believe it has anti-smoking potential, I simply had no desire to smoke with 3-meo in my system and with continued administration I was able to easily quit smoking cigarettes.


I don't know how credible this paper is, but it mentions PCP, Buproprion and Ibogaine as having potential for development of anti-addiction and smoking cessation drugs:


[http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/jpet/288/1/88.full.pdf](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/jpet/288/1/88.full.pdf)


It's from The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. 3-MeO-PCP is similar enough in structure to PCP that the findings might also apply to it.

"Doctor, I need a PCP prescription to help me quit smoking". That'll be the day!

On 3-meo I can find myself smoking 5-10 pre-rolled American Spirits (strong smokes) in a day, whereas I normally smoke about 4 hand-rolls (1/5 the amount of tobacco in each one). Yet if I dont have any cigarettes, on 3meo I am more OK going without any than I would be sober. Its weird.

Haha, your post made me laugh harder than it should have, thanks for that ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) It's that old killing the mouse with a bazooka line of thinking. They need to make a sitcom called Silly Prescriptions(Sillyscription?) that pokes fun at Psychiatry in a lighthearted way and exaggerates the whole profession. It would shine a light on the state of Neuropsychiatry and get people thinking about their minds more while having a good laugh. Such a thing might not fly these days though, the whole business of Psychiatry takes itself pretty seriously and it rubs off on the public.

I ended up taking around 4-5mg in a parachute. Came up unexpectedly quick, was feeling first alerts within 20-30 mins where I was expecting to have to wait closer to 2  hours. The first few hours I felt strongly stoned, slightly dissociated but mostly as if I had smoked more weed than I actually had. The only way I could differentiate it from that state was through the sensation I had when moving my head about, a slight visual delay common to most dissos I've tried. 


Thank you for the advice Xorkoth, less than what I took would certainly have been boring.


I got a little frustrated in the later hours of the drug, because I started to feel what I'd guess is a bit of hypomania, thinking about specific things I want to do that I think would advance myself in one way or another. What was frustrating was the specifics, as it was Saturday night and I had strong urges to execute some financial moves I've been planning for a while, but given the time I simply had to wait for a business day. Eventually I yielded to the facts of the matter and decided to work on another project, which helped recover my will toward productivity. All in all I liked the stimulation it provided but it might behoove me to take it on a weekday instead. Then again it's hard to say how the forced delay might have kept me from getting carried away.

More so than ketamine, anyway. I had a 10g stockpile of which I have a little under 3g left. Most of it I didn't use myself, I tend to put at minimum 2 weeks between any disso usage, so it will last me a while thankfully. Hopefully at least until somebody starts synthing mxe again. 


Back to 3meo I was wondering if anyone else experienced effects on their dreams or dream recall after taking this? Typically I don't remember any dreams at all most nights but after 3meo I dreamt fairly vividly and remembered a fair bit of content on waking. In case there is some sort of a trend I guess it's worth mentioning the theme of the dream was betrayal/guilt.

be really careful with this.  disso "revelations" are often delusions cloaked in grandeur, but at the time, feel very lucid and rational.


i'd recommend not making any big life decisions or financial commitments while on it - i've heard some horror stories of people having these amazing brainwaves about making a fortune, booking flights across the world to make them happen, and waking up the next day to realise it was all a manic delusion.  

be mindful of this urge - it could have bad consequences.

Yes, that featured quite a bit in my notes while on the stuff. Quite interesting actually that while having these urges, the urges themselves seem unhinged, somehow beyond control, but actually *having* the urges was not. I could get carried away about an idea I was having but still be comfortable that it was just an idea, a plan more than anything. Of course this sensibility is bound to disappear at higher dosages and isn't something to be relied upon.

at higher doses, yeah - you can become completely detached from your normal outlook and consumed by this new perspective so much that you can no longer relate to the old one, at least in my experience.

maybe better to have a notepad and pen than to have your online banking open, or a credit card in your hand...

This is very very true. It takes any experienced psychonaut/seasoned drug user, many experiences to know how to use this safely. 


It seems to be the most forgiving and easy to understand chem at the low doses. It ramps up quickly in the high doses.

But, it uniquely links and continues to build with regular dosing, but you dont see it.


Its a great drug, but this approach with caution thing cannot be emphasised enough

Agreed! I can't believe that something so potent can actually exist. If you come from Ketamine use and you see a dose of 3-meo-pcp you think your taking part in some elaborate practical joke. Thinking "no way is this gonna do shit". 10 minutes later your eating your words, laughing, basking in a clear headed euphoria.


How does o-pce stack up against 3-meo-pcp? 


Honestly I would love MXE to return. I am starting to think maybe the top bankers are on MXE and they don't want any competition so they have snuffed the market hahaha! Unlikely but it wouldn't surprise me.

I am familiar with two different "batches" of 3-meo-pcp, can you describe this third batch more fully?

I'm working up a full report, and hopefully the intricacies can be expressed, but as for now I classify it as a lower-grade  quality. Less of the mental effects I seek from 3meo and more of unwanted physical effects. Not 'well-tuned' as I put it. Moist, pastey with chunks, not the most polished synth. Overall far less clean in effects, more amnesiac, Lower lucidity, clarity,it does pump up the heart but not in the tuned kind of way, more of a straining kind of way.  2/5 is my rating.

If it's moist, i'd probably be trying to air it and dry it out. Sounds like there are some residual solvents in there or something. Not a good idea to consume, if so.

OK I cleaned up my string of posts as I was experiencing the revelations.

I've actually come to quite enjoy this flavor, after a couple of days of my tuning and its tuning meeting in the middle, the smells and percolation of it remind me of some of my best MXE memories actually, a gentle aura about it i've been tuning into, and its becoming increasingly euphoric and 'fragrant' of the sort that mesmerizes me as I work with it, tuning with it you might say. Strong buzz is building, and yes its a sweet harmonious energy, I'm wading in a froth of perspiration, the smell is fully enchanting me now. I am the bottle, its effervescence, holy spoils of perspiration, an electro-chemical cocktail of blissfully wafting waveforms condensate on my keyboard, a lust of harmonic energy aligned. Divine! The Smell I associate with the gates of heaven. this alchemy is succulent.

Holy shit I am an incense peppermint condensing as the sweat of my armpits waft jovially, O my God I am synthesizing extradimensional smells of sexual sensual fragrant flowers of electrochemical swabs of arycyclohexylsweat.

its like music with pheromones. Intentionally swapping scented feedback loops i am in olfactory heaven

I am a garden of olfactory flemmins

 a very golden buzz, majestic, I want to bottle this up somehow

God this room smells fucking great right now    

fermenting thought bubbles  

floral-hexylsweating

my friend is coming over to smell me.


Then


I took a hit of DMT, IV, apple cider vinegar you and me, that's a wrap. A nice coin for all my splaugt. Everything I've dreamed in time and space collapsed into one hyperdimensional singularity.

whew ya know, words are only a small slice of the reflection, but I want it to be expressed somehow poetically. I had I very wild ride today, everything from everywhere suddenly came together and I saw it all as it formed a perfect non-linear holographic sphere, the singularity as it came in my face.

Amazing post. You are getting me all pumped for the combo. Did you breakthrough? Or did you not need to?


I took a hit of DMT last time I had it too. Felt like I was almost cheating the breakthrough because the fear was gone. Although I didn't breakthrough anyway I fell just short but I got an absolute total mind cleanse. The DMT geometry swept through my energy field like a filter. Removing any nonsense in there. It was amazing. Very intense but as I said the normal pre DMT fear was removed by the delightful presence and euphoria gifted to me by the 3-meo-pcp. I like to be afraid of DMT though. As much as it stops me from doing it sometimes I think it makes the trips more profound because you already overcome a fear of losing touch with this reality.

Yeah I jumped into it like it was my time, and it was, no fear, just one baked cookie eating itself. Blasted off and broke through as easily as taking a bite. I had about a dozen giggle fits since the experience. The extra capacitance of the 3meo enabled me to pull more amps through my light bulb as the DMT conducted the extradimensional energy.

Really one of the best things after a good experience is the afterglow for days. After a 3 day run, I'm on day 2 of afterglow and it is a calm but strong energy, almost euphoric. A lot of beauty beholden, but in a grounded and natural feeling sort of way compared to the lift of the primary experience. Am I still high on metabolites, or is it the residual vibrations of a solid bell-ringing?

Edit, to be fair it hasn't been all swimming. Yesterday had a few kinda janky hours in the late afternoon, but after taking a walk for an hour and sweating a bunch (this batch had a noticeably greater bodyload on the ass end), a good meal , shower, and smoking a bowl, it cleared into a good roll for the rest of the night.

I think the stimulating afterglow mostly has to do with a rebound effect. You are pharmacologically inhibiting Glutamate signaling in the brain, so the body tries to compensate it, probably augmenting the glutamate release, and then when the drug is cleared from the body you are basically flooded with an excitatory neurotransmiter. 


Note that this is my personal speculation, but I think the reasoning is more or less sound. I also think alcohol does this to some extent, I've noticed that when I drink, then the next morning I always wake up a little bit earlier than intended feeling very stimulated. Then in the afternoon I start getting pretty tired, lol. I think it also has something to do with a rebound effect from the inhibitory GABAergic action from alcohol.

That's actually a really solid analysis.

I don't get any afterglow to speak of on alcohol though. Any positive rebound is far outdone by the strength of negative aftereffects.

Yeah, it's not really an afterglow for me neither haha. It's just that everytime I drink more than a couple of beers, the next morning I wake up abruptly unable to go to sleep, feeling more or less rested... but then during the afternoon tiredness sets in. Of course, if I overdo it with booze, then I just feel like shit the whole day. But I rarely did that and haven't in a while.

Yea the early wake-up call with alcohol is due to the brain rebounding it's hypnotic effects once the alcohol has finished metabolizing.

Had my 2nd experience with this substance Saturday, at 5-6mg, parachuted. Came up in maybe 20-30 minutes. Dissociation was maybe a little stronger than last time, with about the same peak duration of 3-5 hours. I didn't feel as much hypomania a last time, rather I felt entirely satisfied with my current endeavours. Not sure what the cause might be.


I was about to add that I didn't get the increase in dream vividness that I did last time either, but I think I did to some degree, maybe just not as intense. I remember flashes of a dream, but not from the night I took the drug, but the night after. I wonder if this has any relation to the decreased stimulatory effects. 


This time my girlfriend joined me, at 4-5mg, same ROA. She took a bit longer to come up as she had a fuller stomach. All she really had to report was that it felt very mxe-like to her. I guess I can agree as far as the physical dissociation goes but the headspace is definitely distinct. Not as magical for one. 


I tried a hit of nitrous as well during the peak which was quite enjoyable, had lasting sedative effects that really complemented the 3-meo & music. Speaking of, worth noting that this stuff makes me want to sing LOUD. 


Will probably push another mg higher for next attempt in two weeks.

Nice description. It sounds to me like you have found the line and you had too much. I can literally go about 1mg over and I feel dysphoria. If I then stop taking more I come back to feeling good and can dose again later. I can almost guarantee you should not take more. I kept trying this chasing it like with pretty much every other drug. But this stuff you pretty much need to throw out every single thing you know about taking anything else. Redefines the rule book so to speak.

Regarding dysphoria: I had just a little experience with dissociatives when I got my first gram of 3-meo-pcp, having done yet twice and DXM once. My first few trials were dysphoric during the peak, turning into euphoria once things settled down. I attribute this to how alien the experience was to me, as I gradually learned to enjoy it. 


Whether this is a taste worth acquiring is up to you.

Sorry, but why do you say that? I didn't experience any dysphoria whatsoever, was an entirely pleasant but subtle experience. There was a lack of hypomania but as I said I was very satisfied with things. 


I get that this one can turn on quantities of a mg difference and that's why I'm increasing by just 1mg at a time. When I start seeing evidence of adverse effects I"ll pull back of course. I'm really not much of a chaser myself. With what kind of frequency do/did you dose this stuff at?


I'm interested in pushing this at least high enough to have a more full experience matching some of the other reports in this thread. Not sure why I'd stop at such a low point in effects.

Yeah you're good Moxious. My plan would be to scale it up past 5-6mg next time, take in the previous experience to help you know what to expect. Fair warning though, there is a 'line' that is very hard to see. Some people pass it, have a dandy time in hyperspace and come back. Sometimes though it leads to less desired outcomes. Set and setting. I highly doubt that line is below 10mg for anyone with some experience and in the right setting. 10mg is my starting point for a solid experience.

Really hit a good stride last night by starting off with a bump of coke (not a big fan of the stuff but all my friends were doing it and offered me a line), then combining half a tab of quality LSD with ~20mg 3-MeO-PCP (this is a less potent batch, equivalent to like 12-15mg of the previous batch I had). I was so energized and social. I didn't have visuals or anything like that but I felt like the acid gave a nice warmth to the experience and made it more well-rounded. Then I added a small amount of what ended up being very strong ketamine and things got real weird.

Fair warning though, there is a 'line' that is very hard to see. Some people pass it, have a dandy time in hyperspace and come back. Sometimes though it leads to less desired outcomes. Set and setting. I highly doubt that line is below 10mg for anyone with some experience and in the right setting. 10mg is my starting point for a solid experience.

Thanks for this. I would have gone ahead regardless but would have hated the nagging feeling that someone thinks I shouldn't be doing it. Will probably go to 7-8mg next time if I'm feeling brave. I tend to space my dissociatives out by at least two weeks though, and I'm getting antsy for some decent dissociation. Recently 3meo has been taking up all my trials, and I want to keep it up to get through my 'testing' phase for this substance, but something is lacking for sure that a good bit of K would be a perfect fit for. 


I'm excited to try this combo with acid that everybody seems to like. Most likely will not happen until around the new year though at this rate. Also want to try it with moxy as that's one of my favourite psychs available. Can anybody speak to that combination?


P.S. Pretty sure this is my first post as a bluelighter, so that's pretty cool after lurking for many years. Huge thanks to Bluelight and its dedicated mods!

Hey, congrats. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I don't think I've combined 3-MeO and moxy, but regarding combining it with LSD, there is significant synergy, it'll make the LSD a lot stronger so bear that in mind.  But it's a fantastic combo.

3-MeO-PCP + Psychedelics = Fucking awesome times. 


Just keep the PCP dose low. Otherwise you'll end a manic mess. I use 6 mg AT MOST.

My experience with this one last night took a ghastly turn as I reached the peak of an oral dose that clocked in around 18mg. As I find happens often on these types of substances bizarre coincidences seem to pop up more often than when sober and they tend to be benign and ineffectual, but for whatever reason at the height of this trip when I was most powerfully under the chemicals spell and had retired to my bed feeling unable to make sense of any activity my furry friend hopped up onto my chest and began nudging my face and I assume some fur must have gotten into my right eye. I had no sense of time and hardly any feelings of pain/irritation would register in my state so i'm just making assumptions here. Maybe 10 mins after the nudging I could feel a gush of liquid pouring out from my eye that felt thicker than a teardrop so I got up to go look in the mirror and my right eye was swelling up with thick liquid bubbling and dripping out of my eye!


Obviously I was too altered to know what was a hallucination and what was real but it looked like there was a gash in the cornea and the liquid was oozing forth from it. In my manic state part of me believed I was going to lose sight in my right eye. NEVER HAVE EITHER OF MY EYE'S BEEN SWOLLEN BEFORE IN MY LIFE, so the fact this happened to me when I was peaking on and fucked out of my gourd on 3-meo felt like a divine punishment from God for indulging in devilish deeds(I was raised a Catholic so I guess that Christian programming still resides somewhere in the distant recesses of my mind). Up until this happening I was feeling marvelous and I was in a happy place but the trip kind of 180'd once I glanced in the mirror and confirmed my eye was in bad shape. For whatever reason I wasn't as concerned at the idea of losing sight as I should have been(being dissociated, the feeling of loss and the negative emotions were felt as if they were being bellowed out to me through a loudspeaker down a distant stretch of space by a mental observer dictating my thoughts) so I decided to just wash my hands and splash some water on my eye to rinse it out before I went and laid back down. Maybe a part of me remained rational enough to not believe what I was seeing in the mirror and just chalk it up to an allergic reaction, but all kinds of weird trains of thought raced through my mind in my state and the gash in my cornea looked really convincing. I'm glad I just splashed some water on my face and resisted the urge to perform a surgery or glue my cornea back together with some silicone or something(joking, of course).

Wow, as your describing this, im feeling the perspective, being on a different level when something like that presents sucks.

Im glad your story ended as it shouldve though. 

It sounded like it couldve ended in something horrible like ypu gouging your eye out!


Hope the trip settled down again to its more pleasant tone....

I have witnessed the experience flip on a dime multiple times, from the 'most awesome thing ever' to 'holy fuck wtfwtfwtf' in a moment. I like to think I've learned a thing or two from the trials. Still trying to keep that middle path in sight.

Seems safe(ish) when taken orally, no more than 10mg....well, 7mg at most unless you are sure enough of things to take the 10mg dose.

Even then, i don't really think it's that safe to fuck around with stuff like this.


It seems really innocuous, but i think it's really not.   Like, acid can feel like you're losing your mind, wheras 3meo pcp is pretty chilled.  That's misleading though, i reckon.

I'm amazed that some people can use it regularly and maintain a semblance of normality, because you only need to look through this thread to see a few of the trainwrecks.

And a trainwreck on 3meo-pcp tends to go down a pretty deep, dark hole of confusion and delusion.

^^^


He is right.  I meant to say safe(ish) like playing with fire at the 7mg-10mg range, orally a couple, three times a year.


Personally speaking, in 2014 when I used this stuff a lot, I felt like I was playing with fire literally.

I didn't end up getting the groove back and was actually waiting eagerly for the effects to wear off after such a strange and sickening coincidence. Of all the drugs I could think of to have my first experience of something like that on, a PCP analogue would definitely have been my last choice! If I had the same experience sober before this then I probably wouldn't of batted an eye(pun intended) at it happening while dissociated as the swelling and irritation subsided within a few days.

I've consumed about a half gram of 3-meo-pcp so far.  It works very well with LSD and MDA.  It works with 25i-NBOH but it was a little uncomfortable.  I used 5 mg with 150 mg MDA and 120 mcg LSD once and redosed 3-meo-pcp 4 times with 10-15 mg doses.  It was magical!  I just ordered 3 more grams of this stuff.

I had a foul experience with this stuff because I got a new batch and took 20mg as a test dose


I ended up blacking out for almost 24 hours, which actually wouldn't have been that big a deal but I had a vacation I was leaving for the next day, and I managed to board an airplane about 8-10 hrs into the blackout with bags that were almost totally unpacked LMAO (I was driven to the airport by my disgruntled sister)


then I had an extreme depressive episode after coming out of the blackout and mutilated (cut) myself with a key down my arm to try to show my family how crazy I was. 


Then two days later I chugged an unholy amount of whiskey and blacked out for another 12+ hrs and woke up in the hospital with all four of my limbs in restraints. Really not fun guys! apparently I had been trying to punch nurses! and I ended up getting sent to rehab and getting sober for about four months


that blackout batch ended up getting flushed down the drain by my mother, but I took ~5mg of my previous batch today with no negative results.


high doses of this drug have made me cry a lot in the past and but I wanna say they were healing tears overall

20mgs could put an elephant to cry, That´s why mostly us dont take more than 5, maximum 10mgs. Persoanlly I never take more than 4-5, this is the sweetest point

Damn, 20mg is way too high unless you've got tolerance (even then I've never gone nearly that high).  I like it at 5mg at a time max.  Usually it's 2mg at a time.


I got a new batch after a long time, I've tested it and it's good. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I haven't been feeling like daily dosing which is good, I tried it the first night I got it and had a really nice time, then tried doing the low dose thing the next day and I found it got me feeling kinda low, I found myself wishing I hadn't done it, or maybe it was a coincidence, either way I think I'm gonna use it a lot more sparingly this time around.

Good idea! I have had around 8 months off now and going to return to it soon. I was thinking of a cycle 4-5 days on a week off. You used daily at 2mg doses is that correct? How many doses were you doing a day? 


I also thought you mentioned you didn't get much tolerance, is that correct? You still get the same euphoria too?

I was doing 1-4 bumps ma day at 2mg.  I seemed to be able to maintain the same dosage level for a long time.  I was not getting dissociated from it, just energy/mania.  The euphoria was better early on but I kept getting it.

Ive done a fair bit of the low dosing approach.


Earlier in the year, i tore through 500mg in around 10 weeks, at the time i had many a manic idea. I had to keep tabs on myself to ensure i was soundlping lucid at all times.

I had some decent doses ( 5mg plus 15mg are among the higher ones) but most were 2mg + 3mg etc.


Many months later( around july) i acquired a gram.


Its been rather similiar. I dont enjoy higher doses though. Anything over 10mg seems a bit enjoyable but i feel like crap the next day. This is new as my last batch only ever mwde me feel good afterwards.


Mostly i do 4mg plus maybe another couple.  This is as nice as earlier. Less manic though sadly.


I do this on weekends only, not daily or near daily like my batch at the start of the year

Ive never had a batch that wasn't more full-bodied, full-spectrum, therapeutic and 'rich' when taken orally compared to intranasal. I'm not discounting intranasal; there are some unique benefits to it, depending on the application. But if you goal is to get 'far out', oral is the bang for your buck

hey do you guys think this could account for the difference in effects?

Finally got around to my 3rd trial with 3-MeO-PCP. Was pretty lame, just mild dissociation, not much 'content' to speak of. 


I took 6-8mg this time, and I think this is around my upper limit. At one point about 2-3 hours in I started feeling nauseated, a 'foamy' feeling that didn't go away until I puked around the 4 hour mark. Usually drugs only make me puke from their intensity, so this was a bit different, not something I'm used to. Might have had something to do with the cigarette paper as it had not broken down at all.


Once again there was no mania of any sort I could notice.


All in all it just wasn't a particularly interesting experience, it feels too empty on its own. I think it will be worthwhile to combine with psychs, especially because of its duration, but I don't expect to do it alone again anytime soon.

I had a period when I got those kinds of lame experiences, but both before and after that, I have gotten really interesting effects from it. Basically the opposite of lame, extremely insightful, on the level of psychedelics, but with a more practical approach. IMO The downside of this compound is its dangerous profile and the little dosage margin between meh experiences and pure mania. The upside is the most lucid dissociative I have tried, never understood very well what to do with crazy MXE or ketamine experiences.


In the beggining it started shining at 5mg, and after that I need around 10mg to get insights. I spaced out my dosages several months so it is kind of weird the increment. In conclusion I love it but I don't trust it.


P.D. Be very careful combining it with psychedelics, the potentiation is a sure thing and easily becoming very maniac.

Regarding combinations: psychedelics, well LSD, 4-ho-mipt, and 2CB worked quite well for me. The real mania and compulsive redosing came into play when MDMA was added into the mix. I would advise you DO NOT combine 3-meo-pcp with a serotonin releaser. It didn't feel physically unsafe but the combo certainly led to going way too far.

Thanks for the feedback, maybe someday I will venture up to around 10mg but I somewhat doubt it considering the risk vs reward. 


When I do get to combining this with 5-meo-mipt I will post my results, I expect it to be pretty decent, moxy + k was one of my all-time favourite trips. 


With what people say about 3-meo being able to lead to deeper insights I've wondered about combining it with something like mushrooms + an maoi, but if 3-meo is releasing much serotonin on its own that's not a good idea. Or maybe it would be physically safe but over the top like Vediog's experience

I would not even think about putting a MAOI in the mix. I believe it is safer to reach 10mg oral than mixing it with 5-meo-mipt, in any case take very little of both an go up slowly. The margin between deep insights and delusions might be not very large.

What is your reasoning for thinking 5-MeO-MiPT to be a dangerous combination?

I am not saying is dangerous. I just think it is more unpredictable that 3-meo-pcp on its own. I consider 10mg of 3-meo-pcp safe if done occasionaly and not having psychotic or mania tendency. You can take that combination but as a rule of thumb I would say don't take more than half of your normal dosages of each, I would personaly start even lower but I am not an expert on combinations. Surely lots of people can give you better advice on that. The only time I mixed it with psychedelics was after taking a ridicolous amount of 2c-e, don't remember well, like 1 or 2 mg max, and something aroung 10mg of 3-meo-pcp got really potenciated. Was marvellous, but the mania was very real, so even though really enjoyable and insightful, not something I am going to repeat in a long time...if ever.

Ah ok sorry I misunderstood. I thought you were saying combining with 5-meo-mipt in particular would be more risky than lsd or 2c-b. 


I am definitely anticipating a lot of synergy and my default in this type of situation is to take a half dose of each. It's crazy that you got so much potentiation with so little 2c-e but you were already on a full dose of the 3-meo so that does make sense.

Sorry my memory doesn't work very well it seems. It was just 500ug of 2c-e and 14mg of 3-meo-pcp. So I shouldn't blame the 2c-E.

Here you have the report: [http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/806...d-3-MeO-4-Leaf-Clover?p=14096034#post14096034](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/806426-The-Big-amp-Dandy-3-MeO-PCP-Thread-3-MeO-4-Leaf-Clover?p=14096034#post14096034)

And I asked about combination info which can be useful for you.

Could someone explain how 3-HO-PCP/-PCE compares to 3-MeO-PCP/-PCE, as i know the latter very well and am still not got it how these two differ from the MeOs in general, with exception of the lovely fact that the HOs are having direct Opioid Activity, hence effects! I love the 3-MeOs a lot, just as MXE but don’t know wether it’s ok when grabbing me some of them or those new Compounds, which I begin to think are even more interesting after reading things like 3-HO-PCP is MXE 2.0 and that’s almost if not completely way too good to be possible as I think - but hey, the MeOs are on par with MXE too, different but also not, with one being a fully functional damn clean and unique Uber-Stimulant when used with Caution, no downsides to it and a long afterglow almost greater as the actual effects are, and the other being a tad bit less functional and useful as next-generation Upper but on the other hand having a psychedelic edge to it, making it more entertaining and fun of some sorts, including the most awesome afterglow ever that persists up to a week after dosing - and it’s so close to MXE as it gets and making it’s disappearance bearable, i.e. 3-MeO-PCE - with MXE as one and the -PCE the other, namingly -hexane variety and the other the -hexanone (making it just about 3-4x more potent with it’s exclusive effects just as those resembling MXE, mimic or even surpass them!).


I love the afterglows you get from the MeOs really much more in contrast to the also outstanding main effects, but simply somewhat smoother with the same if not even gentle but at the same time strong push towards self-perfection and expression without acting and the look of some psychotic backwood Savage in Phencyclidine Rampage!

So you say 3-ho´s had opioid activity. Are you sure? Sources?


It seems most people prefer MXE (including me). 3-meos happen to be the closer/better option absent MXE, but lacks the "magic", or "spiritual" epiphany aspects


I also hope that there´s a hell of a new dissos to discover, which may surpass evenb MXE as the grial. Time will tell

Sigh..


That isn't as relevant as whether it has been confirmed or refuted. Apparently Hamilton Morris and his bro confirmed this in 2014:

[http://factpub.org/wiki/index.php/F...n-medical_use_of_dissociative_drugs._Morris,H](http://factpub.org/wiki/index.php/From_PCP_to_MXE:_a_comprehensive_review_of_the_non-medical_use_of_dissociative_drugs._Morris,H)


Anyway, less than ideal dynamics at the opioid receptors it is active at could explain why 3-HO-PCP doesn't seem to be helpful subjectively for those with opioid dependency / withdrawals. It may be a bit similar to the opioid agonists I mentioned, in structure, but that doesn't mean it behaves in the same way no.

It should probably be considered an atypical opioid and not be pursued as an opioid but it does still act on those receptors. Possibly on ones other than MOR to produce the side-effects people have been remarking on with 3-HO-PCP for a while now, though that could also be a product of different mechanisms which are shared by both NMDA and opioid pathways, maybe especially in some combination of the two.

I just received 5G from a vendor in China today. I usually get good effects at 15MG. So far I have took 100MG and only feel slight stimulation and slight dissociation.


The vendor has asked if he has sent a bad batch and asked if I want refund or re ship of good batch thankfully though.


Do you guys think something has went wrong during synthesis? I mean I do feel slight effects but I have took 100MG FFS. Waited 7 days on this too so disappointing situation just now ?

Something definitely isnt right.


100mg should put you close to a hospital. Geez, over 50mg should put you close to a hospital. Not the healing kind, but well, we will take care of you kind.

I wouldnt consume any more.

Dude, if you don't get the expected effects from your dose don't keep taking more !! 

If there's really something wrong with the synthesis, you could be literally eating poison. There's dangerous cyanide compounds that are secondary products of this synthesis.


 Be more careful ... If somethings fishy about a chem then test it or get away

hi guys, i received a batch of whats supposed to be 3meo-pcp today but its appearance is completely different to any of the previous ones ive had. Its always been a very fine pure white powder but this one is like clear crystals, some quite large like almost squarish, like rock salt? also the vendor sent 3.3G instead of the 2 i ordered. 


Im a little wary that it may be a mixup with my order? has anyone seen 3meo-pcp look like this before ? any info would be greatly appreciated

I have never seen 3-MeO-PCP (or -PCE) that was crystals, although I'm sure it's possible for them to be.  What you have sounds like how DCK or O-PCE usually look so you're right to be concerned.  I'm not sure what testing reagents work for dissos and how the reactions should look but maybe someone else here does.  That would be your best bet.

thanks for the reply Xorkoth , i managed to clear things up with the vendor, somehow they managed to send some compound called 4-MPD? some kind of mephedrone substitute.


Since ordering hes added ketamine to his listings and then proceeded to ask if i do ket alot? which i do lol then said he will re send me some of that and some of the actual 3-meo-pcp.


He then went on to say in two weeks he will send me a couple more free samples to try , i asked him what kind of chems and if they were arylcyclohexylamines? His reply was "X2 ket and meo an mo" !?!? im not sure what to make of it all to be honest and a bit hesitant to take any of it really !? whats x2 ket and meo an mo ?

that is what was supposed to be 3-meo-pcp so you can see why i was a bit confused as to what it was, i have warned him that its very dangerous to make mistakes like that. Especially if he had sent say 3meo-pcp to someone who ordered ketamine and was a little less clued up on things and they ended up doing 200mg 3meo-pcp. I dont think things would end well for them !8(

That?s a mixture of the fortune wheel and the russian rulette made rc vendor {facepalm}. We can do conjetures but could be anything. I would check they don?t operate with fentanyls, nbomes or any other dangerously potent compounds.


2xket could be DCK. Meo and mo could be any 3-meo, but who knows. Better ask him again

I have ADHD and I've been investigating alternatives to amphetamine for sustained attention.  I'm currently investigating using only 3meopcp for sustained attention.  Currently that involves tapering myself off amphetamine and replacing it with small doses of 3meopcp in morning, and large doses at night.  I'm considering taking LSD every day to mitigate the possible negative effects of the dissociative effects of 3meopcp.  I'm going to report my findings here.  I'm in college so it shouldn't be hard to know if my plan is working.

^It sounds like a trainwreck already occuring. LSD every night, "tapering" amphetamine, and now 3-meo-pcp? While in college? Lol... I'll tell you this, you wont be magically reversing your tolerance, you will absolutely be tripping balls. In a bad way. Like in a, unable to go to class and possible trip to the psych ward. There's something about the 3-meo-pcx chems (and mxe as well) they dont just reverse psychological tolerance, they potentiate the symphatomimetic effects of something like amphetamine when it's taken in tandem. Absolutely horrid. Maybe yeah, if you take a break from amphetamines for 3 months and then take low doses of 3-meo-pcp sporadically you may have SOME potentiation of euphoria for a short while when resuming amphetamine. I would drop the LSD off the menu, you may be causing yourself memory loss and not even know it. Tripping on low dose LSD is fine and dandy if youre living on a farm doing physical labor or something, but not so much when in a college regimen. Know what one of the most prominent effects of a powerful dissociative like 3-meo-pcp is? Marked, extended memory loss for the duration of the trip and a few days after.


Tolerance is simply the name of the game with amphetamine, if you deem it beneficial, then either make yourself comfortable on a low/moderate prescribed dose or drop it entirely.

I just dropped half a tab that's purported to be 180 mcg.  I have lots of experience with LSD.  I've done LSD, 3-MEO-PCP, and MDA and it was the most intense trip of my life.  I might do it again but it was super intense.  I really enjoyed S-isomer ketamine, and I holed once with it.  I'm still experimenting with dissociatives.  I really liked DCK.  I'm also still looking for a girlfriend while I try to furnish my entrepreneurial retirement and graduate from college.

DCK however, gave me a stutter so I'm discontinuing usage.  I used 2 grams of it.  I've already used a half gram of 3-MEO-PCP.  It's my favorite dissociative so far.  Actually, I bought three batches of 3-MEO-PCP.  The first gave me reverse tolerance and would sometimes make me trip the next day.  The second was garbage purity (~5% max) and a I doubt the authenticity of it.  This batch I bought ten grams of doesn't give me reverse tolerance though.  I tried a free sample of O-PCE, but I didn't like it for holing as much as DCK.  S-isomer ketamine trumps DCK and everything else I've tried for holing personally.  I don't plan on holing with DXM ever, although I've taken 900 mg polistirex and 1 hit strong LSD before.  I just ordered "3-MEO-PCE" and I'm going to try that next.

Good for you. You say dropping 90mcg LSD like as if it is some sort of dick sizing contest. I used to drop a ten strip of 100ug+ blotters every single day for months while living with the hippies up north. I have experience with every possible combination of MDxx, 2c-x, dissociative, cannabis, benzo possible. See how that sounds? It's nothing to brag about and just telling you in advance it will not help you find a girlfriend. Girls hate this type of self-serving behavior not to mention any decent girl, especially one in recovery or otherwise, wouldn't take a second look at someone bragging about their drug experience unless they themselves are not in control of their own lives.


DCK gave you a stutter? I had a stutter and a speech impediment as a child, psychedelics cured it. Stimulant abuse and benzo withdrawal caused it to occur again, this time for a long period of time where it eventually went away as my anxiety curtailed. Is it a coincidence or cause and effect? Who knows. But you're putting the controls in someone elses hands when you haphazardly experiment with your mind like this. I might sound like an old timer but I am only 26. 


Dissociatives, for all their merits and praise, cause a type of stimulation that is chased and abused. There's no looking past this. As I said, I am the biggest druggy, tripper that I know. All that dissociatives lead me to was increasingly ramped up stimulant usage and eventually to abuse opioids. It might not be the case for you, but never say never. It sounds like you're still in a good place to curtail all usage but won't do so until you are handed one of life's many heavy handed lessons. I wish you all the best.

Some trails are happy ones,

Others are blue.


It's the way you ride the trail that counts,

Here's a happy one for you.


Happy trails to you,

Until we meet again.


Happy trails to you,

Keep smiling until then.


Who cares about the clouds when we're together?

Just sing a song, and bring the sunny weather.


Happy trails to you,

Until we meet again.

Oh no, haha. I am just stoned on weed and had some drinks earlier. Just enjoying the rest of this Sunday afternoon as best as I can. It's been a while since I have taken any type of heavy psychedelic/dissociative although when I am heavily buzzed from alcohol and take a good bong rip, I definitely feel like I'm tripping balls for a good 30min haha.

I find bragging about drug use in bluelight quite amusing, actually. Missed the whole point of the website buddy.

I had my first goes on this last week. I did a small 2.5 mg dose first go which I really liked. it was very chilled and calm. Music appreciation was increased especially response to bass frequencies.


My next dose was 7.5 mg over the course of an evening out in 3, 2.5 doses. At the start of the evening I felt a bit flat, a friend even commented on this. I felt social interaction uninteresting and difficult but I was drawn into people watching more than usual. 


After dosing another 2.5mg I felt quite rushy. The feeling really reminded me of a combo of nitrous and poppers. Weirdly the affect of the substance seemed to come in waves too so it was like inhaling a balloon /sniffing poppers every 5 minutes or so.


I was dosing using a small dropper bottle, having measured how much a full dropper dose was. I had a strange reaction squirting it directly in my mouth. My throat and tongue seemed to swell up a bit and I had trouble talking for a bit. It was like a sudden sore throat. Surprisingly I wasn't too bothered about this.


My dreams for a few days after were also very vivid.

Been a while since I logged on. Just want to update on high dose, daily usage of 3-meo-pcp for almost a year. I did somewhere around 7-10 grams of this substance redosing all day for a full year, with a week break or 2 somewhere in there. It's been about 6-7 months since my last dosage and I'm still coming down and integrating the delusions and lessons. The whole time i was on it, i'd swear by my usage. Now that it's taking over half a year to simply wear off, I feel otherwise. 


The delusions and mania have embedded so deepy into the core of my psyche that integration has become a fuck of a lot of hard work. I had recreated reality entirely, i perceived everything in ways that were purely speculative and quantum in nature, and at this point in the process i believe there is serious 'magic' at work with these substances (this one especially) that we have long yet to understand. 


I believe consciousness is a space/time bubble/blob/tube whatever you want to call it, and that extreme dosing of something like 3-meo-pcp propels your consciousness into the past and future and literally alters reality permanently through the quantum network. I believe that using substances this strong in this manner have effects far beyond what the government can possibly comprehend in the current timeframe. 


It took a long time for me to realize the drug hadn't begun to wore off. Months probably, and I now realize much farther down the road that my thinking is still very altered and integration is in full swing. I expect this integration to last another couple years, at least. I believe i received personal knowledge from a spiritual source that show me everything i need to do to correct my physical and mental health. It's just gonna take time and effort. Also lost my best friend Laika along this journey, who was a huge support for me when i became manic. It's been an intense past year. 


Although many psychonauts may have similar accounts of hallucinogen abuse, I surely feel as though I've tripped as hard and as long as anybody ever has before, and each day i remain astonished that I'm still functioning in my life.

Now I realize i've been suffering extreme depression my whole life. Anytime i find a motivating and productive substance, i ride the train until it kicks me off. For me 3-meo-pcp was the holy grail! But, due to unregulated batches within a dysfunctional medical society and lack of support from a doctor, sage, or shaman, it was impossible to distinguish between spiritual intuition and ego driven fantasies, as well as unreasonable to try to determine my own dosage or tolerance. 


 I just hope society starts to take an honest approach towards mental illness, so that order is established for a generation that is experimenting instead of undertaking direct healing.

"unreasonable to try to determine my own dosage or tolerance."


This right here is one of the most sinister yet subtle aspects of this substance. I don't think I ever got very delusional, but damn was my usage reckless. I was taking some before work in lieu of caffeine and operating heavy machinery while somehow believing that I was near sober.


This is probably the most tempting self medication available today for many reasons. I miss the feeling of confidence, drive, and  positive self image even now, 10 months since I flushed my 3-meo-pcp. Wellbutrin is helping now but it's the palest of shadows next to this.


Anyway good job on trying to get yourself straightened out. I'd probably have rode that train just as hard were it not for a very hard lesson just over a year ago.

Someone let me know if I got this right . I'm gonna take 500 MG 3-meo-pcp mix with 150 MG baking soda put in shot glass hot water ...until I see oil floating on top then . Let cool . Drain water keep oil?(does the 3-meo-pcp then stay oil or does it solidify? ) then put the 3-meo-pcp in some eathr . How much eathr would u mix with 500 MG 3-meo-pcp free base ? To get something like pcp?  Anything I'm missing?.

If you have 3meo-pcp,  no need to perform any extractions etc. 

It is very active in small doses (2-4mg should be effective) although it takes several uses to properly understand its nature. 


Alternatively 5- 8 mg will be more obvious of its mechanism.


Im pretty sure conversion to freebase is reletively pointless with this chem given its salt forms activity.

Someone else more chemically skilled may answer tho.


Point is, if you have from good source, its suitable to enjoy as is.

Last night I took 5mg of 3-MeO-PCP, and then 6mg of 3-HO-PCP (hadn't tried the 3-HO before).  My friend did the same (he has tried it a number of times).  Both of us agreed that combined, they filled in each others' gaps.  It reminded me of MXE a bit, but way less wonky.  Both of us felt very euphoric, I had this deeply rooted perfect happiness feeling that I have only gotten from MXE or a good psychedelic trip.  We conversed non-stop for a good 4 hours about life and I really processed some stuff.  Really great combo, at least the one time I've tried it so far.  Much better than 3-MeO-PCP alone.

I decided Adderall wasn't for me about 10 years back, but I need attention what with ADHD and all.  I gave it a shot again and decided it wasn't for me.  I read 5ht2a agonists prevent NMDA neurotoxicity.  I'm still researching using LSD and 3-MEO-PCP as an alternative ADHD medication.  Adderall withdrawal has got me but I think I'm going to stick with my LSD and 3-MEO-PCP regiment to solve my holistic binding problem.

Have you ever experienced reverse tolerance with a dissociative?  That's the one I'm looking for.  Everything grew angel wings and I was tripping through time.  I was under the impression it was 3-MEO-PCP, but I don't know who to trust.

Doing doses like that is just asking for trouble.


I did around 6mg 3 meo pcp last night. About 4.5 oral and the rest plugged. Not really sure what to make of this drug. It just reminds me of a long lasting nitrous like experience, which was fun but not really mind expanding like ketamine. My favourite expereince so far has been 2.5mg. so might just stick to threshold doses. It seems to make me quite grouchy the day after.

woodyfence, please be careful man. 3-MEO-PCP is for me, the most potentially addictive compound I have come into contact with. The blur between delusion and reality is so subtle that you really can cause some decent damage to you life if not treated with care.


Anyone reading this, please just stick to low doses and in safe situations ideally with a trip sitter. I got burned again recently, I have 2 psychotic episodes to write about on here as soon as I can. For anyone reading this with any potential for addiction with this substance, write down how many times max a year you can take it, I would say once a month for creative purposes but this is subjective. Then if you go outside of that, flush it while your high - trust me I am doing you a favour.


Honestly I love this stuff, if you have a good head on you and can stick to the rules this compounds amazing. But if you can't just read over the forums and how many long termers have become delusional. I speak from experience. I have been insanely lucky in my endeavours, but it could have easily gone the other way.


Stay safe,


Namaste.

I think your point isn't made enough Crashing and that's just how long it takes it takes to return to your true baseline after extended disso usage. I used them heavily for 2 years - mostly MXE but also others including lots of 3-MeO-PCP at times. For years the changes in perspective from dissos were seemingly all positive for me, until many of them weren't. For over a year now I have been mostly abstaining, like you it was a slow process of returning to normal, but I've also noticed the times I did them in the past couple months how long it would take me to return to baseline compared to during the height of my usage. Almost like I had developed a hypomanic baseline during extended abuse, but it was invisible to me at the time because it had become my new 'sobriety.'


While I like the word "magic" to describe these substances, is that is just an inherent property present of reality that these substances have an uncanny ability to amplify? I've had experiences that seem to defy classical mechanics, is it just tuning into a different reality? Because it's certain that at least in this reality, between enlightenment and psychosis it's a very thin line with these substances, where do you draw it? For myself I decided it's not worth it anymore, although it helps that my tolerance reached a self-limiting point, they're just boring to me now even after long breaks.

3-MeO-PCP has a mild negative cognitive effect on me at functional dosages (and I have only pretty rarely gone into *fully* active dosages, mostly in the beginning, and believe me I've tried), but ketamine was always the stuff that made me stutter etc. It's possible permatolerance involves glutamatergic rerouting making you more immune to this over years / heavy use.


I agree by the way: such high dosages of 3-MeO-PCP have a very high chance of (train)wrecking you sooner or later, and by that I mean sooner rather than later. I'm pretty sure everything I've found about 3-MeO-PCP and reported about would be much different if I were disso naieve when I started with it. Thank whatshisface for that.


I appreciated the stuff when it *really* worked and I think it's okay now that it has gotten duller (but almost don't use it anymore at all), so I am not on any witchhunt for 3-MeO apart from a reasonable concern based on so many trainwrecks in the last years.

Hopefully you guys reading this have actually looked into this if you weren't around to just pick up on this, how experienced people and veterans of the forum have screwed themselves into some serious shit.


If you are not getting the response of 3-MeO-PCP at reasonable dosages like 10 mg you were hoping for, abandon your efforts soon after.

If you have a lot of issues and have an inclination to take a lot of 3-MeO-PCP look for something different, almost anything is probably better apart from fents and shit.


Maybe I am more worried about people already too deep in this (and it lasts a long ass time of course) to not read or integrate advice like a sober person might, much worse than people on opioids which are also numbed but at least less mindfucked. And yeah the whole spiritual angel messiah type vibe people get from 3-MeO is just an effect immediately realized by most people coming down.

I worry that the people we really want to reach may more or less be too far gone to really communicate with effectively.


3-MeO-PCP produces no reverse tolerance I ever heard of, and honestly if that is what you are getting you are probably fucked and psychotic.


Get dexamph if you are getting withdrawals from Adderall or lower your dosage because you really shouldn't get a hangover like you would from recreational / indicental use. Also it might be worth trying Ritalin because some people respond better to that and others to amps.

Taking 3-MeO-PCP and acid for ADHD are you serious? 3-MeO-PCP is bound to fuck your attention although it may give you various illusions to suggest otherwise. Low dose acid on its own for ADHD is pretty much pioneering, I can't say whether it might work for some people but for me it doesn't although LSD is therapeutic to me in different ways apart from my ADD.


Elevating your dopamine is probably still your best bet for ADHD but the trick is not taking too high dosages of any medications and managing side-effects / trying something else if you can't. I don't think I could manage with Adderall but I can with dexamph, it's considerably less physically stimulating. You really don't all that high dosages to get a therapeutic effect, but it is easy to be confused about this if what you are expecting is pretty much recreational effects.


Be careful with self-medicating, in my experience some things can help a little but most if they seem to help just treat symptoms of your problems indirectly. If a dissociative helps it is probably rather because it disrupts chaotic mismanagement of your attention but rather by limiting your thoughts in general. This is not really a solution to anything even if you feel temporarily relieved. You also tend to be oblivious about how it actually does not improve your functioning, people on 3-MeO overestimate lots of things. It also just enables your use or abuse.

WARNING: Potentially lethal 3-Meo-PCP batch circulating

---------------------------

I have analyzed a 3-MeO-PCP batch coming from China a few days ago with the following results:


The sample of supposed 3-MeO-PCP hydrochloride was analyzed by 1H NMR in CDCl3 and D2O. It was found to contain 3% piperidine HCl, 41% PCC HCl and 56% 3-MeO-PCP HCl.

PCC is 1-(piperidin-1-yl)cyclohexane-1-carbonitrile, the most common PCP precursor, formed by reacting piperidine with cyclohexanone and cyanide under appropriate conditions.


The nitrile group is a leaving group in the next reaction step, usually a Grignard reaction. PCC can release cyanide both invivo and in vitro and has been linked to numerous PCP deaths in the past, although the amounts needed to kill are quite high. Considering the lower potency of 3-MeO-PCP (compared to PCP) and the really high amount of PCC in the given sample, the danger of fatal accidents is higher than with usual contaminated PCP batches.

I was asked to post this warning. This batch was originally sent from a well known Chinese vendor. Some of you may not be aware, but most of the Chinese vendors that are left by now do not actually synth their products themselves, but they buy them from big factories that supply various vendors.


It's hard to say how many such factories are operating in China, but probably only very few.

Because of that chances are high that other vendors have also been supplying this batch already. The vendor was informed and they said they will repurify the batch. This might or might not happen, as is so often the case with the Chinese.


So people please be careful and if your vendor can not supply an up to date NMR of his 3-MeO-PCP (which probably 95% of all vendors can not do), then rather not purchase this product! If you research 3-MeO-PCP and notice that it is much lower potency than it should be, then it is very likely that you have this specific batch in hand!


Here are the NMR files:

NMR in D2O: [https://ufile.io/zra4t](https://ufile.io/zra4t)

NMR in CDCl3: [https://ufile.io/7z3nr](https://ufile.io/7z3nr)


TLDR: A possibly large batch of 3-MeO-PCP was supplied to the market which is only around 56% pure and contains 41% of a potentially lethal impurity (PCC)!

If you research with new 3-MeO-PCP and notice that it is low potency DO NOT just take more of the supposedly impure product because it can KILL YOU!!!

Wow... thanks for providing this information.  That's scary.  I'm shortly going to receive some Chinese 3-MeO-PCP.  Do you know of any way to check for this besides sending to a lab to test?  Would a testing reagent indicate the presence of PCC?

Unfortunately, I don't. I was wondering about that myself.

Well, a TLC would probably help a lot already. If you have one spot after trying several eluents, you're probably fine.


Anyhow, 10 mg or so of PCC wouldn't be too dangerous, it's even below a dangerous dose of cyanide. The danger is in people compulsively redosing, especially if they are not getting where they want...

I've had somewhat almond-smelling 3-MeO-PCP before, and also batches that did not have this property.

I don't know if the smell is any indication or if it is highly dependent on release of small quantities of HCN by hydrolysis of PCC which may just be present in trace quantity, maybe there is a way to differentiate between good product and shit that is about half PCC by wetting it and heating it up (or the other way round) and carefully smelling but not sure if this may actually be too hazardous - to be sure I'd start with a really tiny quantity. Maybe NMR chemist has some comment on it and finds he is able to do a simple preliminary test that everyone can try.


A risk would be that people might find a false sense of security in a false negative test, but who knows it might be better than nothing. Also if done wrong you don't want to be essentially vaping 3-MeO especially with no idea if it is good or bad, so any test would have to guard against it.

I found this on another site. Not sure how accurate it is. 

Take 0.1gr steel wool and dissolve in 5ml concentrated hydrochloric acid. This prepares a test reagent for cyanide. Then dissolve 0.1gr of your to be tested arylcyclohexylamine in there. Wait a few minutes. If an intense dark blue color appears (prussian blue) your sample contained a PCC like contaminant or similar cyanide contaminant. Under no circumstances should attempts be made to recover the drug, leave the tap running and pour the liquid with the stream into the sink to dispose, avoiding to breathe the air near the tube. This will put personal concerns about PCC like contamination to bed.

No, it doesn't, but it also shouldn't. Pure PCC doesn't smell like almonds either, neither the base nor the HCl salt. Also, it's not exactly a cyanide. The molecule is capable of eliminating cyanide under certain conditions, though.

It's interesting to see what the Marquis test will show on pure PCC, since it doesn't have any aromatic groups. It still might influence what 3-MeO-PCP looks like if tested, though. I'll see if I can find the time to mix some Marquis reagent and test some 3-MeO-PCP, PCC and the impure batch. It's fortunate that PCC is so easy and cheap to make if you have access to basic chemicals...

I am not sure if that works. Or course this is a cyanide detection agent but PCC is not a cyanide. Not sure if HCN would eliminate under stongly acidic conditions from PCC. It is usually quite stable, or at least stable enough to prepare its HCl salt. How trustworthy is the source? It would be good if it would work so easily...

This only works for PCC base. Unfortunately, PCC HCl is not soluble in those solvents...

That would be true, if phenylcyclohexanecarbonitrile was PCC. However, the PCC I am talking about is 1-(piperidin-1-yl)cyclohexane-1-carbonitrile. The piperidine moiety is a base that can form a salt. I can post you NMRs of both the base and the salt in near future, if that helps you.


Here's a link to the correct structure. 

[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3867-15-0#section=Top](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3867-15-0#section=Top)


During X-PCP syntheses, the nitrile is exchanged for the (substituted) phenyl group in the last step using the most common metal-organic reagents. I hope this much reference to synthesis is OK, this can be googled easily and is all on Erowid.

Just wondering what you guys usually dose for a day long affair, ideally for maximum euphoria throughout the day which will be for around 14 hours. I will be insufflating and was planning to do around 4mg every hour. I am aware this is quite a subjective question, but wanted to hear what course of action you would take in regards to amounts and how often, to get maximum results? 


I have done a fair bit of this stuff but have stupidly just 'felt' when to take more. Now I am keen to be more methodical.

Unless you have a massive permatolerance that doses will produce a trainwreck or a trip to the hospital. For low tolerant or no tolerant people 3mg in 3 takes (total 9mg) should be enought for a superman mode day. You could even double it (total 18mg) but it will be dangerous territory for most people

I did not have too many of those days and was also more guided by feeling, but my estimate is that I took initially 10 mg and added 5-10 mg every few hours. I am sure lower doses would produce comparable mood lift and hypomania with somewhat less dissociation.

This.


Back when I was using this I'd have probably done 3-4mg initially, followed by 1-2mg every hour or two.


4mg/hour is without a doubt asking for trouble, *especially *for 14 hours, let alone 10 or even 6.

Thanks for clearing that up. This is probably why I have had a coupe of times when I have taken it too far! You really need to drop everything you know about all other narcotics with this stuff. So 3mg then wait how long before the next 3mg? 2 hours?

Thanks for the info. I definitely seem to have some tolerance which is where it makes it more difficult. But I just want to stay really far away from anything dangerous, so keen to low ball it and just get on with my day.

I've never taken 3-meo with ketamine, but I've taken it with MXE. It greatly potentiated it for me, and fairly reliably produced a strong and demonic/darker themed experience. I wouldn't recommend it, but I'm sure people have enjoyed it somewhere or another.


If you do combine the two, stay super low dosage on one of them. If you want a more K-like experience, only do a few mg of 3-meo, more 3-meo like, only a bit of K. It's really only for potentiation IME, and caution needs to be taken.

Do you remember the exact dosages of 3-meo-pcp and MXE you did? I have some probably not amazing MXE, it was analysed and came MXE and nothing else, it is quite strong but not very magic. The most I took was around 80mg and I was away for a while but no revelations. I just tried MXE once before this batch and I think it was better, so I would like to mix it with 3-meo which I find quite magic between 10-14mg dose but uninteresting below that, I think it is because I am not a lover of the dissociative feeling, I just like the psychological potential. What dosages would you recommend for my needs?


I quite enjoyed MXE as a launchpad for DPT though, those 2 are made for each other.

I actually like that combo a lot. I once took 6 mg 3-MeO-PCP and then took around 40 mg MXE and managed to hole on that low a dose (That was a few years back when I was almost disso naive so low tolerance was also at play). Was amazing. More recently I've been enjoying combining the same amount of 3-MeO-PCP with lower doses of MXE (around 20, 25 mg). Amazing music enhancement and extreme euphoria nearing the come-down. The hypomanic afterglow is almost guaranteed. A week ago, actually, I had a pretty magical experience with that combo while on a dense rainforest. 


I would expect it would behave similarly with K. Are you aiming to IM it and hole, or sniff small amounts? Whatever the case, expect strong potentiation and keep the 3-MeO-PCP on the medium-low range. I don't remember ever combining them.

Wait a few minutes. If an intense dark blue color appears (prussian blue) your sample contained a PCC like contaminant or similar cyanide contaminant. Under no circumstances should attempts be made to recover the drug, leave the tap running and pour the liquid with the stream into the sink to dispose, avoiding to breathe the air near the tube. This will put personal concerns about PCC like contamination to bed.

I have made some PCC and tested this method with both sodium cyanide (NaCN) and PCC. The NaCN gave a dark blue (almost black) color, as expected, and a precipitate of the same color. The PCC did not react in that way! The was no color change and no precipitation. Unfortunately, I have not made any pictures. I can repeat the experiment with pictures if anyone is interested.


Another thing I noticed was that PCC did have a slight smell that could be associated with almonds. NaCN did not have this smell and I am not sure if it's the same "almond smell" as HCN has. There are many compounds that smell like almond, like benzaldehyde (actually more like marzipan).

NMR-Chemist, Thanks for doing the tests and keeping us updated.


I have test results for the batch of 3 meo pcp I'm working with. Can someone who understand these things please tell me what the results show.

lc-ms results: [http://docdro.id/d32Hi5G](http://docdro.id/d32Hi5G)

Currently available is a batch from 2016 that has apparently been properly stored.


Has anyone sampled this? 


Anecdotes on another website claim it is not contaminated with PCC or cyanide, is active at the appropriate dose, and appears to be high quality. I just don't trust posts on that website as much and figured I would come here to say something before my order arrives. I'll update when I can....


Also, I recently received a very small quantity of a completely different appearance than I had ever seen before. 


It was like very small salt crystals with some off color grains, brownish and black specks. These bigger grains of a different color did not dissolve in water even with boiling.


This was definitely the highest quality batch effects wise I have ever sampled. It was more stimulating and clean feeling. It dissolved quickly without heat....


But it numbed my tongue!! Is that strange or what??


One last thing!! My research leads me to believe reagent testing will be inconclusive! I may get a blue with Marquis? The only thing reagents will do is rule out the possibility that it's anything that does react, eh?


I love this molecule!! It has always had a very strong after glow for me! I swear the after glow can be better than the intoxication!!


Oh just one more last thing!! How would you compare ROA's?? I've read nearly everything on the internet regarding this molecule, but I love to hear new and interesting inputs! I love IV but I feel like it's not the best ROA. Can't wait to try IM some day!!


Love you all!!

The LC-MS looks quite good. It says that there seems to be only one impurity with an integral of 1.5%. Assuming the same intensity of detection by the diode array detector, it would mean that the sample is 98.5% with 1.5% impurity. However, the impurity peak looks larger in the mass spec detector (last graph) but has not been integrated. The product mass fits well, which confirms the identity of 3-MeO-PCP or its isomer.


The NMR has been measured in DMSO-d6, so I don't have a right spectrum to compare it to. I measured in CDCl3 and D2O myself. In general it looks like the product, except that the integrals of the peaks between 0.9 and 2.3 ppm are somewhat too large in total. They belong to 10 protons from the cyclohexyl ring and 6 protons from the piperidine ring. Therefore the total integral should be 16, not 20 like in the spectrum. It's hard to deduce a total purity from this, though. Also I cannot tell if the main impurity is PCC, piperidine HCl or something else entirely... In any case, the provided data shows that the batch is far better than the one I have analyzed.

I recently received a batch that does not seem to be active, at least not at the normal doses.


The vendor claims that he had it tested and that it came back as 3-MeO, but then also offered to reship a different ?brown-colored? batch.


I did try it out the other weekend, and I got no psychoactive effects that I can remember; I probably did more than I should have, thinking ?maybe it?s just impure/weak.?


I also fell on my face about 15 times; it definitely did mess with my balance and stuff, but was not like past 3-MeO I have worked with.


Weirdest thing is I was drug tested for a doctor visit (had fun having to explain this all) and it DID come back as positive for PCP.

If you read recent posts in this thread, there is a confirmed batch circulating that is heavily contaminated with PCC, which is a toxic precursor that is potentially lethal in a high enough dose, with that big an impurity percentage.  It was like 50% of the total weight or something.  Quite dangerous.

Really?  Most people I've heard compare the two seem to find them quite distinguishable, with PCP being way more intoxicating and intense.  I've never tried PCP myself though.

3-meo-pcp is very intoxicating and intense also. i cant imagine making dinner, let alone walk around in public. deschloroketamine was only slightly more debilitating at the same level of dissociation.


i took 12 milligrams, felt VERY stupid for the level i was at, took another 10 mg three hours later and  then it was pretty much just like pcp.

3-meo-pce is like that for me. i can actually do my job BETTER or equal to sober when im on 10 mg of 3-meo-pce. i can even drive on 20 (i dont, but i could). i do like 3-meo-pcp, but honestly i was looking for a disso along the 3-meo-pce realm. i will prolly still try some lower doses of 3-meo-pcp, but at 12mg, i wasnt anywhere near as dissociated as i wanted to be for the level of inebriation. it felt more like a head cold, tbh, until the higher dose.

Doesn?t the batch with PCC contaminant also contain like 50% actual 3-MeO-PCP? If one took say 20mg, wouldn?t he still feel like he took about 10mg ? The stuff I had did not have any effects even at 40mg

So, 3-meo-pcp is off the table unless one has got a VERY legit vendor or has their own ability to do extensive testing.


Some people in this thread are mentioning deschloroketamine as a comparison. 2-oxo-pcm (deschloroketamine) was actually very nice. mania inducing, sure, but it also had a very peaked & immediate "enlightening" anti-depressant type of effect, much like MXE (3-meo-2-oxo-pce). Alot of people are calling 2-oxo-pcm bland, and yes, it is. It won't put you into outer space for 24 hours not able to stand up or prevent from shitting yourself, regardless of dose. In this way it is similar to ketamine. So it is safer. But I will say that it can definitely be very, very mania inducing compared to regular ketamine (s or r isomer). Very euphoric though.

went for a 25 mg dose, apparently i need a new scale cause when i re-tared it with the compound in it, took it and re-weighed it, it registered a -35mg. not good. i said my blessings, prepared my house, told my roommate what was up, and prepared to be gone. 


and gone i was. for quite awhile. 


as far as 3-meo-pcp alone, i still prefer other dissociatives. it was pretty much like a very high pcp dose (two dippers, dunno exact dosages), but with a slight difference. 


3-meo-pcp is a bit thinner. not sure how to put it, but like a less dense version of pcp (still pretty much the same headspace, just a thinner body feel). whereas on pcp, i feel like the anatomical humonculus guy, big balloon hands and all, 3-meo-pcp gives me that feeling (no other disso does, afai can remember), but instead of big balloon hands, its more thin hands. very hard to describe. 


went a bit nutso, and eventually smoked a bowl of cannabis. 


the cannabis (as expected) took it up a notch, added euphoria, and made me very musical. i also had taken 1mg alprazolam to take the crazy edge off. 


on the comedown, i reached one of the most amazing mindsets ever, feeding my plants like they were my first born children. 


all in all, although the intensity of the insane feeling almost made me flush the stash, in the end, the cannabis helped me realize what an ally this may become (need further exploration)


i would probably not wanna go above 20mg ever again, and i think i will smoke cannabis with it from now on, but all-in-all, i have come to really like it. it humbled me. 


i will agree that this is almost twice as potent as 3-meo-pce (maybe 1.5x more like), and i doubt i will chase this one into a hole ever in my life, but this is good.

That?s quite heroic dose... In my first trial both my girl and I did 15mgs each. We almost hole in a restaurant (thinking it would take 3h to full effects). We were glued to the seats, unable to talk, think or move. Asking for the bill was an oddisey of biblic proportions. But finally, somehow we did it. We learnt the lesson at the first try.


Now, I never do more of 6-7mgs in 24h and that?s plenty of a dose. I can?t imagine how some people do 20 or 30mgs in one go and they live to talk it

i dislike the term "heroic dose" at the best of times, but having experienced "too much" 3-meo-pcp (got a bit enthusiastic about dosing...was really fucking dumb because i had to check out of the room i was staying in and, uh, catch a plane but couldn't quite make out *words* or...anything else.  profoundly dissociated in a place i really shouldn't have been...) it's **so** inappropriate for this substance IMO.  there is **nothing** heroic about it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

i don't know if it is, but i wholeheartedly agree that it *should *be.   this is one of the creepier reports of impurities i've heard of.   to me it seems a little crazy that 3-meo-pcp escaped the ban that made so many other chinese RCs disappear.


not saying that is a good or a bad thing, but i do sometimes wish these kinds of heavy-hitting dissociative drugs weren't quite so available to people who don't understand or appreciate the risks of taking them.

same could be said about a lot of different drugs, obviously - but 3-meo-pcp  was - to me, at least - strangely deceptive because it felt so clear and "functional" that it potentially gave a false sense of security.


mental health risks are one thing, though -  and PCC contamination is something else entirely...


be careful folks.

No it's a fine idea, actually on low doses it seems to increase my stamina.  However you should be careful because dissociatives can make you not feel things as much so you can push yourself too hard.

Like Xorkoth said, dissociatives could delay an awareness of injury or tiredness, so its wise to check in with yourself often and not push yourself too hard when working out dissociated. That said, exercise is really important to getting the most out of dissociatives in general IMO. I used 3-MeO daily for months at a time at doses larger than most people are taking but I exercised religiously when I used it which I firmly believe counteracted a lot of of the negative effects associated with 3-MeO. Eventually, daily usage caught up with me, and I stopped using 3-MeO, but hard to say if I had kept up my routine if that would have been the case. I got lazy and started flaking on my excercise routine eventually, not to mention I wasn’t sleeping well and things went downhill for me. That said, excercise on dissociatives feels really great. I mostly would jog but would recommend trying some yoga moves. You’ll really understand yoga after trying it on dissociatives; it can be straight up blissful.

^^^^


lines up perfectly with my experiences (except i was using 3-meo-pce, and my workout and my occupation were one-in-the same)


dont neglect the stretching! you dont know/ care that youve pulled a muscle on a disso until later on when youre in pain. 


i even know EXACTLY what levels means about the yoga. especially when cannabis is in the mix.

Be very, very careful.


A good buddy and I went weightlifting on a low dose of MXE almost seven years ago, and the both of not only overexerted ourselves to the point of needing a week of recovery, but almost pulled multiple muscles, the both of us. Weight-lifting and dissociatives is NOT a good thing, you do not want to be muting your bodies warning signals when playing with weights.

why do i feel so stupid on 3-meo-pcp compared to other dissociatives? 


to reach the level of dissociation i usually shoot for, it takes 25+mg, but at only 10mg im already feeling the dulling of my thought process, like cobwebs and pressure in the front of my head. 


only when i use cannabis with it do truly strong dissociative effects come out. 


(as compared with other dissos, it seems to synergize HEAVILY with cannabis, to the point of overwhelming me, even at 10mg, whereas it took 35mg to overwhelm me with 3-meo-pcp on its own)


anyway, its 6 hours later, im barely feeling any dissociative effects, and i still feel retarded in the neo-cortex


is this a normal response?


i remember having this fumb feeling quite strongly when i smoked PCP in the daytime and hung out in the hot sun, but certainly not every time. 


it also reminds me of the comedown from o-pce, but only after a HEAVY hole dose.

Yeah, I seem to respond in a similar way to you. I usually use this below 10 mg, and if I want to get really dissociated on it I always combine it with weed. 12 mg oral + some cannabis is my sweet spot for dreamy, trippy dissociation. 


Otherwise I use low dosages for the stimulating/hypomanic light dissociative state.

 Could it possibly be an impure batch? At least one producer in China was selling a bad synth that's 41% PCC.

Possibly, but the vendor swears up and down that it has been tested and other customers have success... reading on the vendor?s discussion boards shows that other people are having success...


Does anyone know of a reason why 3-MeO-PCP wouldn?t work for someone?


Like, if someone is taking SSRI?s, most psychedelics won?t work...


What could cause arylcyclohexylamines to not work?

It?s weird because i stopped an SSRI maybe two months ago... have tripped a few times...


But then last night I orally consumed about 25-30mg 4-AcO-DMT...


And nothing, nothing but some diarrhea.

Plenty of other people have told me the batch is great. Even worked for me a month ago.


Something really weird is going on

you know, ive been gett8ng diarrhea lately too, and im just considering 3-meo-pcp as the source. ive also had trouble where i get cognitive/ balance issues with little dissociation, and i chalked it up to individual chemistry or not looking for effects in the right places. 


dissociatives often confound me, trying to pinpoint exactly what is happening, but even moreso with this one.

Hmmm.


MXE, deschloroketamine, DXM and previous 3-MeO have all worked well for me...


The diarrhea from 4-AcO was probably 3-4 days since any attempted dose of the 3-MeO, and the 3-MeO never caused it before, so I don?t think the 3-MeO has anything to do with it

On this topic, I wanted to share something I've found about this compound that forgot to add on my last post. 


Sometimes I get this feeling of pressure in the forehead and mental foggyness during the come-up. Sometimes it goes away, sometimes it doesn't. I noticed a big factor is hydration and food ingestion. A few weeks ago I dosed early in the day and was feeling this particular side effect rather intensely, to the point the "high" became uncomfortable. I hadn't have anything for lunch yet, and I started feeling really hungry 3 hrs after taking 3-MeO-PCP. After I had a meal, all of the uncomfortableness went away. I felt clear headed and energetic. I had taken a light dose btw (like 5 mg divede in two dosages taken 2 hours appart). This allowed for the hypomanic effect I was looking for to smoothly manifest. 


Other times I've noticed similar effects in regards to hydration. If I haven't had enough water, I will get that annoying "mental pressure". So watch out for those things, seems like at least some of us need to be in perfect conditions to truly enjoy this compound.

i can totally see that. reminds me of what the rapper "bad azz" said about pcp: dont use it if youre depressed. 


that goes against my idea of dissociatives being sometimes great for depression, but i can totally see how these drugs definitely respond to set+setting quite strongly. 


im gonna try what you said, thanks!


i think im starting to learn this compound a bit better. it takes quite a bit of dialing in.

Yesterday I did 3-4mgs of 3-meo. Today I have taken 1200mgs of piracetam and Im not lugghish (as I normally am the next day) but hyperfocused and with tons of energy. 3-meo lovers should take it the next day to confirm that it works wonders and turns the hangover into a productive day

I personally never got a "hangover" from it at low to moderate doses. In fact once I got a feel for it (and probably some tolerance) I always had a positive afterglow. 


Now, when the 3-meo train really got rolling, fueled by ecstasy, LSD, and alcohol, well that's a different story.

It does. It can have a very harsh learning curve. When it first came out many very experienced users had a lot of problems. Myself included.

Easter Sunday I decided to take 3-meo-pcp and mxe together. I began with 2-3mg 3-meo-pcp insufflated, within ten minutes I took approx. 23 mg of mxe, also insufflated.


I had a great time on this combination, music appreciation went through the roof and I was very content just chilling and listening to music. I found myself to be more manic on this combination than on my higher-dose experiences with 3-meo-pcp alone (~8mg), however it was more attenuated in the sense that I was very excited about my ideas, but didn't feel the need to pursue them just that minute, it would be fine to come down first. 


I took an additional 10mg mxe about 2 hours in as well as another ~2mg 3-meo-pcp. This didn't seem to affect the experience very much, just prolong it. I found that smoking weed during made the music effects very pronounced, everything sounded 'thick' and I knew my pot buzz was wearing off when it got thin again lol.


Just under 4 hours into the experience I measured out another 20mg of mxe, split into three lines. After the first was one of the most magical moments I've had on mxe, that floating feeling accompanied by the strange sparkle of.. novelty? Something. Very good. 


It was about the time I was taking the second line that my parents came home, they've been away on a trip for a couple months. I knew them to be coming back that day but wasn't sure of the time. I'm an adult (just a sad one who moved back in) and my parents are very chill, I don't hide stuff from them so I wasn't in the least concerned about them finding me tripping. In fact I was really excited to see them after two months so jumped into interacting with them, railing the last line first of course. I was good for a little while but my parents were very intense, actually if I didn't know better I'd have thought my mom was on speed with how much she had to say. Luckily I was lit enough to keep track of it all, had I been sober it would have been way too much. 


Then my dad started talking about computer troubles and that's when I began to feel ill, he brought it over for me to take a look at and I puked. All clear water which was strange, somewhat gelatinous lol. Felt queasy for the rest of the trip until I came down 3 or so hours later. 


I will definitely repeat this combination, though I will try to avoid such unpleasantries as IT support during lol. I ended up having an awesome idea early in the trip that I'm still reeling about the potential ramifications of, made the entire thing feel worthwhile right off the bat. I will probably use close to the same dosages, though would definitely have spaced out that third line given the chance so there's some room for improvement for sure. Here's hoping more mxe shows up sometime soon

Yeah, some nootropics 'block' the effects of arylcyclohexamines, and possibly all NMDA antagonists.

Years ago i found that noopept completely prevented MXE from working, or - as above - "aborted" MXE trips.

I don't know what the mechanism is, exactly, but it kinda freaked me out at the time.

Orangelicker, do you take any nootropics?

Some dissociatives are just insidious. They can inflate egotism and confidence to unheard of levels. Then comes psychosis. All in all the opposite of why I began using dissociatives. Then the middle road of low incremental dosing was found and it made 3-MeO-PCP so much more manageable. I was always able to keep shit together on the outside but the psychosis from it wreaked havoc on my mind. I'm super skeptical and the things I would experience were so hard to deny. As if the feeling was in your very core. 


Used more sparingly with the incremental dosing its an awesome chemical and ally. Used other ways it will start as an ally and end with it holding a knife to your throat before you can even realize it. Its less taxing than plain PCP so constant dosing seems so much more benign until it isn't and by then its unfortunately to late. Used with respect though it can be mind blowing.

I took Noopept for a couple months back maybe 6 years ago... until the cops raided and took my ?baggies of unknown white powder.?


Have taken multiple dissociative NMDA receptor antagonists since then with effects (3-MeO, MXE, ket/deschloroketamine, nitrous)


Don?t think that is it. 


Starting to think my mom has slipped me the duloxetine that I refused to keep taking (tardive dysphoria is not something I want), but I don?t think she would ever do something like that. Would explain why 4-AcO-DMT isn?t working, plugged like 7mg the other day with no results. Sucks that she refuses to let me be in charge of my own medications at 27 years old :-/ thinks I?m gonna try to get High on omeprazole or something

I have indeed. I like actual PCP for its more dissociating nature but they each have their place and time. PCP seems to IMO have characteristics of all dissociatives in one. Stimulation at low doses, sedation at higher doses, and a hole at very high doses. Its hole is like being stuck in place and being apart of everything your touching while journeying inwards. Its kinda similar to other holes but bizarrely unique. Its most definitely the wackiest of all the dissociatives I've tried. Its somewhat similar to 3-MeO-PCP yet fairly distinct. I've never tried it orally or anything though which I assume would change some characteristics a bit. Its super wonky too. 3-MeO-PCP is like a more hyperfocused slightly dissociative zen stimulant while PCP is more like a white knuckle really fun warped rollercoaster ride, haha!

Yeah I really want to get some pure PCP and give it some tries, it sounds like a really nice dissociative.  I would of course measure my doses rather than relying on some dipped cigarette or something.  I can see why a power ego-boosting/stimulating dissociative could become a pretty frightening drug to people observing it from the outside, but PCP is a drug like any other, just a powerful one.  It sounds pretty great. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I also want to try plain PCE, I bet it would be awesome.

Yeah pure powder would be sweet but its almost never seen. I suppose you could buy a bottle of the PCP laced ether then dissolve it. Really dipped cigs aren't to hard to estimate. Just have one or those little tower cig extinguishers so you can take a hit or two put out. Wash rinse repeat. Its pretty cool smoked. This metallic humming overtakes things which reminds me of nitrous kinda. IMO its pretty relaxing at the sedating doses. I find this true for all dissociatives really though... In the US most inner cities have a lot of PCP. There's a place known as "Waterworld" round these parts hahahaha.


I'd love some PCE but really love some PCPy! Bring it on rolicyclidone! I wanted to try 3-MeO-PCPy/r so badly way back when it was released in small amounts but of course they wouldn't ship to the US at the time!

I'd love to try PCPy too!  What makes you want to try that more than PCE?  I've loved the PCE analogues I've tried, and MXE is my favorite dissociative by far.

I like more seating dissociatives personally. I'm not a fan of stimulants in general. Psychedelics and dissociatives are the only classes that have stimulation I'll use really. PCPy because it supposedly has a "barbiturate" esque feeling about it. I'd like to try more PCE analogues\plain PCE too though. IDK if itd be possible as I'm to lazy to care ATM but 3-MeO-2-OxO-PCPy\r might be awesome if they were at all possible. IDK if the reasoning why there's no 3-MeO-2-OxO-PCP would inhibit those but a man can dream. Dissociatives are my favorite drug class right next to psychedelics. Plus PCPy hasn't been tried by to many as far as I know. Dissociatives that are to stimulating cause trouble with most folks. I like ego dissolution rather than egocentricy too. Stimulating ones can make you a manic over confident mess if you don't take proper care and precaution. MXE just had this ethenogenic "I fucking love myself because I deserve love" feel to it more than a "I'M THE FUCKING BEST THAT EVER WAS! COME AT ME BRO!" feeling hahaha!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I feel like those are safer than the totally stimulating manic variety because those are the ones where more mistakes can be made IMO if ya know what I mean! No one ever causes trouble if they can't move from there seat! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I found 60mg of codeine and 3meopcp are just bliss together, I'm not an regular opiate user so it doesn't take much codeine and 3meopcp potentiates just about everything.


Seen a legal high powder called wonkad, active ingredient is 3meopcp, not all places list it as the active ingredient. That's a potential for disaster right there. I'm gonna have a crack and see how strong it is...just for harm reduction because there is no proper reports and I'm pretty experienced. I hope hope it's not to diluted but for safety of na?ve people its probably better if it is. I can just see some dumbass racking up a 50mg line thinking that its just some stimulant cathinone mix and going totally bonkers.

Exactly. That's why people who were the first wave after release got into a lot of trouble with it. I personally was used to MXE and had smoked PCP before. I respected it but the best dose levels had yet to really be released and reviewed. No one knew how long it would truly last. No one realized that the very seductive highly euphoric hypomania would turn into very self destructive mania fairly quickly with sustained use.  The totally consuming psychosis. We learned the hard way and we tried to warn everyone we could. Thankfully it never wrecked my life I just went a bit wackier for a bit but since I'm already wack as fuck and don't normally share much of my real internal dialouge no one really noticed too much. So stupid. All to make money too. Oh people when will you become wiser and get you don't have to possibly kill people to make money selling drugs?!?

Not too much, I would say. 

I actually have never had 2-fdck, but have seen it described as very close to Ketamine. If that's really the case, then they are pretty different. Ket is sedating, and predominantly dissociating, whereas 3-MeO-PCP is pretty stimulating, more so than it is dissociating IMO.

wow, this stuff tastes exACTly like a PCP dipper when smoked (minus the ether/ alcohol taste). did not freebase. 


mild but noticeable +1.5 noted with 5 mg vaped over dried herbs. 


much more pleasant than oral dosing/ mucosa- dissolved dosing. not as edgy. much more like a PCP dipper in effect than oral, or snorted, as well. i think this is the winner.

I've tried all the no-needle ROA's and prefer insufflated, oral, plugged, smoked in that order.  What about you guys?  I have about 7 grams of 3meopcp and I want to use it as efficiently as possible.  I find insufflated to be the most efficient and euphoric but the most difficult to maintain because of nasal damage.  What's your favorite ROA and why?

Oral. I've used it every other way. There's little increase between ROAs IMO, the only difference is the onset.

I gotta say oral too, even though usually I snort it.  Not sure why, because the effects are smoother and fuller when you eat it.  Snorted, it's more stimulating and hits you faster.  It's definitely not the same though.

Oral. The very act of insufflation became habit forming for me and led to problems eventually. Also it really damaged the inside of my nose, which took months of abstinence to heal.

I've only tried oral and nasal but preferred nasal even though I'd say effects were more full-bodied orally.


Why is this one so damaging to the nasal passages? I would have thought the small volume would make it way safer than stuff like K or cocaine. I can't even feel a 2mg bump going up my nose

Well it's odd, when I put even 2mg in my mouth, if it gets on my tongue at all it burns my tongue, it stays tender for a little bit and hurts.  My nose, I feel a sting and when I use it frequently for a while I notice I'm stuffy a lot more often.  But the burn is very minimal and brief when snorted.  I always thought that seemed odd given how caustic it feels on my tongue.  But I'm pretty sure it *is* caustic to mucous membranes.

i didn't know people were smoking this stuff?

when you say "mild but noticeable +1.5 noted with 5 mg vaped over dried herbs" - does this mean you're using a vape, or gently smoking a bowl with a pipe or bong or something?


for me, oral is the best ROA.  but i really hate sticking things up my nose - especially this, the one time i tried it.

too delicate, and yeah this chem does not feel nice on lips or tongue (if you lick something used to handle it, and get a tiny residual amount on your tongue) for me it seemed to linger in an unpleasant way.


i don't really have any desire to smoke it, but i'm just curious, because i thought people had written off the possibility that it could be effective?  i could be wrong.


i really like this stuff, but rarely touch it nowadays. i'm glad that it's never had much of a pull on me

its super nice. ive experimented further with the smoking roa, and i love it. 


basically, ive been putting 10 or so milligrams on a screen that has built up ash and/ or crushed herbs to prevent it from burning too quickly, and slowly melt it with a tiny hemp wick flame. its easy to titrate this way. the effects' feedback is much quicker, i peak within 15 minutes. 


i still get the 'stupids' but because it peaks so quickly and with less of that stim edge, i can work my way up smoothly to a nice dissociation.

I've tried vaping this before too, even after reading about other peoples unsuccessful trials with vaping the salt. I personally enjoy vaping when it's an option but sort of ruled this out for 3-MeO-PCP, so I find your report interesting nepaint21. I'm speculating that the built up ash and/ or crushed herbs you are using might be assisting in freebasing the 3-MeO-PCP. 


The reason for this speculation is I've heard others claim that they are vaping chemicals in their salt for by adding to herb/ash which others report little success with vaping ROA. The chemical composition of ash are chemicals like calcium and potassium carbonate — chemicals which are sometimes used to prepare the freebase. Is it possible that by mixing the chemical with the plant material the freebase step is occuring *in-sito*? I don't know the answer but I'm intrigued by  the possibility. I tried vaping the 3-MeO-PCP off of foil and abandoned the experiment.

its a compelling theory (im only a hobbyist with chemistry). actually, the thought crossed my mind that somehow the heat was releasing the acid-base association, but then i got high af. 


it really works. i just got back from a serious disso/ tryptamine excursion using this method. it does take more... i just sorta kept piling on microscoops worth (one level microscoop with the scoop i have is equal to around 5mg, checked with a scale), waited fifteen minutes, and repeated until i liked where i was at. i would guess that its about half as potent as orally, but really, how can we ever know how much of something we truly get into our bloodstream by smoking or vaping?)

Less potent vaporized than orally, huh? Reminds me of Shulgin's comments on 5-MeO-MiPT. It's always a little odd when a compound has higher availability orally than parenterally... except for benzos I guess.


Has anyone noticed a long (3+ days) anxiolytic afterglow with this compound? It doesn't seem to happen every time with higher (10+ mg) doses but has been consistent for me in the 5-9mg range.

Yes, the afterglow was what attracted me to it in the first place. In my early trials I didn't like the actual high but I always felt great afterward.

It has never lasted longer than a day for me, but there has been times were I've felt pretty stimmed and almost euphoric. I also have found that the afterglow shows more consistently when I dose low, for some reason. I think that maybe the culprit is the fact that if I dose too high (Which for me is over 10 mg) I wake up feeling a little dissociated still the next day. That makes me feel a little dysphoric as it is unwanted most of the time. When I keep my doses bellow 6 mg, specially when separated in two or more doses taken throughout an afternoon,  it has reliably given me amazing afterglows.

Yeah agreed.  I actually just bumped 2mg, planning to do a couple more over the course of the afternoon.  Steady, every couple of hours low-dosing is the most reliable way to get that slightly hypomanic stimulated flowy state, for me.

I usually weight 6 mg and then taken two small oral doses 2 or 3 hours appart from each other. By the time the second dose hits it usually has me feeling all nice and hypomanic.

Yeah I sometimes do oral and I find I prefer it but a lot of the time I snort it.  I think snorting stuff is just fun.  Also I find 3-MeO to be more stimulating nasally.

I wonder about health concerns of 3-meo-pcp use? liver toxicty, etc?


I suffer from C-PTSD and have found ketamine to be a godsend. alas, it is expensive where i live and tolerance builds fast. So I use 3meo pretty regularly. I'm a dissociatives veteran. I have xanax to hand and I can spot immediately the slightest signs of mania, etc. 


I am medically prescribed 40mg dexamphetamine and 3 mg Prazosin daily, for ADHD and PTSD respectively. 3meo is my little daily treat.

With no noticeable depression or hangover after extended usage I'd say 3-MEO-PCP must be about as harmless as LSD or marijuana.

i don't think 3-meo-pcp has anywhere near the safety profile of LSD or weed.  


also far, far less research or recreational use.  not one to be complacent about - as many posts in this thread can attest to; people have really gotten pretty messed up from excessive and/or chronic use,

As far as health concerns: I felt like my bladder capacity was somewhat diminished, but I never had pain there or in kidneys as many have with ketamine. Only other problem was damage to the inside of my nose from insufflation. Both recovered after a couple months of no use. Memory problems were subtle but longer lasting.

It really depends how you're using it. Once a month is surely better than once every two weeks > once a week > every other day > everyday. If you don't use more than once every two weeks you don't have much to worry about as long as you aren't using heavy doses. Although who knows exactly what even responsible use would do over decades, as far as long-term potentiation goes. Personally I started using dissociatives around 7-8 years ago, although probably only 2 of those were spent in serious abuse, I don't feel noticeably less intelligent and I do feel like I can grasp abstract concepts better than ever. If anything, my memory and concentration may be worse but you can't really isolate any of these attributes from aging and environmental factors.


Once you start using dissociatives every few days or more, you will almost surely run into problems eventually. This goes especially for 3-MeO-PCP more than most, as it very easily tends to psychosis. I've had residual effects from 3-MeO-PCP for weeks afterwards when I was using it at my worst, so I would assume it builds up in lipids like PCP. If you're doing it all the time hypertension is another threat to be aware of, as that can lead to all sorts of health issues long-term. With the low doses required it's probably better than using ketamine on your kidneys and bladder, but that's not to say it still isn't bad for them.


My personal opinion from experience is that at least some of the arylcyclohexylamines have statistically significant anti-bacterial properties and can disrupt gut flora, although the only ones I have really noticed this with is MXE, DCK & K. On two occasions in the past few years I was sick enough to require prescribed antibiotics (both times required an additional round to clear it up, but that could just be coincidence) and the bloating and low metabolism that persists for weeks after antibiotics doesn't seem any different than what happens to me after taking K or DCK lately.


Really the more you abuse these drugs (not saying that's what you're doing) the more negative side-effects you will develop/notice. The anxiolytic effects can easily give way to anxiogenesis when you start using them all the time. I've had plenty of odd-side effects but they seem to subside with cessation even if it takes a couple weeks, although side-effects of heavy abuse like anhedonia and mental fog may take longer to recover from. Using them in combination with drugs like amphetamine or MDMA is probably going to compound any issues.


Hopefully I don't come across as a scaremonger as I'm a real advocate for dissociatives and I think they are great tools for self-improvement, but I think considering how potentially addictive they are we need to be aware of the potential pitfalls and advocating responsible use. Those MXE threads a few years back were almost anything but. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Edit: I totally forgot about the paper that I was going to mention, but NMDA receptor hypofunction due to aging is associated with all kinds problems, which dissociatives transiently cause as well. Damage may be somewhat proportional to how long you antagonize the NMDA receptors. So give yourself long breaks if only because you don't want to lose the novelty.


Here's the full paper, it was actually co-authored by John W. Olney: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181613/

Check out this awesome paper I found: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9408919](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9408919).  Combine it with this though and long term use could be hazardous:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16123739](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16123739).  


Also, I've changed my mind about favorite ROA four or five times now.  Plugging is now my favorite due to fast and smooth onset.

one disclaimer about trying to smoke it: the batch i have seems to be flammable. a lighter easily ignites it. small controlled flame, get it all melty first, then vaporize. it starts to taste nasty and plasticy if it burns.

Oh god... So I feel addicted to this drug... I have had binges with over the years because I wanted to be hypomanic and happy and treat my extreme depression and panic attacks... I always end up with SOOOO many more problems... I never see the dark side while I'm sober.. I always think to myself I just want to do PCP again ton induced all the positive feelings and flights of ideas and creativity....

Obviously I've had good experiences to make me come back to it so many times....


Currently I'm at like week 6 of daily use. Prior to this I was using 3meopce daily for a couple weeks maybe longer...


I don't know why I keep returning to these neurotoxic neuro chemistry changing drugs...


How can I help myself?? I've been reading lately....


I know that rehab is only so good. Psych drugs are hit or miss.. healthy food is essential...


I'm so miserable, depressed, anhedonic, no memory, no pleasure, no hope....


I have Medicaid and about $1k.... 


I know I can go to a rehab and eat their unhealthy food and go through programs...


I want to change my life!! I'm so sick of American society and life style...


I know that I need healthy eating, relationships, therapy, so much....


I'm trying my brain hardcore... I have been depressed and suicidal for years....


When I don't use 3meo and kratom I feel so bad and can't pay attention or remember things... When I do use it... I'm lucky to feel good. 


I don't know what to do or where to turn.... Please somebody guide me in the right direction!! I'm so done with life and drugs and hope... 


Where do I go for real help??

Sobriety?  Exercise? Therapy? Rehab? Medication? Meditation? Spirituality?  Philosophy?  Art? Adventure?  


A combination of things can help.  But i think the main thing is reducing your drug use, however you do it - whatever helps get you there.

There is no *one* answer, but there are many things to explore that can help get your head into a better place.

Hey Qihkal, 


   Yeah, unfortunately long term 3-MeO-PCP usage does seem to be unsustainable, particularly at higher dosages. Eventually you likely going to have to let it go.  I'm curious if you think you might be able to start making some of the life changes you recognize as being important to your overall happiness now while you are still using. 


Why not start eating better now. The 3-MeO-PCP may even help with making these changes. It certainly did for me. I noticed when I was using daily that it was no effort to eat healthy foods over foods I craved. As for exercise, why not go for a jog, do some yoga or other form of exercise while you are still using? What's stopping you? What about your usage? Are you redosing throughout the day? Are you taking large doses that leave you incapacitated? Using less and less often actually makes the drug more effective long term for things like depression. As for the kratom, if you are physically dependent on that that is something you need to address and begin a taper to get off of it. If you think you can go without using it, I'd encourage you to do that cause kratom can be very addictive.


To be clear, my advice would be to stop using 3-MeO-PCP, but I encourage you to start making the changes you want to see now while you are still using and begin formulating a plan to get off it. If the 3-MeO-PCP is preventing you from making these life changes you might be taking too much. Just some thoughts; take what's useful and discard the rest. Good luck to you.

Thank you very much for the replies!!! I have so much on my plate between trauma and mental health and drug abuse....


I have $1k... I want to start over... I've done it before... Just hop to a new city and utilize social services like the homeless shelters, group homes, rehabs....  And get a full filling job and give back...


I want to be a part of society and earth... I'm some what informed on healthy eating, psychedelics, therapy, dmt, life....


I have had no direction for so long....


I don't know who to turn to... I like progressive, conscious, clean, eating, well being....


I just want information and resources... I feel so pathetic and have for years... And I've had clean periods and worked....


What do I do with my body and life??


Just stop the drug use and start putting healthy things into me... I'm so lost and confused and have been for years....


I want to be a part of something! I am a good person with good intentions and healthy insight!! 


I just want to start a new path... What is the next step?? Do I taper kratom and 3meo?? Do I cold turkey?? Do I get on mood stabilizers??


I want to help myself... I know that I can't just eat whatever and go to rehab... It takes direction and goals... And specific things like amino acids and what not...


I feel like I've caused so much damage... Is there specific things I can do to help?? Like magnesium or lamictal?? 


Obviously I just cold turkey right?? Why would I taper this class?? 


How do I know about the damage I've done?? My vision while high will be so bad some times.... Like right now... I know it sounds pathetic and stupid but I have been suicidal for years and so much more....


What are the steps I need to take that aren't obvious... Like vitamin B12 or protein... 


What is this choppy vision effect?? Can't see straight... Build up and too large dose?? I know it's pathetic but it happened...


Why do I continue to abuse myself with obvious physical/mental effects...


It's what happened and happened before.... I want change... I always have... I keep returning because I think it will make happy....


Just throw it away and do what?? What do I eat or drink for healing??

I've made the decision to quit using 3-meo-pcp daily because when I just keep getting tempted to use more and more.  I've felt my airways become super constricted, especially after mixing it with 180 mcg LSD today.  I took 30 mg today up my anus(anoose haha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and then went to Burger King and Publix.  Then I took a small amount of preworkout, like 1/10 a scoop so like 20 mg of caffeine and lifted weights.  I played a ton of rainbow six siege.  But that wasn't enough so I took 180 mcg LSD and 30 more mg 3-MEO-PCP up my anus mixed with 30 ml of water, same as usual.  However, I notice when I take too much 3-MEO-PCP or dissociates in general my airways constrict.  I've been playing the roulette too much.  I thought I was going to die several times from taking 3-MEO-PCP; too many to count now.  So I'm going to stop on the regular but I can say that it changed my life for the better.  I've taken it every day since January though... I'm going to stop before I end up in the psych ward...  I'm going to constrict my usage to the weekends.  It alleviated my depression.  But I'm going to stop taking 3-MEO-PCP every day and I suggest everyone else do the same.  Will I do it again one day.  Nah................

Since you asked for some advice I'll throw my 2 cents in, (I've highlighted areas I am referring to).


You've started a new place, etc, etc before but things have fallen back - identify why things have gone astray so you can prevent them occurring again, if you don't know how you keep failing you will keep failing, (I appreciate knowing it is different from changing it). Maybe write yourself a detailed letter about how fucked you feel at the moment so if temptation occurs again or you start to delude yourself that 'this time things will be different' you have your own testimony to counter it. 


Does it have to be in a city? Imho cities lend themselves to ease of access for drugs so a rural setting may be enough to prevent you going out at 3am to score.


You keep saying you want to be part of something - well only you know what moves/motivates you so only you can answer that. I was involved in politics as a young man, (fool), as that stimulated me, when I got older I worked with the homeless. Go and experiment try volunteering at different things and with different groups until you find a fit. Tying in with that and you not knowing who to turn to, what about God? Now before all right minded atheists denounce that last idea many churches offer help for people in recovery, access to paid/voluntary work and access to people who want to help. Could be worth considering, (although religion should be used in moderation).


I don't know what trauma you've faced nor what drugs you've been using but maybe a period of clean living before reaching for mood-stabilisers is called for. Many switch from illicit to prescribed drugs without ever taking time to see if they even need them or if taking them will hamper their recovery, (if you've been a cunt through addiction and substance abuse numbing yourself with antidepressants is less helpful than the initially more painful route of facing up to your cuntiness). Good diet and exercise will help infinitely more than pharmaceuticals and the net is coming own with information in those areas.


Hope some of that is of help. Take care.

Are there any specific supplements or foods to deal with anhedonia and the dopaminergic, serotonin, NMDA, etc... Damage I have done??


I'm thinking I could to go a group home where I can work, eat healthy food, go to groups, take supplements, protein powder, kombucha.... 


I feel like the whole world is designed to bring us down and profit off us with their corn and wheat and domestic meat....


So much hopelessness and anhedonia....

You may not like this answer but what got me out of my depression+anxiety+anhedonia loop was prescription psychiatric medication. Have you explored this option at all?

Damn dude my buddy just tested a batch that wasnt doing anything to me. Said it?s as potent as any batch he has had.


Guess my daily use of a gram + of mxe back in the day for a couple years has finally caught up to me.


Si disappointed. Suppose I will try some IntraMuscular doses . But it literally does nothing to me ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


Deschloroketamine worked fine tho

Ugh, not what I want to hear. I've been on dissos5-6 days out of 7 for the past 3 1/2 years. 


Just recently I went through maybe 3 1/2 grams 3 meo pcp dosing daily for maybe two months. I was probably taking 10mg + a go, and my doses just kept getting hire. This culminated with an oob trip when mixed with o pce and me doing crazy blackout shit. Not too crazy, but crazy enough to scare the shit out of my mom and lead me to even more troubles.


Now all the dissos and psychs are gone, and I am left with weed, a diclaz taper, and kratom. Quitting daily disso and alcohol use. If it wasn't for kratom and riding my bike I wouldn't even want to get out of bed.


6 month long comedown? woooooo another treat.


Also, I think I had bladder problems before. I know I've been to the DR and they diagnosed me with some benign not really treatable shit. The dissos use has been making it worse and worse. Starting about 2 years ago I started taking Olive Leaf Extract daily and that was about the only thing that allowed me to urinate/alleviated the "full bladder" feeling. I will continue to take the Olive Leafe Extract and hope my bladder isn't too fucked.

Wish I understood this one bros, but I just dont get it. Like many here I chose this one because I was looking for something to replace the beloved and forever remembered MXE. Picked up five grams and proceeded with caution...and then not so much caution. I thought I liked it but could never put my finger on why. Two months after dosing daily I realized it was doing nothing for me spiritually besides turning me into a bumbling fool that could not string a basic sentence together without fumbling over the words to save my life. I couldn't follow movies or process the most basic information without forgetting it two seconds later.  Socially I was a wreck. People probably thought I was slow quite literally it was that bad. Could not perform sexually to save my life and didn't care to. Looking back I wonder why I kept going, and wonder if I was manic and just didnt realize it at the time. Delusions of sobriety, eh?


The one time I did enjoy it I mixed it with 1p-LSD and that trip lasted WAY longer than it should have. Ended up having to take a downer to bring myself back to earth. 3-meo-PCP made me depressed in retrospect, quite the opposite of what I was going for or expected.


I still have quite a lot left...maybe I will try again some day. I want to try my 3-meo-pce soon after this nine month disso tolerance break ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I flushed the remaining maybe 500mgs or so my 3meopcp and probably about 3 grams of 3meopce yesterday after realizing it was just driving me into sadness and addiction. Causing more problems then it created. 


Now I'm having hardcore cravings and wondering what am I going to do so I can feel better....


Last use was nearly a year ago and I craved it for the entire year until I got it again....


I don't like this at all... I want to live a life where I don't need drugs to feel good and the cravings to end!!


We have to work together to help ourselves get over the PCP!!


What are we going to do??


I want it so bad!! And it wasn't really making me happy!! This is insane!! I can't believe this is where I'm at again!! It's been years of off and on addiction, rehab twice, I've been depressed for years.... I want to be happy with life! I see a psychiatrist on Wednesday, I'm hoping I can start taking something for the depression and that I can train my brain to realize I don't want a drug that hinders just because it satiates a craving.... I felt bad about myself for using it anyways!! Why must it be like this?!?


And I want it so badddddddd ughhhh... 


But I need to say goodbye, I had to flush the drugs, they weren't really making my life, mind, spirit, or psyche healthy... Perhaps I could have used the 3meopcp in a healthy way... Yeah right!!


So what am I to do now?? I believe I can retrain my brain! I used to crave meth and cannabis and that went away with the 3meopcp used....


90 days of near daily Disso use... and hear I am, a little worse off then before... Craving like a mofo!! And nothing I can do about getting another fix... I won't regret giving it up in the end!!


I'm going to spend some time researching how to curb cravings and try to get my life and mind together...


I really want to have a psychedelic experience as that has helped me rethink my drug use in the past... 


Perhaps I should attend meetings again...


I keep reminding myself I did the right thing... And I keep wanting to search for my stash or order more....


Well I'm glad I'm not the only one who is giving this up right now... I'll report back with how things go and how I am helping myself to retrain my brain that drugs are bad mmmkay??!!


It's for the better!! Even if it seemed like the ultimate drug and stimulant and anxiety reliever, it wasn't!!


Oh man it really was though!!! Ughhhhhhhh!!!! We gotta beat this addiction guys!! Life is truly better on the other side. It feels so much better being a healthy, spiritual member of society than to know in the back of your head that you are on 3meopcp and that it's causing brain chemistry changes, memory issues, cravings, depression, so much negativity!!


So i suppose it's time to find support and once the cravings are gone... Well there's so much more that needs healing too!! Like not having our coping skill of snorting a little to ease anxiety...


Man, I want it so badddddddd!!!

Hey guys I found some good advice from a fellow bluelighter when googling "drug cravings bluelight"... Also I would love to connect with you guys who are going through cravings and giving up this drug or Dissos... Reading this and practicing it helped my cravings diminish significantly in just a few minutes, although they are still kind of there, I feel a lot better and have some hope...


"One of the best tools I learned was to 'play the tape through." Anytime I got urges or cravings I'd simply play the scenario out in my head. So I give into the craving then what? I get high, enjoy it until it wears off, then what? The comedown sucks. Then I start to feel shitty because I screwed up my clean time. I have to tell people I care about that I relapsed and they're all disappointed in me. I get depressed about it, then I have to start with day 1 again.


Once I started doing that exercise I stopped getting urges because all the bad shit it would cause far outweighs the short enjoyable high I would get"

Contrary to others, I've been using dissos almost daily since November, the primary contenders being 3meopcp, DCK, and ketamine.  I feel fine.  Even after abstinence from the chemicals, my body would get itchy for them but they never made me feel bad.  There's no bad comedown for me, just a drift back to sobriety.  DCK gave me a stutter, but I've yet to notice ANY negative effects from my 3-MEO-PCP usage, except when dosing above 50 mg which makes me a little anxious about the stimulation.

Hopefully your lucky streak continues. Maybe it is just personal differences, reasons for using etc, as to why some of us can use responsibly and some can't.


This time around I've been on dissos daily almost every day for 3 1/2 years. 


Years before that it was daily for a year plus.


Years before that it was daily for a year plus.


I have ended up hospitalized, incarcerated (twice), making a complete fool of myself blacked out in front of my family at least 2-3 times. Now dissos weren't the primary cause (always), but i was on them daily all those times. It sucks though, five days after giving my bags to be flushed to a family member after my last blackout episode. I am allready craving them soooo hard. I gave up alcohol (for the 7th time) and dissos five days ago. Still using weed, kratom, and doing my best to keep to a diclazapam taper ( 3 1/2 years of ever increasing daily benzo use. ugh).


I still want dissos sooooo bad. They were always a pick me up to make me get shit done. A little manic edge to counter my pervasive depression. I am supposed to be looking for a job and I can't find the motivation anywhere. Even the very real threat of homelessness. I know if I had a little line of o pce I would be filling out applications, updating my resume, applying to every job I can find on indeed. Trying to sell some shit so I can get that last $1k or so and buy another car, so I can get to the decent jobs.


Instead I'm on bluelight posting about how I want 3 meo pcp after it just caused a major fucked up episode in my life.


wtf guys.

Picked up five grams and proceeded with caution...and then not so much caution. I thought I liked it but could never put my finger on why. Two months after dosing daily I realized it was doing nothing for me spiritually besides turning me into a bumbling fool that could not string a basic sentence together without fumbling over the words to save my life. I couldn't follow movies or process the most basic information without forgetting it two seconds later.  Socially I was a wreck. People probably thought I was slow quite literally it was that bad. Could not perform sexually to save my life and didn't care to. Looking back I wonder why I kept going, and wonder if I was manic and just didnt realize it at the time. Delusions of sobriety, eh?

Yeah 3-MeO is a weird one for sure.  I like it, but it definitely is difficult to pinpoint why sometimes.  When used sparingly it's better.  I like it best for combining with psychedelics, well, specifically LSD/lysergamides.  A little bit of 3-MeO mixed with half a hit of ALD-52 is stronger for me than a whole hit of ALD by far.  Good combo, but very strong.

You're still in your honeymoon stage.  I can almost guarantee that it's affecting you more than you think it is, the 3-MeO anyway, it's such a sneaky drug.  I've known a few people who got into using it a lot, and one of them was one of my best friends, like a sister to me.  It slowly changed her personality so badly, until I could hardly stand her, she was so obnoxious and selfish and needy and fucked up all the time, while believing that she was giving herself vital medicine and that it was making her better.  It also made her incredibly reckless, and eventually she died from injecting heroin laced with fentanyl after not doing opiates for a long time.  There were several factors at work but 3-MeO-PCP had a big part to play in her descent into madness and, eventually, death.  Tread carefully, and do not trust you own thoughts fully if you're using 3-MeO-PCP (or any dissos really but especially that one) daily or near-daily.  They're crazymakers that make you believe they're unlocking the universe for you.  They're also great drugs, if used responsibly, but I've seen it time and time again in real life and on here, that people lose the plot entirely after a while... but it usually takes quite a while.  Longer than since November.  Tread carefully man...

Good luck recovering from all that 3-MeO. Wishing you success. It can take a little while to get on with your life after a long run using it. It's been 8 months since I stopped using dissociatives daily, was using them daily for about a year prior. I haven't totally abstained during this time, but was sober for most of it. Went through 2g of Ketamine, 0.5 g 3-MeO-PCP, 0.5 3-MeO-PCE and a few DXM trips in the last 8 month. Never totally stopped thinking about it. You guys are making me a little nervous with your stories, but I appreciate the reminder. I ordered 4 g of 3-MeO-PCP recently so going to be confronted with that feeling of losing control all over again which becomes an insidious part of the experience after a while and starts to bum the high. On a positive note I pretty much stop using everything else when I use 3-MeO-PCP. No desire to smoke weed, eat unhealthy foods, etc, etc. I lose weight and generally start exercising and doing more activities outside the house, but eventually in spite of those positives, it starts to take its toll eventually and the negatives start to outweigh any positives. If I limit my doses to < 30 mg a day and don't redose I can likely go a long time using this stuff but I know it'll catch up with me eventually.

I'm buzzing so hard.  My whole body but especially my head is buzzing really hard like you do whippits.  I put 30mg 3meopcp up my ass then about 25 more because yolo........... I worked out, took a small amount of preworkout containing about 50mg caffeine then worked out for about 3 hours.  I decided that wasn't enough then I sniffed a line of 30 mg 3-meo-Pcp.  I'm buzzing so hard noww still.  It feels good but bad and my chest is constricted when I breathe.  Goddamn it's great but don't use 3-meo-pcp every day it just gets out of hand.  I still have about 3-4 grams of it but I'ma lay off 3meopcp a bit

I caved and ordered more finally. I'm making three promises to myself, and if anyone cares, to all of you:


I will not use it daily ever again. Two days per week maximum. 


I will only use it at home. What got me in trouble last time was a strong desire to get home combined with the delusion of sobriety.


I will only use it orally. I found nasal dosing started becoming a habit unto itself. This stuff really irritated the inside of my nose too, always a bit of red when I blew my nose. 


I hope that by learning from past mistakes I can utilize 3-meo-pcp safely. Be careful, and show this one lots of respect.

Have any of you guys experienced a whirlwind like sensation of euphoria inside your head on a high dose with no tolerance, similar to how a bunch of N20 whippets would feel?  It was the most lovely sensation I've ever felt besides maybe my DOC, LSD, N20 combo.

Hey everyone who has recently ceased daily use!! 


It's been about 17 days or so since my last use... 


I've continued my kratom habit(and it feels like I have a major tolerance now without the NMDA antagonist present) and have been eating much healthier! 


I also have more hope about my living situation and saw a psychiatrist (nurse practitioner) and basically doubled the strength of my meds(currently at 100mg lamictal and 2mg Intuniv). So I spent the last month of two months using 3meopcp being on 50mg lamictal and 1mg Intuniv.


I feel pretty OK! I now have anxiety that I had before resurfacing.... It's so hard for me not to be twitchy!! But I've always had this problem... The first couple days I was pretty bored, had cravings, depression, a flat feeling... Lately I've been better! I have had some suicidal ideation but I've had that for a long time off and on. I've had some rough days but it's not so bad, probably thanks to kratom. 


I find that (of course) staying busy, socializing, eating properly, and avoiding moments of just thinking(like browse the internet or Facebook instead of laying in bed) are essential for me now.


I have a terrible memory but my slipping up of words isn't so bad lately....


And now that I am reflecting on it, I have spent quite a bit of my sober time being "depressed". Laying in bed all day, not wanting to go outside, avoiding doing the things I should do and waiting until it's nearly too late.


I'm happy to have tossed my doses though because I know I lack self control. The days leading up to my final day had been rather horrible... A lot of depression and suicidal ideation while high. Planning my death and craving self harm. Even had cravings for 3meopcp that were totally insane. 3 hours after a dose I often felt this surge of anxiety and crawling of my skin like I GOTTA HAVE IT!! I believe this was because my adopted coping mechanism for depression, anxiety, cravings, boredem, anything, was to snort a little bump. Or maybe a come down. 


Either way I found the drug, being used daily, to cause a lot of depression while using it. I had periods of non-daily at first that were straight hypomanic... If I only I hadn't used everyday and just took a break, I might have never tossed it and I could be high right now!!! Oh god!!


I believe what caused a lot of the negative effects were the stimulant properties of 3meopcp. About a year ago(May 28th) I had my last use with methamphetamine. My meth abuse was riddled with paranoia and schizo symptoms, even hearing voices without knowing it. I truly believed the neighbors were providing a dialogue of my actions(there he is shooting up again, look at him making food!!)


I had experiences with caffeine causing similar paranoia and dissociation even 6 months post getting completely clean.


So I believe the dopaminergic effects were mostly causing me negative responses to the drug(3meopcp). In that, when meth/cocaine abuse turns into mostly negative effects, a period of abstinence and then return to the drug, quickly leads back to the negative effects(paranoia instead of euphoria).


I kept abusing it, even in high doses and IV regardless of feeling suicidal every night or dealing with bouts of confusion, and a couple catatonic and near hole/or maybe it was hole, doses.


Clearly I have a lot of self destructive behavior.


The night before I tossed both of my 3-meo's I went catatonic from an IV dose. I had done an injection, felt great and dissociative, a little confused, and went ahead and made another shot, probably the same dose.... Made it from the bathroom back to my room and got stuck standing there, feeling... I can't remember these "holes" too well but it was insane in the head. Like I had no idea who I was or what was going on with my life and some other reality takes over... Completely strange although I kind of liked it the few or many times it happened to me. 


If only I didn't abuse this drug to get so damned high so often!! I fucking truly love it! But I can't handle it with the seemingly subtleness of it and all.


Okay such a long post, must be the kratom!? Thank you for reading if you did and... Perhaps 3-ho-pcp will be much safer for me to use ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

The "hole" on this took me to an unformed plane of infinite possibilities and completely new sets of physics, spinning like a giant die, or wheel, giving me glimpses into unknown realities, until it finally landed back here in consensus reality. This only happened twice for me, in reckless combos with mdma and LSD and probably alcohol. Both times I was kind of disappointed that I came back here.

Totally agree Xorxoth, mixing 3meopcp with any type of lysergamides almost turns it into a completely different beast entirely. I have mixed it with 1p-LSD, ALD-52, and ETH-LAD, and every time I do it seems like the trip lasts so much longer for me. Usually I end up aborting the trip after twelve hours because I am ready to come down lol. I wonder why this is?


I haven't used it in about seven or eight months, and I intend to continue this break so that I can reset my tolerance and get my life in full working order. I just weighed out 7 mgs for my fiance because she is dealing with poppy seed withdrawal and is curious to see if the 3meopcp will help her with the lack of energy and temperature disregulation. I will report back to see if it helps her at all. I was somewhat hesitant, but she insisted that she believed it would help her.


The holes experienced on 3meo are certainly difficult to describe, but oddly enjoyable ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

A few years ago when I first started experimenting 3-MeO-PCP I went through about 250mg over the course of a week, the day I ran out I decided to take 1/4 of a 100mcg LSD blotter and it felt so divine I ended up taking the rest. It didn't seem to potentiate it visually, but it made the feeling much more relaxing and spiritual.

I got some bunk x (tested by Ecstasydata.org) containing primarily N-ethyl-pentylone. Is there any reason to suspect that cathinones could be a physically dangerous combination with 3-meo-pcp? And how far apart would I have to space out doses if so?

Does anybody have any insight on repeatedly using high doses of 3-meo-pcp and 3-ho-pcp?


I've holed on both plenty...


I don't know why I keep doing this amount of brain damage to myself...


Any insight would be greatly appreciated....


I often times come to the conclusion "I'm injecting neurotoxins at neurotoxic doses and holing wtf am I doing to my brain"... And flushing and then rebuying.... Over the years...


It's gotta fucking stop dude like why am I doing this to myself?


Not heroin, meth, opiates, benzos.... Because it's so cheap per dose?? I really regret ever discovering RC's and needles.... Like why didn't I follow the nootropric path 6 years ago I was on in college?

I am so glad I stopped taking 3-MEO PCP. Looking back on that period where I used it almost every day is strange. Like some kind of futuristic drunkard who is so intoxicated while remaining relatively functional that he manages to do enough mental gymnastics to convince himself that not only is this addiction not a big deal, it's actually giving him an edge on all the rest of humanity. I would totally do it again in one off experiences, but I like this compound far too much to trust myself with a little stash that I have control over. I'm gonna end up convincing myself I'm some kind of immortal demon who lives through the shells of many men, gaining more knowledge and power over many thousands of years. Again. Seriously the delusions I had made me feel powerful and were wildly entertaining/creative, but if I was a more impulsive or violent person at heart I could have perhaps done something REALLY dark in that head space. Kind of like how alcohol generally leads to violent crime, but not in all individuals, it just has the predisoposition to open up some of your inner darkness, much like many people experience with alcohol and meth.

That sums up my experience pretty well. The rest, not so much. But that first half is kind of insidious in a way. 


I just got a new sample a couple days ago. It ticks off many of the basic checkboxes for 3-meo-pcp, but lacks the magic so far. Hard to explain.

Looking a few pages back, there was speculation about an impure synth with lots of PCC. I am curious if that could be what I got. Is there a way to test this at home? I don't have the cash to send a sample to a lab. Alternatively, is there an easy method to try to remove impurities from my sample?

I might also just be bannanas. I genuinely believed some completely insane shit when I was daily dosing 3-meo. Like being capable of mentally influencing physical objects, guiding the actions of others through telepathy and making contact with demons/satan/dark forces, believing firmly in black magic and the occult as ways to get what I want with no consequences etc.


Back on a more chemical note, this is one of the most moreish compounds I've ever found in a really non traditional sense. Like I wasn't just doing more like "more coke more candy etc" there was always a sophisticated, seemingly logical reason I was dosing each time. Even if it was actually a completely irrational, dumb, risky reason to use it in reality.

I completely identify with this. Like dosing some for the stimulant effect to drive home. Badbadnotgood. But it seemed reasonable at the time.


Pretty sure my current sample is just garbage, super impure. I should take it as a sign that I'm not supposed to have 3-meo-pcp right now.

I've been off this drug for 4 days now.  My longest since January is 5 days.  I still get itches for it all day.  I just itched after typing that sentence and then got another one in my leg while writing this.  However, I will add I haven't noticed any sort of hangover effect.  I still have some visuals especially when I smoke weed.  I'm going to do some more in 3 days.  This drug really stays in your system for a while, but I'll appreciate it more with less tolerance.  Is 7 days enough to clear tolerance out?

If you've been using it heavily for a while, you may have developed long-term tolerance.  7 days is enough for short-term tolerance to clear out but dissociates are famous for producing very long-lasting tolerance when abused, with some people saying they never return all the way to their original sensitivity.  It can certainly take months in any case, but I'm not sure how much you were using.

The amount you've shared about using, woodyfence, it will take weeks to 1-2 months to lower tolerance. Dissociatives in general are bitches to reduce tolerance too once abused, and 3-meo-pcp especially considering how long it stays in your system. Way, way back someone was sharing how someone near to them tested positive for PCP weeks after last using 3-meo-pcp, something ridiculous like 2-4 weeks.

Day five and the visuals still persist.  I started tripping a little harder during work today after I ate lunch.  However, my headspace remains normal so it's not a bother.  Best afterglow of any drug I've ever tried.  The other longest afterglow I've ever had was a week straight with 2C-T-2 (compared to 2-3 days for LSD), and that was great too!

After a seven day break, I took a hit of abnormally high dosed LSD and 33 mg of 3-MEO-PCE.  I came down a little after 6 hours, so I took 24 mg of 3-MEO-PCP.  I came down again in about 4 hours or so, so I took about 65 mg of 3-MEO-PCP up my anus and had an experience very similar to a K-hole when I lay down in bed feeling overwhelmed.  There were very intense open and closed eye visuals, and when I closed my eyes I could imagine anything I wanted in such beautiful detail.  I thought I was a goner for a little bit during the comeup but overall the experience was fantastic.

What would you guys say is the main difference between: 3-MEO-PCP and 3-HO-PCP, 3-MEO-PCE, O-PCE are?


I am looking for something as euphoric, as energetic, with the same clear headed-ness & amazing creativity. Ideally as potent, with the small doses. But I have only tried 3-MEO-PCP. 


I have previously had addiction issues, but read that LSD and other psychedelics can help cure addiction. Anyway my friend gave me a tab which I did not think would be that strong. It was the strongest trip I have ever had and after it my addiction is gone! It is so weird, the compulsion to redose just disappeared in one uncomfortable trip. Can't be more thankful!


So now I can have stuff in my room and not be compelled to have it all until it's done - phew!

I never believed these insane doses people were posting til I got my current batch (suspected PCC batch). 30mg of the good stuff in one dose would have annihilated me but this shit doesn't get me anywhere near where 15mg or so would have got me at my peak usage and tolerance.

A tiny bit unrealted but I was just reading about how 3 days fasting regenerates your entire immune system, link below, I wonder if it can also help with receptor recovery? I know that ketosis already causes your body to produce a similar drug to GBH, makes you feel really euphoric. I just finished over 24 hour fast about a week ago and it's incredible the amount of energy I have. I think 3 day fasting combined with sensory deprivation (float tanks) should really be where we put our energy. Our bodies can heal themselves and we can get high, naturally. Sustained 3-MEO-PCP use in particular is incredibly dangerous. I am glad the last few pages have highlighted this.

I wouldn't recommend fasting; eating is a biological function meant to be done every day by humans.  If I take drugs without eating I'll usually get nauseous because of a sped up metabolism.  3-MeO-PCP doesn't diminish my appetite. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

For sure, when fasting our bodies start metabolising cells to conserve energy. The wonders of our biological intelligence stepping in, the body starts by killing old, broken, malfunctioning senescent cells. Then when we start eating again we get new stem cells = renewed immune system. Makes sense when you think about it... we were not eating 3 meals a day in the wild. Likely not eating at all during periods of migration etc. Overeating stresses our system. Calorie restriction is proven to prolong life. I can almost guarantee the 2500 cals a day is about to go out the window.


Indeed you are probably right about the receptor tolerance. I wonder if Iboga would do it... I know it allows heroin addicts to avoid withdrawals completely because of some sort of brain cell growth or similar [https://www.theguardian.com/society...ction-treatment-gabon-withdrawal-danger-death](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/10/ibogaine-heroin-addiction-treatment-gabon-withdrawal-danger-death) I don't know the extent of it but I remember it blowing my mind.

I can absolutely guarantee that what you got that you took 100mg of is not 3-MeO-PCP.  If DCK works for you, 100mg of 3-MeO-PCP would have you going insane.  There are some bad batches going around.  Hopefully you don't have the one contaminated with PCC as PCC is quite toxic and you'd be ingesting ~50mg of it, which would be very dangerous.  I've also heard of batches that are just bogus and aren't 3-MeO at all.

If it had been the PCC contaminated, it?s still like half real 3-meo and it would have been like taking 50mg.

That's weird as fuck.  How much DCK do you take?  I've never heard of anyone having *that* much tolerance that 100mg of 3-MeO-PCP would do nothing.


And what I was saying was that I know of a batch from last year that didn't seem to be 3-MeO-PCP at all... a friend got a bunch and was taking 50mg and feeling nothing.

Man, based on that study that looked at daily ket users where they were using grams daily, and had lesions all over the place (it's somewhere in the neuro-pharma board), then I'd imagine that daily MXE use can't be too good for overall brain health either.

I can enjoy medium doses of 3meo-pcp ( 15mg is getting high for me in a single dose. Many 10 mg trips taken. I eventually settled and preferred the 2mg plus 2mg type approach after more experience) and 50mg plus top ups of mxe... but 20mg of dck has incredible to me. I had to reduce the dose.


Put it this was, at 14mg, i could still have a deep understanding of the existence of a sponge.

Not sure why but i was very susceptible to dck versus any other dissociative type drug if tried. ( been several!)

Well...Im back. Not sure if I'm appreciated or hated at this point-So I'll just relay information.


3-MeO-PCP always varied so much batch to batch for me that it wasn't and hasn't remained a compound of interest for me. The quality of the synthesis makes the experience. The first gram I tried-I was very kindly gifted by an awesome vendor-That was the only batch I ever tried that I consider TRUE 3-MeO, it kicked in gradually starting with cocaine+psychedelic stimulation that around the 2-3 hour mark would become extremely visual for an intense amount of time that I cannot estimate as its been years. I distinctly remember it being powerful enough that when it fully came on I would have to lay down and relax because of the intensity-it was quite pleasant tho, you just had to be prepared. No other batches I tried gave me the same or even similar effects. More just mild stimulation followed by my head feeling like a mettalic balloon. 3-MeO tended to make me depressed after stopping use and even sometimes while using. For me-it lacked the anti-depressant nature of MXE or analogues that have Ketamine related structure. Brain chemistry is so unique and interesting. Any thoughts or comparisons?


I got myself arrested for disorderly conduct while trying to apply for a job. Life and our current society is a strange brew...I appreciate good friends, but can't find any. I give anything and everything I can to those around me-and instead of support,I'm met with ridicule and disrespect. People in general are really starting to frustrate me...I love and live for Art and to write Music,Poems...just to create something interesting...but where I live-The Humans are too fucking stubborn and ignorant to actually help each other. I really just want to Travel and get the fuck out of this Cowtown. I'm seriously over egotistical women who think they run this planet and time period. I'm a very empathetic man-but where I live,the social scene is legit killing me. I'm an Artists kinda Artist...and these mother fuckers just want some copy and paste bullshit. I'm ready to get away.


I have a fractured shoulder, in a pain pill state-am an ex opiate veteran...and I'm still 2+ years clean thanks to the Self Control that 2-Oxo-PCE has given me. It doesnt kill the pain,but it helps a lot and i dont know if cannabis would be enough. Even edibles. Its fucked. Its an amazing compound,but its such a tight rope walk...A little too much and the disassociation kicks in intensely and uncontrollably. Multiple times now I've forgot entirely where I was and what was happening around me. Luckily for humanity near me, I'm not an evil fuck...I have my issues and downfalls as a person,but even in the deepest states of uncontrolled disassociated consciousness, I don't hurt people, or bother anyone...I just stare off into space and smile. I'm getting fed up with people treating Dust Heads like they aren't equivalent psychonauts. I respect each category of the psychedelic mind like separate clans or foundations. Why is it ok to micro dose LSD daily but not discos? Shits fascist as fuck. Do Humans just want to discriminate until the end of time? What the fuck is our species thinking right now? I have a strong feeling it. O-PCE works on delta receptors...just speculation but something unique is going on with this compound.

Sorry for the rant. Its been a long summer. I'm going to get my money right and travel. Our planet is beautiful right now-but human attitudes and lack of supporting one another is ruining our social beauty. I get high because people refuse to let me be who I am,no matter what I am. If I'm going to be alone-Im staying high as fuck...and honestly-Id rather have a peaceful road on my own, than a disrespectful road with judgemental egos. I'm a very unhappy creature currently. I feel like I could help so many people thru art and conversation, as well as possibly the psychedelic community with my experience...but people are genuinely making me question if Humans as a whole have the value they think they do. I'm not seeing it where I live. I need to fucking move or people need to be nicer to each other.

Is taking Dissocatives a bad idea? Probably, but I need to kill the pain caused by ingesting too much 2'-oxo-PCE and stumbling over some chair in my flat that caused me to hurt my left quadriceps badly, so the 100 doses of 3-MeO-PCP come in handy (amd of course I want to take the pleasant sides of dissociatives).

Apologies if this is too close to "sourcing", but does anyone know if good 3-meo-pcp is still being produced, or are we still on the pcc-contaminated stuff?

So I dumped my 3-meo-pcp down the toilet again. I feel much more secure in my decision this time. I feel like I got rid of it in time to keep myself from going in over my head.


The most insidious aspect if this drug is that it is uninteresting at lower doses, and my natural instinct is to throw out the entire harm reduction manual and push it further until it does get crazy.

I did some of this tonight, it's been a good long while on account of drug testing, but I passed one and shouldn't have another for a few weeks.  Good stuff, especially if you only do it once in a while. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

1. (skip to 2. for instant help/answers...)


Hi fellow Bluelighters, dear Community, or to put ?it? in more, no, the MOST, absolute and correct Words, the honest ones and the only truth existing, so...


...to all of you, a very few (specifically informed beyond what words can express) ?Friends?, and the Rest of you BL?ers, spread all over the Planet and (how cool!) connected trough this awesome Forum, of which each and everyone must have heard one of, as there?s more to it than meets the eye, with it?s indefinite knowledge that?s (especially when put in Context to more unknown, ?exotic? Chemicals,) worth a fortune for Chemists, Medicine etc.: i.e. the ?Bluelight Forum?, that?s known almost everywhere, and (contextually seen making total sense) even found being mentioned in a extremely informative, well written and  interesting Book, that I?m just reading atm (by Mike Power btw.)! Whatever...


This is, as here?s, where?s the most honest and crazy, just as correct as reliable answers were to be given/found - if you are like me, a Genius/Maniac/Lowlife/No one, a whatever you wanna be,...BUT with sum kinda intellect, intelligence AND serious interest in finding/spreading new as well as old (...always 100% top notch!) and well-backed up, documented and useful Information, News, the TRUTH when the very first thing is being focused on Safer Use and Harm Reduction, find help and wanna help as much as you can do get/got by others!


That?s all,...so far - ...as Prologue!


These are honest things I had the urge to write, not only just because after longer time no-posting or if, posting mostly just unusually worthless bullshit (not the usual, old THCified-stuff what?s why I once registered here),...but more as these were things I never read and often thought to myself, are like that and by that, important to let y?all know!z


BL, were/is and always will be something, personally, very important, not just, but highly, unbelievable highly, influenced by the fact, that COMPLETE STRANGERS really did helped me, MANY, MANY, yeah, honestly really A DAMN LOT OF TIMES, in countless ways im- and possible, and with me doing ?my part/homework? (I thought for myself, too!), PROVIDED ME WITH ABSOLUTE 100% ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE, wherever it?s needed - making me a proper, very-well-function Specialist without degree, sum (but mostly me) proud and even Medicinal highly specialised Personnel, mostly to Fiends, as they were too educated believing a No one, even admitted (before kicking my Ass outta the Door!) that I?m better educated than them - UN-FUCKING-FLYING-BELIEVEABLE, then,...nowadays I wouldn?t wanna waste time with dumbfucks as back then!


It?s healthier!


Ah, and I was only honestly interested in doing no harm to myself (or worse, others!), learning and the like,...if I?m not high as a kite, i.e. browsing around in search to find sum extraordinary (sadly as mostly just ugly as fuck) Nudes of even more drugged-up, ?higher? Members, seemingly lost all senses and whatnot, while on (...well at least hopefully, a boatload of damn good Drugs?).


2.


I am trying finding the shortest possible route to make you fully understand me and so gimme the help I NEED and am accustomed to, ok?


I was active mostly during the time, MXE was easy to acquire and so not only found it (well, Dissociatives in common but MXE specifically) to be my DOC (still do) but even though having had highly potent and rare Methoxmetamine during these days (MXM/MMXE) and truly appreciated, no, absolutely loved, them and still do, if Quality is the same (had none for years,...so?!?), i.e. 3-MeO-PCP as well as 3-MeO-PCE, I?ve never found something that replaced it, not even somehow...


I was really blessed, REALLY, I must admit, as i only had access to the famous, THE BEST (godly precious) Synth, most may know as the ?Indian? - Documents speak for themselves, so THIS was the best one ever made (just read trough the Megathreads and you surely will trust/believe me).


So, even if people later on said, O-PCE is almost like MXE (I tested it, too - a said-to-be potent/pure Batch..., and was honestly shaken to the core, hard words after just one-time-sampling it, but hell,... I speak for the fact, that what I heard was it?s NOTHING in comparison), they had a different approach to the whole Compound MXE I know, a totally different place to start/judge from..., you understand?


So to make it more understandable: while others were at their known but beloved local sea (perhaps new Design, I think you got the point?), I, for myself, was in French Polynesia, Haiti, Hawaii... and this ALL THE FRIGGIN? TIME - enjoyed the really oh-so holy, priceless, indescribable Indian Synth (sidenote: I also plugged 98% of my stash), and bad times meant that ?piggy-me? was curious and for the sake of Science, of course, did sometimes experimenting with the somewhat not as beloved (by myself), different, but still second darn best known Stuff ppl know of: 

the Batch that?s originally originated in China, so I only ever had the Pre-Ban Batches! 


Others I tested just outta interest, to get what ppl meant about mine being THE SHIT - and they were right, bcuz even from most reputable Sources provided, all of the Synths made wherever God knows, those floating around after the UK-Ban until EU-Ban, were at best something to get a feel what ?real? MXE felt like...a slight one!


I am well aware of that all sounding like the usual, Archetypal kinda Dick-sizing-stuff, from times when Alpha-Males were ruling and we were more Animals than Humans, it does...I know - I?m sure,...but I had found the Grail during the Moment it was available, I was not at the right place at the right time, I was perhaps also the luckiest Guy alive (or one of them)... The fun-Part is me knowing almost nothing, having had NOT A SINGLE experience with Dissos, I just followed sum instinct, a direction of which i decided, felt good, and I was not disappointed with my decision...


So, to end this: I love MXE the most because of it being just the best Disso of all those I ever tried - the most well-balanced! 


It had the push and power of 3-MeO-PCP, but wasn?t too sterile, it had the fun of 3-MeO-PCE, but not it?s seriousness and besides feeling way friendly/warmer than Ketamine, there?s even more and something to it, not even the next best, nearest ever possible Compound I can imagine, MXM, had - and those were almost identical,...


...but why a Ferrari when you can travel with a Jet?


This Weekend I was blessed, having some Ketamine Ampules, which I also changed my mind some time before about BIG TIME, but this time: WOAH-BANGER!


Holy-Guacamole!!!


I did again, and while growing older, knew now that intramuscular Injection is too easy to be true, had nothing to spare (stuff is harder to get here than anything else!), I thought: ?Fuck it!? and did two Milliliter injections per Deltoid...


...and enjoyed the best Rush, including feelings ever felt AND had the best days afterwards! It was the A-Bomb and I ask myself now, what would be Indian MXE (onset via plugged Route est. 20 secs.) intramuscularly injected - it must be something indescribable godly, as I could think...?


I am stunned! ...from the Ket IM-Experiences, the strong antidepressant (after-)effects just as it?s possibilities to annihilate my sometimes BADASS back pain completely (I?m legitimately prescribed Hydromorphone for that specific reason, which is a godsend, but K I found a darn lot better), let oneself drift off, from the people, world, oneself, never slept better than during these days - in fact, I was sleeping like a newborn, just a lot better and and and...


What?s still available on the Net, sold at RC-Vendor-Sites, that?s on par with Ketamine, or something seriously in between MXE and K? I know ppl already know, so I ask for serious help but will do my read/work in this regard, ofc, too, I promise - but I need serious and proper help! ...and I know this is the most reliable source for what I?m looking for, if nothing?s changed - which I absolutely cannot believe in, did happen,...correct?


So fuckin? what...? Thanks to all...


THCified aka. MXEfied, the Disso-Man!

fuck you I want some MXE :-(


If you could still find DCK I'd say try that, but it seems to have dissapeared.


Honestly, I'd take ketamine over any of the rc dissos out right now, as far as being able to hole and whatnot. The rest all have some use, but are nothing like mxe in the end (imo)

This thread has been pretty quiet for a long time. Is 3meo still available like a few years ago? Did everyone have enough already? This thread used to be pretty manic. I haven't touched it in almost 2 years after it got me in serious trouble.

It's still around.  I think people are past the honeymoon stage.  I still have some, I did a small amount after a long break recently and found I wasn't really into it.  I have a good friend who used to do it almost daily who just doesn't really like it anymore.

It can be magic, but likewise - i kinda got bored of it.  


Which is fine by me, frankly. It means i'm not just compulsively gobbling my stash. Some dissos are nice to just have on hand i reckon.  From time to time it feels right i suppose, and personally i don't feel that heavy dissociative use is healthy or safe, so i like being able to take it or leave it, because i don't know too many people that still have a stash of MXE, for example.

I went through like 3 (maybe 4) gramss of 3 meo pcp between like early feb and maybe mid may of this year. There was o pce mixed in on and off. Culminating in quiting my job because I wanted to fight my manager (300# dude stepped up to me like we were about to street fight) and then two other idiots who said I was a pussy white boy and wouldn't do shit. I just said fuck it and went home before I ended up in jail. I think I was on my 2nd 4 loko of the day and probably 40-50mg 3 meo pcp deep. 


Like the next night  I got pissed off about something, railed who knows how much 3 meo pcp and o pce, woke up like 10 hours later in my moms bed  remember bits and pieces, she was crying and shit showing me videos of being blacked out raving about all types of shit. Ended up dumping my whole stash of everything later because I felt bad. 


I can't even say that's the first time something like that has happened with psychs or dissos.


Man I had like 5-6 g's of MXE around april 2017. I was only going to use it for comboing with psychs for tripping. Got fucking swatted in may of 2017. Lost my mind, sniffed all the mxe until it was gone just so I wouldn't kill myself. On one hand all my mxe is gone, on the other I reallllllllllly wanted to kill myself . Something about cops screaming "we'll fucking kill you" while putting guns on you kinda sucks.

I ended up 2 or 3 times on hospital because of 3-meo-pcp last year. Last one was a hardcore one, and I saw myself walking back from hospital on my bare feet without a phone or keys. 

That was something that made me reconsider my lifestyle.


Since then I destroyed my disso stash and I'm arround 10 months clean from them ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Me and dissos had a good time, but I supose nothing lasts forever. There is no fun in chasing the dragon.

I enjoyed a few grams, it was addictive early on.

In my later uses i really couldnt see the appeal- its magic wore off i guess ?


I have none left but dont mind. Mxe on the other hand, i wish i could find more again. Even dck would be fun to lay with again.

Flushed my 3meo over a month ago. Full story's a couple pages back but basically I felt a malevolence from it that I hadn't previously. I was using it to cope with depression and thankfully it actually seems to have worked. I just don't need another 6 month run of near daily dosing resulting in an additional felony.

Well, if you wanna get in the game, sure! You could also just be the Prize Moderator instead, doesn't sound like much fun though. Psychotic blackouts are what all the cool kids are into nowadays!

I did waaaay too much while being high on a shitload of various Cathinones in a fuckin' Hospital for some weeks - God, even though I have no idea what happened, no recollection of the evening, but it must've look crazy, my whole acting n' shit... Hospital personnel told me they have never seen somebody going crazy that much, that hard... only thing I remember is me falling off a bed and wasn't able to get back up, rollin' round on the floor ?

I'm still working on my 3 gram bag from 3-4 years ago and still haven't opened up my other 3 gram bag to the elements. I don't think I ever will at this point. I was toying with it recently for tolerance reduction purposes and for depression/anxiety but realized I don't even want to use as many stimulants as I have been daily and cut it back to a few times a week instead. The depression remedying power isn't very predictable either, 3-MEO-PCP can switch it on worse it seems depending on factors I still haven't pinned down, sometimes it works like a magic bullet still though. 


I guess I have less tolerance for the mental brain fog and loss of critical thinking skills and my poverty of language then I used to. When I take it now I can't wait for the actual experience to end so I can get back my mental faculties and hopefully feel a little less depressed for a while and whatnot. It has amazing properties but they just aren't refined and it has such a long half-life. It has helped me kick addiction to nicotine with no cravings and I have tested this the few times I slipped up and it works for that really well, possibly due to its NAChR agonist properties and it's length of duration. It helps sometimes re-start my mind in a bad cycle of depression and anxiety but my IQ takes too much of a hit. I'm going back to College soon to take another career path and I can't be taking anything that disrupts my IQ so severely for so long. 


I also want to say that the anti-depressant actions of 3-MEO-PCP might be more related to a hypomanic afterglow than any kind of pharmacological mechanism. I have found compounds such as O-PCE to have a more long-lasting anti-depressant effect similar to ketamine long after any mania/hypomania has died off. I wish they had ketamine clinics in this country like the U.S., I'm thinking of just doing ketamine therapy the DIY way as I have never given ketamine a fair shake due to its price difference, but it seems to have the shortest duration of impairment and the strongest anti-depressant effects. I finally took the time to secure myself with some decent OPSEC so I'm not as intimidated to explore the onion patches.

Anymore, it doesn’t do anything in normal doses. In higher doses, say, 40/50mg+, I just fall on my face if I try to walk. No real high.


I did take a lot of methoxetamine back 6,7,8 years ago. Like a gram a day.


Other arylcyclohexylamines did work for a while after the mxe ended,  but the tolerance set in within a couple years.

The gait?  Do you mean the ability to walk straight?  If so, 3-MeO-PCP messes with my gait about the least of any disso I've tried.

Yeah except when I snorted like 20mg on top of 10mg or something, my muscles felt so weak I couldn't get out of bed 

But normal doses don't impair motor skills much. No robowalk

pretty sure there is a brand new batch going around, coming from the NL which is very pure, and of the more sedating/psychedelic isomer. Anyway I know I am late to the game but I had a very tranquil serene, and beautiful experience with this the other day. Once I was peaking on 9mg I insufflated 70mg 2f-dck. These synergize so well, I am surprised I dont hear more people doing it. I highly recommend. Also took a good bong snap and after that i holed. I feel this is a great way to get the most out of both compounds though I am posting in this thread because I feel the 3-meo was the major player. What an amazing chemical!!! I definitely get re-dose cravings on the comedown, but am able to ignore them. Volumetric dosing has allowed me to be very careful with this stuff

Hey guys,

Im new at 3-MeO-PCP and dont know what to think of it.

My package from NL arrived 2 days ago as a bownish/beige powder.

On my first trial I insufflated 3mg and had only minor effects. Then I snorted in total 10mg 3-MeO-PCP over 2 hours (13mg in my system in total). It was very calm and chill, but nothing special. No alternate thougts or strong euphoria. Then I intended to lay down and chill with it with music. I slept it.


The next day I dose 10mg oral and after an half hour another 5mg. I laid down with music and this was where the funny things happened. I got this typic disso floaty euphoric feeling with alternate music appreciation and weak visuals. Thats what I like about dissos. So I dosed another 5mg to bring this on another level and laid down. After a few minutes I slept in....

I was a little bit sad because I overslept the effect so I dosed in the evening again till 20mg over the course of 2 hours. But nothing special, I didnt know why so many people are loving this substance. I remembered that this substance should make someone manic so I stand up and actend intentionally manic. I fighted an invisible man and said "Im the best". But this was pretty meh, I dont like this feeling of staying above people and not even a hint of euphoria was felt. So I sit down on my desk again.

Somehow I got the idea to write and essay about something, this essay would be the best shit ever. So I took a paper and started to write..... but my handwriting looked like that from someone who is writing the first time of his life. The only words I was able to write were "waddup.....what the hell.....manic.....it will be over". So I put it down and was very dissapointed from the substance and just chilled and surfed the internet.

After the effect died out, I felt normal. Too normal. I felt emotionless like a robot. I went to my temporary job and just did my work. I didnt seek conversations with my people, I not even felt the heartwarming rave as I saw beautiful girl. I felt no love, no joy, no anxiety, no hate. I only did my job with pokerface. My thoughts were only reduced to analytical things regarding the moment. Full robot. I was fully in the present like an advanced monk but without joy.


So what is the fuss about the best drug ever one taken? Coke like euphoria, analytical introperspective thinking and enjoy every moment at this drug? Am I only not the type of person of it or is my dosing not right?

I want give this substance only this weekend a chance and then I will go on with my normal life again. Anyone advice about set, setting and dosing?

For me, the effects of 3-MeO-PCP were sometimes good and sometimes weird.  The first handful of times I did it, I felt robotic and weird and I didn't like it.  When I started doing it more often, I started to like it and I went through a period where it made me feel great euphoria and hypomania, and then after about a year and a half, it stopped doing that almost ever.  Last few times I've tried it, the magic seemed to have passed.  The way I used to get the "coke-like euphoria" (not actually like coke, but sort of similar) was to snort like 2-3mg bumps, separated by an hour or so, 4 or 5 times throughout the day, to very slowly build the effects.  I never liked big doses (20mg is a big dose), I just found them kind of weird.

I'll get me some of this lovely Molecule (along with 2-FDCK) very soon, after a long time without having used it -...and Boy, I'm so looking forward to use it again! It's the most therapeutic ACH I've ever had, as it's (with the correct dose taken) very clean, sterile/clinical in the terms of how it's headspace can be described, but offers a enormous amount of various things it changes, from how one's subjectively feels, thinks and "works" - and by works I can honestly say there's no other Chem giving One such endless energy, as this one! I remember the days I went to Gym on a daily basis and every damn time I had ingested sum 3-MeO-PCP the same day, I was able to get the very best out of me, which means, it made me physically much more strengthened, while, at the same time, I was mentally completely "Zen" and "with me"... perhaps someone can relate!


I'm looking forward to see how batches nowadays turn out to be, as I had sum 3-MeO-PCE two times this year (same Batch) and that stuff was clean af! ...so I think this one won't look much differently, which is absolutely awesome (even though I don't remember having had a single bad batch in the years I was more into that stuff...and MXE, which I miss so darn much!).

As far as I know there's been bad batches going around for a while now with this one. It sounds like CloutGott got an at least minorly mediocre one.

I heard such things in the past and found it unfortunate to hear/see this, but when

I use one I know I can trust my source, and I am sure that they'll deliver only the finest of what sum shady Lab put into

mass-production, I'd be surprised if anything else happens... - but you'll never know, as everything is possible, which is sad but fact, and I have that in mind, which all the time saved me from shite happening to me, a good thing at least!


I'll leave a short notice how I found my Batch to be, especially when compared to HcL/HbR-Batches of all the various sources I used a long time back in the past, which were good every time afaik and remember...what catches me most and is the main reason I must continue experimenting with stuff outta this Class, is that it proved to be a way out of psychotic behavior and stuff that's related to being psychotic, since I've two times completely erased symptoms of that behavior completely, for a prolonged time, which is surely nothing that's solely relevant for myself -  but as i think, a reaction from being depersonalization, a more way more positive headspace and feeling, mentally as physically!


Stuff like Haloperidol is the devil, it is the best worst of the worst ever, and I have a deep antipathy against all the related Compounds of the Neuroleptic-Class of Chemicals - they're poison to the brain...the body...our organism in each aspect possible! I hate 'em...

For a good year and a half I thought 3-MeO-PCP was the greatest drug ever, suitable for daily use of small dosages.  Then suddenly the spell broke and I've never had that same sort of effect from it again, even from the same batch I had from before the spell broke.  Now I find it edgy and crazy-making.  I've never gone nuts on it (or on anything) but this is the closest I've come to going nuts on anything.  It's rather insidious in that it gets right inside your thought process and alters it substantially without you realizing it.  All dissos are very prone to delusion, actually.  But this one takes the cake (well, I've never tried plain PCP).

Ive heard the "weirdness" of this one comes out with daily use. I have put off trying it but plan on making a volumetric solution-is 5 mg a good starting point orally?

Then suddenly the spell broke and I've never had that same sort of effect from it again, even from the same batch I had from before the spell broke.  Now I find it edgy and crazy-making.  I've never gone nuts on it (or on anything) but this is the closest I've come to going nuts on anything.  It's rather insidious in that it gets right inside your thought process and alters it substantially without you realizing it.  All dissos are very prone to delusion, actually.  But this one takes the cake (well, I've never tried plain PCP).

It's obviously something to consider and act in a way to prevent this, that's why acting and thinking logically, reading and reading and reading exactly as much as  collecting as much information as possible, compare other ppls experiences/findings, reduce the risk and harm by doing so, is the most important thing, when experimenting... - especially when researching highly potent "stuff" like sum of the most powerful and indescribably awesome/lovely/...and by ("mainstream"-)people, underrated and misunderstood chemicals ever-fkn-ever!


I know, that sounds not as it's meant to be,...so no offense ppl, k?!

Hello guys. This week I tried this subtance for first time and I was pretty dissapointed for it´s effects. Not for it´s *type *of effects, which i found interesting, but rather for the weak subtle nature of it. I was informed that this substance is pretty potent, but I have 0 tolerance with dissociatives and I dosed, at least, 10mg and I found effects pretty subtle. Also pretty short-lasting (Oral roa)


I am aware delusions of sobriety it´s a common thing for this one but I wanted to make sure this wouln´t be a bad dangerous batch like the one detected where pcc was in it, right? Should I send the sample to analisis or if it hasn´t kill me then it was just me or maybe my scale is fucked? (though I calibrated it just 5 minutes before weighting the substance!)

I would send this off for analysis and not take anymore.  3-MeO-PCP is potent enough that even 1-2mg produces effects.  There was a bad batch going around that was contaminated with PCC and was quite weak so that is a concern, or else it could be an unscrupulous vendor passing off who-knows-what as 3-MeO-PCP.  If you can't send it off to get tested, then I'd pitch it... it's not worth the risk.  This is a very potent drug.

^^ For me around 15mg there was a pretty sheer cliff edge where the effects went from what could maybe be described as "mild", but quite enjoyable, socially lubricating, etc, to questioning the nature of my existence and reality pretty quickly.


That said I never experienced any hallucinations, visuals, significant physical impairment or anything like that, so if thats the kind of thing youre expecting you might be (possibly unpleasantly) surprised. The effects were pure headfuck. I never went higher than 15mg because my experience at that dose was so harrowing.

Thanks for the fast reply! I posted this on reddit and nearly all people said it was just because that dose is pretty "low" or either because my scale could be wrong. Either way if the scale was the reason then the dose is not "low", what is true lol? I find so misleading the dose information regarding this subtance... 

I mean it might have been that I was expecting something more "mindfuck" but still if you say 1-2mg produces effects then i´m definetely going to play it safe and throw it away. For my intented use I´m going to spend more in getting an analysis than getting another batch for a more reputable vendor lol.


Although I´m always going to be curious about if i was right or wrong lol, idk if I send it i´ll be sure to update here the results. Thanks for the reply.

I see, your explanation could be the reason maybe although I´m yet suspicious because I think I wasn´t far from 15mg and I didn´t get at all into confusion or impairing headspace.

^  Does the 3-meo-pcp that you have smell and taste quite horrible?  I think I have the same one and I'm also suspicious that it's not 3-meo-pcp or it's heavily contaminated.


In February 2018 I ordered 5grs and took it almost daily in small amounts.  My preferred way is insufflating 5mg, and after a few hours 2-3mg more, maybe 4 times in total during the day.  That way it's a very functional chemical, awesome for motivation, mood, social situations, etc.  I haven't noticed any serious side effects from daily dosing that way for more than a year. A couple of weeks ago I finished that first stash and except maybe a bit of anhedonia, didn't experience withdrawals or other problems. That batch didn't have a strong smell, when insufflated the drip didn't taste bad (it was even pleasant). The effects were strong and what they should be for 3-meo-pcp.


Once I ran out I ordered another 5gr from the same vendor on 4/18 but this time the batch is horrible. Super strong nasty smell that makes it difficult to insuflate, it's more powdery and it sticks to the glass vials where I store it (the previous batch didn't stick, was a bit more cristalline but still a powder, both are pure white).  The effects are... almost non existant in the amounts I was taking it.  Since I've read about the PCC batch I don't want to test higher ammounts.  


I just contacted the vendor and they told me that they don't have any complains logged for than product.  They have analysis for the batch that they are selling right now, dated 4/23 stating that it is indeed 3-meo-pcp but it is a new batch.  They don't have analysis for the batch I ordered on 4/18 and suggested me to send it to a testing service. 


I've ordered again from the supposedly new batch so I will let you now if it's the same stuff. They cannot confirm if it's a different batch since it's the same supplier, (they told me which one) who they say it is trusted and good quality.


I will post back here once I get it but I'm afraid that you have the same batch I do. And I'm 100% sure that it's not pure 3-meo-pcp.  When did you ordered it?

I just got my first taste of 3-meo-pcp. Took an allergy test and currently waiting. I expected it to smell like plastic like diphenidine. I should wait for an hour or so probably. Feel little stimulated already.

Should you always take it orally?

I like it orally and nasally, nasally it's more stimulating but it's a pretty good ROA.  Oral is generally the best/most full effect/well-rounded with arylcyclophexylamines, except for ketamine.  3-MeO-PCP and the -phenidines are totally unrelated chemicals, other than the fact that they both are dissociatives.

3-meo-pcp is the best nasally imo. take 2-5mg doses throughout the night and enjoy. If you intend to take only one dose, maybe then take it orally. But I think I never took only one dose of 3-meo-pcp a  day.

Like I said above I tried and eventually took all of it in 2 weeks. Quantity was 500 mg.

I chose this chemical to get rid of my opioid dependency (buprenorphine). It worked like a miracle. No WDs at all.

Dissociatives are the best cure for substance dependency (I'm not very serious here). People don't really know this I think.


3-meo-pcp was a weird experience. Mania like stimulation. Pressure inside my body, like my blood pressure was really high.

Because of my tolerance to dissos, there was little sedation. Only on really high doses. I took it nasally. Burns like hell.

It does burn quite a bit.  Also yeah it really is not sedating at all, that wasn't just because of your tolerance to dissos.  It's a stimulating disso.  Very strange drug.  It' pretty insidious really but for about a year and a half I thought it was the bee's knees.  A good friend of mine was injecting shit tons every day and it was making her absolutely fucking bonkers, it was awful, but she was absolutely convinced it was solving every problem she had (hint: it was making it all worse).

I have done it a number of times, just keep the doses low.  I like the combo better than either alone.  But definitely be careful as it's quite strong.

Recently had a white fluffy batch that didn’t seem to do anything even in doses upwards of 40mg.


Are there any good batches around? Doesn’t seem to be my tolerance; the hydroxy derivative works fine

Hey guys, 

I want to take about 12mg oral (with tolerance) 3-meo-pcp at a rave. I plan to have a 6 hours long high, so how much should I redose and how long to wait after first dose to just prolong the effects without rising it?

It lasts for 8 hours or so from a single dose, especially orally, so you won't have to redose.

Yeah, from experience less is more for these sort of settings. From 1 dose you have a great energetic afterglow, a redose makes it more messy and it isn't as good.


1 dose you wouldn't feel as much by the end anymore but you'd still be stimulated and have some remnant mania.

I always did 3-MeO-PCE but 3-MeO-PCP might be even better for raves, underrated dancing drug ime.

3-MeO-PCE is better than -PCP IMO, all the way around.  It's energizing still, but overall much warmer, softer, more euphoric, less psychosis-producing, more comfortable.

Yeah agreed, only did -PCP twice but it felt so dirty I was turned off. PCE's mania is not to be underestimated, but exactly like you describe, always very fun and fits raves good too.

But my friends like 3-MeO-PCP better, also for rave situations.

For some reason I never get much out of - PCE. Its warmer, yes, but a lot more cognitively inhibiting than - PCP.  I dont really feel low doses, but by the time I reach noticeable effects I also feel confused and retarded. Can be enjoyed at home chilling to some tunes but its kinda meh. 3-MeO-PCP on the other hand, I can take a small bump and get stimulated and nicely manic. Its actually one of my fave drugs for a night out. 


YMMV though

I agree with you Img_9999. I took about a year or so off from using 3 meo pcp and used other dissociatives sparingly in that time (compared to how I used them for the 10 years prior). I did get some 3 meo pcp again recently and find it a lot more fun than all the other dissos I have on hand (dck, 2fdck, 3hopcp, 3meopce and oPCE).

It’s also the most addictive, that’s where you run in to trouble. It feels less intoxicating than the others so it lends itself to redosing and binging for days and weeks on end, this is where it starts to take a sinister turn. The binges can change who you are on a very deep level.

Low doses are great though, I’ve used it three times since I got it again, always in doses of 10mg or less. The hypomania feels fantastic. I look forward to combing it with LSD again, such a great combo.

My gf holds on to it for me because I dont trust myself with it. I feel it calling to me all the time.

This drug has an evil side to it but god damn if it ain’t fun.

I'll have to give it a shot again sometime, it's been a long time.  I personally really like 3-MeO-PCE a lot, but haven't done that in a long time either.

Yeah, 100% agree on all that. 5/6 mg of 3-MeO-PCP and a lysergamide a couple of hours later ... bliss ! 

I've found that 3-MeO-PCE is as good for that specific purpose, though. I've mixed it with tryptamines to great effect. Brings a nice euphoric synergy. I had a wonderful trip with 3-MeO-PCE and 5-MeO-MiPT a while back.

Okay guys thank you for your response, I will take only one initial dose.


Another question:

A friend of mine want maybe try 3-Meo-PCP tomorrow at the rave too but he has no experience with dissociatives. So today I want to introduce him to 3-Meo-PCP before he takes it at a social setting. After that he will decide if it takes it at the rave or not.

So how high should the dosage be to give him a good first time?

I thought about my last post a little more. One of the reasons I like it a lot now is because it feels new again, the dark sides haven't creeped in yet. While not using 3 meo-pcp I had a honey moon with all of the other dissociatives. I've had many great holes on DCK, its still one of my favorites for that purpose, for a while I would say its almost as good as MXE. O-PCE and 3 meo-pce are a lot fun individually and in combination, they are warm, euphoric and more trippy than 3 meo-pcp. And the other ones have their value too. Right now I just prefer the clear headed high of 3 meo pcp. I like feeling like the man, this high to me is preferable to stimulants for going out. It has a lot of disinhibition accompanied by the hypomania, it makes it easy to talk to people if you keep your doses below 10 mg. Somewhere between 15 mg+ is where the speech slurring and funny walking kicks in. Anyway its great because its new again (and because the high kicks ass). 

Come over, lets get high!!!!

Id recommend a small bump, around 5 mg. See how he likes that, it'll be pretty mild at that dose, if he wants more after 30 minutes give him another 5 mg. Often times on this drug you're actually much higher than you might think you are.

[@Delsyd](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/83678/) thanks for your recommendation but I preceded and gave him a dose of 8mg and me a dose of 10mg. We both had a very great day together ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


@ all

What are your recommended dosage for a rave? I think we can up the dosage a little bit.

And how fast does the PCx tolerance build up? I took today about 16mg 3-Meo-PCP (6mg insufflated a couple hours before) and now 6mg 3-ho-pcp plugged. And the week before I took 500mg MXPr and 20mg 3-ho-pcp.

Would I be good with 15mg 3-Meo-PCP oral?

Well, i am lucky enough to play with this again recently.


At first i wondered about the fun times i discovered last time but after several 2mg doses, i found a bit of fun. However, last time i fell out of interest and am approaching  thi s same space.


It is nice if you are balanced generally and it can complement, but problem is you need to disrupt you balance with a couple of manic experiences, then ypu can see how this can complement your daily routine, but you didnt actually need this, thats where it gets tricky.


Well, i am having fun and will see how next wee goes with couple of days use only.

What would you recommend for doses when combining 3-MeO- and 3-HO-PCP, and what ROA? I have only done both orally, and to be honest 3-MeO is too all over the place for me, and lasts far too long for a rollercoaster ride like that. I don't get hypomanic or anything, I almost wish I did. It might be preferable to "I feel good, now I feel terrible, now I want to die, now I feel good again, wtf?" Like others have mentioned, it really fucks with your head. That is a vast understatement, actually.


On the other hand, I found 3-HO to be disappointingly weak at equivalent doses, but on the plus side, none of the 3-MeO rollercoaster crap. The best time I had with 3-HO was on the comedown when I smoked some weed, for about 20 minutes I felt godlike (not in a manic way, just very blissful!) and could see this aura of light extending out from my body... very nice. I'm pretty sure I stood still for 5 minutes at one point just saying "God damn I feel good" to myself over and over. Okay, maybe I was a little hypomanic ;-) If that's what a full 3-HO trip is like, that could be excellent. That's actually what I was hoping to get from the 3-MeO.


I want to try combining the two, but I'm slightly concerned about the 3-MeO. I really loved 2-FDCK, and I think that might smooth out alot of the 3-MeO insanity. I wish I hadn't blasted through all of that 2-FDCK, lol.

I have a white fluffy batch. I have no doubt of it's potency. I feel it at 1mg oral. Can't imagine going above 10mg in a single dose (though I did end up dosing 30mg orally throughout one day with mild tolerance... not recommended!). Physically, the effects were not super noticeable, but that stuff is a real head trip (and not necessarily in a good way all of the time!)


Just a general comment on some of those here who are taking 3-MeO daily or binging insanely large amounts: I have no clue how you do that and aren't all confined to mental hospitals or prison (though I see some have been). I tried binging on it for 2 days, and by the 2nd day I was very mentally messed up. Rapid mood swings, stomach issues, random head pressure (not intense or concerning, just annoying). I wasn't delusional or anything, but the mood swings were extreme, to say the least. If I had been around more people those two days, I may have said (or screamed) some things I shouldn't have. I also once felt the urge to make a very inapproprate overture to someone that would not have been age-appropriate (and possibly illegal) for me. That is nothing like the normal me at all, I am usually very reserved, and not especially sexual. What was most disturbing was how little it bothered me at the time! I was almost egging myself on to approach her, but then I just laughed it off, said "nah" to myself, and kept walking. It could easily have gone differently, though.


Also, I felt that stuff in my system for days after multiple redoses across 2 days (first day was all 5mg doses and less, 2nd day was 5mg and 10mg doses). It comes in waves, too. I woke up this morning insanely pissed off, walked around my apartment ranting to no one until I took some Kratom and some Ativan (straightened me right out!). Felt relatively fine the rest of the day aside from light residual dissociation. I fell asleep due to exhaustion this evening, and then thought I would be tired all night, but here I am at midnight after taking Ativan, wishing I could sleep but feeling like I just took a mg or 2 of 3-MeO, and yet it's been a couple days now. God damn, this gives me bad memories of binging on 2-DPMP (at least 3-MeO has an afterglow instead of days of anhedonia, exhaustion, and insomnia).

It's unusual that you found 3-HO-PCP weak compared to 3-MeO-PCP, as most people find the 3-HO to be slightly more potent.  However the nature of the effects is different, less crazy-making and more pleasant.  I used to like dosing both of those drusg (though I have WAY more experience with 3-MeO) in a series of very low doses.  I like them snorted more than oral (unlike most dissociatives).  I would snort 1-2mg of 3-MeO-PCP every couple of hours and eventually get quite hypomanic.  I took a larger dose once and didn't like it.  When I dosed them together, I was basically starting with ~2mg of each and then maybe alternate bumps of 2mg (one drug, the the other next time it was time to redose), or else combine them to form a combined 2mg bump.  


I'm not really into these 2 drugs anymore though.  In the end I think they (especially 3-MeO) are delusion-producing drugs and not good for mental health.  Some dissociatives are wortth doing, for example I had a lot of truly beautiful exepriences on MXE, but the only time I enjoyed 3-MeO-PCP was when it was making me feel powerful.  It was basically an ego trip.

3-MeO-PCP was unbingable for me. It produced a tranquil peace at 6-8mg but it was relatively empty and boosting it caused anxiety.

By contrast, 3-MeO-PCE was bingable up to 100mg and more enjoyable, and 4-MeO-PCP, even though 10x less potent, was more enjoyable in terms of effect.


3-MeO-PCP made me lose interest in wanting to try PCP, and I was always stoked to, until I felt what its 3-MeO did.


I'm MUCH more for the N-Ethyl and the N-Propyl than for the Piperidinyl, Morpholinyl or N-Methyl.


If I'm to love the crap out of an arylcyclohexylamine, its likely to be a N-ethyl.

I'm pretty sure regular PCP is not a lot like 3-MeO-PCP.  It sounds much better.

Its more stimulant than 3-MeO-PCP though, and I'm not good with stimulant effects, and can'tget the most out of 3-MeO because of them.

I think you made a typo here. One of these isn't supposed to be 3-MeO-PCP, I'm guessing, because those statements are confusing together.

I was hoping that was what you were trying to say. You're not the only one who prefers it over the PCP. Think I need to get my hands on the PCE now, as long as it's not as emotionally unbalancing as the PCP, I don't want that.

Yeah, I prefer 3-MeO-PCE by a large margin.  In fact I would like ttop obtain some more for the stash, but I don't plan to get 3-MeO-PCP ever again (I would do a bump here and there if offered).


3-MeO-PCE is quite serene, it reminds me of the baseline content/empathogenic state of MXE, without the wonkiness and magic.  I find it to not be a deceptive drug (other than to th extent that all dissos can be), whereas 3-MeO-PCP is perhaps the most deceptive drug I've done.

So, I just posted a pretty long thread about my history with 3-MeO-PCP and some thoughts about its neuroplasticity that have been stewing in my brain for a few years. I decided to make a new thread since it's so long, but I'd appreciate it if anyone interested would give it a read [here](https://www.bluelight.org/xf/threads/3-meo-pcp-vibrations-editing-mode-neuroplasticity.880911/). I started slowly browsing through this thread about a week ago (not going to sign myself up for reading the previous 3, there's so much material), but I only made it as far as like page 2 before I couldn't hold myself back from finally signing up for Bluelight and putting some thoughts to paper.

I had a rather unsettling experience when consuming THC on top of 3-HO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCP. I had a panic attack, which is not in and of itself noteworthy, that happens to me from time to time when I ingest a bit too much THC. I just ride it out. This one, however, was turbo-charged by PCP analogues.I had my usual symptoms, strong shockwave-like feelings passing through my body, increased heart-rate, temperature issues (sweating like crazy and 5 minutes later shaking in cold, repeated for an hour or so), and that general feeling of impending doom. It was far more intense than on THC alone, and sometimes I had a hard time keeping it together. Other times I was able to look at it truly objectively due to the dissociatives. I wrote down the times in which the experience transitioned from taking all of my clothes off to cool off in response to profuse sweating, to me putting them all back on and bundling up in a blanket to ward off extreme shivering & muscle shaking from feeling cold. At another point I sat and calmly meditated to pass the time as the uncomfortable feelings came and went. I could never do this in this past in this state, my thoughts would race too much.


While all that was happening, something far more sinister was occurring. I began having a series of delusions that I suspect was 3-MeO-PCP's contribution to the experience. I looked at my orange cat's eyes, and their blackness and some terrible feeling of dread made me convinced he was inhabited by Satan. I tried not to look at his eyes for the next hour or so, doing so resulted in feeling of dread and the very real concern that if I dwelt on those thoughts and feelings too long I would get sucked into something, with possibly disastrous consequences. Certain, seemingly random, objects in my apartment felt as if they had an evil presence lurking inside, watching me. I began to get paranoid. I began hearing auditory hallucinations, people talking in the whir of computer fans, low wooshing sounds coming from my speakers (that was particularly disturbing).


I had to constantly force myself to try to focus on a TV show instead of getting sucked into the weird thoughts and delusions. It is best described as being in a waking nightmare, suddenly having thoughts and precepts that made no sense and came out of nowhere, and that persistent sense of something bad or evil lurking in wait. That lasted about 2 hours (but felt 2-3x longer), until the Ativan I took early on began to kick in, and the THC wore off. I have a feeling these sorts of things could happen on a higher dose of 3-MeO-PCP, and last much longer. This time, I had snorted 2mg 3-4 times in the course of the day (same dose and frequency for the 3-HO-PCP. I have moderate tolerance). This definitely gives me pause about dosing too high on this stuff, as well as combining THC with it. Had wonderful experiences with THC and 3-HO-PCP, so I'm fairly sure this was due in no small part to the 3-MeO; it just had that feeling about it.

I miss this compound but at the same time I feel like I got what I needed to learn out of it for the time being. A deliciously cold and dusky vibe to this one. It's like the brutally honest thoughts that ooze out of your subconscious as you drift in to the twilight zone between waking and sleep. Made me feel like a trickster character from oral traditions, cackling and thinking of the absurdity of existence as a joy to be shared. Tbh I would rather get ahold of this than K if I were to do a dissociative impulsively for hedonistic  purposes.

I've had a very similar experience combining 3-meo-pcp, a little mxe, and weed. An anxiety/panic attack started and quickly turned into a fight against being possessed by a demon. Was it real? Who knows. But it felt real as fuck, and I had to fight it for just about an hour.

This didn't involve weed but I also had the experience on 15mg of 3-MeO-PCP that "I" was, or had become, something else... I think I posted about it a lot earlier in this very thread, but I remember really vividly observing the entity that was controlling my body, and thinking, over and over again, "if that's not me, then what am I?" ![:oops:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f633.png)


It was deeply, deeply harrowing, and I could totally understand with a few more substances in the mix, or even just a higher dose, it would manifest as a feeling of some kind of demonic possession.


It's really interesting how similar the reports are of sensations are that people have on this substance, I think.

I think really think it's dependent on the amount of THC you're adding to the mix, but even a weak strain of weed or tiny amount of hash oil can make me feel shaky for a period, even if I otherwise feel great. The body buzz can be amazing... until the anxiety and other stuff starts to kick in. I had a lovely time after smoking a bowl on the comedown of a moderate dose of 3-HO-PCP. Waves of pleasure rolling through me, and I had some kind of synesthesia where I saw this aura of light radiating from me and experienced it as the feeling of bliss. So, so much different than what happened to me last night! That experience still haunts today, much like when I have a very vivid and terrifying nightmare. It was like an H.P. Lovecraft trip, that feeling that reality was not what you thought it was, and underlying it was some kind of invisible and evil force, made manifest in my house cats and inanimate objects. 3-MeO-PCP is some sneaky shit.

I personally love cannabis with DXM and MXE, and I have loved it with 3-meo-pcp, as well. It makes the experience so much more "full" for me.

3-MeO-PCP is the only dissociative I don't enjoy whatsoever with cannabis. 3-MeO-PCE, on the other hand, was really a smooth experience with cannabis. It's generally in the days after taking a dissociative that cannabis isn't enjoyable, it's like my tolerance to it has been completely reset and the experience is uncomfortably strong.


There's only been one time on dissociatives where I had a possession type of experience, interestingly it was the same day a horror movie came out. My girlfriend talked me out of seeing it, so we just watched a movie at her house that night. I did what was a normal dose of MXE for me at the time and ended up shaking and feeling a demonic presence, we got up and walked around outside and then I was fine.


The same girlfriend had a similar experience on 3-MeO-PCP after doing it for a few days straight. Ever since then she doesn't really take dissociatives. I don't really think too much into these experiences though, other than that in the moment they can be quite frightening.

I pretty much universally get uncomfortable with dissos and marijuana, but also I'm generally a lot less comfortable with marijuana in general as I get older, I just find it to produce a lot of anxiety compared to almost every other drug, unless the setting is right.  It's easier for me to take LSD than marijuana these days.  Didn't used to be that way.  No idea why it changed.  So I may be a little biased.

Someone should remind me, which is more potent, the 3-meo-PCP or the 3-meo-PCE? I seem to recall they are about the same in dosing but one of them is  a smidgen weaker... think that was the ethyl one

At equivalent doses 3-MeO-PCE is more visual and physically immobilizing while 3-MeO-PCP is more stimulating and packs more dissociation. That's been my experience at least.

I find 3-MeO-PCE about half as potent as 3-MeO-PCP, or maybe a little more, but -PCP is certainly more potent.  However, subjectively I much prefer the -PCE.

The first panic attack I ever experienced was when coming down from my first 3-meo-pcp experience. I had ingested an edible to go to sleep about 5-6 hours after ingesting my last dose of the 3-meo (I took small doses of around 3mg every 2 hours throughout the day, until evening where I snorted a good 10mg line), and while waiting for the edible to kick in I smoked some DMT (does anyone else love the 3-meo-pcp + DMT combo as much as I do?!), and then meditated afterwards before bed... that's when the edible started kicking in, and led me to believe the 3-meo-pcp was giving me a heart attack.  I ended up riding it out, but had my neighbor drive me to the hospital as I was sure I was going to die (never actually went in, but just waited to have a heart attack outside). Horrible experience, which has made me more cautious ingesting THC with dissociatives. Sometimes they mix well, and other times they don't...


I wish I had a source for the 3-meo-pcp (or the PCE), but luckily I was gifted 2 grams of it for free a couple years back and it has lasted me ever since.  Unfortunately, I've been recently using it to potentiate my shots of heroin, so I feel like I'm wasting it at this point... but I'm trying to take a break soon.  Does tolerance build up fast with this compound? I've been insufflating it almost every day for the past month (5-10mg doses), and have definitely noticed a tolerance build up. I'm a professor, and this compound is actually a nice alternative to benzodiazepines when I feel anxious about teaching a class/topic I'm not that well versed in.... 3-5mg before class does wonders for my social anxiety.  Anybody else found this to be the case?


Also, why is it that at higher doses I always feel like I'm dying? Is that a common theme with this compound? The single most intense experience of my life was a few months ago when I was at a Dead and Company show in which I dosed 100mics of LSD + 100mics of ALD-52, and then two hours later ingested 10mg of the 3-meo-pcp orally... never have a I been so high in my life, and the 3-meo definitely transformed everything into one of the most religious/mystical experiences I've ever had - made me believe in a creator/god for the next week afterward (and I'm a pretty militant atheist).

Yea 3-MeO super potentiates every psych + weed IME.


High doses feeling like dying is a yes over here, though I was always more prone to feeling possessed than feeling like I was dying.


And RE: 3-MeO-PCP and DMT, holy shit, YES! I loooooove that combo. One of my best DMT trips ever was on a base of 3-MeO-PCP.


And I found 3-MeO-PCP to be good for social anxiety in that I would get manic and feel invincible. No room for anxiety when you feel like superman.

I've also come to stop smoking weed when I do 3-MeO-PCP. In fact, 3-MeO-PCP has sort of made me realize that I should smoke weed in substantially fewer settings than I was. I kind of had this mindset where "weed potentiates everything and is always a good idea", but for me that was pretty delusional. Not sure if it's always been true, or I react to weed different as I age, and it's taken some time for my evaluation of it to update.


Experience that made me admit this to myself, and choose to stop smoking weed while on 3-MeO-PCP unless I'm trying to turn down: I was hanging out with this friend I'm particularly close to (hard to define, but more than platonic). She was in my bathroom for a while. During that time, I smoked some weed, then came inside to change into more comfortable clothing for the night. The bud started kicking in as I looking through my clothing... I have a lot of body image issues, it's often hard for me to feel comfortable with how I look, and I was also hoping to look extra cute with her company in mind. I basically ended up working myself up into an anxiety attack trying to figure something out, coming up with reasons why I couldn't wear each article of clothing, at first putting them on and taking them off, then just frozen staring at the closet racks. She came out of the bathroom to find me sitting on my bed or something, almost naked and about to cry lmao. (She was cool about it; she's cool about everything & has a lot of body image issues as well.)


I can chuckle about it a little in retrospect, but I was definitely embarrassed about it because I can usually keep my shit together better than that & I definitely lost it, if only for ~10 minutes. Smoking weed on 3-MeO-PCP has this way of making me feel like my mind has been disintegrated or put through a meat grinder. The more manic/omnipotent the 3-MeO-PCP is making me feel, the smaller the pieces that are left after I smoke. Hard to explain, but I know I don't like it anymore.


That's just me, though. For how benign it usually is, weed's an infamously idiosyncratic drug.


3-MeO-PCP + LSD, on the other hand, is fucking sublime. On Veterans' Day this year, I went out with the same friend and another friend from out-of-town; each of us took 1 tab of 1P-LSD & periodic oral bumps of 3-MeO-PCP solution and went on a hike. I'm a little bit of a housepet, so one component of the experience was my two friends coaxing me deeper into the woods, helping me feel more like a woodland critter at home within nature and not so alien to it — something I know, but regularly forget how to live. Ended up skinnydipping in a stream within a secluded little glade, crisp & just chilly enough to be invigorating. Transcendent experience, even if we ended up getting lost on the way back. Oh, and we saw a UFO! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I enjoy weed with 3meopcp. 


Either 3meo first and a lesser amount of weed or

Weed an then small amounts of 3meo 


They potentiate each other  fair amount.


For example, a 2mg dose followed by a small joint is managable.

4mg and a large joint may become very difficult.my point is lower doses of both are what make this combo work.

I had some mean things to say about 3-MeO-PCP in the past, but I am here to retract them. This stuff is very nice (with tolerance). I had an absolutely wonderful experience snorting 5mg of 3-HO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCP together a number of times in a day (3-HO-PCP is my jam). The fifth and final time was stunning, it actually felt a lot closer to what I got from MXE, Ketamine, and 2-FDCK, and felt nothing at all like the PCPs. None of that weird goopy plastic feeling that the MeO usually gives me, or the opiate whiteout effect I get from the 3-HO-PCP, or the semi-dissociation with emotional flatness and then emotional rollercoaster rides courtesy of the 3-MeO. I was fully dissociated, very euphoric, and having very cosmic thoughts. Music was mind blowing (and a renewed appreciation for Thom Yorke, a favorite musician).


I guess I hadn't had a really solid dissociative dose of either of these PCP analogues until tonight. I would say in total I snorted 25-30mg of each in an 8-10 hour period. In the interest of harm reduction, I have moderate tolerance and I would not recommend doing this without some tolerance to dissociatives. I had no issues with mania, delusions, emotional weirdness, anything like that. Pure good times. I got a lot of work done on my Linux servers (and felt like I was inside them!) while listening to some fantastic music. Yes, I could still type and cogitate, but most of it was me on autopilot. I'm in my zone when I'm using a command line interface. What a day. I also suspect it's going to be a long night without sleep, but at least I'll feel nice.


So yeah, I'm sorry 3-MeO-PCP, you're fantastic. Be cautious, and be safe!

That's a really high dose!  I wouldn't ever recommend anyone take such a high dose.

Sounds interestung. How close are the pcp dissociatives to ketamine/ mxe? 


Im guessing its closer to mxe in terms of that stimulating body feel? 


I really want to try this tho long dissociative trips scare me

3-MeO-PCP is not much at all like ketamine or MXE, but it's closer to MXE.  3-MeO is much less wonky and dissociating and more functional, and much less obvious in its mental alteration.  It gives strong delusions of sobriety... you always think you're acting much more normal and are much more capable of functioning than you are.

3meopcp is not comparable to ketamine of mxe. It is so so different.

It will not incapacitate in anyway. You function on full steam.

It will not be dreamy, comforting or blanketing.


It will change how you think, a lot.

It will seem hard to see how it affects intially.


Doses above 15mg or so will make you wonky and it would be wise to be in a bedroom only or similiar. 

But it will not be like ketamine or mxe other thank how it will have you thinking. (Fragmented haha)

This is so not true, and only a lie that 3-MeO-PCP makes you believe. Yes, you can do lots on it and it is functional in that way. And, you will not be normal. You will be incapacitated. Just functional, too. Like happens with mania.

^ Agreed, though I think that's what he meant.  It won't incapacitate you physically like ketamine does, where you can't move around effectively, but it will certainly make you unable to function normally in terms of behavior and thought process.

Interesting. Is the mania side very much like the mania u get from high dose ketamine/mxe? Or is this entirely a different beast ? I remember thinking boiling the kettle was saving the world when on high doses of ketamine. That sort of shit? ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)

It's similar to the mania from other dissos, but more sinister and delusional.  Like, you will be entirely convinced you're fine and thinking rationally and acting normal, but you're not.  The strongest delusions of sobriety of any drug I've tried I think.  I have seen people utterly lose the plot for long periods of time with 3-MeO-PCP, moreso than I have with other dissos.

At small doses like that is where I like it, it provides a nice mood boost and creativity boost and is quite functional.  When I used it, I would use it in those dosages and found it pretty benign, though I would tend to dose it daily for stretches of time and do 2-3 of those small doses throughout the day.

Yes i meant your perception will leave you believing you are not incapacitated and functioning as normal on full steam.


You will feel as if you are quite normal because you can function.

In reality you are altered and you will feel completely able at least until higher doses. If you feel encumbered from 3meopcp you are well past it affecting you!

I had (another) wonderful experience with 3-meo-pcp on the 4th. I did two 6mg bumps an hour apart a couple of hours into a 50mg dose of Ripple dissolvable THC and had the most positive drug experience I've had in quite some time. It was the last of my 3-meo-pcp (5 years is pretty long for .5 gram of a thing to last me), but it was a beautiful way for it to go out.

I have a pretty high tolerance to 3meopcp and can take pretty decent doses, and I have been fully incapacitated by it.

It’s been a while since I’ve thought about giving 3-meo-pcp another go. A few years ago I recall there were two distinct types In circulation. One was Completely white and the other slightly tannish brown. I for one did not enjoy the white variety as it tended to feel more cold, clinical, and stimulating. The tan one on the other hand felt like a completely different animal. It was warmer, more psychedelic, gentle, and euphoric. Is this still the consensus or am I trippin?

I was referring to 3-meo-pcp, but I've heard great things about the pce version.  Never got a chance to try it out and can't seem to find it these days, but I can get 3-HO-PCE.  Is it a worthy contender for 3-meo-pce?


 Yeah, I'm keeping everything domestic these days until shipping isn't immobilized by Covid.

Thinking back of 3-MeO PCP, long after I quit dissociatives, the intense peace of an 8mg oral dose stands out. There literally was Nothing going on, and I say that in the most respectful, meditative way possible - a near rippleless pond of tranquility, and a sole lotus flower in bloom, that was I.


The good kind of Nothingness.

Its odd.  I loved 3-meo-pcp, but I always had issues with consistency between batches.  IME I seemed to have the best experiences with the slightly tan synths.  Like you so elegantly stated 3meo possessed zen like properties and which would put me in these states of peaceful contemplation and ataraxia. I've been pretty much clean for the past 3 years and I rarely find myself thinking about opiates, sedatives, and stimulants, but there is something about dissociatives that causes me to reflect on the remarkable and mystical experiences they provided me.  They'll always have a special place in my psyche.

Ah MDPV.  Now that you mention it I also recall the different batches of MDPV and more often than not the tan was usually better, but in the world of RC's no one will ever know.  Thats actually another drug I find myself grieving over from time to time for some twisted reason.  I can still taste and smell the vapor to this very day.  It turned me into a compulsive bottomless monster and yet I miss it like a lost love one.

LOL, I remember when MDPV was first released in a small batch, it was being touted as a smart drug... "don't take more than 5mg at once".  I didn't care for it as I would snort it, and found it to be too edgy for a "smart drug".  Then a bit later people started realizing you could go totally ham on it.  I never went there myself, I tried it a few times at 5mg-10mg and gave up on it, never ordered more.

I hated MDPV the first 4-5 times I tried it.  I felt like I was having heart palpitations, my anxiety/paranoia were through the roof, and I was so scattered brain I couldn't communicate. I could have just left it at that like rational human being , but I had to try it once more.  You know I've noticed with some drugs you need a tolerance or some minor exposure before you can enjoy them and oddly enough when I ordered more and gave it a go it turned into a completely different drug.  It went from anxiogenic to anxiolytic and euphoric.  I was calm and yet ready to take the world on, but then you end up staying in your room taking a hit every 5 minutes. It's compulsive nature was worse than crack. Good times.

Yeah, MXE was like that for me, the first handful of times I didn't like it, found it offputting and dysphoric.  Then one time it clicked and became utter magic.

Exactly, I was the same way with all dissociatives.  They just left me confused, disoriented, and uneasy, but once you acquire the taste it changes the game. MDPV is a useless drug, but MXE was so unique and magical. That's one substance I will miss forever. Perhaps something better will be developed down the road, but until then R.I.P.

Hi everyone,


I didn't post about this stuff for 7 years or so. I was surprised to find  was active in thread's Part 2. That was a damn long time ago!


I  decide get this again and it's an excellent compound. Amazing  even at low dosages, 

for a fellow that has permanent NMDA antagonists tolerance is way more active than expected.

This is stuff is dangerously seductive.  I will write a review comparing with 3-Chloro-PCP.


Stay safe. See ya!

This substance is a pretty interesting one and it seems it doesn't follow linear RoA / dosage curve of other dissos. I've tried it 4 times in the last 3-4 weeks. i've also done about 5 light doses (10-23mg) of DCK / DMXE so there's probably some cross-tolerance, but considering i practically barely used dissos before this i don't even have a tolerance.


> - 1st time i tried it was an "allergy test" by scraping the walls of baggie with my finger and licking it. There's was a tiny amount - probably 1-2mg (still subjective). i wasn't prepared for any effects, but they came after 1-2 hours. At first i was a bit worried there was some slight respiratory depression (which sounds dumb because its a disso) - however by the 2nd time i tried this drug i noticed it was just a weird feeling in the upper stomach / diaphragm. is this known as gut rot? It was still the nicest experience with this drug. It could have been placebo considering i was excited about hypomania and focused all my thoughts / positive feelings towards that, but music actually sounded amazing. My soul felt like it was dancing deep inside, but not in emphatogen / psychedelic kind of way where you feel deeper emotions and music moves your heart - this was actually just positive feelings, energy and euphoria not entactogenic. I also noticed my libido was stronger and erection harder. It strangely reminded me of the first few times i took phenibut in larger dosages (2-3.5gr) and retrospectively looking that was definitely hypomania - the sheer enthusiasm, incredibly energetic and outgoing, euphoric, confident, grinning etc. - music definitely amplified and strengthened it further. No stimulant has ever made me energetic like hypomania did. Those were probably one of my best moments on drugs.
> 
> 
> 
> - 2nd time was 3 days later. I did the same thing, except a little bit more powder was stuck on my finger and i thought it was probably 2-3mg, but no more than 4mg. That was a mistake, because the high was completely different. It maybe interacted with 25mg doxylamine from yesterday - as doxylamine has incredibly long legs for me. At about T0:25 i experienced strange / slightly uncomfortable sensation in my upper stomach which is probably the same thing that happened before. After 10 minutes that feeling largely dissipated. At T1:30 i felt some classic dissociation. 15min later i was washing my hands and it felt different, like something was off. At T2:20 i was very fucked up, but still somewhat clear-headed which actually made it worse. It wasn't warm dissociation of DXM / DCK, instead it was very cold, clinical and uncomfortable, but there was no anxiety or worry present. It also felt slightly physically numbing. **This shit HAS to be properly measured and not eyeballed.** Music didn't sound any better than usual, certainly far away from what I've experienced the first time. TV was not entertaining either and libido was even decreased.
> 
> 
> 
> - 6 days later i prepared solution for volumetric dosing - 40ml of 70% ethanol mixed with 80mg of the drug = 2mg/ml & 1mL syringe. Interestingly enough i felt some come-up anxiety at T0:50 like i took a serotonergic stimulant. I felt a bit lighter and colors looked brighter. This time there was no uncomfortable feeling in my stomach (beside anxiety), probably because it was mixed in the solution. At T1:30 i felt nice and physical comfort of dissos. Then i felt something which made me hopeful again - you know how some drugs cause you to have this uncomfortable feeling like anxiety that hasn't manifested itself yet? It was like that except the feelings were positive: good mood, happiness and euphoria which actually felt buried "underneath" me but could not manifest and i didn't know how to trigger them. Later at night when i came home from work i realized i haven't been thinking about negative things and bad memories - and that was much later when the effects wore off.
> 
> 
> 
> - 4 days after that i carefully measured 4mg for insufflation. I cleaned my nose twice with nasal solution and gently sniffed it trough a straw. It didn't feel bad, but after about 5 minutes when it probably started dissolving it irritated my nasal mucosa and dried out my nose. And that was only ~4mgs. At T0:25 i got a lot more comfy. Cognitive effects came on at about T0:43 and i immediately noticed how bright everything became, like my lights got stronger somehow and there was strong dissociative headspace creeping in - but it almost completely went away after ~10 minutes. My head got considerably warmer and that lasted for hours, but my heartrate was completely normal. It wasn't bad, but oral dosage felt nicer it sense of cognitive well-being. I do like that there was no dissociation as i want this to be hypomanic drug. In the evening i once again realized  i'm not ruminating on negative thoughts like i usually do. Interestingly nasal route did not constrict my pupils. Oral dosing of 3-meo-pcp/DMXE/DCK always does that. I wonder how does it metabolize depending on RoA.

So i guess my main question is how can i increase hypomania from this drug? I've been reading the forums and plenty of people say you have to do in consecutive days, but i'm not fond of taking drugs on daily basis just so i could experience a couple of days of "good high". I want it to be useful on-need basis. Is redosing multiple times in a single day perhaps better than taking it 1x day for the entire week or more?

Just ordered half a g. It’s been quite a while since I’ve experimented with this one. The last batch I got years ago was a bit disappointing. It was lacking that subtle warm euphoria and instead felt cold, clinical, and sharp around the edges.


I’ve been dabbling with ketamine the past couple of months, but I’m looking for something that’s more functional and longer lasting. Ketamine tolerance tends to build so rapidly. The magic dissipates just as fast and I’m not keen on insufflating such copious amounts of powder.

Nice to see someone bump this thread. Be careful bro, everytime I ordered a gram or a half I ended up being manic as fuck and eventually psychotic.

Hello old friends, I have been snooping on here for near the start of the site (well i don't know when It started but I know I was on forums back 20 years ago.. IRC and forums.. no stupid facebook or myspace crap..) Anyways now I feel old. I am an opioid user (chronic back pain my whole life, so I have had every type of pain killer made, very few have I not had) anyways I got cancer when i was 30ish and well, now I am trying new chemicals to help with pain old and new (neuropathy has me disabled now, brought on by my spine issues and chemo).. So anyways I quit opioids when I was 21 (well most all, suboxone is the only one in my life now.. its better than all the other shit.. or so I feel.. I have kept my dose the same for 14 years, where as oxycodone it went up from 10mg a day to 1000mg a day within 2 years).

I found LSD to help me thru a ton of mental issues that lead me to a bad place, I am better now and respect chemicals and am very careful on how I use and test things. SO after having fun with CL-pcp and HO-pcp and some others I found some 3-MeO-PCP, I have been freaked out by the reviews on it. So its sat around until tonight, its the 4th of july (or was) and I figured what the hell I am in a good mood and stable so lets give this a go.. My father in law passed a few months back. He was a cop and looking thru his things I found a BUNCH of test kits (I know his energy wanted me to find them, it was in a horded house in an odd spot. I found a bag of these boxes of test kits.. saved me 50$ *I was going to order my own kit but medical bills have kept me away from doing so*)

Anyways i got my half gram of MeO and poped it in the tube and broke the 2 chemicals (reagents) and it told me right away that it is indeed clean PCP (pics below).

I have a vape coils for DMT, and I had a new coil so I used it for PCP (I have always taken pcp by sublingually, I LOVE CL-PCP, but with the MeO I wanted to test smoking this for the reason that its such a small dose, and yes I do have a microgram scale (its not some 40$ cheap one, oh no.. chemo chemicals killed me *white blood cell count went to nothing, I coded, some how I am alive today, a blood transfusion is the only reason.. so go.. give blood please!* so I did spend the money to have proper equipment as I don't fear death, but I would rather enjoy my energy in this form for until its time for it to change. )

 So yes, I am feeling nice and warm, neuropathy pain is down to a 3, when its an 8+ normally. Back pain is eh there but not bad. I have been doing too much ketamine lately (80MG of pure K puts me into an OK space but my head is scattered to enjoy the pain relief.. this seems nice, I can type, and too much at that! (sorry)).

 All things said, this isn't bad, nor is it scary as some make it out to be, I smoked 8MG total, waited an hour, than 35mins ago I did 6MG mixed with .5ML of water sublingually.  

OK so I have looked over this post, and tried to correct it (I suck a writing) but maybe the way this is wrote will show how its altering my head space, I notice it, I wont change the post due to this. I will come back and review it once it has cleared my system ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just took 10mg orally. I forget how much I used to ingest so I guess we’ll see what happens.

10mg definitely won't be too strong.  Personally I usually use less but I prefer the light, stimulating, hypomanic qualities of 3-MeO-PCP, and not the heavier dissociating qualities.  I find it a bit stronger/heavier by weight orally than it is nasally.

Yeah 10mg proved to be underwhelming. I added 5mg more and that seemed to do the trick. It’s been so long since I’ve used this substance but once the effects took hold it was like meeting an old friend. I enjoy the gentle dissociation accompanied by minor mental/physical stimulation. My mini workout went by like a breeze and I’m still feeling good hours later.

This substance in conjunction with lyrica is beautiful. 20mg of 3-m-pcp and 450mg induced a state of pure bliss. Sometimes 3-m-pcp can be a little rough around the edges in terms of stimulation and hypersensitivity, but the addition of lyrica completely obliterates those side effects. Their synergy increased the euphoria of both substances. I felt as if I were wrapped in a warm blanket and was simultaneously energized and relaxed at the same time. The only issue I encountered was that I had some trouble sleeping, so I ended up playing Resident Evil Village  until 4 am. Slaying fungi infected zombies on 3-m-pcp was a blast. I felt so immersed within that world. It was awesome.

It's been a 4 year journey but I can use my right leg again! I found what finally took away my disabling neuropathy pain. I knew it was going to be in S isomer ketamine (lab tested) sugar. All I could drum up was iv use and inhalation use the inhalation just didn't do it and I knew IV wasn't a solution nor a path I wanted to go down, so I started injecting into my leg muscles (right back thigh leg.. 24/7 pain of a red hot knife just stuck.. I still have bad pins and needles on my feet but that's livable), once I hit 150mg and waking up from a hell of a life changing k hole I found my pain is almost gone and I haven't fallen over yet ( I used to fall or almost fall daily due to my leg just giving out) I'm still in disbelief.. I made a promise to myself when I was 21 that I'd never get back on opioids long term so that has not been an option that's what led me to the ketamine. One shot is lasting me upwards of 4 days.. now my dilemma is lack of money and trying to prove that this has worked to my neurologist.. I'm just a guy in remission (or was, last week my blood work came back with bad levels and I'm anemic now which I have never been. So now I have to get a CT scan and more blood work done and they're not taking my port out but I'm not going to let that get me down not after this progress) I don't know how to write a paper on my experience and I have not seen any papers on using ketamine in the way I have. Last night I actually got (was able to) to dance at an awesome break beat event near me. I'm an old school raver and it's been 4 years of not being able to go out because of the pain.. if anyone has any information similar to what I've done I would greatly appreciate it or if anyone has any resources for harm reduction or a way to be prescribed ketamine please let me know this has changed my life. My email is [[email protected]](https://www.bluelight.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9bf6fae8effee9f6faf5ababdbebe9f4eff4f5f6faf2f7b5f8f4f6)

It's all encrypted so anything sent to me will be completely anonymous if you'd like and I will destroy any emails if you would so like. I just want this quality of life to continue because I have not felt this good as far as pain-free in my entire life honestly.

Thank you all in advance.

Peace love unity RESPECT ![🙂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)![💓](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f493.png)

It seems I've finally gotten my hands on some more 3meopcp. It has been quite a while, but it is still one of my all time favorite substances. 


I have had some bad experiences with it, but I totally plan to tread lightly. 


Wish me luck! I'll let you know how it goes. T minus 38 minutes till I get off work AND blast offfffffff!!!!

I just tried 6-7mg snorted for the very first time and tbh I was kinda meh.  


It was just really cold and lacked euphoria or warmth.  It wasn't at all stimulating for me, in fact it sat my ass down and kinda make the room spin a little while everything went numb.  It was really stoning and inebrieating.  I just stared at the wall for at 30 or so minutes of the experience.


I was kinda tired and hadn't eaten in a while but I was expecting something way more stimulating that would make me wanna get up and do stuff.

I find *PCP analogs to be the same, although they can still have their use, just not as recreational. Have you tried *PCE analog or DMXE or more holey dissos like MXPR/MXiPR/DCK?

I found 3meo-pcp to be a bit dark but all in all a useful substance. Dck is my goto substance especially for combinations though. Are there big differences between 3meo-pcp and 3meo-pce? I heard 3meo-pce is a bit stronger.

DXM through a few high 3rd plateau experiences is it.  I'd say my 6-7mg 3-meo-pcp was like a high 2nd plateau dxm 'trip'.  Like on the verge of breaking through to pyschedelia but not quite there but never having taking 3-meo further I'm not sure if that's what actually happens.

If you like DXM, you should try hole-dissos i mentioned. They're the best dissos i've tried.

The way to get the effects you are looking for is with repeated low doses. Try 2-4mg and then redose with the same amount an hour later. Repeat as necessary.

How does oral compare?


Is light drinking a terrible idea for this one.


BTW, I'm giving it a another shot like you say, I just snorted 3-4 a couple minutes ago.


I noticed w/ DXM there was a big difference between taking a few capsules every few minutes vs slamming syrup.  My understanding there is it had to do w/ metabolism of dxm-dxo but I see this strategy with k and -logues and now this one... me thinks something else might be going on.

Okay... Spreading doses out does make it so that I'm not just fucked up. 

However it doesn't really add euphoria or recreational value for me.  It sure does add to the mindfuck. 


At least this night, I found the best value in this one by taking 2-4mg bumps every 5-15min at least until I felt like I wouldn't be able to handle it anymore


This is it's own thing JESUS!


It was hellah uncomfortable and took me places in my mind I DID NOT WANT TO GO!  But that's not necessarily bad.  And at no point did I feel out of control or like I was going to do something stupid.  It just kind of took all my memories right in my face and really showed me how they made me what I am today. 


There's going to be a lot of integration work after this. 


OOF!!!


I feel like a more whole less repressed self after having seen myself.  I'll see where integration work takes me.  I just wanted to make a night in nicer LOL  I don't think this is the one for that but it has it's value to me.

Yeah, pretty much nobody I've ever shared this stuff with liked it, aside from myself. But I'm probably the most eclectic psychonaut out of all of them. My gf had a pretty bad experience with it when she tried it, and I really didn't give her much. 


I've decided that I simply can't do this substance or the ones like it. If I have too much I always get carried away, start dosing daily and regularly, and it blows up my life every single time. No thanks.

3-MeO-PCP is slightly stronger mg per mg I believe, it's the kind of high that has to "click" which it never did for me but I can see how that cold confidence can be so addicting. I do like 3-MeO-PCE far better cause it's warmer and slightly more nuanced, both are very mania inducing for me though.

Spreading out the doses did make it incredibly rushy and stimmy vs just all at once.  All at once was a heavy downer experience.  Either way I didn't feel like moving if that makes sense.  Okay, I'll step away so I don't take over the board ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

You need to spread out the doses farther than 15mins. Wait 1-3 hours between small bumps.

I tried that, it just didn't work out as well.  


What I really loved was mixing vaping and bumps together.  Vape a bump which gives pretty immediate effects and then right after snort a bump and repeat every 30-60min until I'm where I want to be. 


I found vaping to be much more stimulating and manic than snorting.

Just a cheap ol meth pipe.  I don't know if it matters but I used a jet flame lighter.  It really frosties up the pipe quick so don't be too surprised if you find yourself in a strange headspace after vaping the stem.

Took this one this saturday after a looong break from it. Lovely stuff, I had missed it a little so the high took a nostalgic vibe, but it was nice and magical. 


3 mg oral + 3 mg snorted two hours later. I've always felt that's the best way to dose this one. I always get nicely hypomanic.

Yeah I agree, low dosing is the way to go with this for me, too.  I find the full dissociative state from it quite cold and sharp, but the effects of low dosing pretty reliably are dominated by a very pleasant hypomania that can be really fun.


I much prefer 3-MeO-PCE to 3-MeO-PCP but I like them both.

So vaping it in small increments, maybe 2mg at a time every half an hour or so should be the most hypomanic route as far as i know? I would really love to experience the hypomania people are talking about, i have tried both oral and nasal in every way possible and i just never got there. Also as xorkoth said, a bit too much and it gets to the cold clinical high, but the long tail afterwards makes it pleasant. What dosages are you taking xorkoth?

Well I haven't taken it in some time.  But back when I used to use it regularly, I would do 2mg nasal bumps.  Usually I'd do one of those every 2-3 hours until I got to 4 or 5 of them for the day

I like to use 3-MeO-PCE the same way, except the bumps are more like 5mg.  However I also like 3-MeO-PCE in higher doses.  That one is warm and lovely at any dose.

3-MeO-PCE has been weird to me. Sometimes I take it and just feel mentally disabled. Other times it's warm and nice and lucid. Others it just weird and uncomfortable, and it feels "incomplete" in a way, until I smoke some weed and then it gets nice and psychedelic. 


I much prefer 3-MeO-PCP.

I do occasionally have a strange, somewhat unpleasant and anxiogenic experience on it, but I have that sort of experience much more often on 3-MeO-PCP.  Always fascinating how we're all so different with regards to how we're affected by drugs.

Didn’t realize when I used the last of my 3-meo-pcp the other day it’s now impossible to procure. I most definitely wouldn’t have shared it with others if I had known. 


I had ordered a small amount a couple years and forgot I had it. Upon recently rediscovering it I used it for the past few days in doses ranging from 8-20mg. Such a special and versatile compound to have in ones arsenal. It’s subtle yet pronounced effects were so unique. I loved how functionable it was in small doses. Now I’m just in mourning.

I've read that 3-Meo-PCP is good for dancing. What would be a corresponding dosage of 3-Meo-PCP for this purpose for someone who found 40mg of 2-fdck intranasally a perfect amount for rave type social events, assuming that the person hasn't taken any dissacociatives in 2 years?

Also, assuming a 2 day preload of 5-hpt/magnesium for a 3 day rave event and subsequent dozing of the same before going to sleep each night , does the sequence night1: 3-Meo-PCP, night2: 3-fea/2-fea, night3: 6-apb/5-mapb make sense from the point of maximizing enjoyment and minimizing burnout?

Yes


I mean, 5-htp contrary to the general opinion, is cardiotoxic as f. Also, it doesnt get more serotonin production in the brain, that is where you want it, but outside the BBB that is where you dont want it. So you go better just taking tryptophan (like bananas)


For the rest, 4-5mgs of 3-meo should be a good dosage for one festival with no tolerance. Do 2-4 if you are going to mix with other compounds that same night

3-MeO-PCP is very good for dancing, 3-MeO-PCE is even better imo. Less is more even, depends on your priorities. 

If the music is good it might even be the best day of the three. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's gone?! Why is not available anymore?

It doesn't look like anything else is similar, perhaps PCE orally in low doses is the next best bet? Why would it be gone?

I believe that 3-MeO-PCP was banned in a few countries.

The most similar compounds that I've seen recently are 3-Me-PCP, 3-Me-PCPy, & 3-MeO-PCE.

Such a special and versatile compound to have in ones arsenal. It’s subtle yet pronounced effects were so unique. I loved how functionable it was in small doses. Now I’m just in mourning.

Keep hope my friend, I felt the same as you until I recently discovered a vendor with it on a shall-not-be-named market in the 'dark' places of the web. That being said, the vendor is shipping from a country that is not-so-ideal to be importing illicit substances from, if you catch my drift. 


Search hard enough and you shall prevail, because yes, 3-meo-pcp is the tits.
