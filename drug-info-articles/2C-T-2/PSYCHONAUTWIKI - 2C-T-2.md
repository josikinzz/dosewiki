**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine** (also known as **2C-T-2** , and **Rosy** ) is a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces psychedelic effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration) . It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which were derived from the systematic modification of the [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) molecule.

2C-T-2 was first synthesized and tested for activity in humans by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in 1981 and described in his 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). It is a member of the so-called "magical half-dozen" which refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) -derived compounds, all of which except [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) , and are as follows: [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , 2C-E, 2C-T-2 and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) .

Anecdotal reports generally characterize 2C-T-2 as a highly dose sensitive psychedelic known for its open headspace and unpredictable [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-T-2, and it has a relatively short history of human usage. Many reports also indicate that its physical effects may be too severe for those who are not already experienced with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) or suffer from pre-existing physical conditions. It is highly advised to approach this [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using it.

## History and culture

Following the initial positive results found by Shulgin's research group, a more formal study was carried out by psychedelic psychotherapy pioneer Myron J. Stolaroff who was interested in evaluating the potential use of 2C-T-2 in psychotherapy. Based on the experiences of forty participants in the study who took 2C-T-2, Stolaroff compared the effects favorably to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , describing it as more emotionally opening and permitting a wider exploration of feelings and thoughts.

## Chemistry

2C-T-2, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine, is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-T-2 belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 of the benzene ring. 2C-T-2 is also substituted at R 4 with an ethyl thioether group.

2C-T-2 is a close structural analogue of [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) ; the two differ by the length of the alkane chain in their thioether functional group.

## Pharmacology

The mechanism of action that produces 2C-T-2’s [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) and [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) effects has not been established in scientific literature; however, its primary psychedelic effects are more than likely a result of its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . This mechanism of action is shared by many other psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) and [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) .

Athough no established scientific experiments have been performed to establish MAO-A inhibition of 2C-T-2, phenethylamine derivatives substituted with an alkylthio group at the 4 position (4-MTA, and the 2,5-desmethoxy derivative of [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) ) are known to act as selective [monoamine oxidase A inhibitors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Furthermore, many compounds of the amphetamine-analogs of the [2C-T-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-x) have been found to have highly selective MAO-A inhibition . Therefore, this substance may likewise have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects.

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 2C-T-2 is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-T-2 can be described as very intense and uncomfortable in comparison to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . In high doses, it's capable of causing painful cramping. It is similar yet distinct from the "body high" experienced on [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) , but is considered much more unpleasant. The sensation itself can be described as intense and may manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Although this component is capable of manifesting itself in a distinct and noticeable fashion for most users, it does not generally seem to be as apparent or intense as the same component found within [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) .
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Extreme nausea is commonly reported when consumed in moderate to high doses and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in. It can be described as very painful and violent in comparison to [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and extremely realistic in style but with a subtle digital/cartoon-like form.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this experience can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , and [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) with mystical and shamanic undertones which combine with synthetic digital undertones reminiscent of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) . 2C-T-2's geometry can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic but somewhat synthetic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, rounded in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, mostly angular in corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them which is reminiscent of [DOC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOC) or [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) . Higher doses are more likely to result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_geometry) visual geometry, but may also lead into [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry (as with [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) ).
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
At common to high doses, 2C-T-2 is capable of producing a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) family. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , 2C-T-2 is very high in external hallucinations. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and [autonomous entity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entity) contact manifested as dense solidified geometric matter or physical objects of imagined concepts. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 2C-T-2 is very high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 2C-T-2 is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high doses. 
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and is [outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) dominant.
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 2C-T-2](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CT2.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-T-2 use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to trying this drug, but nothing can be completely guaranteed.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

2C-T-2 is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-T-2 is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-T-2 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-T-2 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

If 2C-T-2 does have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects as has been speculated, [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] this could indicate that 2C-T-2 is more likely to induce [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or general [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) overload (especially at high dosages) than other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) . This may make it dangerous to combine it with other [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and certain substances which promotes the release of neurotransmitters such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) or [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . These substances include but are not limited to:
