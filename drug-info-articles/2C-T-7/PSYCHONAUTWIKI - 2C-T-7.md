**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-propylthiophenethylamine** (also known as **2C-T-7** , **Blue Mystic** , and **Beautiful** , among others) is a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

2C-T-7 was first synthesized by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) and documented in his book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). It is a member of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which were derived from the systematic modification of the [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) molecule.

In contrast to other members of the 2C-x family, 2C-T-7 has gained a reputation of being an unpredictable, dose-sensitive psychedelic capable of producing strong visual effects and an intense [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) , which can manifest as a dangerous delirium in extreme cases. Many reports indicate that the physical effects are too severe for inexperienced users or those with pre-existing medical conditions.

This particular compound is part of the so-called "magical half-dozen" which refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which -- with the exception of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) -- he designed, synthesized and tested on himself. They can be found within the first book of PiHKAL, and are as follows: [Mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and 2C-T-7 .

## Chemistry

2C-T-7, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylthiophenethylamine, is a [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain.

2C-T-7 belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines, which contain methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 of the benzene ring. 2C-T-7 is also substituted at R 4 with a propyl thioether group.

2C-T-7 is analogous to 2C-T-2; the two differ by the length of the alkane chain in their thioether functional group.

## Pharmacology

2C-T-7's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects have been shown to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

With serious adverse effects seen on overdoses of this compound (potentially [Serotonin Syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_Syndrome) ) and as the 2,5-desmethoxy derivative of 2C-T-7 has been shown to be a moderate monoamine oxidase A inhibitor and many of the amphetamine-analogs of the [2C-T-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-x) series are highly selective MAO-A inhibitors (with [ALEPH-7](/w/index.php?title=ALEPH-7&action=edit&redlink=1) being one of the most potent) , this substance is widely thought to also have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 2C-T-7 is generally considered to be energetic and stimulating in a fashion is comparable to that of other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) . However, at certain doses and contexts, it may produce periods of notable [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-T-7 is intense, but in comparison to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , it can be considered mild though is still capable of becoming very powerful and highly physically euphoric. It is similar yet distinct from the "body high" experienced on [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , and [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as intense and will manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Although this component is capable of manifesting itself in a distinct and noticeable fashion, for most users it does not generally seem to be as apparent or intense as the same component found within [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) .

- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and extremely realistic in style but with a subtle digital/cartoonish form.

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocetin) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. It gives off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel with slightly more mystical and shamanic undertones in comparison to other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . At higher dosages, they are equally likely to result in states of [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry or [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) . There seems to be a visual geometry that is extremely similar to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) and can be described as equal in intensity or complexity and equal in proportion to the accompanying cognitive and physical effects.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
2C-T-7 produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) family. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 2C-T-7 is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. 
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 2C-T-7](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CT7.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

As of August 2007, there have been at least three reported deaths associated with the use of 2C-T-7. These incidents occurred with insufflated doses of 30 mg or more , or in combination with stimulants such as MDMA, [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . There have also been a number of reports describing concerning physical side effects and hospitalizations, typically following insufflation.

It is strongly discouraged to administer 2C-T-7 non-orally because this can cause vomiting, numerous negative side effects, or death at high doses. In Erowid's Fall 2000 2C-T-7 survey, it was reported that the [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) of 2C-T-7 resulted in more negative side effects than oral administration. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

2C-T-7 is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-T-7 is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-T-7 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-T-7 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

If 2C-T-7 does have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects as commonly speculated, this could indicate that 2C-T-7 is more likely to induce [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or general [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) overload (especially at high dosages) than other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) . This may make it dangerous to combine it with other [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and certain substances which releases neurotransmitters such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) or [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . These substances include but are not limited to:
