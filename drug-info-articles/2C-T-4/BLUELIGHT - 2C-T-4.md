**The Big and Dandy 2C-T-4 Thread**


2c-e’s retarded half brother


To begin, 2c-t-4 was the only chemical I had sampled at the time that I really had no basis for what to expect what I was going to get from it. I had read all the 1st person reports I could find on Erowid, Lycaeum, Bluelight, and in Pihkal. The only common thread between all the reports was that the experience was not what was expected. I was a bit apprehensive to start due to the fact I had just learned that its close cousin, 2c-t-7 may have mao inhibiting properties. After several experiences with the substance at many dose levels and with many other psychoactives, I feel there is nothing particularly worthwhile to this drug. It truly is 2c-e's retarded half brother.


Here is a summary of my and my friend’s experiences with this rare eclectic chem.

1st trial- 6mg

We decided to play it safe, since all sources seemed to point to an exceedingly long duration of action. 6mg down the hatch on an empty stomach. I was without any effects for at least an hour before even getting a typical "there is a phenethylaimine in me" alert. The time passing seemed to almost stop. Every 15 mins seemed like an eternity (and this effect gets more intense as the dose increases). By the time the 2nd hour had past, and I felt as though I had reached the peak of the experience, and I was ready for it to be over. A bowl of cannabis was imbided to try to get more visual effects and to pass some time. The cannabis had no noticeable effect on the overall experience. We decided the drug reminded us more of dxm or ketamine than the phenethylamine family. We had marked trails and some minor patterning on the white walls, but there was no real change in cognitive function. 

Approx. T+6 hours, 30 mg instant dissolve mirtazipine was used to terminate the experience. Sleep was attained within an hour.


2nd trial- 10mg

After the last totally unfulfilling experience at the low dose of 6mg, I decided to up the ante to about 10 mg a week later. The experience was remarkably similar to the 6mg trial, but there was more of a body load at this dose, and the time dilation was far more pronounced. I did not feel a major change in headspace, but had some trouble articulating my thoughts verbally. As with the last trial, 2c-t-4 is like being on a good 2c-e trip, without any visuals or introspection to be found.

I decided to smoke 5mg of 5-meo-dmt to see if any good synergy was to be found. After inhaling the smoke, I was instantly very ill and had to vomit. The 2c-t-4 was totally overwhelmed by the 5-meo-dmt for about 30 mins after the hit. The time spent in 5-meo-dmt space was a treat compared with the pointless stoning of 2c-t-4. After the 5-meo wore off, there was again no real visuals or headspace change, just time dilation and nausea. 

There is a pronounced unpleasant body load with this one folks. Again, at about T+8 hours, I attempted to end the experience with 200mg diphenhydramine, but what followed was total delirium. It was if the entire world was rippling with waves, similar to what you see after a raindrop hits a pool. The ripples began at the center of my visual field, and spread out evenly from there. These waves were cool at first, but then I began to have strange audio hallucinations. I would hear low frequency mumbling, not coming from any particular direction. The audio effects kept me from being able to get to sleep until approx. T+ 15 hours since dosing.


3rd trial- 20mg

After 2 totally worthless trials with the compound, I decided to again up the dose to see if higher doses had anything to offer. I dosed 20 mg in a glass of distilled water. DO NOT DO THIS. The taste is one I will grugingly remember for the rest of my life. BITTER.

Within 45 mins, I was beginning to feel effects and thought this was a good sign. Damn, was I wrong. It seemed that whatever the dose was, the character of the experience never changed. There was such time dilation, it was almost punishing. I felt I had been tripping the entire night by T+ 3hours. I was also, once again, feeling quite nauseas. I had to vomit 2x that night. It was not a typical drug puke, either. I was getting some bad muscle spasms in my abdomen during the vomiting. I smoked some cannabis, which had no effect on the overall experience, but eased the stomach discomfort. I was in what can be described as one of the most useless psychedelic spaces I could even imagine.  There were no visual effects to speak of, just trails. The headspace was very depressing and dark. I wanted so badly for it to end, but knew I had a while to go. The remainder of the night was spent watching tv, though nothing was able to keep me entertained, except one episode of Cowboy Bebop.  I finally fell asleep about 20 hours after the dose. 


COMBINATIONS

After these 3 experiences, I decided 2c-t-4 was utterly useless on its own, and I decided a series of combination experiments in controlled conditions was in order. Here is a summary of those experiences.


10mg  2c-t-4, 10mg 4-ho-dipt.

I took the 2c-t-4 in a veggie cap on an empty stomach. I waited for the standard time dilation to present itself. After about 90 mins, I felt as if I had sufficient access to the space. 10 mg of 4-ho-dipt was ingested in another veggie cap. Within 20 mins, I was beginning to feel the entire character of the experience change for the better. I was beginning to feel the only euphoria I had gotten with 2c-t-4. I began to get some good morphing and twisting of objects around me, but only if I would force it through staring. Laughter came easily. There was some wall breathing. There was no tachardia or tinnitus to be noted. Mild nausea, but nothing severe. I was beginning to see some hope for this chem yet. This was short lived however, as the 4-ho-dipt began to wane after about 4 hours. By T+5 from ingestion of the 4-ho-dipt, I was back to miserable 2c-t-4 space. I spent another night wishing I could sleep.


12 inches of san pedro and 20mg 2c-t-4

I wanted to see if there was any way to get anything out of 2c-t-4.  12 inches of san pedro was de-spined, run through a blender. I took the cactus mush, and combined it with 20 oz of distilled water. The resulting cocktail was placed on the stove over low heat and allowed to simmer for 2 hours. I then filtered out the cactus mush with cheesecloth and discarded. I returned the juice to the stove for another 4 hours, and evaporated 90% of the water, leaving about 2oz of vile viscous cactus tea. The was taken as a shot. Might I just say “blech, disgusting, most foul liquid I have ever tasted” Within an hour, alerts were felt from the pedro, and 20mg of 2c-t-4 was eaten in a gelcap. The next hour was spent trying very hard not to vomit and ruin the experience. I began to suddenly get VERY high about 90 mins after eating the cap.  I was beginning to get some of the most intense visual distortions I have ever gotten. I got nauseas from the amount of twisting and wall breathing going on around me. I, again, got the pleasure of a very bad vomit session. After the vomit, I began to feel much better, There was actually something to the trip this time. I was getting very crazy, borderline delusional trains of thought. I would explain further, but I don’t feel it is possible to do. The night was spent pondering random thoughts. The one thing that stands out the most was I , using my 3rd eye, was able to visualize whatever I tried to. Unfortunately, I began to get some alarming tremors in my legs. I layed down and left my corporeal body for quite some time. When I got back to reality, I found I was on the way back to baseline. I spent the night in awe of the oobe. 


15mg 2c-t-4, 15mg 4-ho-dipt, repeated smoked 5-meo-dmt, cannabis and No2

This experience took place at a Flogging Molly concert. I took the 2c-t-4 and iprocin in a bottle of water and drank it as I walked from the hotel to the venue, about ½ mile away. 

By the time I arrived, the iprocin was making its presence known. The first band to play was The Briggs, I am not a big fan, but they were ok. After the Briggs played their set, I was getting, once again, VERY HIGH. The Street Dogs came on stage next, and I was very impressed. I felt as though I had taken at least 750 mics of lsd. I spent some time in the pit to blow off excessive energy. By the time Flogging Molly finaly came onstage., I was floored. I got in the pit for Flogging Molly also, and talk about sensory overload. I had no idea what was really going on, but could not stop laughing. It was some of the most fun I have ever had. After the show, I stopped at a good times by the hotel and got a burger, as I was starving. Once in the hotel room, I smoked a joint and got out the bitch and 5-meo-dmt. I loaded about 10 mg of the freebase in the pipe. And put 3 whipits in a large balloon. I hit the 5-meo-dmt and blew the smoke into the balloon with the nitrous. I began to inhale from the balloon and was immediately the highest I have ever been. Classic +4 experience. Soon after returning to reality, there was a loud knock at the door. “FUCK, I am way to high to deal with this”, ran through my head. I immediately hid all the drugs in the room safe, turned out all the lights, and became silent. Soon after, the sun was coming up. I got in the car (I know, bad idea) and was on my way back home. I left whippits and god only knows what else still in the room. I got home an hour or so later and smoked cannabis until falling asleep.


Conclusion

Overall, I was not at all impressed with 2c-t-4. It is worth trying once, just due to the oddity of the experience, but not at all worthwhile. The character of the trip is very disassociative, which I have mentioned elsewhere, I believe. The only merit this one has is its synergy with iprocin and 5-meo-dmt. I gave away my remaining supply after these experiments, satisfied I had gotten all I could from 2c-t-4. The body load is also very numbing and unpleasant. Overall 3 out of 10

 What do you on BL think of 2c-t-4??

MY one experience (18mg) was very strong (in that I was at a full +3) but not at all fulfilling.  I too was reminded more of a dissociative than a visionary phenethylamine.  To sum up, my experience was very much as you describe 2C-T-4 (especially the extreme time-dilation and lack of visuals) but thankfully I was spared any significant bodyload.  I did vomit (not surprising as 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 also make me vomit) but no unpleasant stimulation or dirty body-feeling like I get with 2C-T-2.


I still want to try this one again, but at 10mg-12mg just to see.  Hopefully I can get something from it, but I am just as happy to keep it as a souvenir than an ally.  It certainly is amazing how moving the position of one carbon can so radically change the nature of a molecule.


Here is my report...

I think it will better serve you as a trophy in your colection than as a psychoactive![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Your report sounds very similar to my experiences indeed.

Also amazing is how most everyone reacts differently to research chemicals isn’t it?

This is my favorite PEA.  I realize that’s a rare opinion.  For me it’s a brilliant psychotherapeutic tool, which has become the only reason for me to take a phenethylamine anyway.  I guess you probably didn’t approach it that way since you seem to focus on the bland visuals, extreme time dilation, body load, bitter taste, etc.  It’s not something to party with.  Lol.


The cognitive effects of this one don’t even begin to manifest (for me) until at least the fourth or fifth hour.  The body has always felt fine but it is a long experience.  Among other things it has allowed me to deal with the past (provides unrivalled, clear access to hazy and repressed memories) and focus on the future in constructive ways.  Maybe you haven’t sought out this type of experience, maybe you don’t need to, but it works very well in this context.


I noticed you killed or altered your trips early.  Set, setting and purpose is all I can say.

The effects I got were not at all what I was expecting going in to it. The only reason I aborted (or attempted to abort![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) several of the experiences is there was nothing good coming from the chemical I just did not get along with 2c-t-4 nearly as well as any of the other phens I have tried and loved. In my mind, it is a dud.

Hmmm, well what happened in my case then santadog?  I certainly approached it as a therapuetic tool and had taken it for insights (took the day off work so I could be alone all day with my thoughts) but never got much as far as any insights.  In general, it is pretty rare for me to take any psychedelic for recreation.  With T4 my mind was cloudy....more trance-like and dreamy than the clear-head I associate with the other 2Cs.


But as I said, I am hopeful another try (at a lower dose) may show some value.

Maybe if more people contribute, we can take this 2c-t-4 thread and Big and Dandy'fy it. I am surprised there is not one already.

In the book Thanatos to Eros, there is a small bit on 2C-T-4.


> 2C-T-4
> 
> 
> 
> 2C-T-4, code name for 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(i)-propylthiophenethylamine, has characteristics quite similar to 2C-T-2 except that it is considerably longer acting. We have had it only twice, and our first experience with it was outstanding. We found it more benign than 2C-T-2, perhaps because lasting all day and evening, the intensity of the chemical grew more gradu ally and was easier to handle. We found it a superb way to put in a long day. Here is a report of our first trial:
> 
>

> Jean takes 8 m.g. and I take 9 m.g. of 2C-T-4. We have a marvelous ascent -- clean, gentle, and smooth. Our perception is heightened, and conversation is easy. We enjoy talking over many things for which we ordinarily don't take time.
> 
> 
> 
> I spend a good deal of time exploring inside, which is very rewarding. It is easy to explore questions and find answers. I strike a deep loneliness, which resolves as my love for myself grows. I focus on self-love until I finally break free with a substantial appreciation of myself. This is most fulfilling.
> 
> 
> 
> The experience grows in intensity over a three hour period, and stays at the peak for many hours afterward. It becomes a complete, profound, and thorough exploration. This is a remarkable substance, allowing me to look anywhere and explore any chosen subject. Bodywise, it is clean and clear. The experience remains smooth and gentle. Even exploring uncomfortable areas, there is still a good feeling tone. I see clearly into my own functioning, relationships, the dynamics of people I focus on, and general philosophical truths.
> 
> 
> 
> I find it best to let go and simply flow with the experience, following wherever it takes me. This leads to a growing euphoria, a feeling of clearing out body residues, and often culminates in profound insight. Thinking continues to grow in clarity throughout the day, and visual perception is crystal clear. The scenery is outstanding. Closeness and understanding with Jean develop steadily during the day. It is a most enjoyable time together.
> 
> 
> 
> A major problem I work on is the sluggish feelings that arise from time to time. I find it best to simply ride them through. As the day develops, it becomes easier to change my feelings by changing the focus of my thoughts. A major lesson is honesty, to simply be what I am with all of my idiosyncrasies, and stop trying to make things different. I achieve an exceptional state of peace and contentment with myself and the way things are.
> 
> 
> 
> Dancing to high energy dance music uncovers a lot of new, intense feelings, leading to some of the most profound realizations of the day. I strike a profound dichotomy: on the one hand, everyone is God and can resolve their own burdens, so I don't have to do anything. On the other hand, I am Christ and only by my being willing to lift the burden of others can the world be helped. [This is somewhat like a high level realization I experienced sometime later with my friend Gil (see Chapter 11), that the highest state of all is caring with all of your might, while simultaneously not caring with all of your might. Whoever comprehends this is well along the path!]

I hope it works for me that way at the lower level I intend to try.  18mg was just too much.  Santa...what dosages do you prefer to work with?

I don’t know what happened in your case seedy, how would I?  Depending on whose body you place them in these compounds just seem to affect people differently.  I hope you try again someday though.


I love Stolaroff’s work by the way, thanks for including that text.


I’ve worked with dosages from 5 – 25mg.  If I were to go again, which would probably be a long time from now, I’d reckon the sweet spot (for me) to be around 16mg.  Being that I’m 5’10” 175lbs and a phen lightweight.


Glad we’re finally getting around to discussing this one ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

MGS, the person in your text seemed to have a much more enjoyably time with 2c-t-4 than I. It should be noted that my brother and friend B both explored 2c-t-4 at similar doses and found the character to be very much the same as me. 


This one seems very variable, and yet very similar in action, though not in length.


Santadog, the closest thing I found to a sweet spot was during the course of other drugs during the 2c-t-4 trip. Alone it is almost as miserable as a-o, dms.

guess I'm just lucky then!  %)


Of course Stolaroff reported a big positive  ++++ on 2CT8, too.  

Maybe we’re just a bit, uh, odd.    :-S

Well I was being sarcastic because you were quick to find the cause of the OP's terrible time.  I figured you would be able to answer for me as well.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Of course you would have no way of knowing why I found T4 to be such an anomaly.

I tried it twice - once at 5mg and once at 10mg. I got the dissociative feeling like crap feeling both times. When I got it there was not much info out there and I was expecting a different flavor of 2ct2 or 2ct7, but the wierd side effect and stoned feeling were really unpleasant and both times I was eager to end the trip. I have never tried any combinations since I didn't enjoy it on its own and figured that it would ruin the effect of the other molecule combined with it. 

I planned on trying again, but there are so many better things available that it may be a while...

I know its a very large dose, but Ive had one of themost visual experiances of my life on 2C-T-4. (38mg), a friend who took 30mg that night had a severe psychotic break, which ruined the trip. 

 Theres extreme nausea coming up on this amount, and overall the body discomfort isnt worth it, but Ill never forget seeing that ufo hovering outside my house....

I had a very minimal visual experience each time I did 2c-t-4. I get almost as much visual effect from cannabis alone. The trails were basically the only visual manifestation of the chem.

I forgot to mention that I also combined 2c-t-4 with an A. perigrina snuff. The snuff totaly changed the nature of the trip within a minute. I went from a partially disassociated place to a full on visionary state. The 2c-t-4 seemed to mellow out the physical effects of the 5-ho-dmt. I still became very ill and purged, but the pressure was mostly lacking. The nature of the experience still has me wondering about an A. perigrina + DXM combo at some point.

From my experience this chemical is without major visuals. It's more like head and body psychedelic. Over all I enjoy it's effects... bit long lasting but I had longer lasting chem's. I didn't vomit but body load was little too much than I've used too. Definitely giving this chem a try again.

My 2C-T-4 was obtained in 2003 and has had independent lab analysis to confirm authenticity.  To my knowledge, this was a fairly limited batch.  I do not know how many others made the rounds...

2c-t-4 felt a lot like a trippy methylone.  Unlike methylone, the euphoria felt natural, never forced or synthetic.  Parts of the trip were very cosmic, out of body feeling not noted in other 2c's.

I got some of this on the way and should be arriving soon, I cant wait to give it a try! It was a touch choice between this and some 2C-T-2. I decided to go with the T-4 due to reports saying it is less as intense on the body. Although that was never an issue before, it seems to be a rather prominent factor as of lately. I noticed this was never an issue before till I went through a month smoking heroin and due to noticing an addiction on a substance I only meant to try once (I don't have an addictive personality at all, i have never once, till now, had an issue stopping anything I didn't want to be doing anymore) I took a relatively large dose of 2C-E (25mg) to cause a "bad" trip (nothing physically bad, just enough to get trapped and lost in dark thoughts) allowing me to see the path this was leading me and giving me the strength to stay away and get rid of all that I had left (this worked with great success).


2C-T-7 has been my favorite substance. Now, I may be a bit biased being as it gave me [my first full fledged ++++ experience](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=417762&highlight=substancecode_2ct7) (never replicated, even at higher doses. Truly a set and setting influence). Yet that Mescaline like mindset it leaves me with keeps me coming back. As well as the very unique visuals. T-7 seems to be quite potent to me, and I know it is quite the opposite for many people. This, making me wonder if that is the reason some people only get mild reactions and not very visual results.


I have also seen this substance a few times said to have similar qualities to 2C-E which is probably my most ingested substance. Beautiful visuals and a great mindplace (assuming I am in a pleasant mood during ingestion). I take this more than T-7 simply due to how intense T-7 works on me. Now I am not expecting this necessarily to be anywhere near what T-7 or 2C-E did to me, if I was looking for that I would just mix the T-7 I have with the 2C-E sitting right next to it... What I am hoping for is a mellower experience, more functional than while on 2C-E or T-7 but still to have some of the great traits I have come to love in both. Again, i will be taking this without any expectations as that tends to only lessen or add disappointment to the experience. I'll have plenty to play with so there a few different experiments I have in mind to try.

I tried this twice. from 2 different batches (one from the pre-webtryp days and one coming out of Amsterdam in pills)

I don´t remember dosage, but I think it was around 14 mg both times.


What can I say.....it wasn´t bad as such. Visualy it reminded me of a toned down version of 2ct2. I did have CEVs and OEVs and "breathing", colours were enhanced.


it diffenetily was visual, and still I´d say it´s the least visual 2c I have tried.


I didn´t get nausea or any other kind of body load, as far as I remember.


its interesting what Igor writes about it being dissociative. Because that´s actualy what I have been thinking too, without being able to put a finger on it. 

Becuse I don´t have that much experience with dissociatives. 


 it´s not really a fun party drug as such, that´s for sure.


there is something really wierd about 2ct4, I haven´t experienced on other phenethylamines. So I do think it´s actualy kind of worthwhile to try.

So what is suggested dose for the first time with this chemical? I think I will start with 12 mg. 

I am somewhat sensitive to 2Cs, and 16 mg of 2C-E is a very good dose for me.

If 16 mg 2C-E is good for you I think that 12 mg 2C-T-4 should be just enough .

Ok, thank you. Maybe I will do a little less, like 10 mg. 

At what time after ingestion comedown starts/peak occurs? 


I really hope to experiment with this compound in the near future, but I don't have proper setting. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

With the pre-webtryp batch I tried, the alert came, In about 1/2 hour after dosing, but it was in the 3+ hours to the peak;so those figures are pretty close. The duration, however was more like 14-16 hours with residual stimulation preventing sleep for 5-6 hours after the trip meaning it was close to 24 hours before sleep could be attained without mirtazipine. The short duration people are talking about with newer batches makes me wonder what it really is...

^Its longer than 2C-P for sure, and with 20+mg T-4 I personally wouldnt expect to sleep for 14-18 hours. I pushed the pre-webtryp stuff to 35mg, and that lasted well over 24 hours

**2C-T-4 - Insufflation**


I recently have found myself unable to ingest orally any 2C-x and so have taken to snorting them. I would like to take 2C-T-4 with a close friend, but she will be ingesting it orally almost certainly (it does burn quite badly). I know snorting tends to shorten a trip and require a bit less for a first dose. If I wanted to trip roughly the same (with respect to time mostly, but intensity would be nice as well) as someone ingesting orally, how would I do this best? She will be having 15mg; I have 20mg to work with. I was thinking 10mg and then 5mg bumps at 2h and 3h? 1h and 2h? Is 10mg too much to start with? I have had 25mg orally (hence, I cannot eat 2Cs) and I found it enjoyable except for some of the side effects, but I have developed methods to prevent these.


Any help would be appreciated. I can't seem to find any specifics for 2C-T-4 insufflation. Or really anything on oral dosage. The pains of RCs.

Why exactly are you unable to orally ingest 2C's ? It is not clear from your post.


Most people consider the effects of insufflated 2C's (not to mention most tryptamines) to be inferior to oral administration.


Also this probably belongs in the Big & Dandy 2C-T-4 Thread:

Thank you! That's very helpful. I took a 25mg dose of 2C-T-4 once and I had tremors throughout my entire body for 10 hours straight. It was very uncomfortable, obviously. Now, just before I start the come-up on any 2C, I get bad stomach cramps and throw up fairly violently. This has only happened twice, but it was significantly more painful the second time, so I'd rather not even try to push it. I'd like to be able to eat them, but I'm willing to snort, at least for now.


Thank you for your help!

Hey so I should be getting a bit of this soon in freebase form. I've never worked with a freebase PEA before, I'd assume it's smokable? Is there any difference in dosing?

I thought I would report back on the insufflation. The most noticeable difference was that it only lasted 6 hours. Completely down at 8. I didn't notice at the time, but there was no body load. I'm probably done with 2C-T-4. On a side note, I tried 2C-B orally and it worked fine, no body load, even. Definitely the best 2C. I imagine this is already known in some circles.

I;m getting some of this in the next few days. Excited to try it for my 1st time. I am curious why there is so little info about this chem. From reading the info I could find it seems like a very interesting chemical. 


I'm thinking of starting out with 20mg since I have a high natural tolerance to PEAs (10mg 2C-p is moderate dose for me). 


People have mentioned the dissociative effect of this. My question is what does that compare to? MXE? I was thinking maybe like the 1st few times I tried 5-MEO-Dalt it kind of gave me a dissociative effect. I was wondering if it was more like that. I don't enjoy the effects of MXE but did enjoy that feeling on DALT.


I know the chemical is nothing like these but I'm just asking about that specific quality in that one part of the effect profile.

This feels very similar to 2C-T-7 but is a bit more relaxed and not as awesome on the body but is still quite a gem. Certainly loved it at 15-18 mg range and would not recommend a higher dose for first timers. The time frame is not exaggerated in PIHKAL at all, was still going 12-14 hours later and had to get to sleep with etizolam. I liked it quite a bit but it just lasted a lot longer than I had time for. Will try to add more to this when asked but it was nothing like the MXE dissociation or the ketamine dissociation but it was more of just a calm disconnected feel. I did combine it with MXE 10 hours after initially dosing but I came into a state that was pretty paranoid and maybe a bit manic.


I would recommend starting early in the day with this one at 6 AM or so if possible, was very lighthearted and very easy to talk to others. Very in tune with emotion and thoughts of others plus the body high was very nice. Visuals were also suprisingly active for me which is not a usual thing. Had some patterning on the carpet and ceiling and the walls were wavy at times too.

Took 12 mg at 6.30 pm last night. Haven't slept since then, feeling a bit weird as well. I was still tripping some at 4 AM and smoked a bit of weed which was very pleasant. I lay down in bed and was hit with gruesome mental imagery so I took an etizolam to help me sleep, no dice, took another, no dice as well.


Anyone very similar to 2C-T-2, much less nauseating, much longer, great visuals, fantastic body high.

I insufflated around 15mg last october. I chose this ROA out of impatience to avoid dosing on a full stomach. The pain was considerable and persistent, but manageable. What got to me was the violent reaction of the delicate mucous membrane, it produced, well, quite a lot of mucous membrane. My nose was completely clogged within a minute and started running which it did for the next three hours and was abi sore throughout. My eyes watered and the stream of tears also seemed to have no end. The horrible chemical smell which reminded me of petroleum and topped the ghastly sensation of insufflated DPT. The drip also accompanied most of the plateau, I kept drinking soda to wash it down. Blech! As you would expect snorting kickstarted the trip almost instantly but it took still 30 minutes to fulky develop. The experience was shorter and more uneven than a comparable oral dose would have been and I was too much distracted by the unpleasant sensations at the beginning. In short I'd recommend to stick with oral dosing. Just wanted to let you know. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**2c-t-4: Wheres the Info.**


Hey Gang, i recently acquired an order of 2c-t-4. Noticing that there is actually 'VERY' little literature and almost NO trip reports out there about this phenethylamine. I've decided i want to experiment with it first. 

Given that there has already been so much ground covered in the realms of 2c-t-7 and 2c-t-2. With 2c-t-4 I understand that the latitude of this substance is extremely variable with 4-20mg producing wildly different effects across many of it's users according to shulgin. You see out of the 3 compounds i have mentioned. I have only tried the 2c-t-7 once at a very low dose of 13 mg several years ago. Not exactly enough to quantify an hugely admirable response but lets just say i was definitely feeling it. I noted that the T-7 was incredibly relaxing and powerful with it's mind set and CEVS, however being that it was almost 10 years ago now, the only true Phenethylamines i have to base what the experience might be like off of is MDMA, Mescaline and 2c-e and DOC. Nothing will ever treat me the way DOC does It's horrible and i Dislike it. I have heard varying reports about body stimulation being a problem with 2c-t-2, and it being the more "mdma" like out of the T series.

I am interested in trying it, I am just not a fan of excess energy. 


T-4 on the other hand appears as if at least according to shulgin, lacks the stimulation that the 2c-t-2 has. 


Now i have read Murples report on the t-7 and the t-2 and MDMA.

How mdma produced the most side effects, and body load with the greatest feelings of euphoria and a noted drastic decline in the ability to conduct ones normal business.

t-7 produces, the strongest psychedelic response, with the most synesthesia to emotions, and the least stimulation.

t-2 was somewhere in between, only less visual and a bit more empathogenic and less residing in the realm of psychedelia for analyzing oneself and problems and apparently it's a little speedy.


All of these compounds have had deaths, yet reports are wildly varied as to what actually caused alot of these deaths. 


yet t-4 is reported almost no where in the literature. No trip reports. It is noted that the t-4 lasts the Longest out of the T series, or at least that is from what I understand. 

It is even more visual than T-7, it produces MORE psychedelic feelings and it allows you to RAPIDLY get in tune with the world around you more so than T-2.


I am thinking i'm going to start with 11.7 mg with a possible 3mg Booster. My girlfriend is going to start with 9mg because she us lighter than me. I'm going to watch my diet this week, as we really are uncertain as to the MAOI inhibiting properties of these compounds and if things like Cheese Brain Syndrome can occur. If anyone has had any recent experience with any of these compounds, please share your story as it has been since august before i subjected myself to a 12 hour experience. I had a 6 hour ayahuasca experience on New years which, Did... and didn't work. Problem being i woke up the next morning going... "where'd my night go" 


Then i got cascaded with all of the revelations the following morning. 


I want the compound to take my soul out and make me look at it. I'm thinking t-4 just might be the one to pick.


I like to think that the reason why so many 14-15 year old kids like to take their first psychedelic drug like mushrooms or LSD to music like Pink Floyd or The Doors, or Led Zeppelin, is because.

That realm is "safe" especially if you are taking LSD, and alot of people have listened to that music and been in that area no one has had a "bad" time exploring that, except for maybe the first couple of explorers who had to get used to it.

The idea of being able to enter a psychedelic zone if you will that has been relatively uncharted, i find at least leaves more open room for moving around and perceiving depths of consciousness which still remain hidden.

I seek to discover these realms and chart them and put a little enochian key flag in there. So when one of you guys take the same compound and come across some crazy symbol within the depths of mystical conciousness. 

You'll think of me! and break into hysterics! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Edit:  T4 seemed more like a dissociative than a colorful psychedelic...I never took it but one time...18mg or so.  Not my favorite stuff.

PPS, one thing about PIHKAL is that book 1 has an entire chapter devoted to 2C-T-4 and a ++++...and ya gotta get the book to read it.  "Lab Notes" is online at erowid and should have some more T4 info.

I have read it. But once again if you take into consideration that 2c-t-2 and 2c-t-7 have hundreds upon hundreds of reports.


Shulgins experiences with t-4, were primarily flirting ++++ experience. Yet everyone here on bluelight has pretty much given it the thumbs down. 


I did find the t-4 thread, and i have read it. Honestly it sounds exactly like what i want, if not a little bit too sedating.

Not to be rude, but I don't undertsand the purpose of this thread then? Is it some kind of personal blog were you muse over your expectectations for 2C-T-4, or what?


If you don't believe us when we say it's not as good as the other 2C-T's, you should just get along and try it. You might actually really like it. ,


Be sure to write a trip report.

Yeah thats what i am doing. I'm just setting up the forum now. Mentally preparing myself for what i expect is going to be a ++++ experience if i set up the setting properly and live extra healthy this week.  Keep the house clean, do a bit of meditation after work, Basically i am going to go into the experience with the expectation that Shulgin had, going into it with Ann later on. Expecting ++++ getting +++. Who knows what kind of portals will open up. Other thing is through reading alot of Trip reports. I also like to try to determine who is still around and what metabolic qualities i share in common with some of you guys. What doesn't work for a few of you guys, actually works for me, sometimes better. While other compounds like DOC 2c-i and 2c-c produce wicked body stimulation in me which i find horrid.


Ultimately after reading that chapter in Pihkal  about how is was a completely unguarded ++++ and then looking and actually realizing this compound hasn't been touched by anyone in months.

Then, realizing that this one is very low in the body energy department, i signed myself up. 


Achten, i think it's funny that you said the T-4 was less intense than 2c-e. I find 2c-e to be absolutely heavenly.

What kind of comparison could you make between the two compounds.

There are reports about - I put 3 on here myself.

2ct-4 and 2c-e are nothing like each other for me I have to say. 2ct-4 has a lot of that 'rational calm' that the 2c-ts have. 2C-E is much wilder and different territry. I'd say the dosage is more between 10-2mg for T4; found it contemplative stuff, not overly empathic (but somethere) even though it was quite mild I can see it would allow deeper level of experience in the right situ/hands. Not the best but definatly not a thumbs down - maybe rather long. Certainly not too stimmy comparied with Do-x and 2C-I but at the end of the day you will have to try it to see how you take it.

You see thats what i have been reading. 2c-e for me always produces this profound relaxation for the first 6 hours of the experience which culminates into something truly astonishing nearing the end. Something i define as a mescalinesque god head experience where you feel as if you know everything in the universe. It's  very ego driven nearing the end. Almost as if the first 6 hours were meant to destroy you and the next 6 hours were meant to rebuild you.  The t-4 sounds to be like it's going to be almost as sleepy or dreamy as mushrooms with feelings totally separate from most other psychedelic experiences. 

I always get a sort of DNA awakening feeling when i do ayahuasca, which usually renders me unconscious for 2-3 hours of the trip. Sometimes the entire trip. It's quite fascinating. This T-4 sounds like some kind of potent chemical Mescayahuasca with less adrenal effects found from the other similar compounds. All while maintaining a hyper sexuality and a blissful zone of tranquility. I am quite happy there is no body simulation involved with this compound. I am extremely interested in the body and spiritual work which this compound will have, which i feel will then lead into a more highly visual experience 


and given that i feel most drugs act as gate ways. This gate way, or mirror into a zone of conciousness seems ripe for the plucking of new information.


Okay for example as to what i mean by gate way Seroquel is the most commonly used Psychoactive in the Prison System.

In the outside world people take it for depression, which is a feeling of being trapped the world is closing in and a mixture of profound sadness.

I like to think that if people are taking a drug in an attempt to cure a symptom while there are people who there who are using it to ignore a symptom, that creates a "gate way" or at least a realm where more negativity or at least inexplicable feelings from others. Ultimately i consider t-4 really uncharted territory. it still has alot to tell the human nervous system. IF we do live in a closed consciousness, i want this to be an incredibly pure experience where i draw much knowledge not only about myself but about the world around me from it. Really looking forward to this up coming weekend. I want the universe to look through my eyes for a change. That is from what my understanding is what Shulgin felt during his profound experience with it.


Also i am not on seroquel, i just use that to base my strange temporal thesis, that alot of people can visit an area or a dimension and they are unaware of what they are leaving when they both enter it, and when they leave.

This compound sounds extremely malleable in all forms. With a deliciously spiritual side that surpasses the pleasurable aspects of other compounds. Frankly i'm tired with pleasure. I want absolute soul truth milked from my receptors with divine intent.

I don't know; maybe your over thinking this one and just need to try the substance; it may have some parallels with other PEAs here and there but none with mushrooms

I'm all for becoming pumped about psychedelics but I would have to agree with the sentiment that you should just try it first before expecting too much out of it.... I really don't know where you're getting this super psyched attitude about 2C-T-4 from because honestly I've never read anything about it to suggest that it's really that intense of a drug, not that I'm not interested in it.... Well, happy travels either way. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

You see i am all for getting pumped because in PiHKAL, if you don't own the book, you won't be able to find this online, unless you download the full version of the book.

Pihkal has an entire chapter dedicated to the time 2c-t-4 pulled the rug out from underneath Alexanders feet and thrusted him into a ++++ for better or worse, i want that.

I am just praying to the gods that are it will do so without a vicarious atonement.

I do have the book, though I haven't read that chapter yet. I don't doubt that it's interesting and intense there, I just think that that alone shouldn't be enough to convince you that you can get a ++++ with it just like that. At least, like I said, I would definitely try it first before setting any expectations.... Shulgin may have had an intense trip, but the large majority of reports I've read on it haven't reflected that level of strength, certainly not as much as something like 2C-T-7 (just to continue the comparison). Part of the whole point of the ++++ experience anyway is that it's not necessarily repeatable, and from everything I've ever seen, read, or experienced it can happen literally at any time on any drug. I just think there are better ways to go about it than specializing on one drug with a comparitively smaller amount of human reports. Again, not to discourage its use or anything, I just think an open mind should be kept....

That is a key point.  Personally, I hope Psychonautical find all he seeks in 2C-T-4.  I know I was like a kid at Chanukah when I scored some T4.  Like you, I had read the chapter in PIHKAL and since I was (still am ) a devote of all things 2C-T-7...I figured the T4 compound had to be something REALLY special....and it just wasn't.  In hindsight, a lot of psychedelics will give me a very positive experience first time around...and then experiences tend to become more ordinary.  If they don't shine the first time, there isn't much motivation to return and that is why 2C-T-4 was only tried the one time.   If anything, I hope you have such a moving experience that you convince me to give it another spin.  I do look forward to hearing more from you.

You see, i have tried of of the other 2c's and several other tryptamines and various plants. 

My whole idea behind the concept of a plus ++++ isn't about OMG i'm SO HIGH, it's about finding SOMA, relatively quickly. 

2c-b for me is carnival mdma. Everything is the colors of the carnival.

2c-i is electric, and speedy and makes me sweaty and anxious.

2c-d is somatic, but it takes a very high dose to reach an admirable psychedelic level. I have never gotten higher than a PROFOUND ++ where, when i thought about architectural designs the walls of my house would bless me with scenes from Rome.

2c-e gives me something like a ++++ for 6 hours and then i become this macho over ego'd comedian nearing the end of the trip. It's awesome but it feels very bi-polar which is why i have always respected that compound and spaced it out more often after i have the incident where i did it in an increasing dose over a period of a couple days... but i think we have all done that one time or another with a compound. next to that solitary time, i have alway respected it and adjusted something about my lifestyle before taking it which then allowed me deeper access to hidden knowledge within myself, showing me more, over simple things. 


Ayahuasca is a different story, as is mescaline but once again you can reach almost any plateau you want with those, which is rather ridiculous.

You just won't always remember it. But that doesn't mean you are running around naked eating faces. It usually puts you into a somatic trance and you wake up on the floor, or in your bed unaware of how you got there followed by a cascade of revelations and knowledge upon your awakening which lingers around for a long time, unlike waking up from a dream.


Now the t-4, due to it's profundity it seems to have to depended on perhaps a series of things. Drug use leading up to the imbibing of the material, Social dramas and life dilemmas leading up to said experience weighing on your mind, and well set and setting. All determine ones openness to an experience.

I'm basically going and making this like a sacrament from the book of Pihkal. I am establishing from everyone what they have felt from it. Alot of you guys don't really enjoy it... Thats fine. 

I feel it will be somatic, due to the fact it slows down time to what sounds like an absolutely insane degree without increasing heart rate or blood pressure too badly, there by allowing you to easily flow into a state of meditation or samadhi quicker.

Through that i feel there will always be something existential or magical at play.


Thanks everyone for your thoughts and linking me up. but i already knew that erowid only had about 16-20 trip reports for this substance and none of them actually detailed alot.

I wanted to let you guys know i have been sober since august, no amphetamines, occasional Noopept. I did a run for about 30 days on it constantly.

Marijuana and Coffee Daily.

Uhm. lemme think So yes that is my idea of sober. I also adjusted my diet to include no bacon or pork or beef or cheese, or other heavy foods leading up to it. Allowing my metabolic  path ways to be more open to the compound.

So ultimately... i am treating it like a sacrament, and if i experience something sacred. I'll report back soon ^.^ probably on sunday.

I for one look forward to reading of your trip.  In my own case, I did go into it with the same reverence as you seem to have and concluded it was the material that was lacking....but as pointed out the very nature of a ++++ is that it is unpredictable.


If you get a ++++ I'll make sure to leave the T4 to you in my will.

Short answer: none

 I found 2C-T4 at 15mg more clearheaded, with less bodyload than 25mg 2C-E. 

As someone else said, 2C-E is wild territory. Never "fun" in the same sense of other psychedelics. I rarely do 20+mg more than once a year.


2C-T4 feels more mellow, but that doesn't mean it's less therapeutical, IMO. I believe T4 could be used in psyhotherapy, for that matter. 2C-E is too unpredictable to do this, IMO.

I will second 2C-E being unpredictable but that could also be because I've taken it less than any of the others and I don't know it very well.  But that says a lot about 2C-E...that it is not my 'go to psychedelic' like 2C-B or 2C-C.  2C-E is utterly serious with a tendency to be neutral.  A little bit of heaven and hell is to be found there, often in the same night.  My last go with 2C-E (@ 18mg) was some serious tripping...I love every moment but it was challenging to say the least...and if I were new to psychedelics it is quite likely the experience would have scared the shit out of me.

2c-e is somatic for 6 hours after it kicks in. I would say if you have never experienced the feeling of being completely manic while in total control, Then you probably would get a little bit drunk with power during the tail end of the trip. Or at least that is what i like to say. If i was to do like 10-12mg of 2c-e. There is no possible way i could go out with the intention of being  in a social situation in a public place for first 6 hours of the experience. Too much synesthesia and mind games. But the last 6 hours almost craves attention if not demands it. Like you need to go out and tell people all of the wonderful things you figured out this afternoon, With quite a bit of restraint that god headed better than everything around you, because you "KNOW SOMETHING" while rocking the highest of low vibrations in a really good way can be put to extremely good use. 


For example. My girlfriend and i did 17 Mg of 2c-e on a Sunny Afternoon one weekend. When we came too or "when we weren't so somatically inclined to just lay back and become one with the music" My roommate came home all excited about how he had like 5 tickets to bassnectar in toronto and was wondering if we wanted to go. Funny part was, it was right at that turning point in the trip, where the glimmer of blissful samadhi is slowly being replaced with a divine amount of ego. So we both said yes and turned on some Bassnectar with our roommate, which totally blew apart the entheogenic and ott we were listening to all afternoon. Got in the car, which was literally a 2 hour space ship ride down the highway to toronto. We ate 2mg more each in the car ride which was a mistake in the BEST possible way.


When we got into bassnectar, we were wondering why everyone was clamoring over each other to "see" the stage. The stage was so goddamn big and loud that there was no need to be at the front. Being that we were so hellishly high, we mostly just clung to each other for dear life, when the bass would rip it's way through the crowd, being that everyone there was on some kind of phenethylamine like mdma or the sort, we realized that we were on the King of Phenethylamines, and we laughed like drunken mad gods with all of the energy we were absorbing like demons just off of the crowd given that they were completely unaware of how open they were on mdma and how high we were on 2c-e. So there was this recombiant resurgence of energy which lashed off the crowd which was literally making us drunk with power and the bass was not helping, we went outside onto the patio to smoke oil of out my cigarette vaporizer. Big fucking mistake, i didn't change the filter, and there was some DMT residue inside of it, and i didn't smell it before hand. so this plooom of mothball smelling smoke pours out of my mouth. suddenly standing around acting like a cool 'God' isn't so cool anymore. Immediate ego dissolution into a state of strange eerie panic, where i realize all of the energy i was absorbing from the crowd was a culmination of their own unprocessed emotional states, and i began to feel a somatic understanding to individual feelings which peeled off of the slip stream and brought me to my knees. Thank god the concert ended 5 minutes after my toke because i just couldn't handle life anymore at that point. When we got in the car where i could lie down and and contemplate the night with my head on my girlfriends lap, and my friends playing some acoustic modest mouse interlaced with tool to calm me down. Truly a ++++ experience in every way shape and form, but it was like a ++++ i could control, given i have experience with that compound. It was a night of hedonism and reckless fun interlaced with alot of strange understandings of the electronic scene today, and how energy works especially when it has no direction. The Afternoon on the other hand, was literally like we were in heaven, followed by the evening when we drove to hell, to be entertained in a Hellish way. My girlfriend and i literally said that the amount of sheer power we absorbed off the crowd that night will probably keep us living to being 110 years old... lol.

That sounds intense.  The whole time last go we both remarked that 'we could see where this could go wrong' referring to how out of body intense it was...and how being in some public settings could make for a difficult ride given that state of mind.  I can imagine the power you felt at going through such an experience in such as setting as that.  Very intense!


I know your T4 report will be a fascinating read no matter how you rate the material.

Yeah if you are with people you trust who aren't going to play mind games out side of what i have perceived the ability as being able to hear them and see them. I remember one time, i did like you know 7-10 mg of 2c-e in the early morning, a long time ago.

Thats the other thing, i can recall every single 2c-e experience as if it's still a fresh memory. In the evening I got invited over to my friend matthews apartment to smoke some bowls. I remember walking there, and i was just loving it outside, the sky was shuddering in effervescent hues of magenta and neon cluster fuck as i enjoy to call it. I get to the apartment and not only is everyone smoking weed, but they are drinking and playing video games. I was there for maybe about 20 minutes before there was a level of robotic servitude to the alcohol the television and the marijuana that was slowing time down. I remember my ego took over, and i said "Well if you guys were having as much fun as me, you would leave to" and apparently i said it proudly as if it was a good thing as i was leaving Which i can understand to a bunch of drunken stoned friends as being a pretty negative thing you could say to them. I never took it into account until days later, when i needed to buy weed off of them, and they are generally all around good people but i guess my energy really challenged them for the rest of their night and it kind of pissed them off and they talked to me about it later on. I also never told them i was on anything when i went over there, so I was all around rude, but not so much rude, as just Honest, and WAAAAAY over perceptive at the moment.  You just REALLY need to watch your Ego and Mouth on 2c-e like warn people before hand, "guys, i just took a drug that made me perceive  heaven and now i feel a tad mouthy because i know this is hell."

Gosh I was hoping to read more about 2CT-4 in this thread...there's already so much on 2C-E and the others.

Of course I could see some therapuetic value in T4 Achten but that's maybe true of most psychedelics...but certainly I could see it being better than some of the 2C's in that respect...it seemed more clearheaded/thoughtful/introspective then some (almost smart drug on occaission). T4s major drawback in this respect is it's long duration but it is introspective and thoughtful material. I can see why some under rate it; it's not flashy at all but I am not surprised some could a deep experience on it. Very little bodyload. outwardly it seems quite mild, calm and easy to handle, maybe even hard to define but there can be a subtle magic to it; quite different to most of the 2Cs, I never noted anything dissasociative at all (mostly rather in body) but for such a subtle compound I guess it could manafest in quite a range of way on different trips.

2c-t-4 for me is easily the most easy going in terms of body load/stimulation of the 2c's I've tried. Its a smooth transition from sober to tripping. There isn't too much of a difference in the duration when taken orally vs insufflated, maybe an hour or 2 difference both around the 12 14 hour mark give or take. Visually its beautiful, and has a bit of a different twist when compared to other 2c visuals, but mentally I can never put my finger on it. I'll find myself contemplating things but I never find a solid answer, but it definitely does put a funny twist on things.

10:50 Ingestion on an empty stomach following two cups of coffee. My scale kept on jumping between 11 and 15 no matter how many times we re-weighed it. My girlfriends kept bouncing between 9-11. Suspected amount taken a mean of roughly 9-13mg each. 

10:52: Turned on some music. Catch you all on the flip side.

11:48: Using milk drop visualizer to music, it seems to capture the essence of the fractals, but when i look away from the screen it is as if i am responsible for their placement, not their geometric shaping.

it lingers in my field of vision for a long time. Ultimately this is a roaring plus one. The thing that 2c-e likes to do is trick you into it's working, but then it doesn't do anything for awhile longer, then a glimmer of high then BAM you are fucked. This is... about as sleepy as mushrooms, with glimmers of a euphoria which reminds of me slightly of mdma, with no body load... there won't be anything else added to this as i can already feel my eyes becoming more alive and giving all of my energy to typing and the computer screen is not how i want to spend my trip. So... yes... lets hope this metabolizes into something wonderful.

12:29 extreme time dialation beings along with weird mixtures of somatic bliss, combined with attentive talking. The Somatic parts are FILLED with an onflux of totally rational perspectives about things that occur in your daily life.

This drug, is a mirror so far it's reflections hold none of the jadedness of mushrooms or the unreality of LSD.


12:32 we are getting the same feeling we get from 2c-e right before it seems to come on stronger, which is a question that lingers inside of your mind "did i do enough" 5-8mg in the shulgin print. We took 10-13 and it's barely been two hours, Do not do this. Lolol. 

[video=youtube_share;OlleM0sU7yg]http://youtu.be/OlleM0sU7yg[/video] 

last side note over the last hour, i've been experiencing that weird... Lung metabolism feeling... it's quite strange.


I must say during this come up this is the most sober and fucked i've ever felt outside of Allylescaline, and 4-aco-dmt. 

Something is happening. In the background and when you want to focus on it, it's alot. But then it goes away and seems to come back. 

Enjoy the tune.

i only had 100mg of this stuff to work with back in the day.... highest dose i took was i believe 25mg.... was much more fulfilling at high doses in my experience.  the lower end of the dosage range that shulgin listed was too transparent for my liking.


seemed more suitable for high-dose exploration than, say 2C-I.... which i prefer to take lower doses of.

Okay, so where do i begin with this compound. Honestly, i feel a little derped at the moment. So this will not be the complete trip.

Celeste had a roaring +++.5 and i barely got past ++.5 but just being in the room for the divine stuff that Celeste was experiencing was amazing.

This stuff, is gold. I just dosed way too low and never bothered to redose during the day. 


I shall write a full trip report through out the day today have hopefully get it posted by tonight. I'm just rather sleepy still.


Also if you ever get a chance to watch 

The Watership down while under the influence of this compound. Do it. 

it's worth it.

I swear half of the enjoyment with all of the substances is the degree of influence they have upon one's own writing and creativity.  I can't help but feel on some level people are depriving themselves of the full experience that can be gained by taking these things and not writing about the effects but I always was a nerd.

Okay so honestly there really isn't anyway to describe this drug, how it works, and it's effects, because in an attempt to be discernible, it all comes back around to 

"that just has to be the t-4." So when it was taken, rather than any kind of increase in emotions there was a heavy zoning. Everything slowed down to a grinding halt.

Time literally went on forever. We listened to alot of bluetech and Ott and Eskmo for the first 4 -6 hours of the trip. During that time, we shared the couches. 

I asked Celeste what she was feeling, and she said she was just in absolute tranquility and ecstasy. We pretty much didn't move or speak until like 2 or 3 in the afternoon.


i'd like to say that the first 4 hours of the experience are MARKED, with a somatic ecstasy that i don't feel is easily repeatable with other compounds. Unlike other compounds where the worlds are shared, we were each taken into the Atom Heart mother of ourselves, and there was no way we could "share" the experience outside of physical contact.  This compound is one where if you give yourself unto it, and don't occupy your mind with anything other than the fact that you have just taken a compound it will take you very very very deep. When most people take a drug, they are doing it to see more from the world around them an increase in external senses.

t-4 if definitely about the world inside of yourself or an increase of internal sensors. It's one of those things, that if you had taken, the perfect dose, or if you were alone, instead of getting juiced, it's more like being wrapped in all of the greatest aspects of yourself. 


Around the 5 hour point, i asked Celeste what she was experiencing with eyes closed. She said, it was like there was a brand new program running inside of herself. But only in the background. 

i told her my thoughts during that time were running in a very non congruent pattern. But it was kind of like having the ability to think in absolute free form, how the tail end of one thought immediately using like the last word of the thought, would then evolve into a totally brand new conscious mind frame. then if you can reach the end of that,  "bam" upgrade. Like it's really weird stuff... it felt like an SoS machine ... --- ...

________   ___________   ___________         ___________      _________    ______         

___________________        __________


like that is honestly how i felt my thoughts were running if i had to dedicate a path, the tail end of one would begin another one, generally on a totally different field of thought. 


yesterday it still felt like the effects were running fairly high in the background. This morning even, before work. Like i still feel as if this compound is working out something or like upgrading my conscious projections.


I kept on taking myself out of the trip by seeing if i could do normal things around the house. I.e. Make toast, grab some juice. This compound gave meaning to my repetitive cyclical actions and made me feel extra happy to be doing so.

around the 7th hour, i started to note an increase in body energy. It felt like a tryptamine buzz in my feet, it honestly felt like the switch from the internal to the external had been flicked. 


We watched The Watership Down, got extremely involved with those bunny rabbits, i made some Yaki Soba, and fried some spring rolls.


The whole entire night it was like Celeste was a 5 year old kid, and everything was new and exciting and very emotional. For me, this reminded me of a High dose allylescaline with less Bad physical effects. 

The only other compound that i know which can put me into the zone like this, is 4-aco-dmt, but it's spirit, isn't the same as what lies within the t-4. When alexander shulgin said that a truly depressed person would have a hard time with this drug, as they would have no way to get away from it. I totally understand that. He was working in the pharmacology and psychiatry world. If you are dealing with a depressed patient and you have a compound that is going to make them better, the hardest part is convincing them to take the compound, after that it's easy peasey, the doctor guides the trip as much as, the drug guides the soul. t-4 has no manic edge, instead it literally goes in takes everything that is bothering you and obliterates it into something that just no longer exists in that temporal moment in time. There needs to be more research done with this one out of all of the 2c's i've tried. I honestly feel that this one has THE most therapeutic potential.


it's also really hard to report on effects when they are extremely personal. Like you would have to know me to understand what i mean by a few of these. This drug is by far the most up close and personal i've ever been with myself in a very good way.  Never got insane visuals. But their geometry is Defiantly different from other visuals that i had. Celeste on the other hand however, was a +++.5 she was robbed of being able to voluntarily do things, thus leaving me to be in control. Like get some water, get a blanket, ect. So i am excited to experiment more with this one, and i think you all should do. But for the variety of feelings that i was getting during the deepest points of this experience.I gotta say i am really happy i havn't done any drugs in a really long time, because there is something so subtle yet, so remarkable about this, that i feel any amount of just general brain numbness due to the use of other compounds leading up to this one, would just over shadow it completely. I feel like i have more i want to say, but i wasn't the one who had the fullest experience. Celeste on the other hand, did, but even she said that the sheer level of personal aspects that changed in a subtle way deep down withinside of herself, are impossible to describe, because it's like trying to examine the neuron that was causing the issue to begin with. It's gone, it's upgraded, the experience totally changed something, Neuroplasticity has now evolved into jiggly and full of juice and the new head doesn't have the vocabulary the old head had.

THis is the 'dissociative' aspect that I noted in this compound.

I wouldn't really call it a disassociative anymore than i would call the sleepiness from the initial come up of mushrooms a disassociative. I know there aren't any drug categories out there that encompasses a name outside of benzodiazepines which are responsible for producing this kind of relaxing feeling.  But that kind of relaxation feels more chemical than this. Somatogen!? with synesthetic qualities and radical phosphenes. It's like opium for the soul with a wide array of special personal effects. it honestly feels like the initial tranquil come up on mushrooms with all of the yawns and everything which seems to last all damn day, mixed with a blissful ecstasy from like 3-4mg of xanax, only with heightened and deepened thought processes rather than a totally blank mind state. Which then evolves into an mdma//tryptamine esque trip on it's way out, at the half way point around 8 hours. I would honestly almost consider removing this one from the normal realm of psychedelic and i would almost place it into the world of oneirogen. The fullest of the effects that you will get from it, occur during the sleepy phase. They are extremely deep.  I would also have to then consider this one of the most potent oneirogens there is, because alot of them require several grams if not several hundred grams to work. especially if we are dealing with plant material.

I forgot about the fact that there was a sleepy phase to T4.  Indeed checking my notes, I actually fell asleep briefly during the comeup.


I would agree, nothing about mushrooms is dissociative like...and maybe I should say that nothing about T4 was ketamine/PCP-like....but for lack of a better words, 'dissociative experience' still come to mind when recalling the T4 state.  I'll have to explore the term "oneirogen" a bit more, maybe dream inducing is a better word.

Oneirogen, from the Greek oneiros meaning "dream" and gen "to create," describes that which produces or enhances dream-like states of consciousness. This is characterized by an immersive dream state similar to REM sleep, which can range from realistic to alien or abstract. Many dream-enhancing plants such as Dream Herb (Calea zacatechichi) and African Dream Herb (Entada rheedii), as well as the hallucinogenic Diviner's Sage (Salvia divinorum), have been used for thousands of years in a form of divination through dreams called Oneiromancy, in which practitioners seek to receive psychic or prophetic information during dream states. The term Oneirogen commonly describes a wide array of psychoactive plants and chemicals ranging from normal dream enhancers to intense dissociative or deleriant drugs. Effects experienced with the use of Oneirogens may include Microsleep, Hypnagogia, Fugue states, REM, Hypnic Jerks, Lucid dreams, and even out-of-body experiences. Some Oneirogenic substances are said to have little to no effect on waking consciousness, and will not exhibit their effects until the user falls into a natural sleep state.


I definitely had several microsleeps which lasted full albums of music. The naps felt like there were minutes when they were hours. Meanwhile time in reality seems to crawl at an absolute snails pace beyond comprehension. The hallucinations were more hypnagogic and based off of imagination, after images, and well dreamscapes. None of mine which were very deep.

2C-T-4 is very fine material. I've tried it only once thus far (16mg), but I was impressed. In my estimation, it is almost the equal of 2C-T-7 and better than 2C-T-2. It is less visual than either (although visuals are still there), but it is deeper than T-2 and more thoughtful than T-7. T-4 lacks the sheer euphoria and magic of T-7, but it is more emotionally controlled and potentially therapeutic, yet dreamlike. I found it to be much less dissociative than most people make it out to be; that aspect is present to a certain degree, however. Its depth is reminiscent of 2C-E, but the headspace is less prone to chaos. Another good thing about T-4 is the minimal body load and smooth onset, both of which are similar to 2C-P (2C-P is even better in both of those departments though; incidentally, I tend to prefer 2C-P over 2C-E). All things considered, I would say that 2C-T-4 might be the 4-AcO-DMT of the 2C-x series, and unlike that tryptamine, it doesn't stunt sexual feelings/performance (for me).

This is similar to what I've gotten out of it. Both of my experiences with 2C-T-4 had a surreal quality to them not in the sense that ketamine is surreal but more of the classic state-of-wonder feeling that is often associated with early psychedelic experiences.

I found T4 to have a sort of nootropic effect also. A lot like T21 but without the relentless amphetamine-like push. I'd also have to agree that it smoother/better than T2, but they each have a special place in my heart lol! I will write a tr, it's been a while since I've dosed any or pulled any 2c's out of the archives for that matter - gotta love the stability of phenethylamines!

Yes. This one seems to anoint an experience with an other-worldly innocence. It's almost like redemption. I loved that aspect of it and I'm glad that you mentioned it -- very insightful.

Same here. I find 2C-T-4 to be quite clear-headed and thoughtful, in a serene and natural manner. The emotions are very much engaged as well, yet never overbearing.


I'll test this jewel again in a day or two, but this time at 18mg.

I never got to try this one... I have tried T-2, T-7, and T-21, all a handful of times.  Early reports seemed to not paint too favorable a picture (I'm talking like the things I read when I joined BL in 2006), but more recent posts in this thread make me curious. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

In my case, it would be T-21... ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


Early reports of 2C-T-4 did trend toward the less than keen, but I've always given this compound the benefit of the doubt because of Shulgin's high praise of it. I'm now starting to understand why he devoted a whole chapter to 2C-T-4 in part one of PiHKAL.

Indeed... I'm in the middle of my second trial with this compound -- 18mg oral -- and I'm certainly on my way to understanding. This material is exceptionally awesome. So emotional, so intellectual, so lucid, so physical, so visionary, so artistic, so reassuring, so balanced, so controlled, so human, so humane, and too many other superlatives to list. The less than positive reports on this substance now seem quite incomprehensible to me. 2C-T-4 has now supplanted 2C-T-7 in my estimation of which 2C-x is the greatest. Sasha had it right, and it is a pity that because responses to it are so variable, he instead included T-2 in the Magical Half-Dozen. T-4 deserves that honor vastly more than it's little cousin.

Both are *great* psychedelics, but I now find T-4 to be even more overwhelmingly rewarding than T-7. T-7 is more euphoric and visually stunning, but it's rather cloudy on the mind, which in turn can lead to emotions running a bit amok; T-4 is significantly less visual and more introspective, yet never gloomy. This material bestows great clarity and centeredness to one's psyche -- one can resolve internal issues with relative ease. It is also quite creative, aesthetically enhancing and empathic, and in its own way, sexy. It seems that one can take the experience virtually anywhere one wishes it to go, and with potentially excellent results. On the downside, 2C-T-4 does have "dark corners" (as mentioned in a PiHKAL report); it could turn on the user, especially if the user is unprepared and/or not a well-traveled psychonaut. Make no mistake... This is a heavy-duty psychedelic that demands respect.

This one is the only available 2c-T-X which hasn't been banned in my country. Last year they banned a lot of 2Cs, but forgot 2c-t-4 and 2c-P. Dumb laws...

Anyways.. I have read a few underwhelming reports about it, but you are making me want to try it now!

2C-T-4 is an excellent compound.  maybe not as "in your face" as 2C-E or 2C-I, but for someone who is already in touch with themselves (mentally and emotionally) this stuff has a whole lot to offer.

It seems this will be made available again in a few days... (together with 2C-TFM, 2C-B-FLY and ETH-LAD!)


I loved 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 [FONT=Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Calibri, Geneva, sans-serif]but [/FONT]need to find my hard copy of Pihkal for that chapter on 2C-T-4.. But I will add it to my collection anyway.. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Wonderful discussion.. Am inclined to put it on my watchlist, too. I have about 45 mg I think.. I recall realizing that I need to manage the amount well, first a reagent test then testing the waters with probing the threshold and then a decent trial with it..


Are GI issues about the same with this compared to 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7, or milder as with 2C-T-21 (at least in my limited experience with it)..?

I've yet to encounter a synthetic psychedelic that gives me gastrointestinal problems worth noting, so I can't answer your question with certainty. That said, I bet that 2C-T-4 is less challenging on the GI system than T-2 or T-7, at least for most people.

i don't have any experience with 2C-T-2, and only a little experience with 2C-T-7, but 2C-T-4 did not produce much in the way of GI disturbances for me.  note, though, that at the time i was smoking large amounts of JWH-122, which might have eased any indigestion.

I thought to drop by and give you guys a heads up regarding this jewel... I've noticed that this substance has a tendency to be somewhat anxiogenic during the comedown phase (at least for me). At my preferred dosage of 18mg (oral), the comedown begins around the twelfth hour. Moderate to fairly pronounced anxiety has consistently crept in at this time and remains present for an hour or two. The final two or three hours of the trip tend to be essentially placid, however.


Keep that in mind, kids. I've tried all the major members of the 2C-x family, except for T-21, and this is, in my estimation, the heaviest of them all. This stuff is no joke and even experienced psychonauts run the risk of loosing their shit if they aren't well-prepared. That having been said, 2C-T-4 is still my numero uno of the 2C-x group. This is *very* rewarding material. Take care, dudes and dudettes.

Well, two years on and I just turned the corner, heading home from an 18mg still very beautiful experience after a ten-month long abstinence from psychedelics. It seems that the older I get, the more I can go without these jewels. Less is more, except my sentences.


So why aren't you guys posting anything on Sasha's PEA masterpiece? I know that some of you have it, so what gives? This stuff is really worth exploring and discussing, so I hope that some of you will finally contribute. I'll continue to keep an eye on this thread.

I always planned on giving it another go.  My one experience back in 2002, showed T4 to be more interesting than T2...but nothing as good as T7.   Basically, I was not inspired to try it a second time.  One day I will.

I suppose this one would be similar to 2C-IP and DOIPr, zappy and immersive I imagine...8)


I would be happy to try all of the 2C-Ts, never had a chance though.

Will definitely post if I ever get to try it! :D

@ MGS - T7 is a phenomenal chemical, but that 2C moved to the #2 position, for me, a while back. If you try T4 again, please return with your observations.


@ Volsam - I've had 2C-iP in storage for years, but have never tried it. I probably will this year, so I'll go back to its B&D and post my thoughts there.

Never got to try this one before it was scheduled here and it dropped off the map. Wasn’t big on T7 but rather enjoyed T2 - Disappointed.

You seriously didn't miss out on this one IME. It was by far the least useful and/or enjoyable phenethylamine I tried. Multiple trials at varying doses and in combination with many other substances and in different settings. It, to me, was pretty much a psychedelic dud. I  never experienced anything else with time dilation anything approaching what this produced.
