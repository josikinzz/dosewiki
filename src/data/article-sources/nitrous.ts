**Nitrous oxide**, commonly known as **laughing gas**, **nitrous**, **nitro**, **NOS** or **hippy crack** is an inorganic molecule and chemical compound with the formula N 2O. It is an oxide of nitrogen. At room temperature, it is a colourless, non-flammable gas, with a slightly sweet odour and taste. It is used in surgery and dentistry for its anaesthetic and analgesic effects. It is known as “laughing gas” due to the euphoric effects of inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as an A-typical dissociative anaesthetic. It is also used as an oxidizer in rocketry and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidizer similar to molecular oxygen.

The gas was first synthesised by English natural philosopher and chemist Joseph Priestley in 1772, who called it phlogisticated nitrous air (see phlogiston). It was first used as an anaesthetic drug in the treatment of a patient when dentist Horace Wells demonstrated insensitivity to pain from a dental extraction on 11 December 1844. Today it is used world wide by hospitals and dentists alike as a general anaesthetic. The recreational use of nitrous oxide began at “laughing gas parties”, primarily arranged for the British upper class in 1799 and has continued into modern times as the gas has become cheaper and more accessible to the masses.

The pharmacological mechanism of action of N2O in medicine is not fully known. However, it has been shown to directly modulate a broad range of receptors, and this likely plays a major role in many of its effects. It moderately blocks NMDA and β2-subunit-containing nACh channels, weakly inhibits AMPA, kainate, GABAC, and 5-HT3 receptors, and slightly potentiates GABAA and glycine receptors. It has also been shown to activate two-pore-domain K+ channels. While N2O affects quite a few ion channels, its anaesthetic, hallucinogenic, and euphoriant effects are likely caused predominantly or fully via inhibition of NMDAR-mediated currents.

The Nitrous Oxide experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/index.php?title=Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Subjective effects:**

*Physical effects*

The physical effects of Nitrous Oxide can be broken down into eight components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage.

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the nitrous oxide body high starts off as the sensation of a mixture of cold, warm, sharp and soft tingles which begin across the head and face at lower dosages but spread out across the body at higher dosages.
- **Suppression of touch** - this partially to entirely suppresses ones own sense of touch creating feelings of numbness within the extremities. It is responsible for the anaesthetic properties of this substance.
- **Loss of motor control **- a loss of gross and fine motor control along side of balance and coordination is prevalent within nitrous and becomes especially strong at higher dosages. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset unless they are experienced in case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **Euphoria** - this results in feelings of physical euphoria which range between mild pleasure to powerfully all encompassing bliss. Anecdotal reports show that this sensation which is taken advantage of by recreational users during sexual activity’s and said to greatly enhance orgasm.
- **Changes in felt bodily form **- this usually occurs with higher dosages and can be described as feelings that in a non painful fashion your body’s physical form is being stretched into infinity, compressed into a singularity or split into two separate halves.
- **Weightlessness** - this creates the sensation that body is floating and has become entirely weightless. It is often accompanied by feelings of slowly falling or drifting.
- **Dizziness** - although uncommon some people report dizziness under the influence of nitrous.
- **Head aches **- although uncommon a certain subset of people report headaches during the offset of Nitrous Oxide. If this occurs one should avoid this substance in the future.

**Cognitive effects:**

The cognitive effects of nitrous oxide can be broken down into 4 separate subcomponents which are listed and described below.

- **Laughter **- this effect is extremely powerful and pronounced within nitrous oxide and can be described as sudden bouts of intense laughter and giggling. It is an effect which is especially prevalent when taken in the context of appropriate social settings.
- **Euphoria **- this can be described as feelings of mild to intense happiness and general positivity.
- **Ego suppression, loss and death** - at higher dosages, level 3 ego death is an all encompassing effect within nitrous oxide. In comparison to other hallucinogens, it is unique in style due to its rapid onset and fast comedown. This creates the experience that one’s sense of self is rapidly disintegrated and then suddenly restacked through a process of regaining one’s own long term memory. This is a remarkably identical process every time the experience is undergone.
- **Deja-vu **- although uncommon a certain subset of people report strong feelings of deja-vu consistently when under the influence of Nitrous Oxide.
- **Amnesia** - at high dosages, it is often common for one to experience amnesia and memory loss after the experience has occurred. This is especially prevalent alongside of ego death.
- **States of unity and interconnectedness** - during high dosage states of ego death, this component is a common but inconsistent accompanying effect. It generally occurs at level 4 - 5 and creates experiences of becoming one with the greater whole. In comparison to other hallucinogens which induce this effect, it can be described as comparatively simpler and less profound due to its more basic accompanying cognitive effects.

**Visual effects:**

In comparison to other dissociatives such as Ketamine or DXM, the visual effects of nitrous oxide are comparatively simplistic. They progressively intensify proportional to dosage and can be broken down into five individual components which are listed and described below.

- **Decreased visual acuity** - blurred vision to the point of all encompassing blindness is a completely consistent effect within nitrous oxide even at moderate dosages.
- **Double vision **- this component is also prevalent at moderate dosages and makes reading incapable unless one closes an eye.
- **Suppression of pattern recognition** - this effect generally occurs at higher dosages and makes one unable to recognize and interpret perceivable visual data.
- **Geometry** - nitrous oxide geometry can be described as unique in its behaviour. It usually only occurs at higher dosages and as a static wall of geometry which appears in front of one’s vision alongside of the physical sensation of becoming and merging with it. It usually manifests as consistently incidental in its form but varies in its arrangement between people. In terms of its stylistic appearance it can be described as simplistic in complexity, organic in style, unstructured in arrangement, colourful in scheme, glossy in shading, soft and blurred in its edges, large in size, still in movement, rounded in corners, immersive in depth, and often based upon complex interlocking circles.
- **Hallucinatory states **- in comparison to other more classical dissociatives, hallucinations are particularly rare with nitrous but possible at high dosages. They exclusively occur at high levels, are capable of manifesting as both external and internal in style, and are usually delirious in believability (but commonly only include mundane scenarios such as perceiving and talking to people who are not currently present).

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects found with nitrous oxide, although simplistic, are famously known to be particularly intense and consistent in their manifestation when compared to other hallucinogens. These effects include:

- **Distortions **- these distortions are very powerful and loud enough in their volume to make the original sound completely unrecognisable. They include phasers, white noise, high pitch tones and notes, flanging, changes in pitch, echo effects, and stuttering.
- **Suppression** - this effect can be described as a muffling and quieting of externally sourced sound which results in it sounding more indistinct and distant than it would usually be.

**In combination with:**

One of the most interesting application for nitrous oxide is not by itself but in combination with other hallucinogens to which it acts as a powerful and profound temporary potentiation of subjective effects.

- *Psychedelics* - when taken in combination with a classical psychedelic such as LSD or psilocin, the effect will be a sudden and dramatic increase in perceived geometry to its maximum level of 7A or 7B. This is alongside of a sudden and dramatic ego death.
- *Dissociatives* - when taken in combination with a classical dissociative such as MXE or DXM, the effect will be a sudden and dramatic increase in disconnective effects and the triggering of a sudden internal hallucinatory scenario.
- *Cannabis* - when taken in combination with cannabis, the overall effects of the nitrous itself are potentiated more so than the effects of the cannabis.
- *Alcohol* - when taken in combination with alcohol, negative side effects such as confusion, dizziness, and headaches are often greatly increased.

**Available forms:**

- *Canned whipped cream* - these are found in any grocery store. They contain very minimal gas with one or two uses before the cream comes out.
- *Chargers* - these are freely available and cheap to purchase online. They are small metal canisters which can be used by a nitrous cracker to fill a balloon full of gas which is then inhaled. Some varieties contain industrial residue and strength varies (as it is food grade).
- *Medical tanks* - these are hard to find and dangerous without a professional. They are occasionally seen at music festivals being used to fill balloons for sale.

**Toxicity and Harm Potential:**

Nitrous oxide has been safely used as a mild anaesthetic for over 150 years. Problems with its use come primarily from carelessness. Potential problems include:

- Brain injury and suffocation can result from lack of oxygen. When used as an anaesthetic, nitrous is always administered in combination with oxygen. Never use nitrous in any manner that does not provide for adequate oxygen intake.
- Very cold temperatures of the gas can freeze the lips and throat if taken directly from a tank or whippit. Releasing the gas into a balloon first allows the gas to warm before being administered.
- Heavy and frequent long term nitrous use can deplete vitamin B12 in the body and lead to serious and unpleasant neurological problems. Users may experience numbness and tingling in the fingers, toes, lips, etc. In more severe cases, there will be numbness of all extremeties. Taking B12 supplements, especially in combination with a multivitamin and complete amino acid supplements, may help alleviate this problem. If you experience these symptoms, cease nitrous use immediately and if the symptoms persist, seek medical attention.
- Nitric oxide, a toxic industrial gas, is occasionally mistaken for nitrous oxide. Users should be careful they know what they are inhaling. Inhaling Nitric Oxide can permanently damage the lungs or kill.

**Legal issues:**

- *United states* - possession of nitrous oxide is legal under federal law and is not subject to DEA purview. It is, however, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act. Prosecution is possible under its “misbranding” clauses, prohibiting the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide for the purpose of human consumption. Many states have laws regulating the possession, sale, and distribution of nitrous oxide. Such laws usually ban distribution to minors or limit the amount of nitrous oxide that may be sold without special license. For example, in the state of California possession for recreational use is prohibited and qualifies as a misdemeanour.
- *New Zealand* - the Ministry of Health has warned that nitrous oxide is a prescription medicine, and its sale or possession without a prescription is an offence under the Medicines Act. This statement would seemingly prohibit all non-medicinal uses of the chemical, though it is implied that only recreational use will be legally targeted.
- *India* - for general anaesthesia purposes, nitrous oxide is available as Nitrous Oxide IP. India’s gas cylinder rules (1985) permit the transfer of gas from one cylinder to another for breathing purposes.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, although short lived nitrous oxide is an extremely fascinating and worthwhile substance. It is best used in combination with other substances to experience the full effects and is a worthwhile substance for anybody who is interested in the exploration of consciousness.

### Mechanism of action

Findings to date indicate that nitrous oxide induces opioid peptide release in the brain stem leading to the activation of descending noradrenergic neurones, which results in modulation of the nociceptive process in the spinal cord. Several receptor–effector mechanisms including dopamine receptors, α2 adrenoceptors, benzodiazepine receptors and -methyl- -aspartate (NMDA) receptors have been implicated although the relationship of one with the other is not known.

## Subjective Experience

At time of writing (2017) this is extremely popular, particularly on the club scene.

For my own experiment, I elected to use the balloon method, which is commonly
considered to provide one of the safer forms of inhalation. Using a device known as
an N2O Cracker, two canisters were blown into a balloon. The content of this was
then inhaled and held. This had an immediate effect, in that my headspace dissipated
and appeared to distance from my physical being, but it was quick; too quick. It was a
wham bam type of hit, with little fulfilment or pleasure.

During the aftermath I felt strangely calm and was almost sedated for a period, at
least to a small degree. Perhaps this is part of the attraction, but for me, it wasn't a
particularly rewarding experience.

I have an inkling that starting from a different state of mind might provide a more
positive outcome, and in some cases, act as a reset button in terms of mood. I should
add, however, that this is largely speculation.

Nitrous Oxide
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[Nitrous Oxide Images](https://erowid.org/nitrous_images.shtml)
 
Nitrous Oxide (N 2 O) is a simple gas that, when inhaled, causes rapid analgesia (pain relief), euphoria, mild sedation, and sometimes psychedelic dissociation. It has been used in dentistry since the mid 1800's and recreationally since the late 1700's when it earned the name 'laughing gas' because of its tendency to cause laughter in those who inhale. 
 
[ [Main Nitrous Vault](https://erowid.org/nitrous.shtml) ]
 
Dose #
 
Nitrous is most frequently used in the form of whipped cream chargers, small metal cartridges which are 'cracked' either into a whipped cream canister or with a special 'cracker' into a balloon for inhalation. A single cartridge is between one and three lungs full of gas. One or two lung fulls is generally enough for a short nitrous experience although many people choose to use many cartridges throughout the course of a night.
 
Price #
 
nitrous chargers are sold for between .50 and 1.50 USD per cartridge depending on store and size of purchase. Balloons of nitrous at parties are sold from 3-5\$ per balloon. Tank-refills of medical grade nitrous oxide are diverted from non recreational medical, chemical, and industrial use. A single standard whippet cartridge contains 8 grams of nitrous oxide.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/nitrous_law.shtml) #
 
Nitrous Oxide is unscheduled in the United States and available over the counter. In many states it is illegal to sell Nitrous to a minor and in some states it is specifically illegal to inhale Nitrous Oxide for intoxication purposes. Nitrous oxide is controlled differerently around the world. A few countries control it as a pharmaceutical, while many allow its possession for food uses without any licensing.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/nitrous_chemistry.shtml) #
 
Nitrous Oxide (N 2 O) is an extremely simple naturally occurring gas which is produced synthetically for sale.

[History](https://erowid.org/nitrous_timeline.php) #
 
Nitrous Oxide gas was first discovered by English scientist Joseph Priestley in 1772 and was first published about in 1776. In 1799 Humphry Davy gave Nitrous to visitors at the Pneumatic Institute and coined the term "laughing gas". Through his experiments he discovered Nitrous oxide's analgesic effects in 1800. From 1800 to 1840, Nitrous was primarily used for recreation at travelling public shows, but in 1844-1845 Nitrous was recognized as having some medical use in dentistry. In the late 1800's William James published some accounts of his work with Nitrous Oxide and called its effects of "some metaphysical significance". Nitrous has remained popular throughout the 20th Century and is sold over the counter in small cartridges ("whippets") for making whipped cream and in large tanks for industrial and medical purposes.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Nitrous Oxide; Nitrous; Laughing Gas; Hippy Crack; N 2 O.
 
The Experience:
 
No common terms known.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/nitrous_effects.shtml) #
 
Effects Summary Needed.
 
Onset #
 
When inhaled, Nitrous generally reaches full effects within a few seconds.
 
Duration #
 
Effects from a single inhalation of Nitrous Oxide last a few minutes. Most recreational Nitrous use consists of multiple inhalations over a period of time.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Some closed eye visuals effects are common with strong nitrous effects, though most often consist of patterns. Less common are more coherent visuals and are notoriously hard to remember after the effects have diminished. Open eye visuals are most often described as distortions of space and a purple or grey-blue hue.
 
[PROBLEMS](https://erowid.org/nitrous_health.shtml) #
 
Although generaly considered quite safe when used medically and sparingly, it has some negative health consequences when used chronically. Heavy Nitrous use can lead to a depletion of vitamin B 12 . This can cause numbing of fine nerve endings, especially noticeable in the fingers and toes. Supplements of B 12 may reduce the chances of this occurring in heavy users. Shots of B 12 are given as a treatment for advanced depletion. If left untreated B 12 deficiency can lead to long-term damage. 
 
 Most of the acute dangers associated with Nitrous Oxide are related to accidents during ingestion. In medical applications, Nitrous is dispensed in combination with Oxygen. Inhaling Nitrous alone is not required to get full effects, the effects are the result of the nitrous in the system, not of oxygen deprivation. It is important for users to take breaths of air between hits. 
 
 A handful of people also suffocate each year while using nitrous in the US when the balloon, garbage bag, or mask used to inhale the nitrous stays on the person's face as they fade from consciousness. Some tank-users also suffocate when the valve is left open in a confined space such as a car or small room.
 
Contraindications #
 
Contraindications Summary Needed.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Nitrous has gained the nickname 'hippy-crack' because it lends itself to repeated and compulsive use for some people. While uncommon, it is not unheard of to find individuals who use Nitrous many times a day, every day, generally among those with easy access to large quantities.

**Nitrous Oxide Health** 
 **By Erowid** 
Nitrous oxide has been safely used as a mild anaesthetic for over 150 years. Problems with its use come primarily from carelessness. Potential problems include : 
- Brain injury and suffocation can result from lack of oxygen. When used as an anaesthetic, nitrous is always administered in combination with oxygen. Never use nitrous in any manner that does not provide for adequate oxygen intake. 
 
 Note that it is not necessary to feel shortness of breath or a sense of oxygen deprivation in order for the body to be dangerously short of oxygen. The sensation of being unable to breathe comes as a result of unusually high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) rather than low levels of oxygen. Because of this, people who inhale pure nitrous oxide or other gases do not have the sensation of being unable to breathe, despite not getting enough (or any) oxygen. It is quite possible to suffocate while breathing pure nitrous oxide without ever feeling discomfort or a shortness of breath. 
 
 
- Never strap a gas mask to your face while using pure nitrous as it is possible to black out and die from lack of oxygen. Never use a garbage bag as a delivery device. It is possible (and has happened) to black out and suffocate when the bag falls over the nose and mouth. Never open a tank of nitrous in a sealed room, closet, car, or other space.
 
 Very cold temperatures of the gas can freeze the lips and throat if taken directly from a tank or whippit. Releasing the gas into a balloon first allows the gas to warm before being administered. 
 
 High levels of pressure may rupture blood vessels in the lungs and force air into the chest cavity, causing the lungs to collapse. This is primarily a problem when nitrous is being administered directly from a tank or other pressurized container. Again, releasing the gas into a balloon first eliminates this risk. 
 
 Heavy and frequent nitrous use can deplete vitamin B 12 in the body and lead to serious and unpleasant neurological problems. Users may experience numbness and tingling in the fingers, toes, lips, etc. In more severe cases, numbness of all extremeties. Taking B 12 supplements, especially in combination with multi vitamin and complete amino acid supplements, may help alleviate this problem. If you experience these symptoms, cease nitrous use immediately and if the symptoms persist, seek medical attention. See [Nitrous & B-Vitamin Dangers](https://erowid.org/nitrous_health2.shtml) . 
 
 Careless use of nitrous oxide can also cause nausea, vomiting, and disorientation, primarily from inhaling too much, too soon. 
 
 Since nitrous produces a temporary loss of motor control and dissociation, it's extremely unwise to inhale it while standing or while in any situation where unconsciousness is dangerous. 
 
 Some users of nitrous report headaches and generalized discomfort for an hour or more after inhalation. 
 
 Nitric Oxide, a toxic industrial gas, is occasionally mistaken for Nitrous Oxide. Users should be careful they know what they are inhaling. Inhaling Nitric Oxide can permanently damage the lungs or kill. 
 
 Olney's Lesions: there is little to no evidence that Nitrous Oxide use causes the brain lesions described in William White's "This is your Brain on Dissociatives" and, without further evidence, this hypothesis should be considered invalid for Nitrous Oxide.

Nitrous
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Nitrous**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: FDA Regulated
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
Nitrous is available over-the-counter in kitchen stores and head shops. At this point its sale for human consumption is federally regulated under FDA rules. Possession is not illegal, but sale or distribution for human consumption can be prosecuted under the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act. However, in many states is it illegal to sell or distribute nitrous oxide to a minor and in many states it is illegal to consume nitrous oxide for recreational purposes. It is also illegal in many states to inhale nitrous oxide for intoxication purposes. 
 
 There are cases where sale of nitrous oxide has been prosecuted under the 'misbranding' clause of the FDCA.
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Many states outlaw the use of nitrous for recreational purposes and the sale of nitrous oxide in tanks is controlled with a variety of licensing requirements. 
 
 [State Laws Concerning Nitrous Oxide (May 2002)](http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/dll/N20_state_laws.htm) 
 [State by State Inhalant Legislation (somewhat out of date, 1997)](https://erowid.org/chemicals/inhalants/inhalants_law1.shtml) 
 
 
California #
 
California state law prohibits the possession of nitrous oxide with the intent to use it as a psychoactive unless it is administered by medical personnel. See California penal code 381b : "381b. Any person who possesses nitrous oxide or any substance containing nitrous oxide, with the intent to breathe, inhale, or ingest for the purpose of causing a condition of intoxication,elation, euphoria, dizziness, stupefaction, or dulling of the senses or for the purpose of, in any manner, changing, distorting, or disturbing the audio, visual, or mental processes, or who knowingly and with the intent to do so is under the influence of nitrous oxide or any material containing nitrous oxide is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section shall not apply to any person who is under the influence of nitrous oxide or any material containing nitrous oxide pursuant to an administration for the purpose of medical, surgical, or dental care by a person duly licensed to administer such an agent." 
 
 The city of Rialto, CA passed an ordinance in Mar 2017 making the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide illegal regardless of its intended us with "the exception of sales of the gas for lawful medical and industrial use". Persons violating the ordinance can face jail time, a \$1,000 fine or both. See [Rialto passes unique nitrous oxide ordinance aimed at protecting youth](http://www.dailybulletin.com/government-and-politics/20170302/rialto-passes-unique-nitrous-oxide-ordinance-aimed-at-protecting-youth) .
 
Florida #
 
A new 2005 law in Florida makes possession and use of nitrous oxide for inhaling pruposes a second-degree misdemeanor, punishable by 60 days in jail and a \$500.00 fine. Selling, purchasing, transferring, or possessing more than 16 grams of nitrous oxide for the purpose of inhaling is now a third-degree felony punishable by five (5) years in prison and a \$5,000.00 fine. Florida also closed a loophole that allowed nitrous oxide and nitrous oxide paraphernalia (used to store, transfer, or inhale nitrous oxide) to be sold in tobacco shops. Now the use or possession with intent to use such nitrous oxide paraphernalia is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by one (1) year in jail and a \$1,000.00 fine. See [Florida State Statute Title XLVI Chapter 877.111](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0877/SEC111.HTM&Title=-%3E2001-%3ECh0877-%3ESection%20111) . (thanks D5)
 
Oregon #
 
Oregon controls Nitrous Oxide as an inhalant under [Chapter 229, section 1.](http://www.leg.state.or.us/99orlaws/sess0200.dir/0229ses.html) It makes the possession of inhalants illegal "for the purpose of inducing intoxication".
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Australia #
 
We believe that as of July 1, 2004, Australia now adds a number of police powers for searching and detaining individuals under 18 and seizing "volatile inhalants" from them. The Oct 2004 [Australian Government Institute of Criminology](http://www.aic.gov.au/research/drugs/types/inhalants.html) seems to have out of date information and doesn not mention the new rule. More up to date information can be found at the [Australian Drug Info Clearinghouse](http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/article.asp?id=8053&ContainerID=561) . 
 
 Australian rules now are that police may search and detain (not arrest) anyone under 18 who they suspect of using inhalants. The police are to free the young person once they are no longer a danger to themselves or others. It is not entirely clear if this rule includes Nitrous Oxide, but this seems to be the assumption.
 
Brazil #
 
Nitrous is legal for medical use only, but is available for purchase over the internet. (unconfirmed) (thanks P)
 
Canada #
 
Nitrous chargers widely available over-the-counter. We have been told that many stores will only sell to people 25 and older. Other visitors describe buying whipe-cream chargers without being asked for ID. (unconfirmed) (thanks J) (last updated Sep 24, 2015)
 
Korea #
 
In July 2017, the Republic of Korea Ministry of Environment banned the inhalation, sales or possession of nitrous for inhalation purposes, with infractions punishable by three years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won (~\$44,762), the ministry said. See [Govt. bans abuse of nitrous oxide](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170725000401) .
 
Netherlands #
 
Nitrous chargers are widely available over-the-counter. The use of nitrous oxide for recreational purposes is legal (not prohibited). Nitrous oxide is legally sold to the general public for food use, though it is technically illegal to sell for recreational use (it is considered a prescription medicine when inhaled). Many stores regularly sell to people under 18. (thanks K, LB) (last updated Oct 11, 2012)
 
New Zealand #
 
In April, 2005, the New Zealand Ministry of Health reviewed the use of Nitrous Oxide and declared that much of the importation, sale, and possession was for "misuse" and in violation of the Medicines Act of 1981. Nitrous Oxide whip cream chargers have become difficult to buy over-the-counter as of May 1, 2005. See [Ministry of Health Background Information on Nitrous Oxide](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/2bf754585cd67838cc256fe700044e36?OpenDocument) and [Scoop.co.nz](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE0504/S00083.htm) .
 
U.K. #
 
Nitrous Oxide is widely available in the United Kingdom. In the UK possesion of nitrous for non-inhalant use is not controlled and is legal. It is illegal to sell or provide nitrous oxide to someone under 18 years old "if he knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the substance is, or its fumes are, likely to be inhaled by the person under the age of eighteen for the purpose of causing intoxication.". See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/26/section/1](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/26/section/1) . One visitor tells us the law is only only enforced against locations such as night clubs that sell or allow to be sold nitrous oxide and have been warned by authorities. (thanks D) (last updated Jan 24, 2013)
 
Nitrous oxide is controlled differerently around the world. A few countries control it as a pharmaceutical, while many allow its possession for food uses without any licensing.

**Nitrous oxide can cause irreversible neurotoxic damages**
 
Frequent and/or chronic use can cause vitamin B 12 depletion, such as other rapidly vitamin B 12 depleting substance, may lead to severe nerve damage. We recommend that you **always supplement with vitamin B12** if you use this substance, regardless dose and frequency to be on the safe side. Especially those with "decreased vitamin B12 absorption, such as in those with small bowel resection, irritable bowel disease, and/or pernicious anemia, and those with reduced intake, such as in **vegans and vegetarians** ". Additionally, improper use puts the user at risk of oxygen deprivation. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.
**Nitrous oxide** (also known as **laughing gas** , **nitrous** , **NOS** , and informally as **hippy-crack** ). [Whipped cream chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipped-cream_charger) /cartridges are called whippits (also spelled “whippits”), nangs, or bulbs.

Nitrous oxide is an atypical [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) substance that is found in the form of an inhalable gas. The exact mechanism of action of nitrous oxide is unknown, but it is thought to have an effect on [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) and [NMDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain.

Nitrous oxide was first identified in 1772 by the British chemist Joseph Priestly. In the 19th century, it was discovered to have anesthetic properties which made it suitable for dental and surgical procedures. It was given the name "laughing gas" by the British chemist Humphry Davy due to its exhilarating and laughter-inducing effects. Today, it is widely used in surgery and dentistry for its [anaesthetic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) and [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analgesic) effects, and in motorsports for its performance boosting effect on internal combustion engines. Additionally, it has a number of industrial uses and is commonly sold as a whipped cream propellant in kitchen and household stores.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [dissociation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociation) .

Nitrous is considered to have low to moderate abuse potential and low toxicity when used in moderation.

## History and culture

Nitrous oxide gas was first synthesized in 1772 by English natural philosopher and chemist Joseph Priestley. He published his findings in the book Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air (1775), describing the synthesis of the gas by heating iron filings dampened with nitric acid. In 1800, Humphry Davy, an assistant at the Pneumatic Institute, published a book about nitrous oxide in 1800. In the book, there is the following passage;
"As nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying physical pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations where too great an effusion of blood does not take place."
Davy notes the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide and its potential for use in surgical operations. Davy coined the name "laughing gas" for nitrous oxide. Beginning in 1799, nitrous oxide was used as a recreational drug at "laughing gas parties". They became an immediate success within the British upper class. Despite Davy's discovery of nitrous' potential for anesthesia, doctors did not attempt to use it for nearly half a decade.

The discovery of ether in 1830 led nitrous to fall out of popularity as a recreational drug. It was not until 1844 that American dentist Horace Wells noticed the anesthetic properties of the gas. With the assistance of Gardner Quincy Colton and John Mankey Riggs, he demonstrated insensitivity to pain during a tooth extraction. The practice was not immediately adopted by other dentists, as Wells' first public demonstration had been partly unsuccessful. In 1863, Gardner Quincy Colton began to administer the gas to patients in all of his "Colton Dental Association" clinics, administering nitrous oxide to over 25,000 patients over three years. This brought the practice into general use.

Nitrous oxide was not found to be a strong enough anesthetic for major surgeries in hospital settings, but it became useful as an initiator for stronger anesthetics like ether or chloroform. Hospitals would initiate treatment with a mild flow of nitrous oxide, and then gradually increase the flow of the stronger anesthetic. This technique of initiating anesthesia is still used in hospitals today.

Nitrous is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.

## Chemistry

Nitrous oxide, or dinitrogen monoxide, was first synthesised by heating ammonium nitrate in the presence of iron filings and then passing the gas that came off (NO) through water. Now it is commonly synthesised by gently heating ammonium nitrate to decompose it into nitrous oxide. It is an oxide of nitrogen.

Nitrous has a linear molecular structure. It can be thought as existing in two "resonance structures":

- The central nitrogen atom is triple bonded to the other nitrogen atom and single bonded to the oxygen atom.
- The central nitrogen atom double-bonded to both the other nitrogen atom as well as the oxygen atom.

In practice, the atom will almost exclusively exist in between these two states almost all the time, and the electrons will be delocalised across the molecule. Each of the resonance forms can be thought of as having a positive and negative charge, giving a neutral molecule overall.

Nitrous is used as an oxidiser in rocketry and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidizer similar to molecular oxygen. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

At room temperature, nitrous is a colorless and non-flammable gas with a slightly sweet odor and distinctive sweet taste.

## Pharmacology

Although N2O affects quite a few receptors, its [anesthetic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) , [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) , and [euphoriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) effects are likely caused predominantly or fully via its effects as an [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) . NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually the famous “ [hole](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) ”.

The pharmacological mechanism of action behind N2O in medicine is not entirely known. However, it has been shown to directly modulate a broad range of receptors and this likely plays a significant role in many of its effects. It moderately blocks β2-subunit-containing nACh channels, weakly inhibits AMPA, kainate, GABAA-rho, and 5-HT3 receptors and slightly potentiates GABAA and glycine receptors. It has also been shown to activate two-pore-domain K+ channels.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Neurotoxicity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity)** - Long-term or recurrent use of nitrous oxide can result in serious neurological harm.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The nitrous oxide "body high" starts off as the sensation of a diverse mixture of cold, warm, sharp, and soft tingles which begin across the head and face at lower dosages but spread out across the body at higher dosages.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This usually occurs with higher dosages and can be described as feelings that in a non-painful fashion your body's physical form is being stretched into infinity, compressed into a singularity, or split into two separate halves.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Although uncommon, some people report dizziness under the influence of nitrous.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - Although uncommon, a certain subset of people report headaches during the offset of nitrous oxide.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside balance and coordination is prevalent within nitrous oxide and becomes especially active at higher dosages. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset unless they are experienced in case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become entirely weightless. It is often accompanied by feelings of slowly falling or drifting.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This effect can range between mild pleasure to powerfully all-encompassing bliss. Anecdotal reports show that this sensation, which is taken advantage of by recreational users during sexual activities, can greatly enhance orgasm.
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - This effect partially to entirely suppresses one's sense of touch, creating feelings of numbness within the extremities. It is responsible for the anesthetic properties of this substance.
- **[Vitamin deficiency](/w/index.php?title=Vitamin_deficiency&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Repeated doses may induce vitamin B12 deficiency. However, this can be prevented with B12 supplements.
- **[Trouble Urinating](/w/index.php?title=Trouble_Urinating&action=edit&redlink=1)** ### Visual effects
 
- In comparison to other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) such as [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) , the visual effects of nitrous oxide are comparatively simplistic. They progressively intensify proportional to dosage and can be broken down into five individual components which are listed and described below. 
#### Suppression
 
- **[Acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - Blurred vision to the point of all-encompassing blindness is a completely consistent effect within nitrous oxide even at moderate dosages.
- **[Frame rate suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frame_rate_suppression)** - This effect can cause ones visual framerate to lag to such an extent that it can cause one's vision to "pause"
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This component is also prevalent at moderate dosages and makes reading incapable unless one closes an eye.
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)** - This effect occurs at higher dosages and makes one unable to recognize and interpret perceivable visual data.
 
#### Geometry
 
- **[Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)** - Nitrous oxide geometry can be described as unique in its behaviour. It usually only occurs at higher dosages and as a static wall of geometry which appears in front of one's vision alongside the physical sensation of becoming and merging with it. It usually manifests as consistently incidental in its form but varies in its arrangement between people. In terms of its stylistic appearance it can be described as simplistic in complexity, organic in style, unstructured in arrangement, colourful in scheme, glossy in shading, soft and blurred in its edges, large in size, still in movement, rounded corners, immersive in depth, and often based on complex interlocking circles.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[External hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) and [Internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** - In comparison to other more classical [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , hallucinations are particularly rare with nitrous but possible at high dosages. They exclusively occur at high levels, are capable of manifesting as both external and internal in style, and are usually delirious in believability (but commonly only include mundane scenarios such as perceiving and talking to people who are not currently present). ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - At high dosages, it is often common for one to experience amnesia and memory loss after the experience has occurred. This is especially prevalent alongside ego death.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)** - Although uncommon and inconsistent, a certain subset of people report strong feelings of deja-vu consistently when under the influence of nitrous oxide.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This can be described as feelings of mild to intense happiness and general positivity.
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - This effect is markedly pronounced with nitrous oxide and can be described as sudden bouts of intense laughter and giggling.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - At higher dosages, level 3 [ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death) is an all-encompassing effect within nitrous oxide. In comparison to other hallucinogens, it is unique in style due to its rapid onset and quick comedown. This creates the experience that one's sense of self is rapidly disintegrated and then suddenly re-stacked through a process of regaining one's long-term memory. This is a remarkably identical process every time the experience is undergone.
- **[Suggestibility enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Vivid dreams](/w/index.php?title=Vivid_dreams&action=edit&redlink=1)** ### Auditory effects
 
- The auditory effects found with nitrous oxide, although simplistic, are widely known to be particularly intense and consistent in their manifestation when compared to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . These effects include: 
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - These distortions are very powerful and loud enough in their volume to make the original sound completely unrecognizable. They include phasers, white noise, high pitch tones and notes, flanging, changes in pitch, echo effects, and stuttering. In particular, the frequency of the stuttering is proportionally related to the intensity of the effects, especially ego death which occurs when the stuttering becomes continuous.
- **[Suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)** - This effect can be described as a muffling and quieting of externally sourced sound which results in it sounding more indistinct and distant than it would usually be. ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - This effect is reported to occur most commonly with auditory stimuli, like music translating into visual stimuli within closed eye visuals. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - During high dosage states of ego death, this component is a common but inconsistent accompanying effect. It occurs at level 4 - 5 and creates experiences of becoming one with the greater whole. In comparison to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) which induce this effect, it can be described as comparatively simpler and less profound due to its more basic accompanying cognitive effects.
- **[Perception of interdependent opposites](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_interdependent_opposites)** - During moderate to high doses, the effect may be described as having insight into the nature of two conflicting ideas, "battling" each other to maintain natural balance.
### Combinational effects

Nitrous is commonly combined with other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) for it which it acts as a brief but profound potentiator of their effects.

- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When taken in combination with a psychedelic such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , the effect will be a sudden and dramatic increase in perceived geometry to its maximum level of [8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) or [8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry_-_Perceived_exposure_to_inner_mechanics_of_consciousness) . This is alongside a sudden and dramatic ego death.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When taken in combination with a dissociative such as [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) or [DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) , the effect will be a sudden and dramatic increase in [disconnective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disconnective_effects) and the triggering of a sudden internal hallucinatory scenario.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - When taken in combination with cannabis, the overall effects of the nitrous itself are potentiated more so than the cannabis' effects.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - When taken in combination with alcohol, adverse side effects such as confusion, dizziness, and headaches are often significantly increased.

## Available forms

### Medical nitrous oxide

**Medical tanks** - These are hard to find and dangerous without a professional. They are occasionally seen at music festivals being used to fill balloons for sale.

### Nonmedical nitrous oxide

- **Tubes** - These are now commonly sold by web shops that are specializing in nitrous oxide.
- **Canned whipped cream** - These are found in any grocery store. They contain very minimal gas with one or two uses before the cream comes out.
- **[Whipped-cream charger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipped-cream_charger)** - These are readily available and cheap to purchase online. They are small metal canisters that can be used by a nitrous cracker to fill a balloon full of gas which is then inhaled. Some varieties contain industrial residue and strength vary (as it is food grade).

## Toxicity and harm potential

The exact toxic dosage is unknown. Potential problems include:

- Nitrous temporarily inhibits methionine synthase, a B12-dependant enzyme responsible for many important functions in the body. Heavy and frequent long-term use can deplete vitamin B12 in the body and lead to serious and unpleasant neurological problems. Users may experience numbness and tingling in the fingers, toes, lips, et al. In more severe cases, there will be numbness of all extremities. Taking B12 supplements, especially in combination with a multivitamin and complete amino acid supplements, may help alleviate this problem. If one experiences these symptoms, nitrous use should be ceased immediately, and if the symptoms persist, medical attention should be sought after.

- *Nitric* oxide, a toxic industrial gas, is occasionally mistaken for *nitrous* oxide. Users should be careful they know what they are inhaling. Inhaling Nitric Oxide can permanently damage the lungs or kill.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Risks of whipped-cream chargers compared to medical nitrous oxide

Medical nitrous oxide has been safely used as a mild anesthetic for over 150 years.

- Vapor pressure 
- Whipped-cream chargers: Very cold temperatures of the gas can freeze the lips and throat if taken directly from a tank or whippet. Releasing the gas into a balloon first allows the gas to warm before being administered.
- Medical nitrous oxide is released slowly.
- [Hypoxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia) (abnormally low level of oxygen in the tissues), particularly the entity ' [diffusion hypoxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_hypoxia) '. 
- Whipped-cream chargers contains no oxygen. Oxygen deprivation that can cause brain injury and suffocation can result from lack of oxygen from pure nitrous oxide continuously inhaled from strap-on mask connected to a gas canister. Never use nitrous in any manner that does not provide for adequate oxygen intake. Suffocation can occur without discomfort.
- Medical grade nitrous oxide contains 50% nitrous oxide, and 50% oxygen. When used as an anesthetic, nitrous is always administered in combination with oxygen.
- Purity 
- Whipped-cream chargers contains food grade. Thus, they can contain a range of impurities, such as industrial grease left over from manufacturing, and tiny particles of steel from the pierced metal. Users can filter them through a piece of cotton, cloth, or clothing to reduce the amount of impurities inhaled. Regular cleaning of nitrous dispensing devices can also reduce the harm posed by impurities.
- Medical grade nitrous oxide: Contains medical grade nitrous oxide.

### Risks with drug paraphernalia

#### Risk with whipping dispensers
Direct inhalation
Whipping dispensers is more convenient to fill balloons with than crackers. Direct inhalation of butane can cause frostbite like effects that pose a serious risk of personal injury.
Dangers from plastic whip cream dispensers
It is advised to check that all parts of a whipping dispenser are made of metal, because dispensers made of plastic have exploded and damaged, and albeit extremely rare, even killed people:

- In June 2017, Rebecca Burger, 33, a fitness blogger and model, [died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_deaths) after a whipped-cream charger exploded and struck her in the chest.
- In August 2017, another woman got wounded from a whipping dispenser.

#### Risks with nitrous charger crackers

A nitrous charger cracker repeatedly used to decompress cartridges without an outer layer of silicone can cause frostbite.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other dissociatives, the chronic use of nitrous oxide can be considered mildly addictive with a moderate potential for abuse.

Tolerance to many of the effects of nitrous oxide develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Nitrous oxide does not produce cross-tolerance with other dissocatives, meaning that after the use of nitrous oxide other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) will not have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely.
- **GHB** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely.
- **GBL** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely.
- **Opioids** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely.
- **Tramadol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely.

## Drug paraphernalia

### Balloons

- Balloon(s) are inflated with nitrous oxide.
- Sealing clips make it easy to fill multiple balloons without tying or holding them.

A regular balloon can typically hold a single 8 gram whipped-cream charger. However, jumbo balloons can hold about 3 cartridges.

### Gas filter

Cloth is used to filter the gas from whipped-cream chargers that contains often contains small amounts of impurities.

### Gas transfer equipment

A typical whipped cream cartridge contain 8 gram nitrous oxide.

#### Whipped-cream charger cracker

#### Tube valves and regulators

Simple plastic valves and gas pressure regulators, which display the gas pressure, are commonly used with nitrous oxide tanks. These devices are often sold by specialized online retailers that focus on nitrous oxide equipment.

#### Whipping dispensers

To use a half-pint or one-pint whipped cream dispenser, you will need one to two chargers, which is equivalent to 8–16 g (using standard 8 g cartridges). For a one-liter dispenser, you will need two to three chargers, which is equivalent to 16–24 g. The same quantity of gas can also be filled from a large tube with an attached gas pressure regulator connected to the whipping dispenser.

It is important not to overcharge your whipped cream dispenser.

## Legal status

- **Germany** : Nitrous oxide is not a controlled substance under the BtMG (Narcotics Act) or the NpSG (New Psychoactive Substances Act). It is legal, as long as it is not sold for human consumption, according to §2 AMG. If it is intended for medical use, it is classified as a prescription medicine.
- **India** : Nitrous oxide is available for general anesthesia purposes. India's gas cylinder rules (1985) permit the transfer of gas from one cylinder to another for breathing purposes. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Netherlands** : Since 1 January 2023, the possession, importing, and sale of nitrous oxide is banned in the Netherlands, with exceptions for medical use, and the food industry. It is illegal under the [Opium Act](/w/index.php?title=Opium_Act_(Netherlands)&action=edit&redlink=1) .
- **New Zealand** : Nitrous oxide is a prescription medicine, and its sale or possession without a prescription is an offense under the Medicines Act. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Sweden** : From July 1, 2025, Sweden will restrict nitrous oxide sales with an 18-gram (two whipped-cream chargers) limit per purchase, an 18-year age minimum, and tighter controls on import and marketing. Violations may lead to fines or up to six months in prison.
- **United Kingdom** : Nitrous Oxide is a class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act as of 8th November 2023. It is still permitted for use within the medical and food industries.
- **United States** : Possession of nitrous oxide is legal under federal law and is not subject to DEA purview. It is, however, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act. Prosecution is possible under its "misbranding" clauses, prohibiting the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide for the purpose of human consumption. Many states have laws regulating the possession, sale, and distribution of nitrous oxide. Such laws usually ban distribution to minors or limit the amount of nitrous oxide that may be sold without a special license. For example, in the state of California possession for recreational use is prohibited and qualifies as a misdemeanor.

## Effects
Relaxation, euphoria, optical and acoustic changes in perception, loss of the sense of time.

## Dosage
Mild nausea, headache; in case of excessive and improper consumption, unconsciousness, drop in blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmia, in the worst case death by respiratory paralysis. Danger of suffocation if oxygen supply is insufficient, increased risk of injury from falling when "stepping away".

## Risks

### Long-term Risks
Continuous use of nitrous oxide stresses the nervous system and leads to vitamin B12 deficiency (risk of disturbed cell function and temporary infertility). Dependence with psychological symptoms is possible.

## Safer Use
- Never inhale nitrous oxide directly from the capsule or gas cylinder (risk of frostbite in the larynx and bronchi!).
- Consume nitrous oxide while sitting or lying down (less risk of injury).
- Take breaks to avoid too high a concentration of nitrous oxide.
- Refrain from mixed consumption, especially with alcohol.
- Persons with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases should not consume nitrous oxide, nor should persons suffering from epilepsy or otitis media. People with broken ribs or who have suffered a diving accident should also refrain from using nitrous oxide.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/nitrous-oxide/*

Nitrous oxide is a very common inhalational anesthetic that offers analgesia, anxiolysis, and sometimes amnesia. It’s a colorless, non-flammable gas with a slightly sweet taste.

Due to its euphoric and hysterical effects, the substance is also called “laughing gas.” It’s been a recreational drug since the late 1700s and is currently one of the most common inhalants.

N2O is also used in the food and automobile industries, such as in whipped cream canisters and as an engine booster.

There are some mechanistic effects that make the gas concerning when large amounts are used.

The substance offers a short-lasting euphoric state with reduced or altered awareness of your surroundings and a propensity for dream-like hallucinations.

It has a clear dissociative aspect, with users typically becoming somewhat disconnected from their environment. Occasionally a user will significantly detach from the external world and even their body.

Bodily sensations of warmth, cold, tingling, and energy may be present. Sensations of distortion, such as stretching, pulling, and compression, have also been reported. The physical euphoria may be enjoyable and possibly play a role in enhanced orgasm.

Since it only provides effects for a few minutes, a lot of people repeatedly use the drug over a period of 30-60 minutes or even hours. Quick successive use should be avoided.

The drug is usually relaxing and somewhat sedating.

N2O can lead to confusion, paranoia, and anxiety. A Global Drug Survey (GDS) report found 27.8% of users reported hallucinations and 23.9% reported confusion.

Audio distortions are common. Users can report a pulsating “wah-wah” sound along with high-pitched noises, echos, muffled hearing, and an inaccurate sense of distance.

Some visual effects can occur, but they’re normally limited to distortions. Your vision may get blurry and your sense of distance could be impaired. Sometimes a pulsating effect occurs, along with color changes.

The closed eye visuals include colors and patterns.

True hallucinations are less common. When they occur, they’re dream-like and/or delirious and often there’s only an impaired memory of them. The hallucinations could include things like believing your talking with someone or that someone has touched you.

Other effects include depersonalization and derealization.

There’s typically a big impulse/drive to use it again due to its euphoric and short-lasting nature.

It also reportedly synergizes with psychedelics, cannabis, and MDMA. In the case of cannabis and psychedelics, some users report the N2O effect is lengthened.

Sexual

Sexual effects have been reported in medical and recreational settings. It can raise feelings of sexuality and arousal. Orgasm has been been reported, albeit rarely.

An unpublished survey from Stanley Malamed found N2O led to increased sexual feelings, arousal, and sometimes orgasm in some dental hygiene students.

Multiple reports of this being problematic in medical settings have appeared. Occasionally a patient will believe they were inappropriately touched and reports of this kind seem to occur more often among females.

#### Medical

Nitrous oxide produces a light anesthesia on its own that’s frequently added to an IV anesthetic or another inhalational anesthetic (e.g. halothane). It can reduce the dose requirement for other drugs.

In the case of dental procedures, it may only be added to a local anesthetic.

The substance is not very potent. It has a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 105%, making it a poor drug for general anesthesia. It’s instead used at sub-MAC concentrations for conscious sedation or as an adjunct.

Typically the concentration is 30-70%. It’s recommended the concentration be titrated so that an ideal level of anesthesia is provided without raising the chance of negative effects.

A review of patient records from the University of Southern California School of Dentistry found the typical patient needed 30-40% nitrous oxide.

When used for conscious sedation, the drug helps to reduce pain, can reduce anxiety, and often offers some level of amnesia (more common as the concentration increases). Anxiolysis itself can be quite useful, such as in pediatric settings.

Its low solubility in blood gives it a rapid onset and rapid clearance, with the effects ending shortly after administration ceases. Medical personnel can acutely control what state the patient is in.

**Benefits**

Nitrous oxide typically offers stable respiration and circulation, is easily breathed, provides some pain relief, is an anxiolytic, has a relatively low cost, and features an amnestic quality.

Usually there’s little effect on cardiovascular activity. One report showed an hour of 60% N2O in healthy volunteers increased heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Other reports have shown the reverse, possibly from dual cardiovascular-relevant pharmacological actions.

Another report indicated 30% N2O led to a suppression of sympathetic cardiac activity.

Its analgesic, anxiolytic, and amnestic effects can be useful. Some pain may still be felt in certain settings, but it’ll be reduced and less distressing.

**Downsides**

Some of the downsides are that it can inactivate B12, it’s inadequate on its own for general anesthesia, and there are some pressure/volume changes.

It may raise the risk of arrhythmia when combined with halothane. Otherwise the risk appears to be lower in nitrous oxide anesthesia vs. halothane anesthesia.

There appears to be a small increase in cerebral blood flow and volume, leading to a mild rise in intracranial pressure. Some reports have failed to demonstrate this and it may primarily occur in connection with coadministered drugs. For example, this effect appears to exist more when certain amounts of sevoflurane are also used.

Nitrous oxide might increase cerebral metabolic activity in a regional manner.

Its analgesia is useful during procedures, but it doesn’t last into the postoperative period.

There can also be gas pressure and volume changes in some areas of the body, potentially contraindicating its use depending on the situation.

**Pre-hospital setting**

Sometimes N2O is used before someone reaches a hospital to manage traumatic pain, such as in acute myocardial infarction. In some areas it is given when opioids aren’t available.

This use has become somewhat common in the UK and Canada.

**Labor**

Nitrous oxide has been used in labor for well over a century. Although epidural analgesia appears more effective, N2O is often adequate.

The gas offers analgesia and anxiolysis while preserving consciousness.

It’s a useful option since if the patient dislikes the effect, they can easy discontinue it and switch to something else. Women also maintain greater freedom of movement during labor, which can enhance comfortability.

A 2012 Cochrane review indicated there are analgesic effects and there don’t seem to be adverse neonatal effects.

It’s recommended inhalation begins 30 seconds before the start of a contraction.

More studies should be done on its safety and efficacy.

Stanislav Klikovich (Poland) reported this use in 1881 with a 80% N2O/20% oxygen mixture. Equipment for self-administration was introduced by Robert Minnitt in England in 1934.

#### Other medical uses

**Depression**

Like other NMDA antagonists, it’s been examined for possible antidepressant effects.

It’s been proposed that it could be used with scopolamine. This is due to scopolamine’s apparent antidepressant effects and because scopolamine has been shown to block potential pathological brain changes from N2O in rats.

Papers

Paper 1

- Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial with 20 patients
- Two sessions, one hour each, one week apart
- 4/10 had a treatment response and 3/10 had full remission at 24 hours. 
- Compared to 1/10 for response and 0/10 for remission in the placebo cases.
- Depressive symptoms significantly improved at 2 hours and 24 hours vs placebo. 
- For some patients, the effect remained until the second use, meaning an impact for a week.
- Hallucinations weren’t reported.

**Drug dependence**

Effects on withdrawal and craving have been investigated, primarily during alcohol withdrawal.

Some positive results for alcohol withdrawal exist, while other reports have failed to show a notable effect.

When it works, it does so rapidly and may reduce the duration of stay in a treatment center, reduce the time it takes for a patient to enter psychological therapy, and reduce the need for sedatives.

A lot of this work has been done in South Africa since the 1980s, but use has also appeared elsewhere, such as Finland.

**Neuroprotection**

It appears to have some neuroprotective qualities due to NMDA antagonism, which operates against excitotoxicity. There’s a potential application for the substance in ischemic brain injury.

However, the B12 concerns and effects on cerebral blood flow and metabolism have made people more interested in using xenon.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Nitrous oxide is a simple compound made of nitrogen and oxygen. It’s a colorless gas with a somewhat sweet taste at room temperature.

#### Pharmacology

The primary effect seems to be NMDA antagonism. In cultured hippocampal neurons, it had an approximate EC50 of 30-40%. Even at 80%, it was only a partial inhibitor.

A study found N2O could block NMA (racemic NMDA)-induced lesions in rats.

Others mechanisms of unclear importance have been seen.

LVA Ca channels

It’s a weak inhibitor of low-voltage activated (LVA) calcium channels. 80% N2O was shown to cause a 30% depression of LVA currents in rat sensory neurons.

N2O is selective for Cav3.2 LVA. Mutant mice with targeted deletion of Cav3.2 showed diminished N2O analgesia.

TREK-1

Activation of the TREK-1 potassium channel has been seen at clinically relevant concentrations. TREK-1 plays a role in neuronal excitability.

nAChR

Partial inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors has been reported, with a significant preference for a4b2 over a4b4.

Nitric oxide

It may influence nitric oxide (NO), possibly through affecting nitric oxide synthase. Cyclic GMP (cGMP) activation from NO could play a role in anxiolytic effects.

Microinjection of TRIM (1-[2-(Trifluoromethyl)phenyl]imidazole), a NO synthase inhibitor, into the PAG caused a dose-dependent antagonism of N2O induced antinociception in animals.

N2O was shown to cause a NO-dependent rise in b-endorphin and NO metabolites in rat arcuate nucleus.

GABAA

There’s some evidence of positive modulation at GABAA from N2O. It was found to increase the current flow at a1b2y2.

N2O potentiated the effects of muscimol (a GABAA agonist) in cultured hippocampal neurons.

In mice, flumazenil (benzodiazepine antagonist) and another GABAA competitive antagonist reversed the anxiolytic-like effects of the drug.

Flumazenil reduced ratings of subjective “high” in humans.

Other

Weak antagonism at GABAC and 5-HT3.

**Endogenous opioid peptides**

A prominent hypothesis for its analgesic effect is that N2O raises opioid peptides (e.g. met-enkephalin), which then inhibit GABA neurons and remove inhibition on descending noradrenergic inhibitory pathways.

This disinhibition of noradrenergic signalling modulates nociception in the spinal cord.

Opioid peptide activity appears to be connected to the periaqueductal gray area (PAG) of the mid brain. PAG plays a role in integrating ascending nociceptive input and descending inhibitory output.

Evidence suggests that of the descending inhibitory pathways that exist, the noradrenergic ones are most important. Nociception is hypothetically modulated at a2 adrenoreceptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

Opioid antagonists have been found to block its antinociceptive effects in animals, although results in humans have shown naloxone either has no effect, some inhibitory effect, or even a potentiation effect.

**EEG**

N2O inhalation was found to be connected with changes in full brain, parietal, and frontal level cortical networks.

Losing responsiveness was correlated with decreases in parietal network functional connectivity.

Some, but not all, of the EEG effects are similar to propofol.

## History

#### 1768

Joseph Priestley may not have technically been the first to prepare nitrous oxide.

Joseph Black reported the following:

Ammonium nitrate: is the most fusible of the common salts; when the heat is increased it copiously converted into a vapour; the degree of heat sufficient for its fusion is that of boiling water; if exposed to sudden heat (it) undergoes a deflagration…

Either he was discussing something he heard of someone doing or something he did himself.

#### 1772

Priestley (UK) is most deserving of the “discoverer” title in regards to nitrous oxide. He initially called it “dephlogisticated nitrous air” and “nitrous air, diminished.”

He made it by heating ammonium nitrate in the presence of iron filings and then passing the gas through water to remove by-products. It was reported to smell more like regular air than nitrous air.

Dephlogisticated nitrous air is the term by which I first distinguished this species of air, because it admitted a candle to burn in it. (Priestley)

Priestley and other early commenters thought it was highly dangerous to animals and presumably to humans. Mice placed in a jar of N2O exhibited lower activity and eventually death.

Bostock in 1804 wrote an essay in which he said Priestley thought nitrous oxide “was in the highest degree noxious to animals.” He also noted the Society of Dutch Chemists came to the same conclusion.

#### 1776

The first publication about N2O came from Joseph Priestley as part of a volume of his “Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air.”

#### Pre-1796

Before Davy began his experiments, Samuel Latham Mitchill of the US proclaimed N2O to be highly dangerous.

He stated:

Nitrous oxide was the principle of contagion and capable of producing the most terrible effects when respired by animals in the minutest quantities or even when applied to the skin or a muscle fibre.

And

If full inspiration of the gaseous azote be made there will be sudden extinction of life; and this accordingly accounts for the fact related by Russel and confirmed by other observers, of many persons falling down suddenly, when struck with the contagion of the plague.

Mitchill felt it was toxic and the cause of many diseases.

Beddoes cited Mitchill’s work in 1796.

#### 1798

Thomas Beddoes hired 20-year-old Humphry Davy, a Cornish chemist, to become the Superintendent of the Pneumatic Institution at Clifton in Bristol, England.

Davy first took it in April 1799.

It passed through the bronchia without stimulating the glottis, and produced no uneasy feeling in the lungs.

On April 17, 1799 he inhaled N2O in the presence of Beddoes.

Having previously closed my nostrils and exhausted my lungs, I breathed four quarts of nitrous oxide from and into a silk bag. The first feelings were similar to those produced in the last experiment; but in less than half a minute, the respiration being continued, they diminished gradually, and were succeeded by a sensation analogous to gentle pressure on all muscles, attended by a highly pleasurable thrilling in the chest and extremities. The objects around me became dazzling and my hearing more acute. Towards the last inspirations, the thrilling ceased, the sense of muscular power became greater, and at last an irresistible propensity to action was indulged in; I recollect but indefinitely what followed; I know my motions were various and violent…The next morning the recollections of the effects of the gas were indistinct, and had not remarks written immediately after the experiment recalled them to my mind, I should even have doubted their reality.

Davy quickly announced his discoveries and wrote to the editor of Nicholson’s Journal.

I have this day made a discovery, which, if you please, you may announce in your Physical Journal, namely that the nitrous phosoxyd or gaseous oxyd of azote, is respirable when perfectly freed from nitric phosoxy (nitrous gas). Dr. Mitchill’s theory of contagion is of course completely overturned; the mistake of Priestley and the Dutch chemists probably arose from their having never obtained it pure.

He found it could provide brief intoxication with euphoria and distortions of sensation, time, and space. Feelings of “a slight degree of giddiness,” “a high pleasurable feeling,” and “stamping or laughing” occurred.

Highly positive and potentially even “psychedelic” effects were described in some reports:

I felt a sense of tangible extension highly pleasurable in every limb; my visible impressions were dazzling and apparently magnified, I heard distinctly every sound in the room and was perfectly aware of my situation. By degrees as the pleasurable sensations increased, I lost all connection with external things; trains of vivid visible images rapidly passed through my mind and were connected with words in such a manner, as to produce perceptions perfectly novel. I existed in a world of newly connected and newly modified ideas. I theorised; I imagined that I made discoveries. When I was awakened from this semi-delirious trance by Dr. Kinglake, who took the bag from my mouth, indignation and pride were the first feelings produced by the sight of persons about me. My emotions were enthusiastic and sublime; and for a minute I walked round the room perfectly regardless of what was said to me. As I recovered my former state of mind, I felt an inclination to communicate the discoveries I had made during the experiment. I endeavoured to recall the ideas, they were feeble and indistinct; one collection of terms, however, presented itself; and with the most intense belief and prophetic manner, I exclaimed to Dr. Kinglake “Nothing exists but thought! The Universe is composed of impressions, ideas, pleasures and pains!

Experiments were conducted on himself and others, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

Coleridge wrote a letter to Davy describing the effects:

The first time I inspired the nitrous oxide, I felt a highly pleasurable sensation of warmth over my whole frame…The only motion which I felt inclined to make, was that of laughing at those who were looking at me. My eyes felt distended, and towards the last, my heart beat as if it were leaping up and down. On removing the mouth-piece, the whole sensation went off almost immediately.

Robert Southey, a poet, wrote to his brother Thomas Southey in July 1799 about the gas.

Davy has actually invented a new pleasure, for which language has no name. Oh Tom! I am going for more this evening; it makes one strong, and so happy!…Tom, I am sure the air in heaven must be this wonder-working gas of delight!

Davy coined the term “laughing gas.”

Some of his experiments were clearly dangerous, but he was determined to fully experience what the drug had to offer.

For example, he “resolved to breathe the gas for such a time and in such quantities as to produce excitement equal in duration and superior in intensity to that occasioned by high intoxication from opium or alcohol.”

On one occasion he tried using it after inhaling hydrogen:

But in this experiment the effects of hydrogen were so debilitating, and the consequent stimulation by nitrous oxide was so great, as to deprive me of sense. After the first three inspirations, I lost all power of standing, and fell on my back, carrying in my lips the mouth piece separated from the cylinder, to the great alarm of Mr. Patrick Dwyer, who was noting the periods of inspiration.

He also mentioned its compulsive nature.

Remarking on his own behavior:

I ought to observe that a desire to breathe the gas is always awakened in me by the sight of a person breathing, or even by that of an air bag or an air holder.

And that of others:

The desire of some individuals acquainted with the pleasures of nitrous oxide for the gas has been so strong as to induce them to breathe with eagerness, the air remaining in the bags after the respiration of others.

#### 1800

Davy published a book that, among other things, mentioned its potential role in medicine. The book was called, “Researches, Chemical and Philosophical; chiefly concerning nitrous oxide, or dephlogisticated nitrous air, and its respiration”

He noted it provided pain relief during a toothache and headache, which led to this statement near the end of the book:

As nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying physical pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood take place.

The significance of that statement shouldn’t be understated. Had Davy and others actually pursued the belief that it may be useful during surgery, the age of anesthesia could have started decades earlier than it did.

In a great historical review from W.D.A Smith in 1965, it was noted that if Davy had researched the gas further, “The Pneumatic Institution could have evolved into the first Anaesthetic Research Institution.”

Because he made that suggestion and didn’t pursue it, more modern commenters have given varying responses.

Most statements simply suggest the full utility of N2O probably didn’t occur to Davy:

These few words, lifted from the unimportant position assigned to them by Davy among a mass of his other deductions, not all of them accurate, have been given much prominence in the history of anaesthesia and it is often implied that Davy was suggesting that nitrous oxide should be used as a general anaesthetic. It is probable, however, that no such idea occurred to him, even though he knew that prolonged inhalation of the gas would produce stupor. If indeed he had conceived the idea of producing surgical anaesthesia by means of nitrous oxide, he would deserve blame rather than praise, in that he, fresh from apprenticeship to a surgeon, made no attempt to follow up this important idea himself or to encourage others to do so. It should, however, be realized . . . that his dominant enthusiasm was chemistry rather than medicine, as was shown by the fact that a year later he resigned his post at the Pneumatic Institution in order to take charge of the chemical laboratory of the newly formed Royal Institution in London. This early promotion resulted in the discontinuance of Davy’s experiments with nitrous oxide. Had he remained in Bristol and taken his medical degree as originally intended, it is more than possible that his genius would have led him to utilize nitrous oxide as a means of producing surgical anaesthesia. **[Macintosh and Pratt, 1940]**

Having made the suggestion, he dropped the matter and took no further steps to follow it up. From one point of view, why should he? It is not fair to expect it from a pure chemist. What is surprising is that his suggestion was completely ignored by the very people whom it should have interested most; that surgeons should have continued, for nearly fifty years longer, to operate upon screaming, struggling patients in full consciousness. Surely a lasting testimonial to their thickheadedness. **[Sykes, 1960]**

Cartwright in 1952 was still enthusiastic about Davy’s work.

It is not too much to say that this part of Davy’s book should be read in the original by every anesthetist.

He also gave his perspective on why the anesthesia-related comment didn’t lead anywhere:

But, when we study the facts, it becomes no longer remarkable that Davy’s suggestion of anaesthesia fell on deaf ears. A number of factors conspired together to make the adoption of this idea not only improbable but almost impossible. Of these factors the two most important are, firstly, the outlook of the ordinary eighteenth-century man upon the subject of pain, and secondly the fact that Davy’s idea would have been an entirely new and unheard of thing.

The book refuted Mitchill’s hypothesis. Davy found “nitrous oxide was respirable, and capable of supporting life for a long time than any gas, except atmospheric air and oxygene.”

Bostock in 1804 described how Davy overturned Mitchill’s hypothesis.

The experiment was, however, repeated by Mr. Davy, and he discovered not only that this gas may be respired for a short time without inconvenience, but that the employment of it is succeeded by a singular excitement of the nervous system, which differs from that produced by alcohol and opium, in not inducing a subsequent state of exhaustion. Mr. Davy also proved, that it is absorbed by the blood in considerable quantity.

#### 1800 – 1850

A lot of people were introduced to nitrous oxide, including high-profile individuals, after Davy’s book was published.

Astley Cooper, an important surgeon, experienced it during a meeting of the Askesian Society in either February or March of 1800.

William Allen was also present at that meeting. He discussed his experience in his diary.

Present Astley Cooper, Bradley, Fox and others. We all breathed gaseous oxide of azote. It took a surprising effect upon me, abolishing completely, at first, all sensation: then I had the idea of being carried violently upward in a dark cavern with only a few glimmering lights. The company said that my eyes were fixed, face purple, veins in the forehead very large, apoplectic stertor, etc. They were all much alarmed, but I suffered no pain and in a short time came to myself.

The Askesian Society experiments may have been triggered by one of Davy’s communications about N2O to Nicholson’s Journal. In his third communication, he mentioned how it was prepared for respiration.

Astley Cooper wouldn’t have been aware of Davy’s suggestion that it could be used in surgery.

Many reviews of Davy’s book were published, some of which were very favorable. Though they all seemed to leave out the surgical application comment and often didn’t discuss Davy’s mention of pain relief.

Of the many singular and highly interesting particulars contained in the volume now before us, no proper analysis could be given within the limits of our periodical publication. For most of these, therefore, we must refer the chemical reader to the original work, which demonstrates, in a remarkable degree, the industry and genius of the author, whose enthusiasm for the discovery of truth, has led him, with a perseverance almost without example, to undergo very great sufferings, and even to run the risk, on many occasions, of immediate death. And we have no doubt, that the intelligent reader, after careful perusal of his experiments, will give him due credit for his meritorious exertions. **[Annals of Medicine, 1800]**

**Discussion in medical and chemistry settings**

Davy’s work began to be discussed by students, physicians, teachers, and others in the areas of medicine and chemistry.

It was brought to the attention of the public via scientific demonstrations at the Royal Institution, at private parties, through public entertainment, and in non-medical literature.

Humphry Davy joined the Royal Institution in 1801 and gave a short course of lectures after his arrival.

During a concluding lecture on June 20, he offered to let people use the gas after the lecture was done.

An opportunity was given to such as wished it, to breathe some of nitrous oxide . . . Mr. Grosvenor Bedford, Mr. Stodart, and Mr. Underwood, breathed the gas; and the effects it produced, especially on the last, were truly wonderful. He experienced so much pleasure from breathing it, that he lost all sense to everything else, and the breathing bag could only be taken from him at last by force.

One June 23, Davy reported “a select party met at the Institution to try the effects of the gaseous oxide.” It appears nitrous oxide quickly became an attraction at the Royal Institution.

The same “Stodart,” whose full name was James Stodart, published his experiences with N2O in a letter to Nicholson’s Journal in 1802.

He said he “prepared and breathed the gas at different times, and the effects were always pleasurable.” An interesting analgesic effect was described at one point. Stodart said it quickly relieved pain in his face and head one day, with a single use getting rid of the pain for the rest of the day. When his pain returned, he used N2O again before bedtime and awoke pain-free.

A chemistry lecture from Thomas Charles Hope as early as 1800 discussed N2O, as evidenced from a note made by John Lee.

The gaseous oxide of azote—It consists of azotic and oxygen gas—Dr. Mitchell supposes this gas to be the contagion of all diseases—Mr. Davy has discovered its very singular properties—When inhaled it gives highly pleasurable sensations of the most extatic kind —The account given by Dr. Beddoes Jan 18th is perhaps exaggerated

Babington and Allen’s printed syllabus from 1802 mentioned nitrous oxide’s effects and properties. It was at least used in Guy’s and St. Thomas’ hospitals.

Notes from George Hickman in 1806 described Davy’s work and also featured a sketch of an apparatus that’d be used to prepare the gas.

This gas had been thought to be irrespirable but Davy has proved that it may: when respired it produces the most curious sensation.

It should not be exhibited to hysterical persons it has been known to produce ill effects–tho in the common number of persons it produces only temporary effects.

Its properties were mentioned in British chemistry textbooks from the 1800s to 1820s.

it does not prove fatal because, when received into the lungs, it is mixed and diluted with the atmospherical air present in that organ. [Henry, 1815]

There were six references to N2O in the Lancet between October 1823 and 1844.

Professor Benjamin Silliman wrote in 1819 in the American Journal of Science that more attention should be given to the medical uses of gases, including N2O.

Should the revival of the experiments on the respiration of oxygen gas appear to be desired, it would not be difficult to simplify the apparatus and operations so as to bring them within the reach of an intelligent person, even although ignorant of chemistry. This interesting class of experiments ought to be resumed, not with the spirit of quackery nor of extravagant expectation, but with the sobriety of philosophical research; and it is more than probable that the nitrous oxide, which is now little more than the subject of merriment and wonder, if properly diluted and discreetly applied, would be productive of valuable effects.

Bostock had a physiology textbook in 1826 that mentioned it:

Of gases, which although not capable of supporting life are still respirable, the one that is least injurious to the system appears to be nitrous oxide.

There was also some early discussion beyond the UK. In Black’s Lectures on the Elements of Chemistry, Robinson is said to have referred to experiments by Priestley and Davy while in Amsterdam, with Robinson stating:

Its effects when breathed for some time, are very wonderful, and were first discovered, I believe, by Mr. Davy. To those who are not hurt by the sight of folly, they are also very amusing.

**Recreational use**

Medical use largely didn’t exist during the first decades of nitrous oxide’s public use. Instead, it was taken as a recreational drug.

One of the few suggestions of medical use appeared in a fictional Doctor Syntax book in 1820. In “Doctor Syntax in Search of the Grotesque,” a women complains of a bad tooth, visits a dentist, has the tooth extracted, and is then offered N2O to soothe the pain. This was set in Paris, France.

Another Doctor Syntax book, “The Tour of Doctor Syntax through London,” described a visit to the London Institution during which N2O was demonstrated. The book mentioned the gas providing a “sweet delirium” and a “laughing fit.”

**Public entertainment**

Use for public entertainment really seemed to begin around the 1820s and 1830s. Sometimes people would use N2O on stage and act out their intoxication.

A playbill for a show at London’s Adelphi Theatre in 1824 mentioned M. Henry demonstrating nitrous oxide and offering it to “any of the Audience who may chuse to inhale it.”

Schoenbein, a German naturalist, witnessed a demonstration at the Adelphi Theatre during a visit to England. The visit doesn’t have a clear date, but it was around 1824 to 1826.

In some of the smaller theatres, physical and chemical experiments are sometimes made, more for the entertainment than for the edification of the audience, and I once saw such a performance. It was at the Adelphi Theatre and they wanted to demonstrate the very odd properties and the physiological effects of the laughing gas.

When the curtain was raised, you could see on the stage, in a wide semicircle, a dozen or more large caoutchouc bladders with shining metal taps, filled with the laughing gas. The “Expenmentator” appeared in a simple dress suit, and made a short opening speech in which he described the properties of the gas, and its preparation, in a way which would have done credit to a professor of chemistry. At the end of his lecture he asked for someone from the audience to come on the stage and to inhale from one of the bladders. A tall daring fellow jumped over the orchestra and on to the stage, and grabbed one of the bladders. But the audience didn’t like him and greeted him with cries of “Off! Off!” At first he did not comply, but when the cries grew louder he went away. A second candidate appeared, but he too was shouted off. When the third met with the same undignified reception, the “Experimentator” interceded and asked the audience firmly but politely not to be so fickle and to let the show go on. This appeal had the desired effect and they proceeded. The volunteer—sitting in a chair—put the tap to his mouth, compressed his nose, and inhaled the laughing gas while the “Experimentator” held the bladder. The tap was then closed while the subject breathed out through the nose. The tap was opened again, the nose compressed, and some more gas inhaled through the mouth. He continued in this way until the bag was emptied. Now the “Experimentator retired; but the “luft-trunken” man remained sitting in his chair for a few minutes, while he stared straight ahead, holding his nose. You can imagine how this comical posture sent the audience into roars of laughter which increased when the intoxicated man leapt smartly from his chair and then made astonishing bounds all over the stage.

When the audience had had its fill and the man had sobered up, a voice called out: “All nonsense and humbug!” “All nonsense and humbug!” echoed immediately from hundreds of throats. “No! No!” came the emphatic reply. When the protests continued, the “Expenmentator” appeared’and shouted at the top of his voice: “Ladies and Gentlemen”. When he obtained a hearing he assured the audience that the experiment was genuine, and he invited the man who had first voiced his doubts to try the experiment himself. The man responded with alacrity and displayed his incredulity by demanding to empty the largest bladder. His request was immediately complied with, and the effect of the gas upon the disbeliever was so great that he beat around him like a madman and assaulted the “Experimentator”. This performance confirmed the sceptics in their doubts and brought forth fresh demonstrations of disbelief.

Schoenbein also mentioned that use was more widespread in England than anywhere else. Because of its effects, he believed people might adopt it as an alternative to alcohol.

My chemical readers may be interested to know that this gas is nowhere inhaled more often than in England, because its marvellous effects were first discovered in this country by Sir Humphry Davy. Once when I stayed in the country with a friend, who was an amateur chemical experimenter, we discussed laughing gas and decided to make a good supply of it ourselves. One fine afternoon, a large party met in the garden to inhale the intoxicating gas in the open air. Some young men inhaled it first, and they all showed undoubted signs of wellbeing and pleasure. When another man of more mature age had his doubts, he decided to take a large quantity of the gas for himself. After breathing a lot of gas, he began to dance and devastate the adjoining flower-bed in his ecstasy—to the delight of his audience. Maybe it will become the custom for us to inhale laughing gas at the end of a dinner party, instead of drinking champagne, and in that event there would be no shortage of gas factories.

Overall, there are signs that nitrous oxide was pretty frequently used in England, but the average person probably didn’t know its effects in the 1820s and 1830s.

A handbill from 1845 talked about its acute compulsive effect.

Those who inhale the Gas once are always anxious to inhale it a second time.

Read (1947) also determined use was notable in England based on a contemporary description:

Judging from the contemporary writer Fievee, the inhalation of “exhilarating” or “laughing” gas became a vogue . . . for in his Lettres sur I’Angleterre he condemned the practice as a national vice of the English!

From what I can tell, the work from Fievee that was referenced can be found [here](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1113180/f3.image) .

Some problems with its use also seemed to occur, such as apparent poisonings from novice-prepared nitrous oxide. Stanley (1842) said three young men tried preparing it on their own. One of them convulsed and took a while to recover. Although this could conceivably have come from N2O, it was suggested they may have overheated the ammonium nitrate.

**Early use in America**

Many people were introduced to nitrous oxide through the work of travelling showmen as early as the 1830s.

Like in England, use was also likely taking place before then in universities.

Ashurst (1897) in recalling a time earlier in the 1800s wrote:

[It was] the custom of some of our medical schools–at the University of Pennsylvania, for one–for students to breathe “laughing gas”, as it was then called, for a diversion.

Interest in the gas may have come from Philadelphia. Barton wrote a paper in 1808 called entitled, “Dissertation on the Chymical Properties and Exhilarating Effects of Nitrous Oxide.”

But the account which he (Davy) gave of its operation was generally derided as extravagant and imaginary. Few believed it. The description was supposed to have proceeded from a warmed and highly excited mind…In the United States the chymists partook of the prevalent skepticism as to the alleged properties of the gas.

Barton also wrote about its apparent pain relieving effects, which he encountered when using it after hitting his head.

I am decidedly of opinion with Mr. Davy, that this gas has the power of removing intense physical pain.

Barton expressed an interest in bringing N2O to the attention of more physicians.

One of the travelling showmen who demonstrated the gas was Samuel Colt, who would later enable the mass production of the revolver.

In 1832, when Colt was only 18, he toured the East Coast from Canada to Maryland showing nitrous oxide’s effects.

One of the advertisements, titled “Nitrous Oxide Gas For Ladies and Gentlement,” appeared in Portland in October 1832.

Dr. S. Coult respectfully informs the Ladies and Gentlemen of Portland and vicinity, that he will administer the NITROUS OXIDE, or Exhilarating Gas, on Monday evening at the City Hall. Exhibition to commence at 7 o’clock precisely. The peculiar effects of this singular compound upon the animal system, was first noticed by the English Chemist, Sir Humphry Davy. He observed that when inhaled into the lungs it produced the most astonishing effects upon the nervous system; that some individuals were disposed to laugh, sing, and dance; others, to recitation and declamation, and that the greater number had an irresistible propensity to muscular exertion, such as wrestling, boxing, etc., with numerous fantastic feats. In short, the sensations produced by it are highly pleasurable, and are not followed by debility. . . . Dr. G. has exhibited the extraordinary powers of the gas in many cities of the United States, to audiences composed of Ladies and Gentlemen of the first respectability—and many Ladies have inhaled the gas at select Exhibitions. Those Ladies who may be anxious of witnessing the Exhibition, in this city, may be assured, that the City Hall embraces every accommodation for their comfort, and that not a shadow of impropriety attends the Exhibition,, to shock the most modest. He will attend, on reasonable terms, to any applications for private Exhibitions to select parties of Ladies and Gentlemen.

**Medical use**

A couple mentions of it being tested for medical applications appeared in the 1820s and 1830s.

Curtis (1829) mentioned giving it to a patient with severe asthma attacks. The patient reported feeling much better.

Another individual suffering from wheezing and difficulty breathing whenever they had a cold was said to have been cured by nitrous oxide.

Hudson (1832) suggested it could be used as a stimulant in cases of cholera. This was on the grounds that the state of excitement wouldn’t be followed by sedation. There’s no record of it ever being used around this time in that way.

Back and Morgan (1834) at Guy’s Hospital reported trying to allay severe spasms in a young man suffering from hydrophobia. The spasms only increased, however, with the use of nitrous oxide.

Bigelow (1848) said a patient had her breast removed under N2O gas that was given through a valve mouthpiece and a flexible tube.

After several inspirations the patient’s lips and the most vascular part of the tumour began to assume a purple colour. She remained quiet, however, and in a short time was evidently insensible.

#### 1844 – 1848

Horace Wells, an American dentist, visited an entertainment show at Union Hall in Hartford, Connecticut on December 10, 1844. He was traveling with his wife, Elizabeth.

The show was advertised as a “grand exhibition” and was organized by Gardner Quincy Colton.

During the event, Wells noticed one of the men, Samuel Cooley, inhaled the gas and then injured his leg while staggering around. Despite the injury, he didn’t notice the pain until the N2O wore off.

Based on what he saw, Wells thought it may be a useful analgesic. He asked Colton to give him N2O during a wisdom tooth extraction the following day.

Colton served as the anesthesiologist and another dentist, Dr. John Riggs, extracted the tooth.

Wells reported being unaware of the procedure and experiencing no pain. He proclaimed it was “a new era in tooth pulling.”

After this experience, he carried out 12-15 successful trials of N2O during dental procedures in Connecticut between December 1844 and January 1845.

He decided he should demonstrate its efficacy elsewhere and decided to visit Boston rather than New York, which was his other option.

Wells traveled to Boston in January 1845.

Around the time he arrived, nitrous oxide was publicized in multiple local papers. The Boston Bee reported:

A dentist in Hartford, (Conn.) has adopted the use of nitrous oxide gas, in teeth pulling. It is said that after taking this gas the patient feels no pain.

Posts in the Boston Evening Transcript advertised Wells’ upcoming demo of N2O and requested that local dentists provide patients for Wells to work with.

Most of the people he interacted with in Boston doubted the gas’ efficacy, but he was allowed to address students at Harvard Medical School (Massachusetts Medical School).

He talked to students following a lecture from John Collins Warren, a famous surgeon. The students went into an adjoining room and may have been given N2O by Wells.

The same evening, Wells went elsewhere in Boston to carry out his demonstration. Although it’s often said he was at Massachusetts General Hospital, the evidence doesn’t support that. Rather, it appears the event was at Quincy Hall, Phoenix Hall, or Boylston Hall.

Wells tried to show its efficacy in front of quite a few students and physicians during a dental extraction.

Unfortunately, the patient initially cried out and reported pain. However, it is said he eventually reported the pain was “not as much as usually attends the operation.”

Another account said there was an initial complaint from the patient, but when the patient awoke, he reported no pain at all.

Wells attributed this result to withdrawing the bag too soon.

Some of the spectators completely dismissed the effects and may have even “laughed and hissed.”

For a while, interest turned to ether and chloroform instead. Though Wells would eventually be recognized by some as the “discoverer of anesthesia.”

Shortly after the Boston incident, Wells became physically and psychologically ill, possibly in connection to a deep sense of humiliation and failure.

The excitement of this adventure immediately brought on an illness, from which I did not recover for many months; being thus obliged to relinquish, entirely, my professional business.

Wells tried to get public and official recognition for his status as the discoverer of anesthesia, but he largely failed.

In January 1848, Wells threw sulfuric acid on two women in New York City while under the influence of chloroform. He was arrested and committed to prison in The Tombs (The NY Halls of Justice and House of Detention in Manhattan.)

He committed suicide on January 23, 1848 by inhaling chloroform and cutting his left femoral artery.

Wells died unaware that just a few weeks earlier the Paris Society of Medicine had recognized him as the inventor of anesthesia and made him an honorary member.

#### 1863

The same Gardner Quincy Colton who introduced Wells to the gas was able to firmly establish its use in dentistry.

#### 1867

Colton reported widespread use by the late 1860s.

#### 1868

A successful demo at the Dental Hospital in London by Dr. Evans, a doctor from Paris, triggered a spread of its use.

The same year, Andrew published accounts of multiple cases where N2O was being used in combination with oxygen, making its administration safer.

#### 1860s onward

Nitrous oxide was promoted around North America and Europe.

It was popularized as an anxiolytic and analgesic tool for procedures like tooth extractions. The drug expanded into other fields as well, notably obstetrics and surgery.

Dr. C A Brackett in 1875 reported putting a women under N2O for 30 minutes so that Dr. Squier could remove breast cancer. Brackett called it a “grand success.”

#### 1890s

Prolonged administration wasn’t really reported until around the 1890s.

Herbert Paterson in 1895 began giving N2O through the nose in prolonged dental cases. Paterson also went around the UK showing how prolonged nasal N2O could be used in dentistry.

#### Late 1800s

Nonmedical use was still taking place. For example, William James published accounts of its use and viewed it as a potentially useful and interesting substance.

In 1882, he stated:

I strongly urge others to repeat the experiment, which with pure gas is short and harmless enough. The effects will of course vary with the individual, just as they vary in the same individual from time to time; but it is probable that in the former case, as in the latter, a generic resemblance will obtain. With me, as with every other person of whom I have heard, the keynote of the experience is the tremendously exiting sense of an intense metaphysical illumination. Truth lies open to the view in depth beneath depth of almost blinding evidence. The mind sees all logical relations of being with an apparant subtlety and instantaniety to which its normal consciousness offers no parallel; only as sobriety returns, the feeling of insight fades, and one is left staring vacantly at a few disjointed words and phrases, as one stares at a cadaverous-looking snowpeak from which sunset glow has just fled, or at a black cinder left by an extinguished brand.

More statements from James are available on [Erowid](https://erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous_article1.shtml) .

#### 1912

While N2O+O2 was being used, it wasn’t popular yet in the UK.

Teter reported giving a demo of it at Guy’s and Chaldicott/Page tried to popularize it, but interest wasn’t significant.

#### 1917

H. Edmund G. Boyle of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital read a paper before the Medical Society of London. The paper was called, “Experiences of the Use of Nitrous Oxide and Oxygen with Rebreathing in Military Surgery.”

Soon after the publication of that paper, he was contacted by the UK’s War Office, which wanted several machines that would allow N2O to be used in military surgeries.

Boyle was asked to review the machines and approve them “for use at the front.”

After the war, N2O+O2 and ether became more common. Boyle reported it was his routine combo for abdominal operations in the 1930s.

Boyle also said people in the US were using the N2O+O2 gas for childbirth. He tried to get people in the UK to do the same, but it took a while to catch on.

He described alarming experiments being carried out by E.I. McKesson in Toledo, Ohio. McKesson demoed for Boyle a practice called “secondary saturation” that would be used to produce relaxation.

Boyle described it as an “alarming sight.” McKesson would give N2O until the pupils widely dilated and the patient’s color was grey, with the patient looking like “death.” He then returned oxygen to the lungs and the patient’s color would return.

Boyle was glad to have seen the demo, but the method was “not one that I am prepared to teach to students.”

#### 1956

Beliefs about nitrous oxide’s safety started to change by the mid-1900s.

The Lancet published a case series by Lassen in April 1956. That series described megaloblastic bone marrow changes from extended inhalation of N2O by patients at Bledgam Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Physicians at Bledgam suggested in 1954 that general anesthesia with nitrous oxide could be provided to patients with severe tetanus infections.

Of the first five patients, two died from sepsis following agranulocytosis after the first week. They were a 15-year-old male and 53-year-old female.

Records from Bledgam also showed that in patients with similar conditions, N2O administration was the only common factor.

This prompted a trial in two more patients. Both showed marked hematological changes by Day 4 and bone marrow biopsies showed megaloblastic changes.

When N2O was discontinued, the hematological abnormalities went away in 3-4 days.

More cases were published after the Lancet paper.

#### 1950s – 1980s

Other reports built upon the megaloblastic issues reported by Lassen.

It was found that megaloblastic changes would occur after 24-36 hours of exposure, but not within 1 or 6 hours.

Evidence suggested critically ill people were more susceptible to N2O-related issues in shorter periods of time than other patients.

In 1968, a B12 inactivation reported appeared. It was found N2O oxidized the cobalt core of cobalamin, making it inactive for the purpose of methionine synthase. This paper largely went unnoticed by anesthetists and hematologists for years.

Amess (1978) reported that 24 hours of N2O interfered with DNA synthesis. This was accurately associated with B12 issues.

Deacon (1978) reported rapid inhibition of methionine synthase in rats.

The first reports of neuropathy and myelopathy came from Layzer. Initially Layzer reported 3 recreational cases involving two dentists and a hospital technician. They developed problems after using N2O several times per week for months. Some of the symptoms were numbness in the extremities, hypoactive reflexes, and an “electric shock sensation traveling upward from the feet after flexion of the neck.”

Layzer reported a larger case series demonstrating what appeared to be subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord in 15 people.

Medical professionals began to come to different conclusions about how to proceed.

A 1978 editorial suggested N2O probably wouldn’t be used if it were a new drug. Others said the advantages still outweighed the disadvantages.

Saidman (1985) presented a case in favor of N2O that noted the inhibition of methionine synthase wasn’t correlated with clinical effects during typical N2O use.

**Occupational exposure concerns**

Vaisman (1967), a Russian anesthetist, reported a 58% abortion rate in anesthesia personnel exposed to gases including nitrous oxide. This triggered a line of research and concern about the safety of employees.

Vaisman also reported a correlation between N2O occupational exposure and irritability, fatigue, headache, nausea, and fetal malformation.

Bruce (1974) reported that slight exposure among personnel could impair audiovisual capabilities. However, all attempts to replicate this finding failed and the researchers retracted their conclusions.

#### 1979

There was an apparent rise in recreational use, especially among dental/medical personnel, in the 1960s and 1970s.

A 1979 paper indicated up to 20% of dental and medical students had experimented with it.

#### 1980s

It was reported to be very common in US dental procedures, with ~25% of US dentists reportedly utilizing conscious sedation.

#### 1980s – 1990s

We learned more about its pharmacology.

Multiple groups found N2O could trigger a rise in opioid peptide, mainly met-enkephalin, concentrations in rat brain. Some research also suggested a rise in b-endorphin.

Research in the 1990s found it was an NMDA antagonist.

#### 2000

The National Survey on Drug Use and Health found N2O was the most common inhalant among 16 and 17-year-olds.

#### 2002

A review found nitrous oxide use during labor was very common in some countries. 50 – 75% of women in the UK and 60% of women in Finland were using it. Use was also high in Australia and New Zealand.

#### 2003

A paper from Auckland University found 12% of first-year students reported using the drug for recreational purposes.

#### 2000s – 2010s

There was an apparent decline in use due to concerns about its safety and doubts about its efficacy relative to alternatives.

One report found it was used in 33% of operations in the US in 2009, but that fell to 21% in 2011.

At the same time, recreational use was stable or higher.

#### 2010

The American College of Nurse-Midwives published a statement endorsing greater availability of N2O for women going through labor.

#### 2013-2014

A survey in England and Wales found N2O was more popular than cocaine, ecstasy/MDMA, or ketamine among 16 to 24-year-olds.

#### 2017

It’s one of the most common inhalants in the US and other countries.

For decades there have been arguments about how much N2O should be used in medical settings. Those debates are still taking place.

Many hospitals have stopped using the gas since the 2000s due to safety concerns and the ability of short-acting and potentially better tolerated drugs.

## Safety

The primary concerns with nitrous oxide are B12 inactivation and hypoxia.

Other general precautions are that you should be sitting or laying down when using it and it’s best to use it from a balloon.

#### Hypoxia

N2O balloons shouldn’t be used in quick succession and very large balloons are best avoided. Take breaks (preferably longer than 10-20 minutes) in between balloons so that you can deeply breathe regular air. You should also breathe in deeply before using N2O.

Never use N2O in a way that doesn’t let you separate from the N2O source. This means you shouldn’t use a mask, for example.

Don’t hold your breath too long. Holding for more than 30-60 seconds doesn’t seem to be wise.

You generally won’t experience shortness of breath or feeling like you need to breathe even when you experience oxygen deprivation from N2O.

A short period of slight hypoxia generally won’t be an issue for people, but it could potentially raise the chance of seizure and cardiac arrhythmia in some users.

In medical settings, one of the concerns is diffusion hypoxia. This is caused by the rapid outward diffusion of N2O from pulmonary blood, which lowers the concentration of other gases in the lunges. With the oxygen concentration diluted, oxygen transfer across the alveolus can be affected, leading to hypoxia.

Diffusion hypoxia is of minimal relevance for most people, though it could be relevant in pulmonary disease. It can be avoided by only giving oxygen for a period of minutes during the post-N2O washout.

Nowadays N2O is always combined with O2 in medical settings, so hypoxia largely isn’t a concern like it used to be. However, there are occasionally problems due to equipment malfunction, cross-connection of the N2O and O2 lines, inaccurate gas cylinder labeling, or other human error.

#### B12

B12 inactivation is mainly an issue with prolonged administration, frequent recreational use, or the administration of N2O in someone with B12 deficiency.

Nitrous oxide leads to rapid oxidation (possibly through free radicals) of cobalamin’s cobalt from the monovalent to the trivalent form, which is inactive for the purpose of methionine synthase, which B12 is a coenzyme of.

Here are some of the problems with that action:

- Reduced conversion of homocysteine to methionine, thereby raising homocysteine levels.
- Impeded methionine and S-adenosyl methionine synthesis 
- This prevents methylation of myelin sheath phospholipids, eventually contributing to myelopathy.
- Infringed transmethylation of levomefolic acid to homocysteine, which would normally produce tetrahydrofolate and methionine.

Higher homocysteine levels could be linked to endothelial dysfunction and prothrombotic effects, but the usually transient effect of N2O shouldn’t be an issue.

This inhibition can seemingly persists for days and therefore exposure more than every few days likely has a cumulative effect.

Some people may initially be asymptomatic, but these problems develop into subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.

The symptoms include limb weakness, numbness, ataxia, clumsiness, tingling, and imbalance.

Psychological issues like personality changes, mood disorders, psychosis, and hallucinations can occur.

It can take a bit of time for the problems to become obvious.

Mild megaloblastic changes can appear after 12 hours of administration, with the issues increasing by 24 hours.

Agranulocytosis can eventually develop in severe cases, raising the chance of infection.

**Testing**

B12 levels may be decreased, but they can also be within the reference limits.

Looking at homocysteine is a better marker.

An MRI may also show spinal cord abnormalities consistent with subacute combined degeneration.

**Treatment**

The main treatments are abstinence from N2O and the administration of B12.

Methionine may also be useful.

Treatment will generally be effective, but sometimes symptoms persist for 6-12 months or longer.

**Prevention**

Limit your exposure and make sure you have a good B12 intake.

Even B12 supplementation won’t prevent issues, however, if your N2O use is significant enough.

**Papers**

Paper 1

- Monkeys exposed to 15% N2O developed subacute combined degeneration in two months, with progressive ataxia.
- Their spinal cords showed degeneration of myelin sheaths and axis cylinders.
- It would take 5 years of a B12 deficient diet to produce the same changes.

Paper 2

- Plasma methionine and S-adenosyl methionine did not decline with 3 hours of N2O.

Paper 3

- Plasma methionine declined 15-25% with 8 to 24 hours of N2O.

#### Other issues

**Frostbite**

N2O cannot be taken directly from a container as the gas near the outlet of a tank, for example, can be as low as -55°C (-131°F).

There are reports of recreational use leading to severe tissue damage as well as of accidents leading to injury in occupational settings.

Some examples include:

- The inadvertent leakage of a small amount of liquid nitrous oxide from a valve stem instantly froze the thenar space of an anesthetist’s left hand.
- An anesthesiologist opened a nitrous oxide cylinder and sustaineda direct blast of N2O to his left palm, resulting in frostbite.
- A man tried to recreationally use nitrous oxide by placing his lips directly over the cylinder. 
- His lips froze to the valve block.
- This led to frostbite of the lips, mouth, tongue, and palate.

Case

Case 1

- 54-year-old male
- Took nitrous oxide directly from a cylinder
- When he became disoriented, the gas hit his left check for an indefinite period of time.
- Presented to ED 12 hours later 
- Edema in his left check
- Admitted to burn center to manage fourth-degree frostbite
- There was complete necrosis of the skin of his cheek 
- The skin eventually separated and left a granulating wound.
- Skin grafting was refused, so the wound healed with a hypertrophic scar.

**Neuroxoticity**

Short-term exposure has been shown to cause pathological changes in the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex of rats.

The concentration for those changes is about the max concentration used in human anesthesia.

Diazepam, pentobarbital, and scopolamine have been shown to block neurotoxicity in animal models.

Although the potential for neurotoxicity has been shown in animal models, its existence in humans hasn’t been demonstrated. McGregor (2008) reported there was no clear effect on neurological measures when given intraoperatively in response to intracranial aneurysm. It was concluded there was no current evidence to categorically avoid N2O in patients at risk for ischemic brain injury.

Some evidence suggests neurotoxicity could arise from high homocysteine or oxidative stress.

Animals studies showed cell death with prolonged exposure and reversible vacuolation with shorter exposure.

**Malignant hyperthermia**

This is a very rare response and N2O isn’t contraindicated in patients with malignant hyperthermia.

However, there was one case of the gas triggering the issue:

Case

- 11-year-old female
- Needed general anesthesia
- Because father died from hyperthermia during a surgical procedure, she was given a specific anesthetic that wasn’t a volatile agent or depolarizing muscle relaxant.
- Anesthesia with thiopental and N2O 
- Within 12 minutes, temperature was up 1-2°C
- Procedure was terminated, followed by cold blankets and dexamethasone.
- Anesthesia attempted again 
- Only with N2O and O2
- Temperature again began to rise and attempt was cancelled.
- Body temperature stabilizied without active treatment.

**Gas volume and pressure changes**

Because nitrous oxide diffuses into body cavities much faster than nitrogen leaves the cavities, a rise in pressure or volume can occur.

Rise in volume:

- Pleural cavity
- Peritoneal cavity
- Bowel

Rise in pressure

- Cranium
- Middle ear
- Eye

Potentially contraindicated

- During or after eye surgery that involve intraocular gas. 
- Due to increase in the size of the bubble.
- This could raise intraocular pressure and cause vision problems.
- Bowel, laparoscopic, middle ear, and eye surgery
- Caution advised in neurosurgery
- Closing the abdomen after surgery could be more difficult from increased bowel volume.

**Occupational exposure**

N2O exposure doesn’t seem to be an issue for employees as long as there is proper ventilation and scavenger devices.

#### Fatalities

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Nitrous_Oxide*

Nitrous Oxide (N2O) is a simple gas that, when inhaled, causes rapid analgesia (pain relief), euphoria, mild sedation, and sometimes psychedelic dissociation. It is widely available and its effects are short lasting.

## History

Nitrous Oxide was first discovered by English scientist Joseph Priestley in 1772, and was first published about in 1776. In 1799, Humphry Davy gave Nitrous Oxide to visitors of the Pneumatic Institute, and coined the term "laughing gas". Through his experiments, he discovered Nitrous Oxide's analgesic effects in 1800. From 1800 to 1840, Nitrous was primarily used for recreation at travelling public shows, but in 1844-1845 Nitrous was recognized as having some medical use in dentistry. In the late 1800's, William James published some accounts of his work with Nitrous Oxide, and called its effects of "some metaphysical significance". Nitrous has remained popular throughout the 20th century, and is sold over the counter in small cartridges ("whippets") for making whipped cream, and in large tanks for industrial and medical purposes.

## Dosage

Nitrous is most frequently used in the form of whipped cream chargers, small metal cartridges which are 'cracked' either into a whipped cream canister or with a special 'cracker' into a balloon for inhalation. A single cartridge is between one and three lungs full of gas. One or two lung fulls is generally enough for a short nitrous experience although many people choose to use many cartridges throughout the course of a night.

## Duration

### Inhaled

Note: both the onset and duration increase with the dose. 

| Onset | 0-1 minute |
| --- | --- |
| Total | 1-5 minutes |
| After-effects | 15-30 minutes |

## Effects

### Postive

- Anxiolytic

- Euphoria

- Giggling and laughing

- Neuroprotection

- Dream-like state

### Neutral

- Analgesia

- Sound distortion

- Minor to strong hallucinations & visualizations

### Negative

- Neurotoxicity

## Harm Reduction

Nitrous Oxide should be mixed with air (50/50). If you got pure gas make sure you inhale air, so you don't suffocate yourself.

- Make sure you are sitting down and won't hurt yourself if you get dizzy

- Very cold temperatures of the gas can freeze the lips and throat if taken directly from a tank or whippit. Releasing the gas into a balloon first allows the gas to warm before being administered.

- Avoid driving.

- Avoid walking or moving in general if possible.

### Warning

- Nitric Oxide, a toxic industrial gas, is occasionally mistaken for Nitrous Oxide. Users should be careful they know what they are inhaling. Inhaling Nitric Oxide can permanently damage the lungs or kill.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide*

Nitrous oxide (dinitrogen oxide or dinitrogen monoxide), commonly known as laughing gas, nitrous, or factitious air, among others, is a chemical compound, an oxide of nitrogen with the formula N2O. At room temperature, it is a colourless non-flammable gas, and has a slightly sweet scent and taste. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidiser similar to molecular oxygen.
Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anaesthetic and pain-reducing effects, and it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Its colloquial name, "laughing gas", coined by Humphry Davy, describes the euphoric effects upon inhaling it, which cause it to be used as a recreational drug inducing a brief "high". When abused chronically, it may cause neurological damage through inactivation of vitamin B12. It is also used as an oxidiser in rocket propellants and motor racing fuels, and as a frothing gas for whipped cream.
Nitrous oxide is also an atmospheric pollutant, with a concentration of 333 parts per billion (ppb) in 2020, increasing at 1 ppb annually. It is a major scavenger of stratospheric ozone, with an impact comparable to that of CFCs. About 40% of human-caused emissions are from agriculture, as nitrogen fertilisers are digested into nitrous oxide by soil micro-organisms. As the third most important greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide substantially contributes to global warming. Reduction of emissions is an important goal in the politics of climate change.

## Discovery and early use

The gas was first synthesised in 1772 by English natural philosopher and chemist Joseph Priestley who called it dephlogisticated nitrous air (see phlogiston theory) or inflammable nitrous air. Priestley published his discovery in the book Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air (1775), where he described how to produce the preparation of "nitrous air diminished", by heating iron filings dampened with nitric acid.

The first important use of nitrous oxide was made possible by Thomas Beddoes and James Watt, who worked together to publish the book Considerations on the Medical Use and on the Production of Factitious Airs (1794). This book was important for two reasons. First, James Watt had invented a novel machine to produce "factitious airs" (including nitrous oxide) and a novel "breathing apparatus" to inhale the gas. Second, the book also presented the new medical theories by Thomas Beddoes, that tuberculosis and other lung diseases could be treated by inhalation of "Factitious Airs".

The machine to produce "Factitious Airs" had three parts: a furnace to burn the needed material, a vessel with water where the produced gas passed through in a spiral pipe (for impurities to be "washed off"), and finally the gas cylinder with a gasometer where the gas produced, "air", could be tapped into portable air bags (made of airtight oily silk). The breathing apparatus consisted of one of the portable air bags connected with a tube to a mouthpiece. With this new equipment being engineered and produced by 1794, the way was paved for clinical trials, which began in 1798 when Thomas Beddoes established the "Pneumatic Institution for Relieving Diseases by Medical Airs" in Hotwells (Bristol). In the basement of the building, a large-scale machine was producing the gases under the supervision of a young Humphry Davy, who was encouraged to experiment with new gases for patients to inhale. The first important work of Davy was examination of the nitrous oxide, and the publication of his results in the book: Researches, Chemical and Philosophical (1800). In that publication, Davy notes the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide at page 465 and its potential to be used for surgical operations at page 556. Davy coined the name "laughing gas" for nitrous oxide.
Despite Davy's discovery that inhalation of nitrous oxide could relieve a conscious person from pain, another 44 years elapsed before doctors attempted to use it for anaesthesia. The use of nitrous oxide as a recreational drug at "laughing gas parties", primarily arranged for the British upper class, became an immediate success beginning in 1799. While the effects of the gas generally make the user appear stuporous, dreamy and sedated, some people also "get the giggles" in a state of euphoria, and frequently erupt in laughter.
One of the earliest commercial producers in the U.S. was George Poe, cousin of the poet Edgar Allan Poe, who also was the first to liquefy the gas.
The first time nitrous oxide was used as an anaesthetic drug in the treatment of a patient was when dentist Horace Wells, with assistance by Gardner Quincy Colton and John Mankey Riggs, demonstrated insensitivity to pain from a dental extraction on 11 December 1844. In the following weeks, Wells treated the first 12 to 15 patients with nitrous oxide in Hartford, Connecticut, and, according to his own record, only failed in two cases. In spite of these convincing results having been reported by Wells to the medical society in Boston in December 1844, this new method was not immediately adopted by other dentists. The reason for this was most likely that Wells, in January 1845 at his first public demonstration to the medical faculty in Boston, had been partly unsuccessful, leaving his colleagues doubtful regarding its efficacy and safety. The method did not come into general use until 1863, when Gardner Quincy Colton successfully started to use it in all his "Colton Dental Association" clinics, that he had just established in New Haven and New York City. Over the following three years, Colton and his associates successfully administered nitrous oxide to more than 25,000 patients. Today, nitrous oxide is used in dentistry as an anxiolytic, as an adjunct to local anaesthetic.
Nitrous oxide was not found to be a strong enough anaesthetic for use in major surgery in hospital settings. Instead, diethyl ether, being a stronger and more potent anaesthetic, was demonstrated and accepted for use in October 1846, along with chloroform in 1847. When Joseph Thomas Clover invented the "gas-ether inhaler" in 1876, it became a common practice at hospitals to initiate all anaesthetic treatments with a mild flow of nitrous oxide, and then gradually increase the anaesthesia with the stronger ether or chloroform. Clover's gas-ether inhaler was designed to supply the patient with nitrous oxide and ether at the same time, with the exact mixture being controlled by the operator of the device. It remained in use by many hospitals until the 1930s. Although hospitals today use a more advanced anaesthetic machine, these machines still use the same principle launched with Clover's gas-ether inhaler, to initiate the anaesthesia with nitrous oxide, before the administration of a more powerful anaesthetic.
Colton's popularisation of nitrous oxide led to its adoption by a number of less than reputable quacksalvers, who touted it as a cure for consumption, scrofula, catarrh and other diseases of the blood, throat and lungs. Nitrous oxide treatment was administered and licensed as a patent medicine by the likes of C. L. Blood and Jerome Harris in Boston and Charles E. Barney of Chicago.

## Chemical properties and reactions

Nitrous oxide is a colourless gas with a faint, sweet odour.
Nitrous oxide supports combustion by releasing the dipolar bonded oxygen radical, and can thus relight a glowing splint.
N2O is inert at room temperature and has few reactions. At elevated temperatures, its reactivity increases. For example, nitrous oxide reacts with NaNH2 at 187 °C (369 °F) to give NaN3:

2 NaNH2 + N2O  →  NaN3 + NaOH + NH3
This reaction is the route adopted by the commercial chemical industry to produce azide salts, which are used as detonators.

## Mechanism of action

The pharmacological mechanism of action of inhaled N2O is not fully known. However, it has been shown to directly modulate a broad range of ligand-gated ion channels, which likely plays a major role. It moderately blocks NMDAR and β2-subunit-containing nACh channels, weakly inhibits AMPA, kainate, GABAC and 5-HT3 receptors, and slightly potentiates GABAA and glycine receptors. It also has been shown to activate two-pore-domain K+ channels. While N2O affects several ion channels, its anaesthetic, hallucinogenic and euphoriant effects are likely caused mainly via inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated currents. In addition to its effects on ion channels, N2O may act similarly to nitric oxide (NO) in the central nervous system. Nitrous oxide is 30 to 40 times more soluble than nitrogen.
The effects of inhaling sub-anaesthetic doses of nitrous oxide may vary unpredictably with settings and individual differences; however, Jay (2008) suggests that it reliably induces the following states and sensations:

Intoxication
Euphoria/dysphoria
Spatial disorientation
Temporal disorientation
Reduced pain sensitivity
A minority of users also experience uncontrolled vocalisations and muscular spasms. These effects generally disappear minutes after removal of the nitrous oxide source.

### Anxiolytic effect

In behavioural tests of anxiety, a low dose of N2O is an effective anxiolytic. This anti-anxiety effect is associated with enhanced activity of GABAA receptors, as it is partially reversed by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. Mirroring this, animals that have developed tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines are partially tolerant to N2O. Indeed, in humans given 30% N2O, benzodiazepine receptor antagonists reduced the subjective reports of feeling "high", but did not alter psychomotor performance.

### Analgesic effect

The analgesic effects of N2O are linked to the interaction between the endogenous opioid system and the descending noradrenergic system. When animals are given morphine chronically, they develop tolerance to its pain-killing effects, and this also renders the animals tolerant to the analgesic effects of N2O. Administration of antibodies that bind and block the activity of some endogenous opioids (not β-endorphin) also block the antinociceptive effects of N2O. Drugs that inhibit the breakdown of endogenous opioids also potentiate the antinociceptive effects of N2O. Several experiments have shown that opioid receptor antagonists applied directly to the brain block the antinociceptive effects of N2O, but these drugs have no effect when injected into the spinal cord.
Apart from an indirect action, nitrous oxide, like morphine also interacts directly with the endogenous opioid system by binding at opioid receptor binding sites.
Conversely, α2-adrenoceptor antagonists block the pain-reducing effects of N2O when given directly to the spinal cord, but not when applied directly to the brain. Indeed, α2B-adrenoceptor knockout mice or animals depleted in norepinephrine are nearly completely resistant to the antinociceptive effects of N2O. Apparently N2O-induced release of endogenous opioids causes disinhibition of brainstem noradrenergic neurons, which release norepinephrine into the spinal cord and inhibit pain signalling. Exactly how N2O causes the release of endogenous opioid peptides remains uncertain.

## Production

Various methods of producing nitrous oxide are used.

### Industrial methods

Nitrous oxide is prepared on an industrial scale by carefully heating ammonium nitrate at about 250 °C, which decomposes into nitrous oxide and water vapour.

NH4NO3  →  2 H2O  + N2O
The addition of various phosphate salts favours formation of a purer gas at slightly lower temperatures. This reaction may be difficult to control, resulting in detonation.

### Laboratory methods

The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is also a common laboratory method for preparing the gas. Equivalently, it can be obtained by heating a mixture of sodium nitrate and ammonium sulfate:

2 NaNO3 + (NH4)2SO4  →  Na2SO4 + 2 N2O + 4 H2O
Another method involves the reaction of urea, nitric acid and sulfuric acid:

2 (NH2)2CO + 2 HNO3 + H2SO4  →  2 N2O + 2 CO2 + (NH4)2SO4 + 2 H2O
Direct oxidation of ammonia with a manganese dioxide-bismuth oxide catalyst has been reported: cf. Ostwald process.

2 NH3 + 2 O2  →  N2O + 3 H2O
Hydroxylammonium chloride reacts with sodium nitrite to give nitrous oxide. If the nitrite is added to the hydroxylamine solution, the only remaining by-product is salt water. If the hydroxylamine solution is added to the nitrite solution (nitrite is in excess), however, then toxic higher oxides of nitrogen also are formed:

NH3OHCl + NaNO2  →  N2O + NaCl + 2 H2O
Treating HNO3 with SnCl2 and HCl also has been demonstrated:

2 HNO3 + 8 HCl + 4 SnCl2  →  5 H2O + 4 SnCl4 + N2O
Hyponitrous acid decomposes to N2O and water with a half-life of 16 days at 25 °C at pH 1–3.

H2N2O2  →  H2O + N2O

## Atmospheric occurrence

Nitrous oxide is a minor component of Earth's atmosphere and is an active part of the planetary nitrogen cycle.  Based on analysis of air samples gathered from sites around the world, its concentration surpassed 330 ppb in 2017. The growth rate of about 1 ppb per year has also accelerated during recent decades.  Nitrous oxide's atmospheric abundance has grown more than 20% from a base level of about 270 ppb in 1750.
Important atmospheric properties of N2O are summarized in the following table:

In 2022 the IPCC reported that: "The human perturbation of the natural nitrogen cycle through the use of synthetic fertilizers and manure, as well as nitrogen deposition resulting from land-based agriculture and fossil fuel burning has been the largest driver of the increase in atmospheric N2O of 31.0 ± 0.5 ppb (10%) between 1980 and 2019."

### Emissions by source

17.0 (12.2 to 23.5) million tonnes total annual average nitrogen in N2O was emitted in 2007–2016. About 40% of N2O emissions are from humans and the rest are part of the natural nitrogen cycle. The N2O emitted each year by humans has a greenhouse effect equivalent to about 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide: for comparison humans emitted 37 billion tonnes of actual carbon dioxide in 2019, and methane equivalent to 9 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.
Most of the N2O emitted into the atmosphere, from natural and anthropogenic sources, is produced by microorganisms such as denitrifying bacteria and fungi in soils and oceans. Soils under natural vegetation are an important source of nitrous oxide, accounting for 60% of all naturally produced emissions. Other natural sources include the oceans (35%) and atmospheric chemical reactions (5%). Wetlands can also be emitters of nitrous oxide. Emissions from thawing permafrost may be significant, but as of 2022 this is not certain.
The main components of anthropogenic emissions are fertilised agricultural soils and livestock manure (42%), runoff and leaching of fertilisers (25%), biomass burning (10%), fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (10%), biological degradation of other nitrogen-containing atmospheric emissions (9%) and human sewage (5%). Agriculture enhances nitrous oxide production through soil cultivation, the use of nitrogen fertilisers and animal waste handling. These activities stimulate naturally occurring bacteria to produce more nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil can be challenging to measure as they vary markedly over time and space, and the majority of a year's emissions may occur when conditions are favorable during "hot moments" and/or at favorable locations known as "hotspots".
Among industrial emissions, the production of nitric acid and adipic acid are the largest sources of nitrous oxide emissions. The adipic acid emissions specifically arise from the degradation of the nitrolic acid intermediate derived from the nitration of cyclohexanone.

### Biological processes

Microbial processes that generate nitrous oxide may be classified as nitrification and denitrification. Specifically, they include:

aerobic autotrophic nitrification, the stepwise oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO−2) and to nitrate (NO−3)
anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification, the stepwise reduction of NO−3 to NO−2, nitric oxide (NO), N2O and ultimately N2, where facultative anaerobe bacteria use NO−3 as an electron acceptor in the respiration of organic material in the condition of insufficient oxygen (O2)
nitrifier denitrification, which is carried out by autotrophic NH3-oxidising bacteria and the pathway whereby ammonia (NH3) is oxidised to nitrite (NO−2), followed by the reduction of NO−2 to nitric oxide (NO), N2O and molecular nitrogen (N2)
heterotrophic nitrification
aerobic denitrification by the same heterotrophic nitrifiers
fungal denitrification
non-biological chemodenitrification
These processes are affected by soil chemical and physical properties such as the availability of mineral nitrogen and organic matter, acidity and soil type, as well as climate-related factors such as soil temperature and water content. 
The emission of the gas to the atmosphere is limited greatly by its consumption inside the cells, by a process catalysed by the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase.

## Uses

### Rocket motors

Nitrous oxide may be used as an oxidiser in a rocket motor. Compared to other oxidisers, it is much less toxic and more stable at room temperature, making it easier to store and safer to carry on a flight. Its high density and low storage pressure (when maintained at low temperatures) make it highly competitive with stored high-pressure gas systems.
In a 1914 patent, American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard suggested nitrous oxide and gasoline as possible propellants for a liquid-fuelled rocket. Nitrous oxide has been the oxidiser of choice in several hybrid rocket designs (using solid fuel with a liquid or gaseous oxidiser). The combination of nitrous oxide with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene fuel has been used by SpaceShipOne and others. It also is notably used in amateur and high power rocketry with various plastics as the fuel.
Nitrous oxide may also be used as a monopropellant. In the presence of a heated catalyst at a temperature of 577 °C (1,071 °F), N2O decomposes exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen. Because of the large heat release, the catalytic action rapidly becomes secondary, as thermal autodecomposition becomes dominant. In a vacuum thruster, this may provide a monopropellant specific impulse (Isp) up to 180 s. While noticeably less than the Isp available from hydrazine thrusters (monopropellant, or bipropellant with dinitrogen tetroxide), the decreased toxicity makes nitrous oxide a worthwhile option.
The ignition of nitrous oxide depends critically on pressure. It deflagrates at approximately 600 °C (1,112 °F) at a pressure of 309 psi (21 atmospheres). At 600 psi, the required ignition energy is only 6 joules, whereas at 130 psi a 2,500-joule ignition energy input is insufficient.

### Internal combustion engine

In vehicle racing, nitrous oxide (often called "nitrous" in this context) increases engine power by providing more oxygen during combustion, thus allowing the engine to burn more fuel. It is an oxidising agent roughly equivalent to hydrogen peroxide, and much stronger than molecular oxygen. Nitrous oxide is not flammable at low pressure/temperature, but at about 300 °C (572 °F), its breakdown delivers more oxygen than atmospheric air. It often is mixed with another fuel that is easier to deflagrate. 
Nitrous oxide is stored as a compressed liquid. In an engine intake manifold, the evaporation and expansion of the liquid causes a large drop in intake charge temperature, resulting in a denser charge and allowing more air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. Sometimes nitrous oxide is injected into (or prior to) the intake manifold, whereas other systems directly inject it just before the cylinder (direct port injection).
The technique was used during World War II by Luftwaffe aircraft with the GM-1 system to boost the power output of aircraft engines. Originally meant to provide the Luftwaffe standard aircraft with superior high-altitude performance, technological considerations limited its use to extremely high altitudes. Accordingly, it was only used by specialised planes such as high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, high-speed bombers and high-altitude interceptor aircraft. It sometimes could be found on Luftwaffe aircraft also fitted with another engine-boost system, MW 50, a form of water injection for aviation engines that used methanol for its boost capabilities.
One of the major problems of nitrous oxide oxidant in a reciprocating engine is excessive power: if the mechanical structure of the engine is not properly reinforced, it may be severely damaged or destroyed. It is important with nitrous oxide augmentation of petrol engines to maintain proper and evenly spread operating temperatures and fuel levels to prevent pre-ignition (also called detonation or spark knock). However, most problems associated with nitrous oxide come not from excessive power but from excessive pressure, since the gas builds up a much denser charge in the cylinder. The increased pressure and temperature can melt, crack, or warp the piston, valve, and cylinder head.
Automotive-grade liquid nitrous oxide differs slightly from medical-grade. A small amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is added to prevent substance abuse.

### Aerosol propellant for food

The gas is approved for use as a food additive (E number: E942), specifically as an aerosol spray propellant. It is commonly used in aerosol whipped cream canisters and cooking sprays.
The gas is extremely soluble in fatty compounds. In pressurised aerosol whipped cream, it is dissolved in the fatty cream until it leaves the can, when it becomes gaseous and thus creates foam. This produces whipped cream four times the volume of the liquid, whereas whipping air into cream only produces twice the volume. Unlike air, nitrous oxide inhibits rancidification of the butterfat. Carbon dioxide cannot be used for whipped cream because it is acidic in water, which would curdle the cream and give it a seltzer-like "sparkle".
Extra-frothed whipped cream produced with nitrous oxide is unstable, and will return to liquid within half an hour to one hour. Thus, it is not suitable for decorating food that will not be served immediately.
In December 2016, there was a shortage of aerosol whipped cream in the United States, with canned whipped cream use at its peak during the Christmas and holiday season, due to an explosion at the Air Liquide nitrous oxide facility in Florida in late August. The company prioritized the remaining supply of nitrous oxide to medical customers rather than to food manufacturing.
Also, cooking spray, made from various oils with lecithin emulsifier, may use nitrous oxide propellant, or alternatively food-grade alcohol or propane.

### Medical

Nitrous oxide has been used in dentistry and surgery, as an anaesthetic and analgesic, since 1844. In the early days, the gas was administered through simple inhalers consisting of a breathing bag made of rubber cloth. Today, the gas is administered in hospitals by means of an automated relative analgesia machine, with an anaesthetic vaporiser and a medical ventilator, that delivers a precisely dosed and breath-actuated flow of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen in a 2:1 ratio.
Nitrous oxide is a weak general anaesthetic, and so is generally not used alone in general anaesthesia, but used as a carrier gas (mixed with oxygen) for more powerful general anaesthetic drugs such as sevoflurane or desflurane. It has a minimum alveolar concentration of 105% and a blood/gas partition coefficient of 0.46. The use of nitrous oxide in anaesthesia can increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting.
Dentists use a simpler machine which only delivers an N2O/O2 mixture for the patient to inhale while conscious but must still be a recognised purpose designed dedicated relative analgesic flowmeter with a minimum 30% of oxygen at all times and a maximum upper limit of 70% nitrous oxide. The patient is kept conscious throughout the procedure, and retains adequate mental faculties to respond to questions and instructions from the dentist.
Inhalation of nitrous oxide is used frequently to relieve pain associated with childbirth, trauma, oral surgery and acute coronary syndrome (including heart attacks). Its use during labour has been shown to be a safe and effective aid for birthing women. Its use for acute coronary syndrome is of unknown benefit.
In Canada and the UK, Entonox and Nitronox are used commonly by ambulance crews (including unregistered practitioners) as rapid and highly effective analgesic gas.
Fifty percent nitrous oxide can be considered for use by trained non-professional first aid responders in prehospital settings, given the relative ease and safety of administering 50% nitrous oxide as an analgesic. The rapid reversibility of its effect would also prevent it from precluding diagnosis.

### Recreational

Recreational inhalation of nitrous oxide, to induce euphoria and slight hallucinations, began with the British upper class in 1799 in gatherings known as "laughing gas parties".
From the 19th century, the widespread availability of the gas for medical and culinary purposes allowed for recreational use to greatly expand globally. In the UK as of 2014, nitrous oxide was estimated to be used by almost half a million young people at nightspots, festivals and parties.
Widespread recreational use of the drug throughout the UK was featured in the 2017 Vice documentary Inside The Laughing Gas Black Market, in which journalist Matt Shea met with dealers of the drug who stole it from hospitals.
A significant issue cited in London's press is the effect of nitrous oxide canister littering, which is highly visible and causes significant complaints from communities.
Prior to 8 November 2023 in the UK, nitrous oxide was subject to the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, making it illegal to produce, supply, import or export nitrous oxide for recreational use. The updated law prohibited possession of nitrous oxide, classifying it as a Class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
While nitrous oxide is understood by most recreational users to give a "safe high", many are unaware that excessive consumption may cause neurological harm which, if left untreated, can cause permanent neurological damage. In Australia, recreational use became a public health concern following a rise in reports of neurotoxicity and emergency room admissions. In the state of South Australia, legislation was passed in 2020 to restrict canister sales.
In 2024, under the street name "Galaxy Gas", nitrous oxide has exploded in popularity among young people for recreational use, partially driven by TikTok trends.

## Safety

Nitrous oxide is a significant occupational hazard for surgeons, dentists and nurses. Because the gas is minimally metabolised in humans (with a rate of 0.004%), it retains its potency when exhaled into the room by the patient, and can intoxicate the clinic staff if the room is poorly ventilated, with potential chronic exposure. A continuous-flow fresh-air ventilation system or N2O scavenger system may be needed to prevent waste-gas buildup. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that workers' exposure to nitrous oxide should be controlled during the administration of anaesthetic gas in medical, dental and veterinary operators. It set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 25 ppm (46 mg/m3) to escaped anaesthetic.
Exposure to nitrous oxide causes short-term impairment of cognition, audiovisual acuity, and manual dexterity, as well as spatial and temporal disorientation, putting the user at risk of accidental injury.
Nitrous oxide is neurotoxic, and medium or long-term habitual consumption of significant quantities can cause neurological harm with the potential for permanent damage if left untreated. It is believed that, like other NMDA receptor antagonists, N2O produces Olney's lesions in rodents upon prolonged (several hour) exposure.
However, because it is normally expelled from the body rapidly, it is less likely to be neurotoxic than other NMDAR antagonists. In rodents, short-term exposure results in only mild injury that is rapidly reversible, and neuronal death occurs only after constant and sustained exposure. Nitrous oxide may also cause neurotoxicity after extended exposure because of hypoxia. This is especially true of non-medical formulations such as whipped-cream chargers ("whippits" or "nangs"), which contain no oxygen gas.
In reports to poison control centers, heavy users (≥400 g or ≥200 L of N2O gas in one session) or frequent users (regular, i.e., daily or weekly) have developed signs of peripheral neuropathy: ataxia (gait abnormalities) or paresthesia (perception of sensations such as tingling, numbness, or prickling, mostly in the extremities). Such early signs of neurological damage indicate chronic toxicity.
Nitrous oxide might have therapeutic use in treating stroke. In a rodent model, nitrous oxide at 75% by volume reduced ischemia-induced neuronal death induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, and decreased NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx in neuronal cell cultures, a cause of excitotoxicity.
Occupational exposure to ambient nitrous oxide has been associated with DNA damage, due to interruptions in DNA synthesis. This correlation is dose-dependent and does not appear to extend to casual recreational use; however, further research is needed to confirm the level of exposure needed to cause damage.
Inhalation of pure nitrous oxide causes oxygen deprivation, resulting in low blood pressure, fainting, and even heart attacks. This can occur if the user inhales large quantities continuously, as with a strap-on mask connected to a gas canister or other inhalation system, or prolonged breath-holding.
Long-term exposure to nitrous oxide may cause vitamin B12 deficiency.  This can cause serious neurotoxicity if the user has preexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. It inactivates the cobalamin form of vitamin B12 by oxidation. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, including sensory neuropathy, myelopathy and encephalopathy, may occur within days or weeks of exposure to nitrous oxide anaesthesia in people with subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency. Symptoms are treated with high doses of vitamin B12, but recovery can be slow and incomplete. People with normal vitamin B12 levels have stores to make the effects of nitrous oxide insignificant, unless exposure is repeated and prolonged (nitrous oxide abuse). Vitamin B12 levels should be checked in people with risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency prior to using nitrous oxide anaesthesia.
Several experimental studies in rats indicate that chronic exposure of pregnant females to nitrous oxide may have adverse effects on the developing fetus.
At room temperature (20 °C [68 °F]) the saturated vapour pressure is 50.525 bar, rising up to 72.45 bar at 36.4 °C (97.5 °F)—the critical temperature. The pressure curve is thus unusually sensitive to temperature. As with many strong oxidisers, contamination of parts with fuels have been implicated in rocketry accidents, where small quantities of nitrous/fuel mixtures explode due to "water hammer"-like effects (sometimes called "dieseling"—heating due to adiabatic compression of gases can reach decomposition temperatures). Some common building materials such as stainless steel and aluminium can act as fuels with strong oxidisers such as nitrous oxide, as can contaminants that may ignite due to adiabatic compression. There also have been incidents where nitrous oxide decomposition in plumbing has led to the explosion of large tanks.

## Environmental impact

Global accounting of N2O sources and sinks over the decade ending 2016 indicates that about 40% of the average 17 TgN/yr (teragrams, or million metric tons, of nitrogen per year) of emissions originated from human activity, and shows that emissions growth chiefly came from expanding agriculture.

Nitrous oxide has significant global warming potential as a greenhouse gas. On a per-molecule basis, considered over a 100-year period, nitrous oxide has 265 times the atmospheric heat-trapping ability of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, because of its low concentration (less than 1/1,000 of that of CO2), its contribution to the greenhouse effect is less than one third that of carbon dioxide, and also less than methane. On the other hand, since about 40% of the N2O entering the atmosphere is the result of human activity, control of nitrous oxide is part of efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Most human caused nitrous oxide released into the atmosphere is a greenhouse gas emission from agriculture, when farmers add nitrogen-based fertilizers onto the fields, and through the breakdown of animal manure.  Reduction of emissions can be a hot topic in the politics of climate change.
Nitrous oxide is also released as a by-product of burning fossil fuel, though the amount released depends on which fuel was used. It is also emitted through the manufacture of nitric acid, which is used in the synthesis of nitrogen fertilizers.  The production of adipic acid, a precursor to nylon and other synthetic clothing fibres, also releases nitrous oxide.
A rise in atmospheric nitrous oxide concentrations has been implicated as a possible contributor to the extremely intense global warming during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event.
Nitrous oxide has also been implicated in thinning the ozone layer. A 2009 study suggested that N2O emission was the single most important ozone-depleting emission and it was expected to remain the largest throughout the 21st century.

## Legality

In India transfer of nitrous oxide from bulk cylinders to smaller, more transportable E-type, 1,590-litre-capacity tanks is legal when intended for medical anaesthesia.
The New Zealand Ministry of Health has warned that nitrous oxide is a prescription medicine whose sale or possession without a prescription is an offense under the Medicines Act. This would seemingly prohibit all non-medicinal uses of nitrous oxide, although it is implied that only recreational use will be targeted.
In August 2015, the Council of the London Borough of Lambeth (UK) banned the use of the drug for recreational purposes, making offenders liable to an on-the-spot fine of up to £1,000. In September 2023, the UK Government announced that nitrous oxide would be made illegal by the end of the year as a class C drug, with possession potentially carrying up to a two-year prison sentence or an unlimited fine.
Possession of nitrous oxide is legal under United States federal law and is not subject to DEA purview. It is, however, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act; prosecution is possible under its "misbranding" clauses, prohibiting the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide for the purpose of human consumption without a proper medical license. Many states have laws regulating the possession, sale and distribution of nitrous oxide. Such laws usually ban distribution to minors or limit the amount that may be sold without special license. For example, in California, possession for recreational use is prohibited and qualifies as a misdemeanor.
