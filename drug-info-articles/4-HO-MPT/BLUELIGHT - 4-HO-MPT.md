Anyone have any experience at all with this material?


TIHKAL notes of only one experience at 8mg in which 

*There was a very mild visual distortion, and a prominent vertigo without nausea. In the second hour there is still some enhancement of visual detail, but I am not endowed with the flight of ideas of philosophical concepts as with psilocin. I am rapidly subsiding and I am able to eat normally. Residual insomnia lasted eight hours.*


I will have some in my possession next week and will be titrating accordingly. Curious if anyone has anything to offer...

I posted this at the other forum, but here is a recent report:


10mg (freebase)

In an hour, perhaps an hour and a half, plant's peak effects were encountered. The freebase makes the 10mg go a lot farther. There is no vertigo what so ever (The tihkal entry altogether is a very poor representation). A very peaceful experience follows through. Very unique to itself. Not pushy at all. It was of very noticable intensity. Plants were enjoying the silence very much. Music was on sometimes, but they would forget that they were listening to it, due to their train of thought. OEV and CEV both present. The OEV being very active in their manners, with some brilliant colors. Bodies was filled with a psychedelic energy, but were very relaxed. They were content in their ways, not thinking of their bodies much. It was easy for them to get lost in the substance. They are very interested in trying this compound further. They can already tell it contains depth of which they want to dwell deeper.


Total duration:

To come up 30-90min

Peak effects around 2 hours

Diminishing effects remaining 2 hours

Sure, cool thing. I meant no offence, so I hope you didn´t take it that way ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It just seemed to me that something was a bit off with your little report. And I was thinking it would be an obvious way to letting the "scene" know that it´s know available out there.

And that it´s better than what shulgin say´s about it in Tihkal, or else few people would be buying.

I did read you thread "on that other forum" were I did get the impression that you had "kind of" insider info. Like "no more samples". Which could also just be because you are in mail contact with him. well, nevermind ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Anyways, personaly I don´t really care  if you were the vendor. But it would change how your report should be read of cause.


Well,well, I guess I am a bit paranoid after all. It does pay though to not be too naive on the interwebz. You damn never know who´s behind the screen.%)

This point of view makes sense, at least to me. I don't really disbelieve him, and the compound can be good. 


If I recall things correctly, when all this long story with 6-AP(D)B started, some newcomers(with just 2-3 posts) posted reports in the first threads. This looked like a vendor promotion, though now I can't find these posts to prove myself. So correct me, if I am wrong.


Anyhow, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, and I clearly understand that posting a report about new unresearched chemical is a good reason for registering. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I don't have interest in this chemical, but I will keep my eye on this thread.

i doubt he is the vendor simply because the vendor seems very professional. ie. not the type to shill. 


he must live right by the vendor to get his sample so quick though. :D


id expect well have a bunch more trip reports after the weekend

No offense taken, I figured a report on a novel substance was good means for registering. But it's understandable if you want to take my report with a grain of salt. This has been an awkward introduction anyways.

I don't have an extensive tryptamine background (only dmt/5-meo-dmt/psilocin) so it's hard for me to compare and point out distinctive characteristics. Someone has mentioned that the description sounds like a mixture between 4-ho-dipt and 4-ho-met. And yes, that report was related to an oral dose.

I've just today gained access to this compound. I hope to try it late tonight or tomorrow. I'm thinking about doing a 2 mg test for idiosyncratic reactions followed by a 10 - 15 mg rectal dose dissolved in vinegar to form 4-ho-MPT acetate (hopefully for faster and more complete absorption than insufflating the freebase). 


I also read the description likening it to a mixture of 4-ho-dipt and 4-ho-met.  The quote I saw really did not elaborate any further beyond that. My 4-sub tryptamine experiences do not include either of those, only 4-ho/AcO-DMT, 4-ho/AcO-MiPT, and 4-ho/AcO-DPT. I'll try to make any warranted comparisons with other compounds I can, but will probably stick mostly to common experiential terms.

9:13 first alerts?

9:18 feel "something" mild visual distortions (wood grain patterns look as if they are floating)

9:33 10 mg rectal

9:55 15 mg rectal

Starting to think this one's a bust. I'm not holding out much hope. Oh well.

Sorry guys. If I feel anything it's threshold, and I'm at many times your dosages by an ROA that is usually more potent. I'm calling it placebo in the mean time.  If anything changes I'll report back.  I'm saving the remainder of my 100 mg for one 60 mg trial in the hopes that there's something in this chem at that level to salvage it.

I once tried what should have been an active rectal dose of Methylone, hoping to make my last 120 at the time into an effective dose.


Zip.  Nadda.  Pissed at myself for not swallowing it which would have had me feeling at least SOMETHING from it.


I bet efficacy of plugging can be highly variable, based on, the um uh conditions inside there, which can probably be variable, and might cause absorption to be high one time, low another.


Or perhaps certain compounds are just not well absorbed that way.

Assuming it's the freebase it wouldn't be water soluable so the rectal ROA would not work.

You have to evacuate your bowels if they're not empty, either naturally or with an enema. Failing to do so can result in the majority of the dose being absorbed by the faeces.

I don't know what else could explain it, keep us updated on that 30mg IM, seems like a hefty dose. Very interested in some more detailed descriptions from CA and merrskis btw.

15 minutes in and still nothing. So that's 30 mg IM and 40 mg rectal. Nothing. I have faith in the integrity of my butt hole. The vendor is a good one.  I believe I have 4-ho-MPT, as supported by the vendor's NMR and LC-MS analysis reports.  I think Shulgin's report was placebo. This one's a dud.

I'm no chemist, but is there any way to know that it's still freebase even in the vinegar? That would explain no absorption through insufflation/rectal... i'm pretty sure me and captain felt effects through oral.

Seems that Shulgin was not that far off. I think SOME people might still get the effects he reports. Still it´s definitely not worthwhile, and expensive too.


> QUALITATIVE COMMENTS : (with 8 mg, orally) "There was a very mild visual distortion, and a prominent vertigo without nausea. In the second hour there is still some enhancement of visual detail, but I am not endowed with the flight of ideas of philosophical concepts as with psilocin. I am rapidly subsiding and I am able to eat normally. Residual insomnia lasted eight hours."

I would also like to add that the person likening it to 4-ho-met and 4-ho-dipt, hadn´t actually tried it. He just said it sounded like a description of a mix of the 2.

This is strange, we must all have the "same" 4-ho-mpt going around. I'm curious to see as more reports unfold what we will see...


To any and all who would know, would 4-ho-mpt (freebase) theoretically work if you carefully vaporized it? Or is it impossible to smoke any 4-ho's?

That's a deception, it looked good based on Clear Creme & CaptainAmerica's posts. Guess I shouldn't even ask, but no tolerance involved right? Normal dosage of 4-substituted trypts on the high side, or just normal? I doubt it's completely inactive solely going by the Pihkal report, just very benign perhaps compared to most other 4-substituted tryptamines. CC reported a come-up of nearly an hour, but it's been more than an hour by now since both of you dosed, something should've happened at least, really nothing mentionable to report by now?

No tolerance. Last psychedelic use was 1 hit lsd on new years.


I am still stimulated, I usually fall asleep by midnight and it is now 2:30. I can see why the stimulation "lingers" from this drug. Its psychedelic effects wear off long before the wakefulness wears off.


The trip was very enjoyable. I had lots of pleasant bodily energy. I felt more open to talk about things with others, more so than mushrooms or 4-aco-dmt/det/met.


Being this is such a novel compound, I feel inspired to write a detailed trip report. It was a crazy night so that will help with making a good story!

No tolerance on my part either guys. 30 mg IM does not lie. I also tried 20 mg orally about a half hour ago just to entertain the idea since I had nothing to lose. Nothing. Fuck, here I go with another 20 mg down the hatch. Sorry. PLACEBO and EXPECTANCY BIAS!  The mind fills in the rest! Placebo is very real. Don't be too embarrassed. Just note that I was the first to call bullshit. Heh heh.

Cream,


I am. I clearly felt a psychedelic drug in my mind. The laughter, giggles, definate CEV's, and moderate OEV's like movement, a little buzzy vision.


My pupils were large and, of interesting note, it was hard to get an erection. Most tryptamines do that to me besides the 5-meo's, which gives me more reason to believe this has **definate** activity.


psood0nym and merrskis, do you either of you have a tolerance?


Or maybe this drug is so crazy selective that only certain people feel its effects. Imagine! :O haha

Yeah I don't really know whats up or what to think of it, I feel the slight energy you guys are talking about but I dont know if its placebo or if its the compound. I have no tolerance right now to speak of either, I hopefully will have more positive results with the dpt sample I'll be receiving this week. *snip*

psood, please do not force your opinion on me. I am trying to be open minded. You are putting false definitions as to how I describe the chemicals properties. I am agreeing with Captain here. As much as you think it is inactive, I think it is active. I am not you. And I know how I felt.

Great read, this thread. 


It would be great if it could somehow be verified that the same source was involved with all of this.

So far its divided, 2v2. 


Wanna ask everyone, psood, mers, creme. When do you usually go to bed by? Would it have been earlier than the time now?


We're really gonna have to wait till more reports come in. I will sampling this again this weekend, maybe 15mg or so. Hopefully more will appear in the mean time...

Yes, I would normally be in bed by now. I'm only up because I'm fascinated by the psychological/sociological phenomena on display (and naturally the egotistical thrill that I'm not part of it).  Even if the stimulation is owed to the intrinsic properties of the chemical (which is most definitely from the same source, as I can confirm, for example, that they also sell 4-AcO-DMT and they canceled their DOC due to synthesis problems) it is not psychedelically active.

I can't tell if your being sarcastic.. But are you saying you experienced some effects, but nothing psychedelic in nature? or that it was simply inactive all together, i.e. you take 30mg IM, and notice no change in perception, feeling, mood whatsoever?


We clearly have gotten it from the same vendor btw.


I'm going to bed now, sleep is finally kicking in.


Look forward to reading this post tomorrow as I bet a few more reports will have popped up.

I'm not being sarcastic. I'm not pissed off that I lost $35 dollars. It was worth this thread. Whatever effects I experienced were psychological extrapolations from my memory of other active compounds.

Not many other explanations other than placebo than.


Certainly no shame in it being placebo. It's an interesting difference between the opioid freaks and the psyhedelia freaks. As a junky the placebo effect is embraced with open arms. Not so much with psychedelics. 

People, naturally, get very defensive when it is suggested that their 'trip' was self induced. And why not, it is that certainty that you had a real experience, brought on by a active compound,  that allowed the placebo effect to work it's magic in the first place. Or not if it turns out there is some other explanation which is always a possibility. 

Only way to really prove it to yourself would be to try again a few days later at an even higher dose. With it's activity in question and out in the open I'd be surprised if you could then chalk it up to placebo.

After reading this i felt obliged to sign up.  I also received a sample of this compound with my last purchase from said vendor.  I have too much work to do so i can't really comment on it yet, i'm hoping by the weekend.   I don't see how 2 peoples research proves worth while yet another 2 are writing it off as placebo.  Now i'm even more interested.

Tyrpatamines, extremely active ones like 4-aco-dipt, hit quick and induce strong tolerance.  Perhaps the anal dose was ineffectively absorbed due to, um, "anal contents", ahem, but enough absorbed to induce a tolerance effect, rendering the other doses moot?


Of course that doesn't really explain merrskis's lack of effects.  Then again, he at first reported effects, then seems to have changed his mind and wrote it all off to the hash... hmm... insufficient initial dose causing rapid tolerance rendering redoses impotent, combined with botting out of ability to clearly feel effect by hash (which can be REALLY REALLY strong and zoning so this could be an issue), combined with "group bias" effect???


Placebo can work the other way too you know... you can be so convinced nothing is going to happen that you psyche yourself into "blocking" the effects on a mental level.

If you look at my first post I did report feeling effects, but the level of effects is consistent with placebo effects. I then redosed two more times within that hour for a total of 40 mg assuming I would get something more tangible, and the "effects," as vague as they were, never increased.  I then IM'd 30 mg at once and experienced no increase in effects. Then I finished the rest off orally. What other 4-sub tryptamine with activity at 10 mg orally would allow one to continue feeling only vague threshold effects, posting and doing homework as I was, at 10 times the dose as others (mostly taken through ROAs that are usually more potent than oral), when their response to other tryptamines is in the normal dosage range? 


Also, what other 4-sub tryptamine takes 2 hours to peak as ClearCreme reported?  This freebase converted to acetate in about 1 minute in vinegar. It shouldn't take much longer to convert to HCl and absorb in one's stomach, so the fact that it's freebase doesn't account for such an unexpected delay. 


Even if I was somehow psychologically blocking the effects it would be the first time I've been successful at doing so in 13 years of psychedelic use, not to mention one would think the cognitive load of the unconscious effort needed to ignore a dose 10 times larger than that needed for others to experience psychedelic effects would interfere with me making coherent posts and doing statistics homework, right? Regarding the supposition of tolerance development from my early doses: what other 4-sub-tryptamine shows tolerance development so quick and severe to cover 10 times an active dose? Plus I assume when merrskis says he finished off the rest of his that means he had a total of 50 mg. He also started with 18 mg orally, almost twice the dose of the other's first oral doses. So if merrskis finished all of his that means he had 5 times the dose of others and never felt more than effects that are of the type that placebo and the hash he was smoking can explain.  Also, the initial report of 4-ho-MPT being like a cross between 4-ho-DiPT and 4-ho-MET mentioned towards the beginning of this thread has since been revealed to be based on mere theorizing rather than an actual trial. 


I wanted there to be effects and expected there to be like everyone else. The difference is that only two posters, myself and presumably merrskis, have taken a dose where the effects should have been overwhelming and undeniable given the reported 10 mg active dose. I was second guessing myself all night thinking "maybe I am tripping a little" because others had reported activity, I wanted there to be, and knew what I was "supposed" to be feeling. The problem is that at 100 mg total I see no plausible reason that there should be any "maybe" or "little" about it. 


Regarding why I got 100 mg instead of a 50 mg sample: I didn't really think anything of dropping $35 and knew the vendor was legit. I wasn't even aware samples were still being given away. Hell, it's conceivable the vendor themselves may have experienced placebo effects based off expectancy from Shulgin's reported activity (BTW vertigo and mild visual distortions are what one might expect from placebo, too) with a small dose and figured "Ok, it's active, I'll sell it." 


Finally, check out the 2006 John Hopkins psilocybin study. There were numerous instances of people receiving ritalin and having full blown mystical experiences that they counted as among the most significant experiences of their life (not nearly as many as those who actually received psilocybin, but nevertheless they had  very powerful experiences). These people had those experiences because others were having them and because they expected to and wanted to. Presumably they had never experienced anything like it, yet they concocted a novel and profound experience from ritalin. Placebo is sufficient to explain what happened in this thread.

Well to be honest until I had consumed the compound I had not doubted its activity at all, so my expectations definitely could have played into the placebo effect. I smoke weeed/hash pretty much all day throughout the day so Im quite the experienced stoner with quite a high tolerence. The body feeling definitely didnt feel tryptamine-y which is why I was confused at first and continued to redose. Even if this compound is active in the slightest bit, it is still completely undewhelming and I would find it not worthwhile. So far me and psoo have tried every ROA to no avail, and to clarify I ended up consuming 30mg oral and 20mg insufflated.

I dont understand why you guys ascribe much meaning to all your multiple redoses, regardless of ROI.  Whenever I have redosed tryptamines, I have found a VERY strong tolerance had already set in and the redoses were exponentially LESS effective.  That's an aspect of both your reports, and an odd COMMON feature to both that leaves me scratching my head a little.


Also, the one time I tried plugging, methylone I KNEW to be orally active, got zero effects, so I dont think that doing things that way automatically always gives the ultimate absorption profile to plugging that is often presumed.

I dont understand whats so difficult to believe. We took a drug. We didn't feel the drug. Leading us to conclude that the drug is inactive. Same thing happens when you take bunk pills, I know its happened to people I know, they take it and say they feel it despite the fact that they are bunk. Theres no reason my 18mg original dose should have yielded less results than the previous 10mg doses. BTW it was on an empty stomach

Well I am just playing devils advocate here, trying to elicit more discussion.


Can you think of any alternate explanations as to why CC and CA felt what was to them extremely active, obviously non-placebo effects... and you did not?

We need more reports I think. I plan to take 15mg in the morning. I will be going into this with no expectations either way and have not used any tryptamine in months so I suppose I'll see what happens.

Well Dwayne, I don't really understand the meaning you ascribe to a single ineffective trial of a plugged dose of a non-tryptamine monoamine releaser generalizing to a plugged tryptamine experience. And if you're so certain "tolerance" is sufficient to explain how 10 times the reported active dose of a class of chemical (tryptamines) established as being effectively absorbed rectally could be taken without getting more than threshold effects then by all means take 10 mg of 4-AcO-DMT, followed two hours later by 90 mg, then go take a test or do some other cognitively demanding work as I did without it making a difference. Lets see if you really believe your claim about "exponential" tolerance quickly developing to tryptamines at dosage levels that are subjectively threshold at best.  


Also, please don't post in other forums that merrskis did a "180" in his opinion and state he did so simply to line up with mine when he did double the reported effective dose orally initially and posted that he wanted to push it higher before I even posted about suspected inactivity. I'm pretty sure that's you in that other forum, or is the methylone plugging story posted there just a coincidence? Clearly mirrskis wasn't getting much in the first place either or he wouldn't have wanted to redose. 


You're not simply trying to stimulate conversation or playing devil's advocate when you go to other forums trying to undermine people's experiences at dosages numerous times greater than the reported active dose and opine that one of them is simply conforming to the idea of non-activity when non-activity is the opposite of what we were all expecting. Who conforms to a minority opinion that's not in line with what they expect and desire to believe? You're waging a war of public opinion covertly without having even tried the chemical yourself. If you just said lets wait for more reports I'd be more inclined to let it slide because it's not TOTALLY impossible our experiences were flukes (just very unlikely), but it's clear you have more invested in this argument for some inexplicable reason. 


You want an explanation for why others experienced more? What was my posting about people having mystical experiences they counted as among the most significant experiences in their life from ritalin in my last post if not an explanation?  Why is it that that didn't register for you? You're ignoring evidence and plausible reasons that don't fit with what you want to believe. Both merrskis and myself WANTED to believe we'd trip but couldn't deny the evidence. So what's your excuse for ignoring it?

I think we need to wait for my reports to come out.


I've taken bunk LSD on 3 occasions. And as much as I would have loved to trip, 1, 2, even 3 hours in, it didn't happen...


psood0nym: I'm well aware of the John Hopkins Study, very interesting you brought that up. What is interesting though is that the placebo in that study was **still a drug**, therefore it still had affects on the CNS. I guarantee that if the placebo was a sugar-pill instead of ritalin, that the results would be completely different.


Only time will tell, I'll let everyone know how my 2nd trial goes this weekend.

I thought it was active because thats what I had anticipated. It was placebo, I had no problems sleeping, no dialated pupils at any point. I was stoned but thats normal for me, im stoned 80% of the time im awake, you just sound like you have no tolerance. Why would I feel the urge to redose (what I believed to be) a psychedelic, which I never do, let alone had taken a dosage double what anyone had posted yet. I redosed one hour in because I thought the experience was rather lackluster and usually when I have to question if im tripping or not then Im definitely not. I was going by cremes report and wanted to experience more than what he did. Why would I not want to trip off of such a rare tryptamine? It sounds like you guys either dont want to look like fools and are just trying to save face or are shills.

Just wanna put this out there, I used to only take high doses when I tripped, 18+mg 2c-e, 30mg 4-aco-dmt, 3-4 hits. 


Now since I trip much less often I'm all about the 1 hit LSD or 10mg 2c-e.


Just a thought...

psood0nym dont get your panties in a bunch, as they say.


I am not trying to incite anything.  Just posting what comes to mind as it comes to mind.  I have no vested interests, you're being paranoid.


As someone who has not tried it and was about to order it, I do have an interest.  But I am now in a quandry because I see 2 people who tried it and got rather strong results.  And 2 people who tried it and got zilch.


But despite your arguments that I should believe you because... what?  the ubiquitous and irresistible power of the placebo effect?  I see no reason to believe either result set over the other.  They are both just text on a computer screen by people I do not know in person.  So to be perfectly objective about it, from my perspective it's all still a big question mark.


Hopefully we will get more reports.

Seconded on the agreeing


I'm not trying to defend myself in fear of looking like a fool. I wrote a report to describe my experience, and my words are the best i can offer. Maybe it seems that I'm defensive only because you are so forward?


I would rather talk about why the chemical would or would not work. Similar compounds such as 4-ho-met, 4-ho-dpt, etc are found to be active. There was some reports too on MPT, being active around 100mg. Anyone with scientific knowledge that can chime in?

Let's just wait for more reports. 


psood0nym, your point of view does make sense, however why can't you have predisposed tolerance to 4-HO-MPT? I read so many times about people not getting any effects from 10 mg(or even more) of 2C-I, whereas 10 mg pushes me to clearly psychedelic state, and 2-3 mg is a threshold.

Yes, this is strange. 4-HO-DPT described as good psychedelic, but its (oral) dosages are rather high, albeit lower than psood0nym's 4-HO-MPT dose.

Maybe this 4-ho-mpt being on the market is to let us plainfolk know what it was like for Shulgin whenever he tested something which wasn't active or active at only a threshold level.


I've got some of this on the way, but looking at the reports so far, it doesn't look to be active but I'm still holding out on seeing for myself. I've also been spacing my trips apart by several weeks so there shouldn't be much tolerance involved. 


If it is a dud, then we simply get to experience a similar point in mind when Shulgin was testing his stuff, some of which turned out to be duds. We're just guinea pigs here, going through a more extensive testing trial phase than what Shulgin had collected in his notes. The original report in TIHKAL left it ambiguous as to whether or not it was truly active and that was from a single report. 


The more reports come in, the more we know about it, it's all simple curiosity and even though some might consider it a 'wasted' endeavor, It's still worth it to satisfy our curiosity.

I could conceivably have predisposed tolerance, but I don't have predisposed tolerance to other 4-sub tryptamines so that's reason to think I don't.  My argument is all about what there is *more* reason to believe. I don't think it makes sense to treat these reports as equivalent "votes" for activity or no activity at this point as Dwayne is insisting he has reason to do simply because there is two for and two against. That notion of equivalence is what I'm arguing against. I'm not arguing for what absolutely must be, but what there is most practical reason to think.


When investigating a new experimental treatment you assume no effect to guard against Type I error, or finding an effect when their is none. That's the worst type of mistake you can make because it leads to further experimentation in vain (in this case people spending money and time on something they hope is effective but isn't). I'm arguing for inactivity because the consequences of me doing so are less negative for others than the alternative. That's why in the legal system innocence is assumed and the burden of prove lies on the prosecution, so they don't find an innocent person guilty. 4-ho-MPT has been bought by enough people already to get sufficient numbers of reports in to reach a conclusion. My position protects people who are debating buying it now from wasting their money when the fact is if it is active it will be restocked and they'll have more opportunities to get it later. Findings of no effect are to be weighed more heavily than findings of effects from the very start for this reason. That's the first reason I don't think our reports should be treated as equivalent "votes" that cancel each other out just because there is two of each. 


The second is because the two "experiments" that found no effects are using more of the "treatment" than the other two experiments (100 mg and 50 mg versus 10!). I mean, that's not a small difference. More treatment should be assumed to equal more effect. That's a solid sensible reason that we know is in effect in this instance (we in fact did take much higher doses), while Dwayne's ideas about profound instant tolerance are mere suppositions that we don't know happened and that there is actually reason to assume didn't (my never experiencing variance in effects with tryptamine rectal dosing). There's more reason to assume that what is known to be true has a real effect in *this instance* than to assume that some anomaly about rectal absorption not working and causing instant exponential tolerance is in effect, or the idea that I have a predisposed tolerance for 4-ho-MPT that has not been displayed for similar 4-sub compounds is having an influence.  It's about sticking with what is known for sure about this case and what there are simple reasons for rather than treating suppositions that have no clear support in this instance as if they are *equally meaningful *counterpoints. I don't deny that alternative explanations are in the realm of possibility, just that there is *as much* reason to entertain them as the one's I've given in favor of suspecting non-activity.


As far as talking about why 4-ho-MPT shouldn't be active when other 4-sub tryptamines are, there are numerous instances of compounds that look good on paper that don't work out.  As fractal fountain notes, Shulgin's report is ambiguous and totally within the possibility of being placebo effect (which is a powerful, physiologically measurable, well-established effect, whereas again, we don't know that tryptamines cause instant profound tolerance such that 10 times the reported effective dose should be rendered inert -- that's not established). 


We will indeed find out what the truth is when more reports come in. My point is about what it makes sense to assume and treat as quality evidence in assessing the reports at hand right now.

^ I've personally thought of most 5-MeO-T's as useless, other than 5-MeO-DMT... and even that one is only really good for ego loss. It seems like Moxy and Foxy have a tendency to have bad side effects/freakouts... 5-meo-met and 5-meo-det, the former isn't too much on the sparkle, the latter being potent to the point of great discomfort. 


5-MeO-MPT will probably cause a bunch of GI issues and not that many psychedelic effects.

They're fucking vendors. They're idiots practically by definition. I don't even know which one is selling it and I'm sure of that. It would take many reports of no activity for me to believe this compound is inactive; with both 4-oh-met and 4-oh-dpt being active and shulgin reporting it as active that is an extraordinary claim, and we lack any sort of extraordinary evidence.

Why would the freebase self destruct for two people who got the same batch of the same chemical from the same source as everybody else, yet using 10 times and 5 times the dose reported active did nothing for them? I mean, think about it. Would you ever buy that somehow someone could fuck up using 10 times the "fully active" dose of 2C-E such that they could use it rectally, orally, and intramuscular (all at over 15 mg) over three or four hours and not trip? I mean, try it with 2C-E or 4-AcO-DMT and tell me you're certain the tolerance effects developed will be so strong it will result in nothing. I've used psychedelics literally hundreds of times in over 13 years, and only with fake LSD have I ever not tripped at a NORMAL dose, let alone 10 times a normal dose. This makes no sense to me at all.


Also, like merrskis I never had dilated pupils and fell asleep at the end of the night (about two hours after I orally dosed the last of my sample).

Hi everyone! This is my first post, though I do a bit of lurking on occasion.


I wanted to join this discussion in particular because I also recieved a sample of 4-HO-MPT from the same vendor and had the opportunity earlier today to try a 7mg oral dose.


The first alerts came within 45 minutes of the dose in the form of excited energy.  I found myself easily distracted, I turned on the TV but found that I wasn't paying any attention to it.  


The peak came gradually, so I won't venture a time frame, but it was extremely enjoyable and I found myself feeling peaceful and content to spend my time alone, quietly.


At some point, about two hours in, I had a conversation with my mom- I noticed I was able to articulate myself exceptionally well, which has always been a pleasant effect found with psilocin and 4-AcO-DMT.  Overall, I found the conversation wonderful, I was in a state prone to laughter and understanding.


The come down was quite as gradual, 4 hours later residual energy is present but not much else.


The visuals were mild, and what you would expect- an all around brightening and softening of the world around me.


I will certainly try a higher dose next time, I just wanted to test the waters with what I (correctly) discerned would be mild and give a good impression of the substance.


I am without doubt that the effects I felt were real and caused by the chemical itself, and not a trick of my mind.

This stuff is very nice. Not overly visual at this dosage but a really nice euphoric body high. Seems to be mildly stimulating, very comfortable. Would liken it to 4-ho-dipt only less visual. 15mg of the freebase produced a solid +2. Would definetely consider stocking up if it were available as a fumerate or Hcl. salt.

Since evidence has turned against us, I guess I'll say sorry to CaptainAmerica and ClearCreme for my hubris.  


Just please try to understand the certainty of my perspective by asking yourself this:  What is more likely, that a person who responds normally to psychedelics can take 10 times the normal dose of a psychedelic and not feel a thing, or that another person can take 10 times less than the first person's dose expecting to trip and imagine that they are (as has been established hundreds of times across subjects with placebo effects using fake alcohol or dopaminergic drugs)? Would you not be incredulous? Does the first interpretation not seem profoundly more likely when considering people who have experience placebo effects have expressed exactly the same degree of certainty that they are inebriated, yet if they were to take 10 times a drunk dose of, say actual alcohol, it would result in unconscious and maybe death no matter what they believe they've taken? I mean shouldn't the open eye visuals that would no doubt be present at 10 times and active dose prevent us from even reading posts? Do you see the divide? It's a choice between believing one can convince one's self they're inebriated when they're not or believing one can totally ignore a degree of inebriation that should, by sheer physiological inevitability, result in incapacitation.  Which do you believe is more likely?


The only thing that makes sense to me is that it's not the same chemical going to everyone, but I see no clear reason to think why that should be.

This is fascinating. Glad to see more positive reports coming in. Glad to know I wasn't a textbook example of the placebo effect.


psoo0donym and merskis, I would really like to get to the bottom on why your batches were inactive, this boggles my mind!


Being that its winter time, might the cold, (or possibly heat if you live in a warm climate) have done something to the freebase 4-ho-mpt?


Because it was a freebase, does that make it more susceptible to degradation?


I look forward to dosing more this weekend..


**for all you who have sampled this chemical**

I noticed my jaw hurt quite a bit (maybe form clenching?) as well as a mild headache that persisted throughout the day after I took my 10mg dose. 


Has anyone else noticed these affects? Would you attribute it to 4-ho-mpt?

The freebase would degrade more easily, yes. I would think the cold would have slowed any degradation as optimal storage conditions for tryptamines are to keep them cold and away from light, water and oxygen.

I'm still experiencing the effects but I have to say I haven't noticed any jaw clenching at all. Will get back to you later regarding the headache.

Maybe this chemical is 'unique' in the sense that it only works through the oral route of action? Maybe, maybe not... But so far most of the active posts have stated that they ate it to feel effects. I guess psood0nym's trials just show that it must be taken a certain way... That is not say psood0nym's trials were in vain! If he hadn't gone the unconventional means of plugging and IV/IM, we might not have found out that perhaps this chemical is not meant to be plugged or IM'd.

Thanks for understanding my perspective guys.  I thought it made some sense! I live in a very cold climate and used it the day I received it. It's difficult to imagine it degraded so quickly. It didn't get all wet or sticky or brown like the 4-AcO-MiPT I had once that degraded, rather it stayed crystalline white and didn't even clump. 


Also, to answer fractal fountain I didn't use only unconventional ROAs. I used 15 + 10 + 15 mg doses rectally within the first hour, 30 mg intramuscularly, and 30 mg orally just to finish it off. If it's not active non-orally, then no tolerance should have developed and 30 mg orally should have certainly been strong enough to notice. Mirrskiis also did a 18 mg dose orally to start and only felt light effects which could be attributable to placebo, and then did another large oral dose later. I've redosed other 4-sub tryptamines in the past, and though they were not as potent as the original dose, I certainly have gotten strong boosts from taking just 50 percent more than the original dose well over an hour past the first dose (plenty of time for tolerance effects to develop). Here I took nearly TEN times the original dose, that's 20 friggin times what I normally take to get a boost from other psychedelics if I assume I need 50 percent of the original dose to get a boost like normal, without feeling any boost in effect. If my sample was active this is totally unprecedented in hundreds of trips with over a dozen different psychedelics in well over a decade of tripping. I can't make sense of it.

^ It is really, really strange.

Also, I would suppose that the people, who found 4-HO-MPT active, had predisposed sensibility to its effects. Even with 2 more positive reports, why not?

Anyhow, psood0nym, are you going to buy this chemical again to investigate if it is totally inactive for you?

I attempted a vaporization with the freebase:


3mg, aluminum foil & a lighter. Slow, low heat was applied. It liquefied soon, closely following through with a noticable vapor once medium heat was applied. The vapor was held for 30 seconds. By +45 seconds, most full effects were felt. Light visions, a body high (very enjoyable), and a more than usually content mind follows. +15 minutes: Same physical and mental activity. Achieved a strong calmness when eyes closed. +30 minutes: 10-15 minutes were spent with eyes closed, having dissociated thoughts. +40 minutes: Dimishing effects occuring. Ate some food. +50-60 minutes: Most effects gone. Nap was taken.

Psoodonym, going through your posts I did notice you had 2C-C-NBOMe last week, which might explain possible (cross-) tolerance issues going by Erny's reply here:

No idea why merrskis didn't report anything though. Other than that he was smoking hash at the time of his experiment, which could have negatively impacted the light and benign effects 4-HO-MPT seems to produce, I can't think of anything else besides rapid degradation and/or an impure batch. 


I might try a dose soon to confirm it's (in) activity.

I think this is very plausible, actually. If this drug has very subtle effects, that you actually need to be "sensitive" to feel, I could easily imagine how a lot of hash could drown it´s effects.


There is also the possibilty that the vendor made a mistake, maybe he sent you the wrong chemical. Or maybe he turned into a selective scammer......


Thing is, we will never know what was really happened. it´s like the ongoing thread about non-LSD ergoloids in blotters. We can debate it till the end of the world, but we will never know for sure.


Edit:

Psood and merrskis, you should contact the vendor maybe? He should be interested in keeping costumers hapy.

Well, except you can only talk about "reactions" and "reagents" in test-tube terms.  Any hints about human consumption and the vendor pretty much needs to dissociate himself from you, since to do otherwise puts him in direct violation of US analogue law.

Yes, of cause. But still.....You can just write him that results of your experiments were disappointing, and that you think that there is something wrong with the product received. 

Ask him if he is sure no mistakes were made? if there was more than one batch? 

For how long had the compound been stored? etc, etc.


The more I think about it, I believe the vendor is the key to this mystery.

^ maybe, Fagott, but Blowmonkey's observation about psood0nym's recent NBOMe use could have something to do with it.  And if that resulted in diminished effectiveness, then the rapid redosing 3 times in the first hour seems to me like it could add to the tolerance rapidly.  You don't have to feel anything for tolerance to be getting extended.  Back when I once had aquired a huge gotss of very clean microdots of LSD I liked it so much that I tried doing it every or every other night, with rapidly diminishing effect.  So I kept trying that with increasing doses, still pretty much feeling nothing.  I didnt get effects again till I quit it completely for about 3 weeks.  So even though it was not effective at causing perceptible effects, it was still bathing the neurons and causing the tolerance to continue.


And all the hash smoking by the other guy, and the fact that he started to say in his 1st 2 posts that he was feeling something, I dunno, just sounds like the hash lotted out the non-overpowering effects of this stuff. THC is extremely powerful, and it CAN definitely STRONGLY affect the character of many other trip substances, making them much more hazy and diffuse and non-distinct and possibly even hard to notice.


So I dont see alot of payback in puzzling for other explanations, yea it would be nice to know "for sure" but short of the vendor saying "oops I sent some people something inactive" I don't see that any definitive conclusions can be reached.  Unless some can be given to a friend to cross-check reactions.

Regarding buying the chemical again: I wouldn't buy it from a vendor.  I have some friends with similar experimental tastes as myself and if they experience activity with an order of their own I'd probably ask them just to send me 15 mg or so to check to see if I trip.


Regarding 25C-NBOMe tolerance: That's a good observation, only I was able to trip off of a normal dose of 4-ho-MiPT four days after using 25C, so the tolerance couldn't have been too severe.  The super long tolerance with that one comes from repeated dosing or redosing up to a high cumulative dose. I once took 3 or 4 mg in a day just to see what would happen and I'm sure that tolerance lasted at least a week (though I didn't try tripping within a week to test it for sure). I've never had significant tolerance issues dosing 4-AcO-DMT or DPT two days in a row (50 mg of DPT will wipe me out both days, for instance) so I don't think 4-AcO-MiPT played a role. If we were talking about me not catching much off of 15 mg of 4-ho-MPT I'd seriously entertain the idea of tolerance from the 25C and 4-ho-MiPT playing a role, but it was 100 mg.  Also, I don't usually dose twice in a week, so I haven't built up tolerance that way. It was just the last week of winter break...

In another forum it was suggested that we could have potentially been sent DPT by accident. It happens to be the case that the vendor had just recently received DPT and put it on sale at the time of my order. This is the explanation that makes the most sense. I had given up hope for the 4-ho-MPT and started drinking a little thinking I'd be going to bed soon when I used the IM dose.  It's possible a 30 mg IM dose of DPT could have been masked by the alcohol. Even though 30 mg would normally be enough to feel over alcohol, my reactions to DPT on occasion vary dramatically, with 25 mg sometimes coming on strong and 50 mg sometimes feeling like 25 mg normally feels (therefore 30 mg could potentially feel like just 15 mg, a small enough dose to be masked by alcohol).  My rectal doses and oral doses would of course have been ineffective since those ROAs require very high doses of DPT to be effective. This would also explain merrskis' reaction, as he used the bulk of his dose orally.


If this is the case, everyone needs to be EXTREMELY careful with using chems from this vendor. They're planning to get DOC and DOC-NBOMe, and if they're being lazy with what they send out, you could be in a world of pain or dead if you order DPT and inject 50 mg of DOC they send by accident!! Yikes.  Test 2 mg (nasally, since NBOMes are not active orally) and wait a few hours or do a proper test on anything you order. This should be standard practice, but with them it may be even more critical than usual.

I did not email them yet. I can't prove it was DPT, but yeah, it's certainly worth a shot, especially if they aren't following this thread or the thread in the other forum.  They should absolutely be made aware of this (very plausible) explanation so that they refine their methods of shipment preparation for greater safety.

Hah, I just checked my email for a reply to an inquiry I sent earlier today about the stock dates of DPT with the vendor. Apparently DPT wasn't in stock until 2 days after my order went out. Again this becomes a total mystery!  None of their other current products has a dosage as high as DPT. I thought finally I had a proper understanding of this. But no, once again it's totally inexplicable and unsatisfying.


EDIT: After further communication the vendor has offered to send a free sample as a good faith measure.

So you brought it up, or reverse? I guess it's better news to hear that you probably did receive the right product, as opossed to the lingering thoughts of mislabeled chemicals... hopefully your new sample can lead to some more information.

^^ Mepocin? With r("Meprocin") it sounds too much like miprocin.

Also, we could swap methyl and propyl part and get Promecin. But it is against rules of naming of 4-substituded tryptamines.

Aw, come on, man! The vendor probably didn´t do it on purpose. if he did it at all.

There has been several reports of very reputable vendors mixing shipments up, leading to some very bad accidents. Vendors are humans too, and not perfect robots.

Some people got 2cp instead of Buphedrone. And some of the deaths from bromo-Dragonfly happened because they thought they had received 2cb-fly!


No ones trying to discredit any one here. Just trying to find out all possibilities about how come 2 people have found this compound to be inactive at 10 times the supposed regular dose.

how soluble is the freebase in ethanol?  and meprocin would sound better if the prefix me has a long e sound. i dislike the short e pronounciation of metocin so i apply the same rule for it to not sound like medicine. but then again the phosphoryloxy and acetoxy analogues would sound like  pirate talk. miprocin for me has a long i sound as well. i say this name may be destined to sound stupid.

Aw come on man, I know vendors are human,  and accidents happen,  this also makes me question why anyone would dose themselves with 100mg of a chemical in one sitting, especially since vendors are human and accidents happen.  This compound is pretty much brand new, having 1 report at 8 mg before this week.  I'm not trying to get on anyones bad side, but the entire thread looks like its trying to discredit said vendor.  That vendor however, I believe, is actually intelligent, and with 4 products ; I don't believe he would mistakenly send you the wrong chemical.

Do you remember what your order looked like psood? Maybe you can compare once you get that new sample. Does anyone have the dpt and 4-ho-mpt side by side?


It's good they offered some more of the product to you, seems they have confidence in their ways at least. I don't see why they wouldn't if they really didn't have dpt at that time.

I also get the feeling you're trying to discredit the vendor, but why?  He's always seemed clean and professional to me.

ClearCreme: it all took place in a matter of minutes, by "earlier in the day" I actually minutes ago, heh. I was juggling email and homework and different forums and editing and re-editing posts in numerous places so things got a bit short and I wasn't making the best word choices. You suggested I email them, I did, then they answered almost immediately. The sample was white and came in a 1 cm X 1 cm baggie.  From the pictures posted on the vendor's site I don't think there's any telling them apart.

That vendor however, I believe, is actually intelligent, and with 4 products ; I don't believe he would mistakenly send you the wrong chemical.

Please look into some of my back posts or even just read the whole of this thread before you start making ludicrous accusations.  It's clear you didn't even read all my posts in this thread or you would know it was 100 mg over 3 or 4 hours using various ROAs, and that I started with 15 mg (actually, I started with 2 mg nasally an hour before that for safety's sake).   Not to mention there was more than just Shulgin's 8 mg report online at the time I used it. I also have experience with every chemical on the vendor's site besides 4-ho-MPT that I have reason to suspect they might have sent me by accident, and I'm well aware of my dose of each and the onset time of each.Why would I embarrass myself claiming others are having placebo effects if in fact I knew it was active and in a matter of days a flood of reports would come in contradicting everything I said? Why not just make a few new accounts as a greenlighter and simply post I was ripped off? Wouldn't that work a lot better, with a fuck lot less effort and embarrassment? Why would I post that the vendor was sending me compensatory samples and make them look better if I was trying to discredit them? That would be lunacy. What kind of discrediting strategy is that? How are you even entertaining such a notion? Spell it out for me. Are you the vendor or a business partner, Greenlighter? 


I've been here since 2005 as you'd see if you'd bothered to look a few inches to the left. I'm nowhereman on Erowid. I have trip reports going back over a decade, including three 3 star reports, the most of any author in the site's history.  I'm not some amateur brat whose going to come around recklessly and stupidly kicking shit that is obviously going to backfire on him and undermine a decade's worth of honest commitment and time and effort to this culture to make some random vendor look bad, and then make myself look dumb, and then spend more time providing evidence to exonerate said vendor when I don't have to do any of that to make them look bad. Your extraordinarily shallow reading of this thread and lack of consideration before posting unsubstantiated insults boggles my mind. What really pisses me off is for all the people who are being thoughtful and trying to help make sense of things I know there's hordes of other people on here or who are just lurking that are just like you and will read your post and think to themselves "yeah, that makes sense -- psood0nym's just a liar and an asshole".

For such a veteran of the "community," you seem to be the antithesis of harm reduction in your actions.  It doesn't matter how many chemicals you've ingested/injected/plugged in orafices, you need to be more careful than you claim to have been in your exploration of this chemical.


The reason I feel you are discrediting the vendor is that yours is *the only* one out of several reports indicating that 4-HO-MPT is inactive (save for merrskis, who I won't fully count because he seemed to go either way and be unsure whether he felt any effects through his THC high).  


I appreciate your report as a person who is interested in exploring my mind through chemicals and would like to do so safely and effectively.


However- what strikes as unusual is your utter defensiveness!  If you posted your report sheerly out of the desire to help others achieve my aforementioned objectives, than I can't understand why you would be so argumentative about it. 


Why argue so passionately that it was a placebo rather than sit back with interest as other reports came in? 


How can you- one individual- say so definitively that something is inactive?


Maybe your beef isn't with the vendor, maybe you just like attention or wanted the opportunity to give a conclusion on something.

skidmarx: Because it was obvious I wasn't going to trip off it after hours of inactivity and confirmed using a 2 mg insufflated dose long before that it wasn't potent (why do I need to tell you this yet again?). Regarding my insistence that it was a placebo see my explanation of my perspective in my apology to CaptainAmerica and ClearCreme. Also, see my explanation about protecting people from wasting their money on buying it between the time I posted and the time more reports came it (which could've been days or even a week later for all I knew). I've explained already that I wasn't arguing for what the definite truth was, but for what it made sense to think at the time. All of this is out there for you to read and recognize on your own. Am I speaking to a child? I've explained my perspective and my rationale over and over again exhaustively. That's why everyone else agrees it's genuinely strange and you're the only one accusing me of being a liar (and now an attention whore). I don't appreciate having to continually defend myself from blatantly unjustified accusations after all the work and frustration and confusion and embarrassment this experience has caused me just because you don't want to put in the effort of reading or exercising any nuance of thought to understand what's been said already.  I'm not exhausting myself to entertain your laziness anymore. I won't read any reply you make. 


To everybody else: I think I'm taking a week off of PD. Talk to you later.

This is ridiculous. 


For the record it was me, not psood0nym, who suggested that the vendor might have made a mistake or had turned selective scammer.


Besides from that, I don´t understand why skidmarx and BGreenGC suddenly have to get all defensive on part of the vendor. Maybe they know him personaly?

Or you just luv him because of his fast shipping and exceptional costumer service?

yeah, right.


Reputable vendors have made mistakes before. They might again. Not wanting to aknowledge this is naive and stupid.

We can just get back on topic and off the bashing for the good of shared knowledge and experience(what this should be about)? 


The title of this thread is 4-HO-MPT and it seems a potentially quite pleasant novel chem. Wouldn't ya say!


I would like to hear more about peoples experiences with it now that we know its available and active. Some Trip reports maybe! Maybe i'll have one of my own here after the weekend when I give my sample a go!![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^^^Agreed. The vendor seemed to willingly respond, and have a another sample sent out to psood to compare. I'm sure psood will let us know when he has more commentary.


Itd be more than cool to hear some additional reports, I almost forgot what this topic was about!

Hahaha.  Believe me i've been following this thread since the first day i saw the vendor put put the chemical up.  So if you look back, i believe i'm on the first or 2nd page? Saying i had to sign up to comment? Did you miss that?  Trust me i saw that you started with 15 mgs, i'm pretty sure you started with it up the pooper. I also read every part where you got entirely too offensive at the ones who were claiming to reach effects that were truly not placebo.  Have i ever called you an asshole?  I don't believe so, and i don't believe your outlash is really warranted.  You honestly have to ask how i'm entertaining such notion of you just strictly trying to discredit this vendor? Honestly?  Look a few pages back at you ASSURING people that what they were feeling was absolutely nothing more then placebo!  Tryptamines are powerful chemicals, anyone with any experience would really be able to tell if there dose didn't even get them to any sort of threshold.  So now you're coming at me and trying to precious bluelight reputation by saying i'm affiliated with the vendor? Please, i'm a good 1000 miles away from where my deliveries are mailed.  Maybe you've been sticking too much chemicals up your ass since 2005.  I did notice you have a ton of posts, so i gave you the benefit of the doubt until you started calling people out and telling them their trips were nothing but placebo.  That is what made you look dumb, and anyone with any logic would think you had some sort of vendetta with said vendor.  Maybe you liked the 4-ho-mpt so much that you would go as far to discredit the vendor in as many forums as you can so you could get another 100mg for free.  Who knows right? crazy interwebs.


Did you ever find out what chemical he did send you? I check his page pretty much daily as i await 5-methyl-mda, so as soon as you started saying maybe he sent you dtp, it really seemed like you were just trying to discredit him, as dtp wasnt put on the page til late sunday/early monday.  And you gave your trip report the next day if memory serves me correct.  


O and if you're gonna call me out and say i'm the vendor, are you merkiiss too? IS that your greenlighter alter ego?  Trust me bro, we can all go skizo and start pointing fingers if you want.


I'm not here to argue however, as my comments weren't meant to sound outlandish.  


Hi, i'm buddy green.  I've been browsing this forum for quite a while now.  I actually joined so i could contribute my findings on this fairly unresearched chemical.   


And to Fagott - 


I don't know the vendor, i don't even know his name to be honest with you.  But yea, he ships quick as fuck and everything is always weighed on point.

thought i would summarize all of the reports so far into one spot.  whoever saw reports on a different forum, could ya bring a summary over here?


Shulgin, 8mg hcl salt, orally -- mild visuals, vertigo, not much in the way of mental effects.  insomnia for 8 hours.


Clear Creme, 10mg freebase, orally -- Peaceful feeling.  OEV and CEVs noted.  Good body feeling.  Notable mental effects.


CaptainAmerica, 10mg freebase, orally -- "Not too deep" (mental effects?).  "Amazing body feel, clarity, and laughter."  Lasting stimulation.


abrad84, 15mg freebase, orally -- Moderate OEVs, "classic tryptamine body high," mild stimulation, considered to be a ++


Clear Creme, 3mg vaporized -- Light visuals, body high, content mind, strong calmness with closed eyes.  dissociated thoughts with closed-eye meditation.


psood0nym, 100mg via various routes -- no effect


merskis, 50mg via various routes? (not sure that is exactly right...) -- +/-


i will hopefully be recieving 50mg today.  i have used mushrooms twice (mostly 3.5g+, approximately 5 times), and 4-aco-dmt (dosages of which don't really matter for this conversation because the first day i dosed higher to compensate for cross-tolerance with a 2c-i dose from ~5h prior, and the second time was the next day and also combined with 2c-i)


those are my only tryptamine experiences, but i have much experience with various different psychedelic phenethylamines/amphetamines (some of which i have used very high dosages of), as well as a few acid trips.


my first thought was to drop all 50mg, but now i'm looking at these reports and thinking that less would be more appropriate.  i would normally take a ++ dose of a new chemical before jumping into a +++.  however, if i were to take a ++ dose (which appears to be ~15mg), then i would be left with a funny amount afterwards, ~35mg, which in my opinion would probably be too large for a single dose, but two small of an amount to split into two doses.


anyway, i think i'm just going to keep it simple and split the 50mg into two 25mg doses.  this hopefully will be a full +++.  at the very least, 25mg should be enough to rule out the possibility of a +/- reaction.


i'm also going to leave open the possibility of taking the other 25mg at around t+2h.


i think what i will do is mix the freebase powder with lemon juice to convert it to the citrate, and then use my trusty oral syringe (my only volumetric measuring apparatus) to evenly divide the dose into two.


any thoughts/comments/questions/concerns?  honestly i'm just going to skip the allergy test... i will keep benadryl nearby in case a reaction does start to occur.

This material is far more euphoric than 4-aco-DMT. Very easy on the mind, I can't imagine many people will run into trouble with it.

The only things I would suggest nightwatch it to lower the does and keep it in the freebase and not convert it. psood tried it and maybe it changed the situation. Itd be good to see possible variables avoided.


And alergy tests are always suggested... even if you want to rub a little bit on some soft skin to see any irritation.

seems like the freebase doesn't even like to dissolve in alcohol.  with my means i need to do volumetric measurement, so converting to a salt seems ideal.


i do understand the concerns about 25mg being too high of a dose for a first time.  however, this chemical seems fairly benign so far, and 25mg isn't really *that* much higher than 15mg.  though also i do know that individual response can vary widely even among different closely related chemicals in the same class...


however, i tend to be a hard head in some ways when it comes to psychedelics.  even having done large doses quite often in my life, i can only recall probably less than 10 times that i have actually gotten pronounced visuals.  this drug seems to be more of a sensory drug than a mental drug at low doses, so there is a strong possibility that 15mg would only put me at a +/-.  this is a situation that i would very much like to avoid.


i'm fairly certain that using lemon juice or something similar to dissolve the freebase is probably my best bet with the means that i have, but if anyone else has any better ideas then please, do share! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Why do you need to do volumetric measurement? Sounds like you might not have a scale... I hope that's not the case. You'll loose accuracy just by assumming the initial weight.


None the less, I would be happier to hear about the non-converted results. Maybe they provided it in freebase for a reason.

i'm aware that the initial weight might not be accurate.  i do not have a milligram scale. i have, however, weighed this vendor's products with a .01g scale in the past, and everything was accurate to at least a hundredth of a gram.  i trust that the vendor gave me close enough to 50mg that the discrepancy in accuracy doesn't matter.  it is a small risk, but one that i am comfortable with.


when the freebase hits your stomach acid it gets converted to a salt anyway.  converting it before i consume it shouldn't make that much of a difference.  i doubt that the reason they provide it as a freebase has anything to do with differences in activity.


anyway, i have decided to use 20mg for my first go-round.  i have a strong feeling that 15mg or less will leave me underwhelmed.

before i dosed i typed up a long intro to a trip report, here's the only bit that i want to share:


> "To prepare my solution I simply made a mixture of 5ml of lemon juice and 5ml of 40% vodka. The lemon juice is so that the freebase will convert to Meprocin citrate, and the vodka is to make sure the solution stays sterile during storage.  I put this into a glass jar that holds slightly more than 10ml.  I then dumped the contents of the baggie into the jar and shook it up until the powder appeared to have dissolved, leaving me with 5mg Meprocin:1ml solution."

i took 20mg.


my experiment only told me two things really... this stuff is *definitely* active, and i am still a hard head.


by that i mean, i still didn't get much in the way of sensory effects, but i did get slight body tremors like i get from psilocin or psilocetin.  this stuff didn't affect me mentally like psilocin or psilocetin do, but i find that i need pretty high doses even of those two to get a pronounced mental effect.  and neither one gives me much in the way of perceptual distortions.


edit--- forgot to mention that peak effects were over for me at about t+2.5h, but like i said i dosed on a pretty empty stomach.

Its burning a hole in my pocket and i want to use try it so bad, but i have things i have to do tomorrow(later today really).  But after i read your report i'll decide  if 20 mg is going to do the trick. So i'm def looking forward to your report.

So how are our little guinea pigs? everybodies alive and in one piece, I hope? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I am really looking forward to some more reports coming in on this substance. Especialy from people with a lot of experience in psychedelics, so we can get some comparisons to other tryptamines. 

about dosage it seems that people are getting very varied effects from similar doses, which makes it sound a little bit like DPT, in the way that 50 mg can blow one person apart, while others need 200 mg to just get over treshold.


I guess your prior experience with psychedelics also play a role here.

I'm going to write a report with my experience in about 24 hours!  I haven't seen anyone write anything about taking more then 15mgs, do you have links for other trip reports that a normal google search won't yield fagott??  


I'm very experienced with psychedelics and i'm not so much worried about 20mgs being too much, i just hope it's enough!  I want to really experience it!

Yea forbidden, i'm not worried about still tripping for the stuff i have to do, i just wanna play it safe and do it tomorrow incase my body doesn't agree with the substance.  I'll also be around family that i don't see too often, so i would like to have my wits and not appear to fried.

what i wrote is pretty much all i have to report honestly. like i said, i am a bit of a hard head.  20mg should be an active level for most people though.  i definitely felt the peripheral side-effects at a level that suggests this is a pretty active chemical (side-effects like leg tremors and chills), i just didn't get much in the way of sensory or cognitive effects (again, probably because i am a bit of a hard head).


i will note that i felt first effects in about 10 or 15 minutes though!  my last full meal was about 18 hours before dosing, and i had one donut about 3 or 4 hours before dosing,  your gel cap will make the comeup take a bit longer though... not that that's a bad thing--i will admit that i was pretty scared over the quick comeup "shit, i'm feeling this so fast, maybe i took too much."  but then an hour and a half later i once again realized that i am in fact a hard head...

No, sorry. I don´t know of any other trip reports.

I was just talking about the vide variety of effects we have found in this thread already.


Like clear creme and thenightwatch seems like their experiences were on 2 wholy different levels. And the thenightwatch even took the double amount of clear creme. 


Maybe it would help if people indicated what level on the shulgin scale was reached from the dose they took?


Anyway, I probably have to buy a sample of this myself soon ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Ok, I took 20mg oral dose in a gelcap last night and must say I was impressed! I am pretty experienced with psychedelics and must say over the other tryptamines i've done this was the fastest come up to peak to come down I've experienced. As far as other 4 substituted trpys. i've done 4-ho-met, 4-ho/aco-dipt, 4-ho-mipt, 4-aco-dmt. I would say I saw some hint comparisons to mipt/dipt but it was truly its own and unique experience. I found it quite euphoric with some good visuals (I did add a couple cartridges of nitrous I found around at the peak which melted my surroundings!Hehe!) but overall was surprised with the intensity I reached at 20mg. It was in no way overwhelming but I went farther faster than I expected and came back quicker than expected. Overall a very enjoyable experience. I would put it at a 2 and a half plus to three plus on the shulgin scale which is good because I am working with a slight tolerance from a little binge a week or so back. So yes I would say if you like and are interested in tryps. this is a good one forsure ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)%)

Yea I was surprised at its potency aswell! 20mg was bout plenty for me maybe would go 25 tops considering how quick it comes on and its got intensity. I did find it quite comfortably dissociating too in the comedown!

Tried 12mg before a Reverend Horton Heat show friday and though that was not the idea environment for evaluating the effects of a new compound, I still got a decent feel for the effects. Due to alcohol and cannabis throughout the evening, I can't give an exact duration, but the effects were noticeably declining by the 4 hour mark. Despite being aware of the rapid come up, I was still caught a bit off guard by it. First effects felt within 15 minutes and full effects within about 40 minutes. More stimulating than 4-ho-dpt or psilocybin. More visuals than any other 4-subbed tryptamine I have tried at this dose, except maybe 4-ho-mipt. Visuals consisted mostly of trails and a sort of pixelation. Not a ton of mental effects besides some euphoria, but that could be due to the environment I tried it in. Too bad I most likely won't get another trial in until spring break.


Also, I had taken no psychedelics in months so tolerance was not an issue.

I really like 4-ho-mipt. A Beautiful Substance!![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I definitely found 4-ho-mpt more dissociating of the mind and body though and would expect it more in line of an out of body experience over the iso. if it were taken up a little maybe or after a few weeks sober, but thats just me. 


DPT is REAL! My experiences have likened it more to DMT but less visual, great for the soul%)

Wow. Best. Tryptamine. Thread. Ever!


So much fun, so much controversy... It's almost like sitting in Shulgin's garage trying to curate a set of Qualitative Comments for TiHKAL. 


I read the whole thread and have a few thoughts. FIrst off, I haven't been here for awhile, and had no idea the controversy was swirling about until someone told me I shouldn't have had a trip off my sample.


So, yeah, I got in early enough to get a 50 mg sample. Received it withn a couple of days and tried vaping ~4-5 mg from a glass pipe. The effect was rapid and strong (++/+++), but the magnitude of effect was most likely influenced by the rapid come-up.


There was a full, vibrating tryptamine body buzz, the racing mental confusion that results from a too-fast come-up, and heightened colors with objects fuzzing around the edges. The OEV were mild to nonexistant, except some slight squirming and squiggling of faces. The CEV were mild, but evident. The color scheme seemed to be ochres and golden hues, whereas I catch neon blues and pinks from (for example) 25C-NBOMe. The CEV were well defined, with towering, arabic spires, and edges in stark relief. Music was great, but at this dose didn't provide the stimuli that it did with 4-AcODMT or 4-HO-MiPT. A continual body energy kept movement constant, so that fidgeting and dancing in place was happening in time to the music.


We have a friend near us at Uni, who has access to a LC-MS. The sample we received was ~98-99% pure and exhibited a primary ion in positive mode of 233 m/z, which is the correct mass for 4-HO-MPT. The primary impurity appeared to be a tryptamine dimer with twice the mass. Note the following CAVEAT:  MS analysis can NOT tell the difference between 4HO-MPT and 4-HOMiPT. So, it's either 4HO-MPT or 4-HO-MiPT, given this Vendor's track record I bet it really is 4HO-MPT, but only 1HNMR analysis will tell for sure. This next piece of info doesn't tell us much,. but I put it here for completeness sake: The primary fragment ions in MS2 for the sample of 4-HO-MPT in positive mode was m/z 160. The same exact fragment mass was observed when the analyst ran a separate sample of 4-HO-MiPT that had been aquired from a completely separate vendor. This is to be expected, as the fragmentation of both species is expected to follow the same decomposition path. 


Quick Question for Someone???


There has been talk of the instability of 4-HO-Tryptamine freebases, and allusions to proper storage conditions. Can someone Please link me to a thread that details how to store 4-HO-Tryptamine bases for long-term (year)?? I have some of this and am now so worried that it will decompose, leaving us with nothing! Thanks for any info.

Would 4-Ho-MPT freebase really degrade noticeably in a plastic bag rolled up inside an airtight dark container? (not frozen)

I may not be 100 percent correct on this, but wasn't the concern with the 4-ho and 4-aco freebases that it would "degrade" into psilocin?  Wasn't that the issue? I'll be posting my in depth report once I finish writing it, as I completely lost track of everything after about 40 minutes after dosing. It was an amazing experience though, and 20mg absolutely blew my mind.  I studied 4 mg of 4-aco dmt 2 weeks prior, and last tryptamine study was well over a year ago, so the results may vary, but it was very powerful and relatively short lived compared to other tryptamines, as I initiated at 2:15 and was pretty much back to baseline at 6, but it was mind blowing.

I wish people would make a habit of including ROI everytime they report a dose, it gets very confusing and a little aggravating to have to ask every time.  Note that with this chem in this thread we have EVERY roi mentioned multiple times.

A couple of months will probably be okay. But I believe that after one year it will definitely have lost potency.


You have to store it in a completely airtight container, in the Refrigerator or freezer. Be sure no moistness can get inside, or form inside your container. it need to be completely dry.

No, sorry. You are thinking of 4-Aco-DMT.

Some people are thinking that some of it will degrade to 4-Ho-DMT.

4-Ho-MPT will most likely just degrade into something inactive.

I took 17 mg of my “replacement sample” orally and within a half an hour was experiencing, shaky hands, increased mucus production in my lungs, reduced typing speed, delay in forming grammatical sentences, body shudders during onset. And of course OEVs (though mild) by 1 hour. In short, all the normal signs for me that weren’t there the last time around. I certainly wouldn’t expect to get full effects at 10 mg oral, maybe more like 30mg, but take your time. About 20 minutes ago I IMd 9mg (freebase dissolved in 5 percent acetic acid).  There’s a definite “uptick” in effects (that is, no substantial tolerance development at 1hr past first dosing, as was proposed earlier.) I’ve taken my shirt off because the onset is getting a bit more intense. OVEs are still not dramatic but are undeniable. It boggles the mind to think I could’ve done 30 mg IM and felt nothing at a similar point last week, let alone polished off 100 mg while doing stats homework and falling asleep without issue with the same material.  But whatever, it undeniably works for me with this batch, whatever the explanation, and at less than 1/3 of last weeks total dose).  Yeah, this travesty of language took me twenty minutes to write…  I don’t think I’ll report on any more qualitative effects at this point.  I’ll save it for a “clean” trial at some point in the future.

Yeah, same really little white baggie. Dissolved in vinegar like last time, but of course what tryptamine wouldn't? Looks aren't much to go on when they all look the same.  


I'm getting some  "feathered serpent" knot-work as part of the CEVs. Of the other 4-subs I've tried -- dmt, mipt, and dpt -- it reminds me most of 4-ho-DPT in its aesthetic and feel. I'm sporting a permagrin, though not one as intense as that of its brethren (granted, this isn't a fair trial given the context). I'll probably do 25 mg IM at once next time to feel it bite me good, but not for a few months at least.

Well its good to hear the noted action. Sounds like you got the same stuff too (which doesn't help the confusion). I just got some of their dpt, and it is tanner/off-white in color and is very fluffy & powdery in comparison.

Yes, I also got some of their DPT (given to me to compare). It has a slightly pinkish/tan hue in direct comparison to the whiter 4-ho-MPT. I don't trust my memory to judge whether last week's solitary baggie had a slight hue or not reliably. Looking over the doses mentioned by others since last week, with some experiencing "ego-shattering" effects at 20 mg, I have to say I certainly do not find it overwhelming even at 17 mg oral and 9 mg IM an hour later.  I was maybe at a high plus two at the height of it (I could be in public and have generic conversation without arousing suspicions if I had to). The effects are undeniable, but I do seem to have some innate tolerance to it over others (odd, as my reactions to other 4-subs are normal). Not enough, mind you, that I could do second-level stats homework and type incredulous posts on 100 mg though various ROAs over 3 hours or so and then go to bed an hour after the last dose of it as I did last week if indeed I had the equivalent material.  I'd love to believe I could suppress such a thing so nonchalantly, as it would've gotten me out of many psychedelic binds in the past, and undoubtedly many more to come!

psood0nym. I am sure you are a much more experienced "hard core" tripper than anyone else in this thread.

I have read some of your trip reports (IM ketamine+4-ho-dmt was a really nice one ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)) The more strong trips you take, the more jaded you become. And also the more you expect from a compound.


The effects of drugs are very subjective, and we have only words to express to others how they feel to us. And words are really a poor medium. 


What does "ego-shattering" mean? Being a little out of it? unable to communicate with your surrounding? or lost in a dreamy state of well being? Or does it mean to no longer exist at all? to then be reborn. 


People put different meanings unto words.


There´s been remarkably few comparisons of 4-ho-mpt to other tryptamines in this thread. I am still not sure if I want to fork out $ for this.

What does it have to offer that other tryptamines don´t have? what´s unique about it?

I´ll not be getting something just because it´s a rare novelty. I am over that stage.

^I guess I just mean I tend to get all the overt signs of tripping at normal dosages and don't have physical tolerance. But I see what you're saying from a psychological perspective. After so much tearing down and rebuilding over the years I suppose the souls of a lot of us older folk are sitting pretty in big brick shit houses of egos.


Again, last night's experienced was tainted, so take this with a sack of salt, but there did seem to be some experiential novelty to it. I don't think it a mere collector's fetish item.  4-ho-DPT is, like DPT, pretty unique, and it seemed closest to that, but with a sharper, more metallic, and grating edge to the stimulation (cannabis dulled it a bit, though, thankfully). However, at first glance it doesn't appear to have half the verve of either of those compounds. 


I kept seeing serpents with the heads of eagles tangling themselves around involuted organic armors and finely crested shields. Though beautiful, the scenes were dim and devoid of the synesthetic air of sensuality that creatures like these usually inspire. On further reflection, though, such images may have been subconsciously projected metaphors for resistance to the trip; I mostly just took the drug to help satisfy the contentions of this thread rather than because I felt called to its experience, as is my standard motivation.

Finally ran a trial on the sample I received, and it was an awesome time. I had already dosed 220mg Methylone orally and 7.5mg of Methoxetamine about an hour and a half earlier, but I was sure they wouldn't cause tolerance towards it (Based on very little knowledge). I loaded up 5mg for my partner and then 5mg for me (Vaped off tinfoil). The effects were instantaneous, I felt a body buzz similar to DPT, I felt alive and instantly the patterning on the bed and curtains began rolling and swirling around. I felt the effects weren't outstanding (We both tripped 2cE+LSD+Methylone+DPT the weekend prior) so we both vaped another 5mg, and laid down on a bed, threw on black eyed peas, turned on a whole buncha flashing lights and and some fun for like an hour and a half. The tracers were outstanding, and when we'd hit nitrous it was almost unbearably good, like we couldn't even fucking move good.


I plan on breaking from psys for a week and a half to two and then dosing 20-30mg orally, but vaping it was AWESOME, I've only vaped DMT and 5-MeO-DMT so vaping a tryptamine that doesn't just rape my mind totally was very novel. I got to a ++ in about 2 minutes, I see the appeal of all those IV and IM trip reports with hallucinogenic drugs.

Vaping tiny little 2-5mg bumps of 5-meo-mipt is also nice.  Just several grains really.  Amazing how little is effective.


And yes, most tryptamines do taste like ass.  4-aco-dipt has got to be one of the most disgusting bitter molecules on earth but I sure do love its effects.

Hahahaha, yeah I'll second this.  This chemical is truly gnarly on the ol' tastebuds.  I remember once my buddy was looking at my sealed ziploc bag of it, but there must have still been a little tiny tiny bit of powder stuck to the plastic outside of the seal, and before he handed it back to me he flicked the bag really hard with his fingers and the tiniest little puff of 4-aco-dipt managed to find its way onto his lips and even that made him cringe, but it was hilarious.  He didn't just cringe, he was like "bllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrg!!!!!!!!" with a totally shrivelled up face.  I've tasted it myself, and I would compare the taste of 4-aco-dipt to be akin to that of super duper ultra concentrated bitterness unlike that of anything else that you can even imagine, and there are undertones of dump smell and garbage juice and general lingering awfulness.  Put this one in a gel cap folks.

So just how instantaneous are the effects when it gets vaped? 

I realize the definition of instantaneous, but is it actually instant or is it like a salvia 45 second thing or is it more like a 5 minute countdown til blastoff?


And for those that have tried both ROA's, would you rather recommend vaping or oral as the more comfortable/enjoyable method?

this one's starting to look pretty interesting.  Are you guys smoking the base or the salt?

I've never tried 4-ho-dmt powder but i've tried 4-aco-dmt, and it was more visual then any of my 4-aco-dmt trips at the same dose.  The visuals we're nice, text on my macbook started to melt down the screen, something i've never seen except on lsd and doc.  It was one hell of a mind fuck for me.  I walked to my bathroom which is right across the hall, and had to think about where my room was (or who i was). ((loss of ego for the older dudes with brick shithouses of egos)).  I think i allowed the chemical to tear my mind apart, as the quickness of the comeup brang on a good bit of anxiety.  ("this is a new chemical... omg... i only took it 15 minutes ago? wow i am fucked up... whoa! 30 minutes in WTF!!! WHY DID SHULGIN ONLY TRY 8mg!!AHH!" know what i mean?)  


At 20mgs ingested it was both more mental and visual for me then 4-aco-dmt at 25mgs, but was also shorter lived.  It was amazing though, possibly my favorite.

psood, you're right i can't PM you back, you could've just posted this on the board.  But yes, obviously i meant to compare it to something other then itself, as seeing i was talking about 4-ho-mpt being compared to 4-aco-dmt.  i represented (the topic of the board we're in - 4-ho-mpt) by using a simple ' it '.  i was replying to a poster asking if anyone can compare it to 4-ho-DMT or 4-aco-dmt.   Thanks for looking out though, perhaps i should have been watching my run-on sentences.

Heh, I just want to do what I can to make sure anything so (is this really pretentious?) important as a report of a novel psychedelic is understood accurately. 


To answer the question in question though, I can't compare it to 4-AcO-DMT except in the broadest terms.  I would compare it more to DPT, or, more precisely, to 4-ho-DPT (see above).  I think most can expect less of a mind fuck than 4-AcO-DMT, but  also that some might find themselves appreciating something in 4-ho-MPT that they never expected. In my experience this appreciation takes the form of a highly ethereal aesthetic.

I dosed 4-HO-MPT for the first time tonight, just 14mg to test the waters after a tiny .5mg allergy test. I definitely feel *something*, but I have no distinct visuals closed or open eye, and not much of a body high. My thinking has been very associative though.

Thats odd, I would expect 14 mg to be a decently strong dose if 20 mg is "ego shattering"

I needed 17 mg oral to feel it in my body, and then I was still motivated to use 9 mg intramuscularly to get some idea of 4-ho-MPT's character beyond the vague stimulation. Though I experienced open and closed eye visuals, they weren't all that lively.  And at that dose it was still underwhelming. I react within the normal dosage range to every other of the dozen or so psychedelics I've tried except 25C-NBOMe (which I need a slightly higher dose than average to fully appreciate), but this one is odd. I wouldn't be surprised if we eventually hear a lot more reports of people who find it weak in the dosage range reported earlier in this thread (10-15 mg).

I should have noted that I have have always been a hard-head when it comes to serotonergic psychedelics, and on top of that I have a bit of an acquired tolerance. A typical dose of, say, 4-aco-dmt for me would be at least 30mg.

Oh, and just to put in my $0.02 about the vendor, I have always found him very professional in every aspect of the transactions I have had with him, and I wouldn't believe for a second that he would intentionally deliver a bunk product or a product other than what is ordered.

^There's been enough good buzz about it for stocking by some other vendor(s) in the future to be profitable.  There's probably negotiations for its synthesis happening right now.  Hell, said vendor might have already sold off the rest of their stock to another vendor to recoup losses and it could show up again in a week somewhere else. They probably just can't afford the commitment of running a business like that any more, (maybe they got someone pregnant, maybe they have to take care of a move-in parent, who knows?) so they're bailing.  It'll be awhile, but 4-ho-MPT will most likely show up again.

Pure speculation, unfortunately. But there's always a rush to get the thing nobody else has as soon as it's possible to get it made, in some cases even before activity is known or qualitative effects have been reported. Now testimonials exist, there's been sudden availability vacuum,  and the first vendor to get a legally quite safe (comparatively) product again is guaranteed to sell a lot of it to people wanting more who find themselves suddenly short their source and to others who were going to try but didn't act fast enough.

The question still remains, should I convert this into a salt? (specifically HCl, by mixing it stoichiometricaly with mildly acidic, say ph 3, water).

You know the answer, if you wanna store any tryptamine, (no matter how atmospherically stable they claim it is) you should have it in salt form versus freebase.

Do you think that 4-ho-dpt.hcl would crystallize if the water solution it was in evaporated? 


If I have to leave it in solution, that really isn't an option for me and I would instead just stick the freebase in a sealed container in the freezer.

Is it possible that law enforcement or the DEA was closing in on the vendor?  Someone I know received an order from him with a big question mark drawn on the envelope, and my last order I didn't receive at all (probably just got lost in the mail, but now I have to be paranoid).

Perhaps, he hadn't been around for long though so I would be kind of surprised if they closed in on him that fast, considering their are other vendors that have been around for years.

Yeah it did.  He said he sent a reshipment for my order, so I guess it would be strange if he did that when he thought he was about to be caught.

offer them a drink and secretly dose them with 100mg 4-ho-mpt.


I think this guy closing down has to do with him offering 4-aco-DMT.

It's clearly over a legal line, being just an ester of psilocin.


apparently a few other US based folks closed down recently as well, which also offered the 4-aco.


Operation web tryp here we come!

(mods please feel free to edit this post if crosses vender discussion lines) very interesting... another US vender that was selling 4-aco-dmt website went off line within the last month as well.. but they sent a newsletter out saying they would be back.. Probably just coincidence but very interesting... 


honestly I really doubt anybody was shut down by the DEA or something like that, or that these problems are related to the RC scene. My first thought, was that he suffered a fate similar to many vendors over the years, that is to say that he was busted for illegel drugs unrelated to his RC business. Maybe not but just a gut feeling I got.

Mainly I'm just paranoid.  I think that rationally speaking there is little chance of legal repercussions affecting me, but because I didn't receive a very recent shipment and now he is shut down all of a sudden, I am filled with paranoia and speculation about what might have happened.

Yea, I think its pretty rude of him to just BLINK vanish into thin air.  He AT LEAST owes it to anyone whose address he mailed anything to a slightly more complete explanation of what approximately happened.


Actually, he should just SAY WHAT HAPPENED, and let his RECIPIENTS (yes even of only free samples) DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES what level of risk this puts them at.


Dude if you are reading this, you are SERIOUSLY generating BAD KARMA by not at least INFORMING ALL MAILING RECIPIENTS, or making a public comment here (from an anon email) or at your former site URL as to WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED!!!

This is extremely strange.


I ordered 4-ho-mpt from him on Jan 31st, but never recieved it.


He sent a reshipment one week ago, which arrived today and included 4-ho-mpt, and also a sample of DOC-NBOMe, which he never mentioned...

concerning why the vendor stopped selling--my guess is that he's already made so much money from his business that he doesn't see a point in continuing at the moment.


idk if this is too close to price discussion, but i did the math looking at both "small time" vendors like this guy, and bulk vendors... and *snip* is probably making close to $100 profit per gram that he sells.  that's so much money.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

LUCKY!


He handed out a couple of those free samples ages ago... right around the time the DOC synth failed.

I bet he just saved a little bit of it and realized he didn't need it any more and hooked it up

Points to take away

- DOx-NBOMe appears to be 10x less potent then DOx

- I believe oral ROA doesn't work (at least it doesn't for 2C-x-NBOMe), however I would start pretty damn low, maybe 100 mcg, just in case.

got to try this one out last night, since so little is known about this chemical decided to write a realtime report.


9:00 (t0:00): Ingest 4-ho-mpt -- 15 mg in a parachute.


9:20 (t0:20): The same vague tryptamine buzz that has been present since I first took this substance is growing.


9:30 (t0:30): Some yawning now, body buzz rising, very mild nausea and very mild visuals.


9:45 (t0:45): Definite ++, unmistakeable visual distortions, and am shivering and feeling cold so a blanket is required.


10:05 (t1:05): Still rising, but still just at a ++, considering smoking some buds but I may wait a little while so i can get as clear of a picture of what this 4-ho-mpt is doing to me as I can.


10:30 (t1:30): Adding cannabis into mix did pretty much what i knew it would, a noticeable increase in effects, and I decide to put a dvd of Phish's clifford ball on. A decent trip, but I would say at this dose, for me, a +++ is impossible and one can't help but notice the most obvious effects of the visual display only came about after adding the buds into the mix.


11:05 (2:05): Almost forgot to update. I thought the trip was dropping off a minute ago but after finishing another bowl I'm as high as I've been all night. Visuals pretty nice for this dose I think, but I got to say, I dont have enough experience with tryptamines to say what this chemicals visuals are, but I have enough experience to say what they arn't and thats 4-ho/po/aco-dmt. Definitely its own distinctive beast.


11:30 (t2:30): I do believe things seemed to have peaked and may be showing there first signs of dying back.


11:45 (t2:45): After finishing another bowl I'd say suspicions are confirmed and I'm definitely coming down.


12:30 (t3:30): Not all the way down but largely there.


1:30 (t4:30): Down


Thoughts: Very interesting chemical, short but sweet, distinct enough to me from psilocybin to make it worth exploring but I am not sure how different it would be then 4-sub.-mipt and can't comment on that because I have not yet tried the latter

sweet! 


captain, do you have any tolerance or in general need to take more? 


or if anyone else can answer, for a 130 lb person would 17 mg be a +++?

Admist a dream... 25mgs placed in a parachute produced remarkable results. 


Beautiful flowing oev's, euphoria and a thirst for the erotic. It blows my mind that some are saying this is inactive, it's a gem in my cat's eye. The come-up was fast with this one, felt alerts within 15 minutes or so and was "there" completely within 45 minutes. The visuals were consuming my entire surrounding's at some points, and I felt a connectedness to the universe that was just astounding. It set my mind on a train of thought where I was able to connect all the dot's to questions that I've been pondering recently, which I was unable to find the answers beforehand. 


It's peak was stunning, and it seemed like our [Magic man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa-rhL_n4yE) wrote this song for my trip. 


Was back to baseline within 5 hours, but the smiles lasted all day long.   ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

With 16 mg. A took about the same, M took a teeny bit more. 


	At 6.30 we took our gel caps in my house. My sis came and talked to us for a little bit and 20 minutes later we took a walk outside. It was cold but not bad. I expected to be feeling it a bit by now, since usually I’m quickly affected by tryptamines. Within 5 minutes I was starting to feel it. There was a lack of the chilled feeling I get from shrooms and 4-Aco-DMT. It was a bit more spacey, chill, and euphoric, no nervousness or anything like that, no sitting back and waiting for it to hit. It just slowly crept up to me and within 40 minutes of dosing I was pretty close to peaking. We kept on walking and made it to the beach, where we sat around for a while. Everything was moving, but not necessarily breathing. The woodchips on the ground morphed into leaves and the trees shifted about. Talking was very hard. We all noticed we were laughing and smiling tons. I was feeling rather tingly and removed from my body. 


	I felt very confused; paradoxically I was both quite cold and yet oddly warm. I was a bit happy but often times thinking about sad things. Thoughts made sense but didn’t. I was in a similar mind space to shrooms and 4-Aco-DMT but my thoughts had much less meaning. After a little while we started walking back, we knew we were cold even though we didn’t really care. We stared at a wall for a little while and it didn’t swirl or breathe, the texture just became shapes, specifically little gnome like creatures. M mentioned he was seeing textures he felt, but A and I didn’t have that. Walking past people was a bit weird, for we knew if we looked at them we would stare and search their thoughts and minds. 


	About an hour and half after dosing my visuals were significantly less pronounced, still noticeable but not all that strong. I started thinking about how fortunate I am, and was focused on this for a while. We went into my house and talked for a little while, M was still tripping pretty hard but A and I were definitely coming down. I was surprised by this but wasn’t going to complain. My visuals were all gone after two hours and the trippy thoughts tapered to an end after another two hours. 


	Overall it was an enjoyable experience but not particularly meaningful. While it had a similar head space to shrooms and 4-Aco-DMT nothing meaningful came of the thoughts I was having, it was lacking in depth. The visuals were greater than what I’ve experienced from 4-Aco-DMT and different from shrooms in the way they didn’t breathe, they moved in other ways. There was significantly less euphoria from this than the other previously mentioned substances. Coming down made me feel a bit empty. I was also very surprised by the short duration, only tripping hard for one and a half hours. M tripped a little while longer than A or I, but he did take a teeny bit more. On another note, I think that 3 is a hard number to trip with. It loses the intimate connection one makes with 2 and doesn’t have the group mentality of 4 or more.

^swell report.


So i don't really know what to say with this one. 

At 10:00 pm I took a ~20mg parachute swigged down with grapefruit juice and ginger extract 

to help any future nausea. 


I meditated giddily and realized i was way too excited about the upcoming trip to fully relax.

I compensated by reading the last chapter of a book i had been reading which took about 20 minutes. Still no signs yet.


I put on the psychedelic avenger's CD; and went downstairs to brew up a cup of echinacea tea.

By the time i had finished my tea, aprox 40 minutes had gone by. Still no signs.

Other's had reported peaking in 45 so i concluded that this is strange.


At the 50 minute mark, I rolled a joint of rasberry leaves for a smoke, and put about 5mg of the mpt in the end/middle of the cig. I smoked it outside in the snow in my socks and yes for some reason my feet couldn't/didn't really care or feel the snow at all. Smoking the cig felt great, but i still had the exact same sober headspace as before.


I go back upstairs and start focusing on stuff to see if the little bit of nothings i feel is just placebo or i am somehow just at a threshold dose still. (one hour after ingestion.)  To my surprise when i glare around my room; the door, windows etc seem to barely be floating and changing dimensions and shapes very slowly if i focus. I seem to play this off by saying i could to that by relaxing my eyes when i'm sober so it still might be placebo?


I'm very confused because my headspace is exactly the same as normal. I proceed to smoke another 3mg hit, followed shortly by another 6 mg hit.  Thing's seem different, maybe,

but i seriously couldn't tell if there was any tryptamine in my system except for when focusing hard for long periods of time on snow/etc. Music is really awesome, but i've also never listened to this CD before and it is extremely strange german space music.


I continued until 2;00 in the morning trying to get some sort of trip out of this stuff. I repeatedly smoke 5mg rips until my 50mg was all gone. On one of the middle ones a took a bigger dose than normal i think; and all of the sudden the wall in front of me started morphing and swirling intensly, as well as the drawings on my wall....but only for all of 2 minutes. Even with these strange visuals there was never once any real head change at all. 

I gave up and took a whippet optimistically to see if that would make the trip kick in,

but alas, no dice.


I then spent the rest of the night trying to fall asleep, which was extremely hard to do. I finally fell asleep around 5:00 in the morning which shows that this stuff is active, but very very degraded.


All in All:  My Batch has obviously degraded somehow, but i managed to get visuals for 2 minutes at a time or less, immediately following tokes if i held them in for long periods of time.


I am very disappointed in this; I was looking for a spiritual experience, and never once got anything close to that or any head space change.  It left me feeling empty because I just smoked a bunch of white powder that really didn't do much to me besides leave me with a headache and insomnia.


I has figured 3 weeks in a dark container locked in another dark container would have been fine,

but obviously this one needs to be frozen or refrigerated.


I'm tempted to get more to really see what this chem has to offer, but then again, it's extremely unstable in it's freebase form, it's the only tryptamine that has ever left me with a headache,

and it actually left me feeling empty. The only interesting thing about this one was the fact that i had a few full on hallucinations whilst still being completely sober...It left me with this strange feeling that it was placebo but such visuals just couldn't be.


less than a + for me at 50mg (throughout the night); anyone else have similar experiences with smoking this freebase? short hallucinations with no head change?

^ Thanks. 


It does sound like your batch degraded, which is a bummer. I agree that it made me feel a bit empty, not really sure if its worth while to explore much further considering the fact that lots of any given batch will degrade and 4-Aco-DMT is much more meaningful to me. 


How did you vape this one?

I have never tried this one before, so i was expecting good thing's from you're guys reports.

Also, I hadn't done any sort of psychedelic in over a month so i don't think there's a tolerance.


At one point i proclaimed:

"well this is an awesome drug. Visuals with no 'trip' whatsoever."

But i was ready for a trip and i wanted a trip so then i took back that statement.

Plus the visuals were extremely short-lived following mpt tokes.


This may come into play: I didn't vape it with a real vape, I simply loaded a bowl with raspberry leaves and vaped the mpt off the top of the leaves with a normal lighter. You think that matters?

It shouldn't though becuase those hits were when i felt it most,

and the 20mg oral parachute did jack diddly


EDIT: I agree shishigami, 4-aco-dmt is much more meaningful. It actually feels exactly like normal mushrooms to me. I kept expecting some sort of mushroom-similiar headspace and there was no such thing on the mpt.

^ 

4-Aco-DMT is the same has the same mindspace as shrooms for me except I find it lacking in visuals. Not the biggest deal. 4-HO-MPT on the other hand, just wasn't deep. It felt very shallow but it had lots of visuals.

I'm curious as to the other people who have smoked the freebase...

How long did it last for you?

what's the correct technique? just vaping it off of inert plant matter with a normal lighter only produced short visual distortions that quickly tapered off... then again my product was degraded.

Well, your personal experience differs greatly from that of the vast majority of users of this substance. In fact, it seems that everyone but you has noted at least some similarity between the two chemicals, which is to be expected considering that both 4-AcO-DMT and 4-PO-DMT are believed to at least partially metabolize into 4-OH-DMT, which is also present in "psyhilocybin mushrooms".

I put 70mg in a homemade freebase pipe, and shared it between four people. I think I probably got about 20-25mg myself. The visual effects were very noticeable during the peak (which was quite short), and I felt warm and empathetic and awesome for the duration of the experience. The effects had abated completely by T+3h.

Unless you convert it to the hydrochloride (or hydrobromide?) salt, it will likely degrade somewhat unless it is stored in a vacuum (and not a vacuum cleaner either).

Having tried 4-OH-MPT oral, rectal, and vaporized, I would say that vaporization produces the most desirable effects in the lowest dosages, but also easily has the shortest duration. Oral was actually a little underwhelming even at 30mg; rectal works somewhat better.


The dosage range I tried for each ROA were as follows:


Oral: 14mg - 30mg

Rectal: 20mg

Vaporized: ~5mg - ~25mg

For the oral route I put a measured amount in a gelcap and then swallowed it. Rectal I would assume to be a solution shot up with a syringe.

25mg is a tiny amount, whyt the hell mess with parachutes or caps?  Just dump it on the back of your tongue and have a sweet drink at the ready to gulp.  I even do that with 180 mg of methylone.  Unless you are REALLY sensitive to taste.  I *DO* use caps when taking 4-aco-dipt though... man that is some of the most bitter lingering horrible tasting stuff in existence!

i prefer to cap everything, i've yet to come across a good tasting chemical, ha.  I mean, some are tolerable, but why taste it if you don't have to.


I do agree with dwayne about 4-AcO-DiPT... man that stuff was particularly foul.  I discovered this after i'd snorted some and couldn't get the taste/smell to go away for some time... very unpleasant.  bleckh


And how well does 4-HO-MPT vape?  Is it really easy to burn or do you have some leeway between the melting point & vaporization point?

I've never written up a trip report or anything like that before. Nothing all that interesting happened, but, since there isn't much info on this chem, I figured I'd put this out there for everyone to read.


The other night I dosed ~50mg of 4-ho-mpt. The first ~2 hours involved awesome visuals and a huge increase in sociability and a corresponding decrease in inhibitions. It was shortly after that point that I began to suffer from heart palpitations, muscle pain, difficulty breathing, and severe tightness in my chest. This went on for a few hours. These negative effects came in waves. During the peaks I was essentially incapable of doing anything other than sitting very still and trying to relax my body as best as possible. After these effects receded (for the most part anyway) I continued to trip hard for about another two hours, with effects tapering off after that for about another 2 until I passed out at my laptop. I noticed that i still had mild visuals throughout all of the next day (I dosed at ~1:30 in the morning). For a couple days after I noticed i was prone to breaking into maniacal laughter for no reason, repeating random phrases in a sing-song kind of way without really meaning to, hearing/feeling/seeing things that weren't there, etc... Over all I'd say that this is a very interesting chemical with great potential for socializing and even therapy. It is, however, sadly lacking in terms of "mindfuck" so to say. I do intend to take this chemical again although probably not at such a high dose. I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in a social psy without much insight (although I do think it could be great for that if you pushed for some in a conversation with someone else). If anyone plans on experimenting with higher doses I'd recommend you be somewhat careful. The physiological effects can be somewhat unpleasant. Oh! This chem doesn't taste bad at all! I was beginning to think that every psy had a horrible taste.

Ah, but the sensual effects are particularly delicious! (That is if you choose to exploit them... if you dont its probably just a feeling of unfulfilled agitation and uncentered unease... the trick is to CENTER and FULFILL that agitation on sex, THEN its magic is revealed).

Having just finished the last of my 4-HO-MPT over the weekend, I am inclined say that this substance is one of the most fun and euphoric tryptamines I have ever had the pleasure of using. I think I actually like it better than 4-AcO-DMT, 5-Meo-MiPT, and 4-Aco-DiPT, although I have great fondness for each of these wonderful drugs, and each has its pros over the other two for different reasons. But if I had to pick one of the four as a favorite, it would probably be 4-HO-MPT, at least in the freebase form, which is particularly special when used in the incredibly pleasant vaporized/inhaled ROA.

My first oral run with the stuff went amazingly well. Wonderful cascade of conceptual and healing archetypes and themes channeled through the electric guitar, searching for the girl I love with paint and canvas, vaguely lysergic visuals and sensual erotic pull to everything.


Residual insomnia is a bit long with a drained feeling, but well worth it imo.

fair enough.  though i do usually put the extremely low dose tests i do with each chemical (<1mg, 2mg, 5mg) directly in my mouth.  With those small amounts its usually not too bad, still rarely have the desire to taste any more though, ha.

I hope we see an uptick in TRs for this compound, I know some BLers had to pick up a g or two recently. 


I am very interested in this compound due to the vape ROA that so many report being pleasant, but I am terrified I'd only get to use it twice before the rest of it degraded.

Just wanted to throw a quick report up here.


My girl and I each had ~12mg 4-HO-MPT along with 380mg piracetam, some beer, and weed. Taken at appx 8PM on July 2. Good ++ but open eye visuals were not very prominent. We were on the Oregon beach watching fireworks. Got some tracers but nothing like 2C-I can do. Closed eye visuals when I kissed my sweetie were much more impressive, swirling fractals with prominent hues of orange, red, and purple (may have been influenced by our campfire). Body high somewhat buzzing and energetic, could be good for erotic (didn't get a chance to test). Didn't really get a chance to test music appreciation either.


Very excited to see what is possible at 16mg.


For comparison, 14mg of 4-AcO-DMT gives me moderate swirly/shroomy OEV, and CEV is dominated by brown, green, yellow if i recall correctly, and body high seemed more "wet" and "alien" like shrooms.

Well I'll be gobsmacked... going thru a box of misc supplements, old script bottles, OTC meds and other psudo-pharmacological mish mash (admit it you have one too? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ) found a folded up short envelope from a very "middle" US state sent Feb 10 containing a plain piece of white paper folded in half to which was taped a sachet of white powder, below "50 mg" and the long name of this chem, inside of the MSDS.


Forgot I had gotten this, dont even recall from whom, vendor or friend.


***So.... what to do, what to do?***


I am leaning towards 25mg oral dose ala Carver Slice above (I like his trip report the best I guess)?  *"For a Holiday"* as the famous Huxely quote about Soma goes?  Less sounds a like a bit of a prick-tease, haha.


Or perhaps best put to use vaporizing 5-10mg for 10-5 uses instead of just 2, maybe after some methylone sinks in.  I like 4-aco-dipt as a PS to M1 and some were comparing this to 4-ho-dipt, so this could be pretty fun....


Well, just musing.  Guessing this material was some one-off synth by request and wondering how best to exploit these few grains of something I will probably never see again.

if i ever stumble across this stuff i am going to try vaporizing, as i have heard from several people that that ROA is pretty excellent.  25mg is probably a good oral dose, people in this thread were dosing sorta low for the most part IMO.


its been awhile since i took this, but the main thing that stands out in my memory is the comeup... absolutely no position i can get in is comfortable while coming up on this stuff, and the comeup starts in like 10minutes when taken orally.  the comeup resolves itself fairly quickly though.

Recent vaporizing attempts proved successful, even after just sitting in the original mini-baggy packaging for roughly 9 months.(Room temp)


Seems it could be more stable than previously thought? There was a small oxygen-absorber packet near the packaging the entire time.


Very visual chem indeed. I would be interested in the hcl or fumerate if ever such a strange chem hits the market again.

Cool. Is it from a batch you've had stored for a bit?

have some from the initial give away that's been stored in an lite-less air tight place, is as good as when arrived. actually plan on taking some tomorrow hence why I am reading this thread. Only have like 10 mg left so I am definitely going rectal. Anyone got any experience?

10mg rectal might be just about right.  never done rectal, but 10mg oral was too low.  shouldn't be overwhelming by any means, but the comeup on this stuff was always jittery for me at any dose.

Forgot about this post from a minute back. I went ahead and went ahead with the trial, here are the vague water spilled notes I can find.


6:40 - 10 mg of 4-ho-MPT administered rectally.


6:53 - still not feeling it much, gonna smoke a bowl.


7:00 - at a plus two


7:05 - Head pretty fucked, as in intoxicated, though its euphoric and has that feel of splitting open and melting as they say.


Definitely works its way into your mind.


7:20  - Visuals are finally coming along, making themselves distinct. I'm going to smoke another bowl.


8:00 - Add 300 mcg of 25c insuff. Comes on quickly and the visual display and body high kicks up a notch as well as the trip in general.


9:00 - 10 mg of 2c-i added rectally. Phenthylamine and tryptamine visual displays mix to perform fireworks in my eyes.


It was around this point I spilled water on my notes. Was just far to intoxicated. At 12:05 I insuff 700 mcg of 25n-nbome which really is underestimated for combos. But this was a great trip really helped get me back into more exploring the more hedonistic pleasures of the psychedelic realms

I would guess that the acetoxy version 4-AcO-MPT would be nicer and longer acting (but I usually always prefer the aco).  It seems it would be worth getting synthesized, also there are still unexplored tryptamines like 4-AcO-EPT or EiPT, or even PiPT.  I used to see reports by one person on lycaeum for 5-MeO-EiPT.

This is an interesting thread, a lot of good information in here. I think this may be the next thing that I try, so I thought I'd bump this. Has anyone used this one lately? There's one sort of scary report here of breathing problems and such on 50 mg, but I read elsewhere about people taking that amount or more without the same issues. I was thinking about starting at about 25 mg anyway, but was just wondering if any more knowledge had surfaced about this one. I also read that a lot of people who've tried it have compared it visually to 4-HO-MET.... If that is the case then I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what it can do. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i only had like 100mg of this stuff to work with, so i don't remember it too well / can't describe it too much.  i split it into four doses that were all between 20-30mg (volumentric measurement, i just don't remember the exact doses anymore.  definitely didn't go over 30mg)


what i do clearly remember, though, is how intense the initial comeup is, and how quickly it hits.  it didn't feel dangerous to me, but there is definitely quite a bit of physical energy that needs to be worked through on the comeup of this one.  i took it orally, and i was feeling it pretty strongly within 15 minutes.  i could barely keep my legs/feet still.  i can definitely see how someone taking 50mg without being prepared for the intensity of the comeup could end up hyperventilating and having problems breathing.


you know, i never tried it at the time, but with that weird physical push, i feel like this stuff might be best taken slightly spaced out (i.e. space your dose out in tiny increments over the course of a half hour or so).  it would help smooth that comeup, and should still hit that super euphoric plateau that comes a bit later (i usually hit the chill plateau a bit over an hour after dosing if memory serves...)

Thanks for the response! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


That makes sense with the come up feeling, as I get the same kind of thing on most 4-substituted tryptamines and especially 4-HO-MET. I haven't ever actually taken a tryptamine by spacing out the doses, but I have taken LSD that way and did definitely find it to make the ride up much smoother and more relaxed, like the initial build-up still doesn't really stretch beyond the first dose. I bet it could work in this instance too!


I have enough of it to work with that I should be able to get a pretty good feel for it. Unfortunately it was not stored in the best conditions before reaching me and it has turned just slightly beige, but I'm hoping it's not enough to make a difference. I've had other tryptamines be this color before without it being a problem.

I hear that this particular lesser-known tryptamine might just be hitting the market again soon! So, in order to drum up some (premature) hype, here are the only two reports for 4-HO-MPT posted on Bluelight to date, some promising accounts written by Kaleida:

I've tried it a few times, but never wrote a report because it didn't stand out, but I was taking it while hanging out with friends and playing music so those aren't the best trips to write about.  I can't remember, I may have a dose left, otherwise I plan to get more, I really liked it, it was the most similar in visuals and effects to LSD of any tryptamine I've tried, very dissimilar from mushrooms.

Thanks for reminding me I've got 500mg of this to experiment. Tried 20mg only once mixed with 2-oxo-pce and I enjoyed it a lot, though it didn't felt as visual as my favourite tryptamine 4-ho-met

Rereading this thread again, about 95% is arguing with a psoodonym and speculation about a vendor's sudden closure.  


Does anyone want to volunteer comparisons to other tryptamines?  Or if it doesn't stand out, that works too.


I guess my question is about any subjective trends in the 4-subs, from tiny N-groups to bulkier ones.

4-HO-MPT is great stuff, powerful in the mind, gentle, short-acting, similarities to LSD for me but so much shorter.

I have used mushrooms, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-DET, 4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-EPT, 4-HO-DPT, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-HO-McPT, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-MET, 4-AcO-DET, 4-AcO-MALT, and 4-AcO-DALT, speaking specifically about 4-substituted tryptamines. 4-HO-MPT is my favorite of them so far, without even the slightest bit of doubt. It actually honestly competes with LSD for the spot of my favorite psychedelic period.


It would take quite a while to write out every one of my thoughts about this.... I don't suppose you'd be willing to tell me which ones you're already familiar with to make things a bit easier?

Wow, thanks that's quite an endorsement.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck with the classics so far, in their natural setting, and LSD.  


So I have a large menu right now, and choices to be made.  I know there's threads about comparisons, but I guess just not a large enough pool of test subjects yet to have a consensus on what might make a tryptamine unique.  An aspect or combination that none of the others have, or rarely have, besides solubility or potency.  About all I've heard that all agree on is the sound distortion unique to the MiPTs, and maybe a sinister note to the unsub DPT. 


And if it's tough to find a unique aspect, there might be trends that become apparent with more inputs.


I'd certainly be willing to collate like two-line reviews for all these tryptamines.

Anyone care to sum up the expierience? Was it like short acting LSD? Was it super funny like shrooms? Or super spiritual material. Lots of Visual or just a little etc. This seems to be a winner along with 4 aco malt. I just can't make up my mind which one I want more.

No problem. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) And ah, gotcha, gotcha....


Heh heh, I hate to tell you, but I don't think there are any completely unique effects between them honestly, it's all just about different ratios. It's actually DiPT that the audio distortion you mention was once thought to be unique to, but I have experienced it on DiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, MiPT, and 4-HO-MiPT, and it's also known to be common on 5-MeO-DiPT, so I increasingly suspect that pretty much any isopropyl could probably produce this effect at the right dose. Likewise, the sinister aspect you mention on DPT also occurs on other tryptamines for me, like 4-HO-DET, 5-MeO-EiPT, and DiPT which I find to all feel uncharacteristically dark in style. Though, furthermore, not even everyone will agree on these aspects.... I know people who don't get audio distortion on MiPT-based drugs, and who find 4-HO-DET very lighthearted and bright, and so on.


I've noticed several trends between all the different tryptamines I've tried, but again, it would take forever to detail them all here. Rather I will ask, what is it in particular that you like the most about the classics?

The ego dissolution, manic confidence, dissociative visions, visual filtering, and long tracers of LSD on top of the lucid stimulation, giggly headspace, complex hallucinations, visual distortions, and mandalas of 4-HO-MET on top of the peaceful satisfaction, sensory overload, and extreme geometric designs alike Alex Grey art of mushrooms, topped off with a spontaneous orgasm from the combination of nitrous oxide. The duration for me is slightly longer than mushrooms but feels more like a compressed LSD trip, with the first few more mental and dissociating hours of LSD being compressed into the first forty-five minutes of 4-HO-MPT, during which the heaviest mushroom-like visuals also occur, followed by a far more lucid, cognitive, and euphoric plateau dominated more so by the LSD-like beautiful neon visions. That's pretty much what it's been like for me so far.


4-AcO-MALT has been fantastic for me so far too, but so far I find it more selective in its effects than 4-HO-MPT, which is much more of a balanced full-spectrum psychedelic for me. I'd personally choose the 4-HO-MPT first if I had to pick between one, but I don't think I'd want to go without either if I could avoid it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well thanks for all that.  I do appreciate it.  And it does sound like a consensus, which is close to impossible sometimes in these threads.


The situation for me is a two week window in which to indulge for the first time in gee, ten years?  Given my life situation, a tryptamine, I feel, is in order (rather than a more sensational research chemical, also considering my current use of a certain stim).  So there's monetary value to consider, there's the chance of a positive experience (rather than a dud or dosing problems or just being alright); a new experience; let's admit we all do like a good fireworks display, so entertainment does play a role; but finally I need a chat pretty bad with the little toadstool man I've met before, or preferably his boss.


So I've been lightly lurking.  This one does and has sounded like a winner for a while now, and I think the fortuitous timing might be a sign.  Hard to ask for more than a good duration, balanced experience at this pricing.  And I may say I desire a difficult experience, but, you know, I don't want to spend the entire time crying, just a portion.


That said, there's something to DPT that calls to me, complete with tricky dosage info and the rec.s for non-oral ROAs.


(I could do both, so it's not a tremendous dilemma; in fact maybe better to try DPT after this, rather than just DPT?)

I'll just quickly point out that nearly ten years ago, our Xorkoth posted this in a tryptamine comparison thread:


> ^^ In my experience, when you've tried a lot of psychedelics and gotten a number of trials under your belt with each, the differences become pretty obvious. Sure, they're all really similar and perhaps even go to the exact same place (I would suspect this is true with tryptamines), sometimes the road to get there is the most important part, and the road to the destination with each substance has its own unique landmarks.

I find that funny because the road I'd take with DPT would be up my butt.  I'll spare y'all the unique landmarks.

Damn I've been here a long time.


I feel like the old part of old greg...


Not the mangina part.  And I'm not so into Bailey's, especially from a shoe.  I also don't enjoy going to clubs where people wee on each other, although to be fair I've never tried it.

I got around to trying 4-HO-MPT today. I took 25mg of the fumarate salt.  It wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be. No ego dissolution, not  much music enhancement, no profound thoughts. The short duration was a  little disappointing. The headspace was intriguing though. Mentally I  felt almost sober, yet the trip had a dreamlike quality. I still felt  like myself, but reality didn't quite feel real. The trip had a  fairy-tale/fantasy vibe. The visuals were decent but short-lived.


It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't anything special. I think  there is potential for it to get really interesting with a higher dose.


I didn't find any aspect of the trip to be particularly LSD-like. It just felt like its own unique thing.

Nice, you're the second person I know now to try it in the last couple days, at about the same dose. I'm pretty happy to see this one making the rounds, thanks for the input. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I can relate to a lot of what you said. My first 25 mg experience was definitely strong in the ego loss kind of way and had my thoughts flying a bit out of control, but aside from that it felt pretty sober and not too euphoric in a sensory enhancing way or anything, but did have the dreamlike quality you mention, it's consistently fairly dissociative for me, and does have that fantasy vibe you mention. It is longer-lasting for me though, I'm surprised that so many people seem to get a short duration; it definitely lasts around four to seven hours for me depending on the dosage so far.


I found the 25 mg dose interesting, but it was the 50 mg that really did it for me; also, the latter was the one that truly felt LSD-like for me, whereas the former felt more similar to 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-DET. The next time I took, at 20 mg which I didn't write a report about, it retained the LSD-like qualities a lot more than the initial lower dose had ever had, but interestingly also felt a bit more psilocin like than either previous trip ever had. It's been a very dynamic drug for me so far....


Not that any of these things necessarily need apply to you of course, just some food for thought. I'll definitely be eager to hear more of your thoughts if/when you go deeper either way. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

There are no certain bests I'm afraid, you're not going to be able to track down the ultimate molecule just by seeing what people have to say about their own experience; each and every molecule will produce unique experiences for each and every person, and the only way to know how something will effect you is to try it yourself. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) What I love and find deeply satisfying, others will find almost useless, and vice versa. I really wanted to love 4-HO-MiPT before trying it because I had multiple friends who claimed it to be one of their favorite psychedelics and produce highly impressive hallucinations, but I've really never been able to get anything too great out of it yet even when it was objectively extremely intense, like 50 mg where the visuals were almost blinding and headspace very deep, but nonetheless it just felt boring and simplistic overall. And yet, MiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT, which many people often claim to not be very psychedelic and some dislike for that reason, are both extremely hallucinogenic for me and some of the best psychedelics I've ever taken for my own chemistry, and definitely far more visual than 4-HO-MiPT.


Drugs are weird like that.... You pretty much just have to be willing to do some trial and error if you really want to find your personal bests. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Oh the will has always been there, and opportunity always groped at, clumsily usually; the means don't  . . . work mixed metaphors well.  


(I figured by delaying as long as possible to avoid awkward delivery-timing, it'd be out of stock anyway.)

Yep, I took 26 mg on Saturday, and your analysis is more or less the same as mine, except I had some additional qualms... As I detailed in the [trip report I posted](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/828663-(4-HO-MPT-26-mg)-First-time-Psychedelic-anaesthesia), I'd love to try it at 50+ mg, but I'm a little worried about the physical issues that might come up with high dosages, because it had a strange and unpleasant anaesthetic numbing and motor paralysis for me.

I also experienced numbness. I wouldn't call it uncomfortable but it is a little odd. It's certainly less desirable than the tactile enhancement most other psychedelics cause. The worst thing about it was that it made playing guitar more difficult than normal.

its so funny to see the differences in what people get out of their trips. 1 on 1 with the right person is certainly a deep and intimate thing that is unrivalled, especially when a high dose of dissociative headspace is involved, but one of my most connected and meaningful trips came from an LSD trio trip. 


on a side note, your description of this substance makes me very interested. an extremely short mushroom headspace without the added (often cumbersome and obstructive) "meaningfulness"? sounds like something i could really use for an analytical therapy session. 


thanks for your report! hard to pick between this and 4-ho-ept... might have to research both ;0)

I tried 4-HO-MPT again, upping my dose to about 40-42 mg. I wasn't too  impressed by it the first time I tried it, and now I've come to the  conclusion that I'm not a fan of it. At this dose, the side effects were  pretty pronounced, and like before, the peak was very short lived. It  has an intense stimmy adrenaline feeling that's kind of overwhelming,  especially during the come up. I did get some pretty good psychedelic  effects for maybe 20 minutes. Open eye visuals were noting special but I  did get some awesome closed eye visuals at one point. Overall the positives didn't outweigh the negatives.


I had high  hopes for 4-HO-MPT because MPT is so good, but the base tryptamines are  all quite different from their 4-HO counterparts. I do find 4-HO-MPT to  be very similar to 4-AcO-DET, but more visual and a little less  mushroom-like. I prefer 4-AcO-DET though. It's deeper and more satisfying, leaving me with a calm afterglow. I didn't really get much out of 4-HO-MPT either time I tried it. I still don't see any similarities between 4-HO-MPT and LSD.

^ Thanks for sharing your experience. I also tried 4-HO-MPT again recently, this time at only 20 mg, and actually enjoyed it quite a bit more than my first trial. I've been meaning to write a trip report on it, but I haven't had much time lately.


4-HO-MPT is a rather unique psychedelic, and I think it's best approached with minimal expectations. When I first tried it, I was expecting it to be a familiar, classical, LSD-like experience, but I was a bit let down. The second time I tried it, I went into it prepared for something totally different, and found it much more interesting.

Awesome, thanks for the update on this one. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It's a shame that this one didn't work out for you in the end, but you can't win 'em all as they say.


I'm quite glad to not get any significant body load from 4-HO-MPT myself, though it does make me a little tense so I can understand how some might. I do also get the adrenaline feeling you describe, and it's actually one of the things that made me love this one so much; I have even gone so far as to refer to it as the cocaine of psychedelics while tripping on it with a friend, though I suppose my opinion on that might be different if I had tried more phenethylamines. There is a short peak for me as well, but I also actually like that because for me pretty much the entire head trip takes place in that short peak and then the rest of the trip is very manic and lucid for several hours, as opposed to something like 4-HO-MiPT where I'm basically sobering up entirely by the time I'm getting out of the really heavily mental phase of tripping.


The corresponding base and 4-substituted tryptamines are definitely quite different from each other, even while sharing a shocking amount of superficial similarities at the same time.... The more of them I try the less I think it's really worthwhile to try to assume much at all about one based on the other, they're all pretty much just their own psychedelics as with anything. I do agree with your comparison between 4-HO-MPT and 4-AcO-DET though, even though oddly the way I find them similar I also find to make them comparable to LSD, though 4-HO-MPT is definitely even more so. The similarities are undeniable to me, but as TheAppleCore says, 4-HO-MPT is just a unique psychedelic like any other too, and I probably oversell the importance of the similarities sometimes just because I'm quick to make those sorts of comparisons and contrasts between different molecules.... It is a lot like LSD for me, but it is a lot its own thing too, and that thing is not interchangeable with LSD or any other psychedelic.

I had finally got around to try this one. As my first trial, I dosed myself with only 18mg of 4-HO-MPT (after an allergy test) and was pleasantly surprised by its activity! :D


I dissolved the powder in an acidic drink for a quicker onset - it was pretty bitter and had a somewhat unpleasant taste, as most tryptamines are. It took about 15 minutes and I started getting dizzy and started getting the effects to kick in. 


The dizziness continued for another 30 minutes and it could have been caused by wavy body feel - I could not connect with my body in a precise manner I usually do, so I lied down. 


At first it felt very similar to 4-Aco-McPT - speedy, a bit disorienting and somewhat messy but interesting nevertheless.


The visuals came in strong and unexpected - as I was laying and looking at the curtains in my bedroom, I started seeing movements, as if there was a wind blowing in and causing the curtains to ripple. After about 5 minutes of watching them I realized there was absolutely no wind in the room and immediately they were blown in ripples again and my field of vision became somewhat unreal and hard to look at so I closed my eyes and was greeted by some expressive abstractions growing there - it was a very interesting theater of emotional melting pictures, I continued watching it for about half an hour.


The process had melted my ego slightly and I was able to see where my self-blocking mechanism was originating, all the way down to my early troubled childhood - it felt great to be able to work it out so easy! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


After about an hour or so into the trip, I got up and felt euphoric and free, drank some juice and got into reading an interesting book. It was producing an interesting immersive effect, just like some BLers mentioned, it felt dreamy and sparkly.


In another hour I was down to baseline with a nice but very mellow afterglow. I felt pretty hungry and food tasted delicious! I went to sleep shortly after and had active dreams.


**Conclusion:**

I liked the short duration - being able to come down by the third hour is useful when trying to relief some work-related stress in between working days. 

It reminded me of 4-Aco-DET as well, just like **cj187** mentioned, but 4-HO-MPT definitely has it's own place on the shelf. No similarities to LSD is noted either, but I can see how the speediness and the initial rush may be interpreted by some as such. Overall, I liked it and looking forward to trying it in higher dosages! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I am tempted to add some 4-HO-MPT during an acid trip and see if there is any synergy. 8)

Inspired by TheAppleCore, I tried a 20mg dose. He had the right idea. Sometimes less is more. It was actually a pretty strong dose. 4-HO-MPT can be really strange and dissociating. I think when I took higher doses before I must have been too delirious to realise how strongly it was affecting me.


At first it felt like I hadn't taken enough, but then I started playing guitar and got really into it. During that part of the trip I started to see why some people say that 4-HO-MPT is like LSD. Then I started to trip harder and couldn't play guitar any more.


Things got very weird and intense. It started to feel less like acid and became really similar to 4-HO-DPT. I felt really dissociated and confused and the adrenaline feeling was really strong and uncomfortable. After maybe an hour of that, I started to come down and was able to enjoy the trip again.


I'm still a little unsure of what I think about 4-HO-MPT. Parts of this trip were really great, but the peak of it was pretty unpleasant. I think I need to go even lower with my dosage. It could become one of my favorite substances. It seems to have great potential for creativity enhancement.

I just completed a 40mg trial of 4-HO-MPT. He are some initial observations on this compound.


The first alert occurred twenty minutes after ingestion. This was followed by a noisy and rapid onset which built to a fairly strong peak less than thirty minutes later. The peak was over twenty minutes after it arrived, which was disappointing, because I would have liked to explore its vertiginous and intriguing headspace in more depth. The plateau lasted about three hours, but it didn't yield insight -- introspection came easily, but answers were nowhere to be found. I attribute this failure to the notably dulled headspace which was now evident. This muddling contrasts sharply with the diamond-like clarity of LSD and other lysergamides that I have tested. Regarding libido, arousal was rather lacking, which is unusual for me while on a psychedelic, but I still came and it was pleasant enough. For the length of the experience, open- and closed-eye visuals were present, and somewhat atypical, but ultimately nothing to write home about. The glide to baseline was perhaps the best part of the trip, as it was particularly smooth and I could "see" how my mind reassembled itself into a coherent and lucid whole. Bodyload was negligible throughout. The duration of the trial was seven hours.


I still have plenty of material to work with and I'll explore it further. For the time being, I'll say that this compound is better than some, but not as good as many.

Thanks for the report, lamanogaucha! Great to see this molecule getting some more attention. Vertiginous is a great word to describe the headspace. It does indeed have a somewhat drunkening, disorienting character.


If you were disappointed by the visuals, you may want to give it another chance. After having numerous experiences with 4-HO-MPT, I now regard its wonderful visuals to be the most salient and impressive feature of the drug. While they're not quite as blatant as those of psychedelics like 4-HO-MET or DMT, I find the way it enhances my perception of the colors, forms, and motion of my environment to be particularly beautiful.

Hey, Apple, thanks for that. I'm by no means done with 4-HO-MPT. My opinion on this compound will probably change over time, possibly for the better. I'll chime in every now and then with more observations.

I recently sent some of what i thought to be 4-HO-MPT to a lab to be analyzed, and preliminary results say to my dissapointment that this was 4-HO-MiPT + some yet unidentified compound.


This came from a reputable Canadian vendor that closed up shop pretty recently, so others with this compound might want to analyze their samples. 


Well, at least it's 4-HO-MiPT and not something completely different, but this could land someone in trouble if they're ordering 4-HO-MPT that is legal in their country and receive illegal 4-HO-MiPT. You can also only guess what the unidentified chem is.

 I was going to ask you/anyone to compare/contrast with 4-ho-mipt, basically the only tryptamine I am familiar with, and my favorite/2nd favorite psychedelic overall.  I’m only experienced with LSD (tied for favorite), miprocin, 2ce, 2cb, and much less so with mushrooms, 4acodmt and N,N-dmt.  

But I saw your comment about not being a fan of miprocin (hard for me to imagine), so while I’m still interested in your opinion, it may not be very relevant to me.

I just found my first source in like a decade so I was getting excited about all these new-to-me tryptamines I could potentially try. On the menu is **4-HO**-MET, -DET, -DPT, -MPT, -EPT; **4-AcO**-DET, -MET, -MiPT; and base tryptamines DPT and EPT


Wrong thread but is 4acomipt any different from 4homipt?


4-ho-Met seems the most popular and recreational one, but I’m kinda intrigued by 4hoMPT or 4hoEPT, even though I basically just started learning about them.


I’m kinda scared to take 4acodmt again after my friend had a seizure type event on it. To be fair it was the night after a daytime lsd trip and drinking lots of whiskey. 4acodmt always gave me the shakes so I feel like I was flirting with a seizure or something since I saw it happen to him.  Miprocin is pretty light hearted, easygoing, and a gently return to baseline.  I’d kinda like something similar to that but different enough to be worth trying instead of just sticking with miprocin.

I don’t have enough experience with the ho to give a definitive comparison, but they are similar. Some have described the aco as more stimulatory and a bit lighter on the headspace, however for me the aco is absolutely perfect. It is my favorite tryptamine these days. When I take it, reality seems everywhere pregnant with itself. Sensual female creativity abound.

4-HO-MET: a deeper, smoother, more sedating and emotional version of 4-AcO-MET's cold, crystal clear eye candy. They're both childlike, but 4-HO-MET is deeper and warmer and more interesting, while 4-AcO-MET is more recreational and refreshing. The internet consensus is that 4-HO-MET is a gem, now supplanting 4-HO-MiPT and 4-AcO-DMT as the internet's favorite 4-sub.


4-xxx-DET: No idea, no internet consensus


4-xxx-DPT: No idea. The internet says that it's shallow and easygoing compared to N,N-DPT. Also a pain in the ass to get the dose right due to inconsistent bioavailability. Some people insufflate it because of this. Tremory/seizurey maybe with some muscle side-effects, although these don't appear to be common side effects. 


4-xxx-EPT: Light, pastel confection. They lie to you, telling me everything is right with the world even when it definitely isn't. They're kind to me, but also not challenging or insightful. 


4-xxx-MiPT: Impossible to classify. Is it primal or cyberpunk digital? Is it rich or thin? Is it alien or organic? I don't know. They definitely make me enjoy things: my body, food, touch, and narrative. I find them recreational and not insightful, but they can really bring attention and emotion to interpersonal relationships, refreshing appreciation for the love you feel for those that are important to you. Sometimes it all goes sideways and you just end up kinda stoned. 


4-xxx-MPT: A warm, gilded relative of 4-xxx-DMT. Baroque and rich, this has depth without being as confronting. It's less harsh, but less earthy and grounded. Is it as honest? That I don't know. Sometimes it whiffs completely and is just a generic, blunting tryptamine like 4-xxx-MALT. 


N,N-DPT: It's had books written about it. It's a mega-classic on par with the classical biggies. It's also pretty polarizing--people love it or hate it. I will likely never take it a second time, but I respect it. Again with the tremors. You may not want to explore this if you are nervous about possible seizures, although it appears to have a pretty good safety record all in all. 


N,N-EPT: The lightest psychedelic that I've ever used that I would still call a psychedelic, and that's when vaporized. Intimidates absolutely no one. Feels lovely in the body. Erotic and gentle. Not very visual at all, and not very insightful. Still very pleasant if you aren't looking to get your world rocked.

It depends on you. It seems like people fall into one of three camps. 

1) All 4 substituted tryptamines are indistinguishable from psilocybin. There's no real difference.

2) 4-substituted tryptamines have individual variation, but there's no difference between hydroxy and acetoxy substitutions at the 2-position.

3) 2) 4-substituted tryptamines have individual variation, and there's a noticeable difference between hydroxy and acetoxy substitutions at the 2-position. This can be potency, duration, or subjective effects. 


This is an oversimplification, of course. I fall into category 3. So far, acetoxy subs have been smoother, lighter, more electric, more stimulating, and more shallow. Hydroxy subs have been foggier, bumpier, more muddled, deeper, less jittery, and more insightful.


This holds true for miprocin and mipracetin. I don't really like miprocin (although I want to.) Mipracetin has all of the benefits of miprocin, but yet it seems thinner and more hollowed out, lacking miprocin's richness. Mipracetin lasts longer for me.

I asked my friend who loves miprocin more than any other psychedelics what they would recommend. They have not tried as many of the four subs as I have. They would recommend mipracetin as a different take on miprocin. If you don't find it any different then well damn, you just got yourself more miprocin. What a shame. They also like 5-MeO-MiPT, but it's not very visual

That honestly makes metocin sound great. I was under the impression that metocin was the internet’s favorite, but due to being almost purely recreational and visual compared to other 4-subs.

That had kinda put me off it, though I have to admit to enjoying miprocin quite a bit and agreeing with your opinion of it also being mostly “fun” and entertaining. So, it wouldn’t be a bad thing if metocin was purely rec. but the adjectives deep, smooth, emotional make it sound better to me.

Sounds nice too. I had put a “star” next to 4-ho-ept and 4-ho-mpt as ones that seemed interesting at a first glance/read through of the big and dandy threads (repeating myself, sorry)

So not just me then? Kinda reassuring. I can’t quite nail it down either but I know I have had some interesting and varied trips with miprocin. I always enjoy nature and miprocin seems to mix well with that, and one of my most memorable trips was going to a sit-down bakery to have full English style tea (I’m American) which was delicious and fancy and hilarious. Felt like the Alice in wonderland tea party a bit ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I agree pretty strongly with your assessment of miprocin, except for not liking it haha

I seem to have the idea, not sure from where, that hydroxyls are preferred somehow over acetoxies. Just from reading years ago I think I compiled that opinion, and from my own preferences with 4homipt (pretty easy, and while somewhat jittery on the comeup, not too bad) and 4acodmt (just so shakey and I cant DO much of anything on it like hike or bike)


You say that AcOs are smoother but that 4homet is smoother than it’s acetoxy - an exception? And what do you mean by smooth? On the body? On the mind? Similar to saying it feels soft or fluffy?

I gotta say, I don't really know where you're coming from here. People do say that metocin is purely recreational, although I didn't find it to be. But it sounds like you're hoping to find something like miprocin, just different enough to still be worthwhile, and you agree that miprocin is...largely recreational. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I will say that I've taken metocetin 4 times. Every time was stunningly visual as well as cognitively light. That doesn't mean that it was completely easy breezy--we're still talking about a 4-substituted tryptamine. It still had a far blunter headspace than most phenethylamines. I just found that it focused on childlike wonderment, not unlike mushrooms can. 


My one experience with 4-HO-MET was very different. It wasn't very visual and it was a glorious experience, but it was much closer to mushrooms than miprocin ever is. My miprocin aficionado friend agreed--they had the same kind of filterless mania that they only get from 4-AcO-DMT and mushrooms, and ended up taking a benzo to kill their trip. It wasn't because they were having a bad time, but because they thought they were going to be having a recreational metacetin-like experience and got something much more. That said, our experience is in the minority. I do suspect that the reason it's popular is that it has the potential to produce both recreational and deep experiences, and it can be highly visual on top of that.

Tough to say. Some people find the acetoxies are less potent, creep up more slowly, have less comeup anxiety, transition through their stages smoother, and last longer, but are otherwise identical. Other people find that there are differences in subjective effects. So far, I initially thought that I preferred acetoxy substitutions because I found psilacetin to be less cloudy and sleepy than 4-PO-DMT. Now, I'm not so sure. It may be possible to generalize, and it may not. I think both mipracetin and miprocin have merits, I think both metocin and metacetin have different uses. 4-AcO-EPT was too stimulating for me at 30mg, but was easygoing and mellow at 10-20, almost too much so. I think the 4-HO sub may be more promising, but as of yet I've only vaped it. But yeah, I get the impression that for me, 4-HO subs are likely to be the ones that I go to if I need to get cognitive work done while 4-AcO subs are the ones I'm more likely to use if I want to be active and not too bogged down with my headspace. 


When I said that acetoxies may be smoother, I meant that the come-up is usually more gradual and less abrupt.

Sounds like even if metocin isn’t purely recreational (as compared to miprocin being *largely *recreational) it’s still different enough to be worthwhile. Your comments on metocin have got me about ready to head over to the store and pick some up right now!

I admit my experience is pretty narrow, with 4-aco-dmt being the only acetoxy I’ve tried...but it is the only psychedelic I’ve had trouble being active on. Maybe it’s an exception.


I hope you don’t think I’m nitpicking semantics here, I just find this conversation interesting. You said 4-ho-Met was smoother than its axetoxy right? So is that another exception to the rule?


“Blunter” headspace is another term I don’t quite get. I *am* a native English speaker believe it or not haha. I think you mean that phens are generally clear headed while tryptamines come with some headspace that is not as cognitively “sharp.”

I don’t feel very “sharp” on any psychedelic haha (maybe lsd sometimes when you get that manic on top of the world feeling of just being so connected to everything) but I do know the relatively clear headed space from 2ce or 2cb.

But then again, I wouldn’t describe any of my tryptamine experiences as blunt-minded. Or would I?  The more I discuss this the more confused or less able to describe it I become. Maybe my sober mind is relatively blunt?

Yeah, we don't have a good shared vocabulary for the phenomenology of these experiences. The people with the Subjective Effects Index are working on this, but they seem to be starting with the comparatively low hanging fruit of visual experiences. Those can at least be objectively replicated a lot of the time.


When I say blunt, I think a lot of other people would say stoned. And while I agree that I don't usually feel "sharp" on most psychedelics, I definitely do feel comparatively "dull" with 4-HO/AcO-subbed tryptamines, even the clearheaded ones. The best non-psychedelic frame of reference would be the brain fog that comes from taking too much noopept, or perhaps the start of a blood sugar crash.

My use of this word is inconsistent:

4-AcO-MET has less wild and inconsistent come-up than 4-HO-MET

4-HO-MET feels emotionally and somatically more like sunshine-warmed silk blankets compared to 4-AcO-MET's brisk ocean breeze.

50mg of this stuff was a solid waste of time.


I tripped a month ago and didn’t write my experience down but it was lackluster mentally and visually. Started with 25mg and gobbled down 15 and 10 more over 1.5 hours. Oh well!

Weird. I've had two experiences with it. The first was sumptuous, rich, and satisfying. The second was bland and forgettable. I'm glad they happened in that order. If the bland one had been first, I don't think I would revisit it. As it is, I'm still pretty excited to.
