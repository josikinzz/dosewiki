## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenol ethers. These are aromatic compounds containing an ether group substituted with a benzene ring.

### Background

Viloxazine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.
7
For decades, an immediate-release formulation of viloxazine has been used in Europe as an antidepressant. It was first approved in the UK in 1974; however, the immediate-release formulation was discontinued due to business reasons unrelated to drug safety and efficacy. In the US, viloxazine was assigned an orphan drug designation in 1984 under the brand name CATATROL: while this product was intended to treat cataplexy and narcolepsy, the drug was never approved for these therapeutic indications. In April 2021, an extended-release formulation of viloxazine under the brand name QELBREE was approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
6

### Indication

Viloxazine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older.
7

### Pharmacodynamics

Viloxazine is a serotonin-norepinephrine modulating agent that has been used as a treatment for depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
6
Although it is not a stimulant agent, viloxazine produces amphetamine-like CNS stimulant effects without a risk for drug abuse or dependence.
4
Viloxazine does not produce sedative anticholinergic or adrenergic effects.

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter
Inhibitor
5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B
Antagonist
5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C
Agonist

### Absorption

Viloxazine is rapidly absorbed following oral administration.
1
,
2
The relative bioavailability of viloxazine extended-release relative to an immediate-release formulation was about 88%.
7
Viloxazine C
max
and AUC increase proportionally over a dosage range from 100 mg to 600 mg once daily.
7
The C
max
ranges between 540 and 1600 ng/mL.
1
Following administration of a single 200 mg dose, the median T
max
was approximately five hours, with a range of three to nine hours. Steady-state was reached after two days of once-daily administration, and no accumulation was observed. A high-fat meal decreases C
max
and AUC by about 9% and 8%, respectively, and delays T
max
by two hours.
7

### Metabolism

Viloxazine undergoes CYP2D6-mediated 5-hydroxylation to form 5-hydroxyviloxazine. This metabolite can be glucuronidated by UGT1A9 and UGT2B15 to form 5-hydroxyviloxazine glucuronide,
3
which is the major metabolite detected in plasma.
7
Viloxazine can also be glucuronidated to form Viloxazine N-carbamoyl glucuronide.

### Half-life

The mean (± SD) half-life of viloxazine was 7.02 (± 4.74) hours.
7

### Toxicity

The oral LD
50
of viloxazine was 2000 mg/kg in rats.
8
There is limited clinical experience with viloxazine overdose. According to case reports in the literature and postmarketing reports, doses ranging from 1000 mg to 6500 mg, which are 1.7 to 10.8 times the maximum recommended daily dose, resulted in overdose with drowsiness as the most reported symptom. Impaired consciousness, diminished reflexes, and increased heart rate have also been reported. There is no specific antidote for viloxazine overdose.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The metabolism of 1,2-Benzodiazepine can be decreased when combined with Viloxazine.
Abacavir
Abacavir may decrease the excretion rate of Viloxazine which could result in a higher serum level.
Abemaciclib
The metabolism of Abemaciclib can be decreased when combined with Viloxazine.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Abiraterone can be decreased when combined with Viloxazine.
Acalabrutinib
The metabolism of Acalabrutinib can be decreased when combined with Viloxazine.

### Food Interactions

Take with or without food. A high-fat meal decreases drug Cmax and AUC and delays Tmax, but not to a clinically significant extent.

### Mechanism of action

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children characterized by inattention and hyperactivity. In current literature, the pathophysiology of ADHD is understood to involve the imbalance of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE).
4
The mechanism of action of viloxazine has not been fully elucidated; however, viloxazine is believed to work by modulating the monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Viloxazine is a selective and moderate norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that binds to the norepinephrine transporter and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine.
6
,
7
It thereby increases extracellular norepinephrine levels across several brain regions.
6
Viloxazine potentiates serotonergic effects: it was shown to enhance neuronal sensitivity to serotonin and increase serotonin levels in the brain.
5
,
6
In vitro
, viloxazine is an antagonist at 5-HT
2B
receptors and an agonist 5-HT
2C
receptors.
4
,
5
5-HT
2B
receptors expressed on GABAergic interneurons are involved in tonic inhibitory control of serotonin neurons that innervate the medial prefrontal context; thus, antagonism of 5-HT
2B
receptors may result in disinhibition and enhanced serotonin release in the brain region.
6
There is conflicting evidence in the literature that viloxazine increases dopamine levels in the brain via direct or indirect effects. For example, the norepinephrine transporter is also involved in the reuptake of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex
6
and stimulation of 5-HT
2C
receptors facilitates DA release and enhances dopaminergic transmission in the brain.
5
As dopamine dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is implicated in ADHD pathophysiology, the impact of viloxazine on dopamine levels may contribute to its mechanism of action. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude this. Viloxazine has a negligible impact on dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and is not associated with an abuse risk.

### General Function

Multidrug efflux pump that functions as a H(+)/organic cation antiporter (PubMed:16330770, PubMed:17509534). Plays a physiological role in the excretion of cationic compounds including endogenous metabolites, drugs, toxins through the kidney and liver, into urine and bile respectively (PubMed:16330770, PubMed:17495125, PubMed:17509534, PubMed:17582384, PubMed:18305230, PubMed:19158817, PubMed:21128598, PubMed:24961373). Mediates the efflux of endogenous compounds such as creatinine, vitamin B1/thiamine, agmatine and estrone-3-sulfate (PubMed:16330770, PubMed:17495125, PubMed:17509534, PubMed:17582384, PubMed:18305230, PubMed:19158817, PubMed:21128598, PubMed:24961373). May also contribute to regulate the transport of cationic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable)
