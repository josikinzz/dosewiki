## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic.

### Background

Diamorphine (heroin) is a narcotic analgesic that may be habit-forming. It is a controlled substance (opium derivative) listed in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Parts 329.1, 1308.11 (1987). Sale is forbidden in the United States by Federal statute. (Merck Index, 11th ed) Internationally, diamorphine is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As heroin, it is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell in the United States and the UK. However, under the name diamorphine, heroin is a legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom.

### Indication

Diamorphine, as a prescription medication in the United Kingdom, is indicated for use in the treatment of severe pain associated with surgical procedures, myocardial infarction or pain in the terminally ill and for the relief of dyspnoea in acute pulmonary edema
6
.

### Pharmacodynamics

The onset of heroin's effects is dependent on the method of administration. Taken orally, heroin is totally metabolized in vivo via extensive first-pass metabolism into morphine before crossing the blood-brain barrier; so the effects are the same as orally administered morphine
5
,
6
. Take by injection, diamorphine's acetyl groups facilitate rapid crossing into the brain
5
,
6
. Once in the brain, heroin is rapidly metabolized into morphine by removal of the acetyl groups, therefore making it a prodrug for the delivery of morphine
5
,
6
. Subsequently, whether eliciting actions peripherally (on smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, liver, or spleen tissue
5
, for example) or on the central nervous system, it is ultimately the morphine metabolite of heroin that then binds with opioid receptors and produces the narcotic opioid effects commonly associated with the substance
5
,
6
.

### Mechanism of Action

Mu-type opioid receptor
Agonist

### Absorption

Bioavailability is less than 35% when orally administered
2
. In particular, some studies have determined that the bioavailability of orally administered diamorphine could be as low as 22.9% (16.4-29.4%) on average in opioid-naive subjects
3
.
Nevertheless, diamorphine administered by any many medically indicated routes of administration leads to a rapid absorption
5
. Peak serum levels are achieved five to ten minutes subcutaneously, three to five minutes intranasally and intramuscularly, and less than one minute intravenously
5
.

### Metabolism

Once administered into the body, diamorphine undergoes deacetylation via various esterase enzymes to generate active metabolites like 6-monoacetylmorphine and morphine
5
,
6
. In particular, when administered orally, diamorphine undergoes extensive first pass metabolism

### Half-life

In humans, administered diamorphine has a half-life of approximately two to three minutes
6
.

### Toxicity

Overdosage with diamorphine well characterised by a number of symptoms including respiratory depression, pulmonary oedema, muscle flaccidity, coma or stupor, constricted pupils, cold, clammy skin and occasionally bradycardia and hypotension
5
,
6
. The antidote for heroin overdose or poisoning is naloxone

### Mechanism of action

When administered orally, diamorphine experiences extensive first-pass metabolism by way of deacetylation to generate the active metabolites 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine
5
,
6
. Alternatively, when given as an injection the acetyl groups present in the diamorphine/diacetylmorphine compound confer the substance lipophilicity that facilitates diamorphine's rapid crossing of the blood-brain-barrier
5
,
6
. Once in the brain, diamorphine is metabolised via deacetylation to the active 6-MAM and morphine metabolites as well
5
,
6
. Despite diamorphine possessing little to no opioid agonist activity itself, its rapid transit across the blood-brain-barrier elicits a far faster onset of activity in comparison to the extensive first-pass metabolism of oral administration
5
,
6
. Regardless, the metabolism of diamorphine to morphine makes heroin a prodrug for the delivery of morphine
5
,
6
.
Morphine is subsequently a mu-opioid agonist. It acts on endogenous mu-opioid receptors that are spread in discrete packets throughout the brain, spinal cord and gut in almost all mammals
1
. Morphine, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters
1
. They are beta-endorphin, dynorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin
1
. The body responds to morphine in the brain by reducing (and sometimes stopping) production of the endogenous opioids when morphine is present
1
. Endorphins are regularly released in the brain and nerves, attenuating pain. Their other functions are still obscure, but are probably related to the effects produced by morphine besides analgesia (antitussin, anti-diarrheal)
1
.
Nevertheless, morphine ultimately elicits the majority of its analgesic activity by binding to mu opioid receptors in both the central and peripheral nervous systems
7
. The overall effect of morphine is activation of descending inhibitory pathways of the central nervous system as well as inhibition of nociceptive afferent neurons of the peripheral nervous system, which results in an overall reduction of the nociceptive pain transmission

### Volume of distribution

Data regarding the volume of distribution specific to diamorphine is not readily accessible or available. However, considering diamorphine is considered a prodrug for morphine, the volume of distribution of morphine has been determined to be approximately 1 to 6 L/kg
8
.

### Protein binding

Diamorphine does not bind to plasma protein
6
. However, considering diamorphine is considered a prodrug for morphine, morphine itself is about 20 to 35% reversibly bound to human plasma proteins
6
,
8
.

### Route of elimination

The majority of the drug is excreted via the kidney as glucuronides and to a much lesser extent as morphine
6
. About 7-10 % is eliminated via the biliary system into the faeces
6
.

### Clearance

Some studies have determined a relatively high systemic diacetylmorphine clearance of about 8.7 +/- 2.6 L/min, suggesting that the intestine, liver, and blood might all collectively take part in the first pass metabolism of diacetylmorphine to morphine
3
, although such clearance observations were made only in opioid-addicted individuals
4
.
However, considering diamorphine is considered a prodrug for morphine, the mean adult plasma clearance of morphine is approximately 20 to 30 mL/min/kg
8
.

## Subjective Experience

Heroin is probably the most infamous drug in the world. It is refined from morphine,
which itself is extracted from the opium poppy, and it was first synthesised in 1874.
Erowid describes it as a euphoric depressant and an analgesic, and there is no doubt
that the consequences of abuse can be grave.

For most of my life I never saw the slightest possibility that I would ever use this
drug. It never entered my head. The media had done a fine job in frightening my sub-
conscious, and simultaneously ensuring that I didn't have a clue what the risks
actually were, or how to manage them.

The word heroin had become synonymous with addiction and death.

As I increasingly grasped that mainstream drug reporting comprised largely of
outright propaganda, a more objective outlook emerged. This solidified as I noted
that personally experienced substances, which I knew to be benign, were routinely
presented using the same toxic terminology. It was impossible to differentiate any
grain of truth from the endless catalogue of misinformation.

With this in mind, I eventually approached heroin in the same rational and cautious
manner as I had with every other chemical and botanical. Safety was paramount.

Armed with 100mg of what was purported to be 87% pure uncut #4 heroin, I
embarked on the pre-requisite research, which was from a start point of almost no
knowledge at all.

Whilst online literature suggested that most #4 originates in Burma or Colombia, I
was totally unaware of the geographic origins of my supply.

Further, what on earth did #4 mean? I quickly learned that #3 was the rawer
freebase form, which would not dissolve in water, but that #4 was heroin salt, which
would. This distinction is important because the salt form renders the drug suitable
for insufflation and IV.

A note in passing: smoking, which is the usual RoA for #3, attracted mixed reports,
including many that suggested it was particularly bad for the lungs.

For dose, 5mg-10mg was commonly suggested, and it aligned with the light
threshold on the harm reduction websites. I therefore decided that 10mg was
probably a sensible starting point, with the potential to redose. I noted that
additional 5mg-10mg lines were referred to by Erowid:

\`\`\`
"Heroin users describe chopping out "pin"-thin lines of heroin and then
redosing every 30-60 minutes: getting high, coming down a little, snorting
another line to get high, coming down a little. This is done over the course of
an evening or a day and may feel like chasing the peak high that is
achieved".
\`\`\`
Regarding expectation, I anticipated euphoria and a sense of well being, over a
period of about 3-5 hours.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I prepare a 10mg line and insufflate [3:43pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:02 I may feel the slightest of something, although this isn’t really
significant. The thought occurs that this substance may actually be #3.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:05 Perhaps I under-dosed. Given that there is no obvious adverse effect, I
snort a little more (10mg). This produces a mild effect: a rather sedated
headspace, but no euphoria or high.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:20 I insufflate another 15mg, with no excessive nasal discomfort. I snort
deep with my right nostril, and I continue to wait, impatiently.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+0:30 There is now a clear effect. I feel sedated and a little distant, but not
sleepy. This isn't a massive high, but it is a nice light buzz. I am fully
functional, in control of myself, and comfortable with the experience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I perform a few checks. Pupils? They are constricted. Horn? There is nothing
abnormal and no real interest. Appetite? No change, in that I am not really
hungry. My head is definitely in a lightly inebriated state and I am relaxed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:40 As I am at ease with this, I decide to snort a final 15mg. Based upon
Erowid and the other safety oriented websites, this will take me to a fairly
large but not excessive dose, circa 50mg in total. It is probably wise to stop at
this point. Again, there is no discomfort in the railing operation itself.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:50 I'm into this more deeply than previously, but the overall character of
the ride appears to be set. I am relaxed; my headspace is drifty and
unengaged. Physically, I feel a little numbed (analgesic). I am not euphoric but
I am tranquil and content.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:10 I am in an ataractic-like comfort zone, in which problems are dissolved
and all is good. At this stage, it's a nice drug in terms of effect, but not exciting
or compelling in any particular way.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:50 One of the effects mentioned in reference sources was a dry mouth. I
can confirm this to be the case: I had to chat to someone for a few minutes,
and this came on quickly. Beyond this, there are no significant changes from
earlier, although I now feel a little woozy with a hint of fatigue.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:30 The general characteristic hasn't changed, but the fatigue has
increased, as has the grogginess. I feel a little like I am suffering from motion
sickness. It is not horribly uncomfortable, but it is there in the background,
nonetheless. Overlaying this I am still chilled and relaxed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:35 A meal has arrived. This could be a challenge.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:10 I got through it, meaning that I ate it, but with little enjoyment. There
may be a degree of appetite suppression in play here, and certainly, taste isn't
accentuated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am now fading somewhat. The feeling of queasiness remains, and I am
increasingly tired. Indeed, I feel I could fall asleep easily if I lie down. I am still
functional but clearly zoned-out, and I am now sweating a little. This isn't
particularly pleasant, and I am relieved not to have snorted any further lines.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:15 This has now taken a further turn for the worse. The dizziness
continues to increase, as does the sleepiness, so I head to bed. I lie in the dark,
drifting and feeling quite unwell. I attempt to rise a couple of times over the
next half hour, but I fail, as the spinning head and general malaise is too
intense.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+3:50. I force myself up and head downstairs. I suddenly feel heaviness in
my gut, and I vomit: not repeatedly, but I expel the most recent contents of my
stomach. I lie down again for 10 minutes before rising once more. This is not
good, at all.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 I begin to feel slightly better. I am still dizzy, but less intensely, and I
am less somnolent, although I could easily have continued to sleep had I
wished.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
These aspects have taken me by surprise. I Google heroin and vomiting. This
is common; so common that I can't believe that I was unaware of it. For
example, 'Talk To Frank', which is always quick off the mark with negatives,
points out: "The first dose of heroin can bring about dizziness and vomiting."
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It appears that nausea and vomiting are common features for many, and not
only for the first dose. HowToKickHeroin.Com describes it like this:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
"Strangely enough, getting nauseous and throwing up is part of the
heroin addict lifestyle. Actually, many addicts glean pleasure from
throwing up because they perceive it to mean “strong heroin"," and
"In hospitals, nausea is expected to occur in 25 – 30 percent of
patients treated with opioid drugs. However, since heroin involves
greater average dosing and subsequent amplified effects it results in
higher than average nauseating events."
Well... now I know.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:20 I still feel ill. I suffer a further bout of vomiting. The motion-like
sickness persists. It is awful.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am thinking with clarity and can function, but I am poorly. One decision is
taken already however: the rest of the 100mg is binned. Perhaps I took too
much of it. Regardless, this body load is far too high to justify any further
testing or experimentation.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:00 Slowly, too slowly, I am heading back to baseline. This has not been a
good experience. The onset and peak were nice but not particularly wonderful,
and the aftermath has been horrible.
\`\`\`
Overnight, sleep was sparse and in the morning I woke with a headache. A low level
hangover persisted through the early part of the day.

Why on earth do people put themselves through this, and how do they repeat it
frequently enough to become addicted? Never again!

WARNING: At the time of writing this page, reports of heroin having been cut with
fentanyl and similar chemicals are all too common. Given that fentnyl is typically 30-
50 times more potent than heroin, the consequences are inevitable. Test, measure
and allergy check your gear carefully before even thinking about using it.

SAFETY NOTES & REMINDERS
It hopefully goes without saying that if you use heroin you should never shortcut the
harm reduction messages documented throughout this book. However, there are a
few opioid safety steps which are widely presented across health centric Internet sites
which are worth repeating, even though they have largely been covered.

The first of these is to test your supply to ensure that it is indeed heroin (and not
fentanyl for example) and also to establish its purity/strength. This is hard to over
emphasize.

Another is that it is very unwise to take heroin when you are alone, for rather obvious
reasons.

A common piece of advice is to always use a clean needle if you inject. I would also
refer you to the IV segment in the first section of this book. Again, please note that IV
in itself is a terrible idea from a safety perspective.

On the first signs that you or someone you are with may have overdosed, seek
medical assistance immediately (call 999/911 or whatever is required in your
territory).

Never mix your heroin with other depressants (such as alcohol or benzodiazepines).
Note that generally poly-drug use with heroin is particularly risky.

If snorting, refer to the segment on nasal care in the first section of this book.

Take particular care with respect to dose if you are changing from one RoA to
another.

Find a comfortable safe-space in which to use your heroin.

A measure specific to opioids is that you should always carry naloxone (narcon). This
is a medication used to block the effects of opioids, and is often used to counter
decreased breathing in an overdose scenario. Again, the importance of this is hard to
over state.

Remember that tolerance is real: if you are new to this drug don’t simply take what
your friends or colleagues are taking (hopefully this is obvious). Equally, if you have
had a break from your last use your tolerance will have diminished or disappeared,
so don’t start from where you left off.

If your use of heroin is becoming habitual or worse, consider treatment options and
support. Please don’t delay in choosing this route.

Finally, and I’m probably becoming an annoyance at this stage, re-read the Ten
Commandments of Safer Drug Use and the rest of the safety data offered in this
book.

Heroin
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[Heroin Images](https://erowid.org/heroin_images.shtml)
 
Heroin is a semi-synthetic opiate derived from [morphine](https://erowid.org/pharms/morphine/morphine.shtml) . Intravenously-injected heroin causes a rush of powerful euphoria lasting a few minutes, followed by sedation lasting a few hours. When injected IM or insufflated, there is a slower onset and a less intense peak of effects. 
 
 Heroin is primarily produced in Colombia, Mexico, Southeast Asia (especially Burma), and Afghanistan. Depending on how it is processed, it ranges from a thick sticky "black tar" to a brown, tan, or white powder. Street material varies greatly in potency from as high as 95% purity to as low as 5 or 10% purity. Heroin is most commonly injected (intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously), smoked, or insufflated (snorted). 
 
[ [Main Heroin Vault](https://erowid.org/heroin.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/heroin_dose.shtml) #
 
Dose depends greatly on the purity of the heroin and level of tolerance. Common IV doses generally fall between 5 and 10 mg; smoked heroin doses may range from 15 to 25 mg. Heroin users typically use small quantities of new material to determine potency and reduce the risk of overdose.
 
Price #
 
According to the United Nations Office of Drug Control, in 2005 heroin cost between \$40 and \$350 per gram retail in the United States, while the price in the United Kingdom was much lower at about \$27 per gram.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/heroin_law.shtml) #
 
Heroin is illegal to possess and sell in the United States (Schedule I) and in most other countries.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/heroin_chemistry.shtml) #
 
The chemical name for heroin is diacetylmorphine (C 21 H 23 NO 5 ). It is a semi-synthetic opiate made by extracting [morphine](https://erowid.org/pharms/morphine/morphine.shtml) from the [opium](https://erowid.org/chemicals/opium/opium.shtml) produced by [opium poppies](https://erowid.org/plants/poppy/poppy.shtml) and then acetylating the morphine into diacetylmorphine (heroin).
 
Pharmacology #
 
Heroin itself is believed to be inactive, but after administration it is rapidly metabolized into the mu-opioid agonists 6-monoacetylmorphine and morphine. Heroin delivers a more intense "rush" and more potent analgesia than morphine, probably because it crosses the blood-brain barrier more rapidly. It is also more soluble in water than morphine, and forms a more concentrated solution. Smoking yields rapid delivery, but relatively low bioavailability as a considerable amount of the drug is destroyed in combustion.
 
Production #
 
Production Summary Needed.
 
[History](https://erowid.org/heroin_timeline.php) #
 
Opiates have been used for thousands of years for their euphoric and analgesic effects. Heroin was first synthesized in 1874 by English chemist C.R. Wright. But its commercial value was first recognized in 1897 by Heinrich Dreser and Felix Hoffman at the Bayer pharmaceutical laboratory -- the same researchers who invented aspirin, which is is made by a similar process. Heroin was intended to be a less-addictive substitute for other common opiates. 
 
 In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, heroin was common in over-the-counter medicines, but it was made illegal in the United States in 1924 through the Heroin Act. In the second half of the twentieth century, heroin was widely stigmatized as the quintessential illicit drug, as images of urban heroin addicts were propagated by media reports.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Heroin; Dope; Smack; Junk; Horse; H; Chiva.
 
The Experience:
 
No common terms known.
 
EFFECTS #
 
The effects of heroin vary greatly depending on the quality of material, route of administration, the person, and the dose. Possible effects may include feelings of euphoria and well-being, relaxation, sedation, and analgesia. Negative effects may include nausea or vomiting (sometimes severe), constipation, dizziness, and blackout.
 
Onset #
 
Intravenous injection can produce strong effects in as little as 3-5 seconds. Smoking produces milder effects within 5-15 seconds. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injection produce a more gradual onset in 5-10 minutes. Insufflated heroin produces effects within 2-10 minutes. Oral use can take 60-90 minutes to produce effects.
 
Duration #
 
When injected intravenously, smoked, or insufflated, heroin produces a wash of euphoria followed by a period of sedation lasting for 2-4 hours. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injection typically lack the initial wave of intense euphoria, and cause feelings of sedation lasting three to five hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Heroin use can cause death by respiratory failure. Several factors can increase the risk of overdose, including the strong tolerance effects that develop with repeated use. Tolerance effects wear off over time, and users who take a break may find that a previously-safe dose is now dangerously large. The purity of street heroin is also highly variable (and may have risen in recent years) and users often do not know how much heroin they are taking. 
 
 Street heroin is frequently impure, and some adulterants are dangerous. Several hundred heroin users died in 2006 in the U.S. after unwittingly taking heroin cut with fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opiate. 
 
 Repeatedly snorting heroin can cause severe damage to the nose, especially with long term exposure. Smoking heroin can cause breathing difficulties.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Heavy or frequent opiate use during pregnancy may cause dependence in the fetus, who may undergo withdrawal after birth. It has also been associated with lower birth weight and increased infant mortality.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
One of the most problematic aspects of heroin is that it causes rapid tolerance and physical dependence. In combination with its euphoric effects, this leads many people to become addicted, having difficulty controlling their own use. Once physically dependent, discontinuation generally causes extremely unpleasant (but not life-threatening) withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, insomnia, diarrhea, and sweating.
 
Long Term Health Problems #
 
Major problems associated with repeated recreational use of heroin include loss of interest in other activities (a type of anhedonia), increase in amount of pain medications (especially opiates) needed for medical purposes, and side problems from over use of central nervous system depressants. The most commonly described long term problems associated with heroin are addiction, physical dependence, and compulsive behaviors related to addiction. Those addicted to heroin will often have lasting health complications not from the direct pharmacological effects of the drug itself, but from injuries, diseases, and traumas that occured as a result of intoxication and willingness to engage in risky behavior while high, to achieve the heroin high, or to acquire the substance. 
 
 Intra-Venous (IV) drug use can lead to exposure to viral hepatitis and other serious, life-threatening diseases, injection site infections, collapsed and scarred/hardened veins, damage to heart, and related issues. Other health problems associated with recurring use of heroin are: insomnia, depression, weight gain, and general health decline with worsening diet. Another major problem is that strong physical addiction and unreliable access to the drug can result in withdrawal symptoms, including shaking, an overwhelming feeling of anxiety, physical discomfort or pain, inability to sleep, use of other sedatives and depressants to reduce the severity of the withdrawal symptoms, diarrhea, cold flashes, and a strong desire to find and take any opiate of any quality.
 
Risk of Death #
 
All methods of using heroin have resulted in deaths from depressed breathing and general autonomic suppression from overdoses. Risks of death from using heroin are substantially worse when heroin is injected. Intra-Venous (IV) use of heroin results in fatalities from allergic reactions to contaminants, injection-site infections, and overdoses associated with large variations in concentration of heroin in the materials uses. Some harm reduction organizations strongly advocate that heroin users switch to smoking it to avoid IV-specific risks.

Heroin Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
Although insufflation (snorting/sniffing) is perhaps the most common way heroin is now used in the Americas and Europe, we have little information about the pure dosages which are used. Often heroin users will be taught about how much to insufflate from the person they first try it with and then simply titrate their own dose as they wish by increasing or decreasing the size of the line used. Our guesstimate is that doses for insufflation are probably between 10 and 50 mg for less tolerant people and 20 to 80 mg for those who use frequently.

 Heroin users describe chopping out "pin"-thin lines of heroin and then redosing every 30-60 minutes: getting high, coming down a little, snorting another line to get high, coming down a little. This is done over the course of an evening or a day and may feel like chasing the peak high that is achieved. Heroin use is often accompanied by other drug use such as alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis use. Combining heroin or other opioids with stimulants is sometimes called "speed balling" and many users report very powerful euphoric effects but also can be very dangerous at high doses or when done frequently. Using stimulants and depressants together is dangerous both in terms of acute physical risks and can lead to or be part of very serious addictions. 
 
 For some information about dosage at tolerance levels, see [Heroin Tolerance Dosage Levels](https://erowid.org/heroin_dose1.shtml) .

 The charts above shows intravenous (IV) dosages in milligrams (mg) for individuals with different levels of tolerance. Because people quickly develop tolerance to the effects of heroin, and because batches of heroin vary from extremely low (2-3%) to extremely high (98%) purity, dosages will vary dramatically depending on whether an individual has been using regularly, and for how long. The numbers on this page are approximations only and should not be used to determine actual dosages.

Heroin
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Heroin**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I
- CLASSIFICATION: Opium Derivative
 
Heroin is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 It is notable that heroin was NOT included as a controlled substance in the United Nations 1971 International Convention on Psychotropic Substances that paralleled the US's Controlled Substances Act. Heroin is thus not banned by international treaty. 
 
 
Australia #
 
Heroin is controlled in Australa, but we have found conflicting information about its exact legal status. Heroin was listed in Schedule I of the Narcotic Drugs Act of 1967, but we are unclear whether the control system has changed since then.
 
Brazil #
 
Heroin is listed as a controlled substance, making production, distribution, or possession illegal. (thanks P)
 
Canada #
 
In September, 2016, Health Canada began allowing prescription of pharmaceutical heroin (diacetylmorphine) to severe addicts as a treatment regimen. See [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/13/canada-has-just-approved-prescription-heroin/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/13/canada-has-just-approved-prescription-heroin/) . Otherwise, heroin is [Schedule I](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/law_canada.shtml) in Canada. However, a unanimous Supreme Court decision in 2011 declared that there is a right under Section 7 of the Charter to have access to clean injection sites, if they are available. See [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15130282](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15130282) , and [http://scc.lexum.org/en/2011/2011scc44/2011scc44.html](http://scc.lexum.org/en/2011/2011scc44/2011scc44.html) . (last updated Sep 23 2016)
 
Czech Republic #
 
We have been told that the Czech Republic has decriminalized 1.5g or less of heroin and the punishment is similar in scale to a parking ticket. Sales, production, and larger quantity possession are still crimes. See [http://www.praguepost.com/news/3194-new-drug-guidelines-are-europes-most-liberal.html](http://www.praguepost.com/news/3194-new-drug-guidelines-are-europes-most-liberal.html) . (thanks zb) (last updated Oct 13, 2012)
 
Finland #
 
Heroin is a controlled substance, making production, distribution, and possession illegal without a license. See [Finland Law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/law_finland.shtml) .
 
Germany (Deutschland) #
 
in May 2009, Germany made it legal to prescribe heroin to addicts who are over 23 years old, been addicted for at least 5 years, and have tried 2 other therapies to get off heroin. See [HanfJournal.de](http://www.hanfjournal.de/hajo-website/artikel/2009/05mai/s29_0509_Heroin_jetzt_Arznei.php) . (thanks t) (last updated may 31, 2009)
 
Italy (Italia) #
 
Listed in Tabella I of "Tabelle delle sostanze stupefacenti e psicotrope", making it illegal to possess, purchase, or sell. (see [Tabelle delle sostanze stupefacenti e psicotrope](http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/temi/p2_6.jsp?id=3729&area=sostanzeStupefacenti&menu=vuoto) . (thanks a) (last updated Dec 16, 2015)
 
New Zealand #
 
Heroin is Class A in New Zealand. (thanks MM)
 
Norway #
 
Heroin is Schedule I in Norway and illegal to buy or possess without a special license. There have been some projects to establish "needle rooms" in Norway by the government where heroin addicts are allowed to get fresh needles for injecting heroin, but the chemical is still Schedule I. [See Norway Law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/countries.shtml#norway) . (thanks Y)
 
Portugal #
 
Effective July 2001, personal use of heroin was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 (see [text of law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/portugal/lei30-2000.pdf) ). Possession of less than 1 g is not regarded as a criminal offense, though the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale, or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit, are criminal offenses punishable by jail time. (thanks P)
 
Switzerland
 
Heroin is legally available for addicts under an ongoing experiment. (see [Switzerland's Liberal Drug Policy Seems To Work, Study Says](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/44417.php) )
 
U.K. #
 
Heroin is [Schedule II/Class A](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/uk/uk_law_definitions.shtml) in the U.K. It is illegal to buy, sell or possess without a license.

It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Diacetylmorphine** or **morphine diacetate** (also known as **diamorphine** and **heroin** as well as colloquially as **H** , **dope** , **smack** , **junk** , **brown** , **boy** , and others) is a semi-synthetic [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) substance of the [morphinan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphinan) class. It is a derivative of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) , a natural product of the opium poppy ( *Papaver somniferum* ). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Heroin is known for its highly addictive properties and it makes up a large portion of the illicit traffic in narcotics.

Heroin was first synthesized from morphine by a British chemist in 1874 and was introduced as a commercial product by the Bayer Company of Germany in 1898. Although the name heroin is a trade name, it has since been widely adopted for all intents and purposes and may describe a recreational depressant that may or may not contain pure diacetylmorphine.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) .

In its pure form, heroin is active at doses of 5 mg and above; however, the substance is most commonly found in a preparation containing significant impurities. These impurities can result from including processing faults during synthesis, the addition of harmful or benign cutting agents, or the substitution of significantly more potent and dangerous analogous substances such as [fentanyl](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Fentanyl) adulterated into the end-product before distribution. The heroin found on streets may have a significant variation in purity, but on average is about 5%. This makes accurate dosing particularly difficult.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Diacetylmorphine was originally synthesized by C.R. Alder Wright in 1874 when attempting to combine morphine with various acids. The synthesis was achieved through boiling anhydrous morphine with morphine alkaloid with acetic anhydride.

Although the name heroin is a traditional trade name for a Bayer product containing diacetylmorphine, the name has since been widely adopted for all intents and purposes and may describe a recreational depressant that may or may not contain pure diacetylmorphine.

## Chemistry

Heroin, or morphine diacetate or diacetylmorphine (diamorphine hydrochloride), is an opiate and an ester of morphine. Heroin and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called a phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R 9 and R 13 , with the nitrogen member looking at R 17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.

Heroin, along with other morphinans, contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R 4 and R 5 through an oxygen group. Heroin contains two acetate (CH3COO−) groups bonded to R 3 and R 6 of its structure, and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R 17 . On the same ring containing the 6-acetyl group, heroin contains a double bond.

Heroin's chemical structure is closely related to morphine. Heroin is the 3,6-diacetyl derivative of the diol [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) , meaning it contains acetate functional groups at the same locations hydroxy groups are found in morphine (3,6). Heroin is analogous to the other morphinans including [dihydrocodeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dihydrocodeine) , [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) , [ethylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethylmorphine) , [hydrocodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hydrocodone) , and [oxycodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oxycodone) .

## Pharmacology

Heroin itself is an inactive drug, but it is metabolized into [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) when inserted into the body. When taken orally, heroin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism via deacetylation, making it a prodrug for the systemic delivery of morphine. When the drug is injected, however, it avoids this first-pass effect, very rapidly crossing the blood–brain barrier because of the presence of the acetyl groups which render it much more fat-soluble, and thus more potent, than [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) itself.

Once in the brain, it is deacetylated variously into the inactive 3-monoacetylmorphine and the active 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM). 6-MAM is found in some commercially prepared batches of black tar heroin, often found on the west coast of the United States. It is then deacetylated into morphine, which binds to [μ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) . Heroin itself exhibits relatively low affinity for the μ receptor, suggesting that much of the psychoactive effects of the substance come from the metabolites of heroin rather than the diacetylmorphine itself.

The recreational effects of this compound, including [cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) and [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , occur because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally produced within the body and are also active on the μ-opioid receptor set in the brain. The way in which synthetic opioids such as heroin structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects. This is because natural endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. The endorphins can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - This leads to the trademark "nodding off" effect seen in heroin users, where the head falls, the eyes close, and the user slips uncontrollably into momentary unconsciousness. This can lead to falling into microsleeps while sitting or standing up.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - The physical euphoria experienced on this substance is extremely intense when compared to other opioids such as [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) or [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) . The sensation itself can be described as extreme feelings of intense physical comfort, warmth, and all-encompassing bliss.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - Heavy dosages of heroin can result in [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) which leads onto fatal or dangerous levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation)**
- **[Cough suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression)**
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Decreased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_heart_rate)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect can be intense enough to lead to vomiting at high doses. When severe, the nausea and subsequent vomiting can cause dehydration in the user.
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)**
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - The cognitive euphoria experienced on this substance is extremely intense when compared to other opioids such as [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) or [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) . The sensation itself can be described as powerful and overwhelming feelings of emotional bliss, contentment, and happiness.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - At high doses, the eyes un-focus and re-focus uncontrollably. It appears to be caused by issues in depth perception, as by closing one eye the issue can be temporarily alleviated.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - One may experience a state of semi-consciousness and [hypnagogia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) during heavy dosage nodding which results in dream-like states and up to level 3 [imagery](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming#Internally_sourced_sensory_input) . This is often accompanied by ill-defined [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_acuity_suppression)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - Some users experience rumbling in the ears and/or tinnitus with this substance. Effect may last for long periods after the experience due to the ototoxicity of opioids

## Forms

#### Black tar heroin
**Black tar heroin is dangerous to inject**
 
It's not practical to make black tar heroin sterile, for example, by heating a solution with a lighter for a minute. Black tar heroin injection is associated with *Clostridium botulinum* infection. [Prion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion) : "For prion elimination, various recommendations state 121–132 °C (250–270 °F) for **60 minutes** or 134 °C (273 °F) for at least 18 minutes." A pressure cooker reach 120 °C at full pressure. However, we don't recommend black tar heroin injection even if you own a pressure cooker with a PSI meter due to lack of safety data.
This form of heroin is diacetylmorphine acetate, a product of heroin production that does not require further acetylation. It differs in texture from powder heroin in that it is black, gooey, viscous, and a texture ranging from quite similar to wet asphalt and a hard rock of material. It is commonly produced in South America and is found on the western coast of the USA.

The actual chemical contents of black tar heroin can vary from the white powder form. Black tar might contain a variable mixture of morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine) which is another result of crude acetylation that occurs in the clandestine manufacturing process.

When injected into any type of tissue, this form of heroin results in an increased risk of wound botulism . Wound botulism can be fatal and leads to amputations and death at a higher rate of black tar heroin users. Because of the consistency of the substance (tar-like), it can pose a greater risk for collapsing, damaging, or infecting veins. This damage to veins leads to a higher chance of subcutaneous and intradermal injection which is not advocated from a harm reduction point of view. For users who do choose to inject this substance, it is advised to follow the procedures found in the [safer injection guide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Safer_injection_guide) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Like many other opioids, unadulterated heroin at appropriate dosages does not cause many long-term complications other than physical and psychological dependence and [constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation) . Outside of the extremely powerful addiction and physical dependence, the harmful or toxic aspects of opioid usage are exclusively associated with not taking [the necessary precautions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) in regards to [its administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injected) , [overdosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) and using impure heroin products that contain harmful additives.

Heavy dosages of heroin can result in severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) which can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) - this effect is proportional to the dosage of the substance consumed.

Due to the nature of the unregulated drug market, illicit heroin is of widely varying and unpredictable purity. A user may prepare what they consider to be a moderate dose while actually taking far more than intended in the event of obtaining a purer product than they are used to, or may be cut unknowingly with more potent and dangerous substances such as [fentanyl](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Fentanyl) . Depending on drug interactions and numerous other factors, death from overdose can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours and is a direct result of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) leading onto anoxia (oxygen deprivation) resulting from the breathing reflex being suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) . Some sources quote the median lethal dose (for an average 75 kg opiate-naive individual) as being between 75 and 600mg.

Heroin can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) ).

In case of a suspected or known overdose, it is advised to administer a dose of [naloxone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naloxone) intravenously, intramuscularly, or nasally to reverse the effects of opioid agonism .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the administration of the intended dose (especially due to the unusually high risk of an overdose this substance presents.)

#### Bodily harm

Many opioid drugs, especially oxycodone and heroin , are known to be [ototoxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ototoxicity) , causing hearing loss, tinnitus and balance issues. In some cases the damage can be irreversible.

Opioids can cause [urinary retention, or difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating) and [constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation) with chronic and repeated use. Some users find relief in blowing hard into their palm or doing squats before using the toilet, as this compresses core muscles onto the bladder.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , the chronic use of heroin can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological and physical dependence among certain users. When psychological or physical addiction has developed, mental and physical [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) and cravings may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of heroin develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same psychoactive effects of a previously lower dose. After heroin tolerance has developed, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Heroin presents cross-tolerance with all other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of heroin all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) will have a reduced effect.

The risk of fatal heroin overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and [relapse](/w/index.php?title=Relapse&action=edit&redlink=1) , largely because of reduced tolerance. When users dose their old doses, they no longer have the physical tolerance to handle the sedative effects of heroin and overdose occurs. To account for this lack of physical tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual [dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) if using after a prolonged period of sobriety. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in tolerance: in one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.

Studies have shown that the subjective [cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) and [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) of heroin use, which is the reinforcing component of addiction, is proportional in its' intensity to the rate at which the blood level concentrations of the drug increases. Intravenous injection is the fastest route of drug administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the fastest. It is followed by smoking, suppository (anal or vaginal insertion), insufflation (snorting), and ingestion (swallowing).

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants increase respiration rate which allows for a higher dose of opiates than would otherwise be used. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position blackouts/memory loss likely.
- **DXM** - Generally considered to be toxic. CNS depression, difficulty breathing, heart issues, and liver toxicity have been observed. Additionally if one takes DXM, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position
- **Ketamine** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MAOIs** - Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.
- **MXE** - MXE can potentiate the effects of opioids but also increases the risk of respiratory depression and organ toxicity.
- **Nitrous** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are common.
- **PCP** - PCP may reduce opioid tolerance, increasing the risk of overdose.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of seizures. Tramadol itself is known to induce seizures and it may have additive effects on seizure threshold with other opioids. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present.
- **Grapefruit** - While grapefruit is not psychoactive, it may affect the metabolism of certain opioids. Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice . This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected . Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.

## Legal status

- **Brazil:** Heroin is listed as a controlled substance, making the production, distribution, or possession illegal. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Canada:** Heroin is a Schedule I substance in Canada. However, a unanimous Supreme Court decision in 2011 declared that there is a right under Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to have access to clean injection sites.
- **Czech Republic:** The Czech Republic has decriminalized 1.5g or less of heroin and the punishment is similar in scale to a parking ticket. Sales, production, and larger quantity possession are still crimes.
- **Finland:** Heroin is a controlled substance, making the production, distribution, and possession illegal without a license. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

- **Italy** : Heroin is a Schedule I drug.
- **Latvia:** Heroin is a Schedule I drug.
- **New Zealand:** Heroin is Class A in New Zealand. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Norway:** Heroin is Schedule I in Norway and illegal to buy or possess without a special license. There have been some projects to establish needle rooms in Norway by the government where heroin addicts are allowed to get fresh needles for injecting heroin. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Portugal:** The personal use of heroin was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 on July 2001. Possession of less than 1g is not regarded as a criminal offense although the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit are criminal offenses punishable by jail time. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Russia:** Heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance.
- **Switzerland** : Heroin is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis D. It is legally available for addicts under an ongoing experiment but is otherwise illegal to possess.
- **United Kingdom:** Heroin is Schedule II/Class A and is illegal to buy, sell or possess without a license. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **United States:** Heroin is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute without a DEA license. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Poland** : Heroin is illegal to produce, sell and possess under "wykaz środków odurzających i substancji psychotropowych". [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

  "saferparty": `# Diacetylmorphine
*Source: [SaferParty](https://saferparty.ch) - Drug Checking Service (Switzerland)*

## Effects
Diacetylmorphine is chemically identical to heroin and therefore has analgesic, balancing, sedative, anxiety-relieving and euphoric effects.

## Dosage
Due to the lack of impurities and extenders, diacetylmorphine must be dosed much lower than heroin.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Slowing of breathing, nausea, vomiting, itching, drop in blood pressure, pulse slowing, pupil constriction and urinary retention may occur.
Confusion, disorientation, memory lapses, slurred and slurred speech as well as coordination disorders, constipation, reduction in sexual desire and a potentially life-threatening reduction in breathing rate to 2 to 4 breaths per minute (due to the attenuation of the coughing and breathing centre) are also known side effects.
For users who are not used to opiates, the use of diacetylmorphine even in small quantities can be life-threatening (severe respiratory depression, danger of suffocation).

### Long-term Risks
The danger of addiction with psychological and physical symptoms is great, the same as with illegally produced heroin. As soon as a tolerance has developed and the body is not supplied with the necessary amount of substance, physical withdrawal symptoms occur 8 to 12 hours after the last intake.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.

## History

Heroin (diacetylmorphine, morphine diacetate and also diamorphine) was first synthesized in 1874 by English chemist C.R. Wright. But its commercial value was first recognized in 1897 by Heinrich Dreser and Felix Hoffman at the Bayer pharmaceutical laboratory - the same researchers who invented aspirin, which is is made by a similar process. Heroin was intended to be a less-addictive substitute for other common opiates.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, heroin was common in over-the-counter medicines, but it was made illegal in the United States in 1924 through the Heroin Act. In the second half of the twentieth century, heroin was widely stigmatized as the quintessential illicit drug, as images of urban heroin addicts were propagated by media reports.

## Types of heroin

**1**: Morphine freebase or another form of morphine.

**2**: Heroin acetate or Heroin freebase.

**3**: "Supposedly"  60% Heroin HCl and 40% Caffeine however it is usually found in as Heroin freebase, which needs something like citric acid to be added before it will dissolve in water. 

**4**: Heroin HCl, which is a white or grey-ish substance that can be snorted or injected without treatment to make it soluble, but cannot be easily smoked.

Black tar heroin. In a sense does not fall under the above number, as it uses a completely different method from opium to Heroin. Contains 6-MAM and 3-MAM (which binds relatively weak to the μ-Opioid receptors).

## Dosage

Note: Purity varies wildly, and with such the dose does also.

| Common (no tolerance) | 5-15mg |
| --- | --- |
| Strong (no tolerance) | 10-20mg |
| Common (with tolerance) | 20-30mg |
| Strong (with tolerance) | 30-50mg |

| Common | 10-20mg |
| --- | --- |
| Strong | 20-30mg |

## Duration

When injected intravenously, smoked, or insufflated, heroin produces a wash of euphoria followed by a period of sedation lasting for 2-4 hours. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injection typically lack the initial wave of intense euphoria, and cause feelings of sedation lasting three to five hours.

| Onset | 3-5 seconds |
| --- | --- |
| Total | 4-5 hours |

| Onset | 5-15 seconds |
| --- | --- |
| Peak | 5-10 minutes |
| Total | 3-5 hours |

## Harm Reduction

- Always have Narcan when using heroin, which can save your life if you OD. Be in the presence of other people who can help you if you OD

- Do not drive or use heavy machinery

- Do not mix heroin (or other opiates) with benzos or alcohol. For a full list of interactions view [Drug combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations)

### Potentiators

A common misconception is that grapefruit juice potentiates morphine and/or Heroin. It does not.

Any first generation anti-histamines.

### Conversion from freebase Heroin to a salt

Converting the freebase version of Heroin to a salt version impacts the chemical in subjectively positive and negative effects, lets begin with listing those.

Pros:
- Easily water soluble (Easy IVing and snorting, also snorting has an notable increase in potency as the heroin is now able to easily pass the mucous membrane)
- You have 'more' as you add powder to your Heroin but depending on your route of administration (RoA from now on) this can even increase potency

Neutral:
- It changes the color of the Heroin

Cons:
- Not smokeable anymore (freebase Heroin is made for that and thus way better if your RoA is smoking/vaping)

So basically if you got freebase Heroin and wanna smoke/vape it? Stay with your freebase. You wanna IV or snort it though? Definitely get some kind of acid! These are your safe, and most of the time, cheap options:
- ascorbic acid powder (vitamin C) -> turns your Heroin into Heroin Ascorbate 
- citric acid powder (DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT USE LEMON JUICE TO IV HEROIN. IT CAN MAKE YOU BLIND) -> turns your Heroin into 
- vinegar (same as above! it's just listed it for completions sake, I highly recommend to use ascorbic acid ) -> turns your Heroin into Heroin Citrate (same as popular 'ECP')

I could sadly not find any information on difference in strength but I suppose all 3 CAN be slightly different and depending on your body, metabolism and more.

So whats the ratio? You only need very little of one of those 3 options and all the heroin should dissolve in water, but if you snort it you must mix it up pretty good in order for it to work exactly how it's supposed to and with full strength.

### Some words from a fellow member

Hello fellow & former opiate/heroin addicts. I have some very important information that may save your life one day.

There's a good chance you've heard it before, but cannot emphasize how strong its so important to know the following critical information:

- If you relapse after having a week or more clean time, you have very well may die. Why, you ask? Most cases involve an individual who managed to get clean for a fair amount of time and relapse, often using the same dose they normally would use. Sometimes even less. In fact, I'd wager that at least 70% of heroin related deaths are from who make this lethal mistake. I feel obligated to make this post, as one of my closest friends died last month after making this common mistake.

There is more to keep in mind. Many people are not very bright, and don't realize how serious drug interactions can be, ESPECIALLY with little to no tolerance. A lot of other overdoses occur from people mixing heroin/opiates/alcohol with benzos. Without serious tolerance to all/any of these drugs, especially benzos, this is an incredibly potential lethal combination. I have been using opiates/heroin for well over 5 years now, and nearly every time I hear about someone overdosing & dying, it is either a result of benzos+opiates/alcohol, or from relapsing without stopping to think about how low their tolerance has become. 

A third killer is easily a result from mixing heroin with cocaine. It is true that many experienced users are able to handle a speedball, but even with a high tolerance, people still have died. And I assure you, cocaine overdose is NOT fun. The majority of users don't speedball, and if you haven't tried coke+heroin IV, do yourself a favor and just don't try it or your addiction will get far worse. I sincerely hope any heroin/opiate/benzo/alcohol users will heed my warning & remember this vital information forever. Share it with your friends, but most of all, be SAFE.

  "wikipedia": `# Heroin
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin*

Heroin, also known as diacetylmorphine and diamorphine among other names, is a morphinan opioid substance synthesized from the dried latex of the opium poppy; it is mainly used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. Heroin is used medically in several countries to relieve pain, such as during childbirth or a heart attack, as well as in opioid replacement therapy. Medical-grade diamorphine is used as a pure hydrochloride salt. Various white and brown powders sold illegally around the world as heroin are routinely diluted with cutting agents. Black tar heroin is a variable admixture of morphine derivatives—predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is the result of crude acetylation during clandestine production of street heroin.
Heroin is typically injected, usually into a vein, but it can also be snorted, smoked, or inhaled. In a clinical context, the route of administration is most commonly intravenous injection; it may also be given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, as well as orally in the form of tablets. The onset of effects is usually rapid and lasts for a few hours.
Common side effects include respiratory depression (decreased breathing), dry mouth, drowsiness, impaired mental function, constipation, and addiction. Use by injection can also result in abscesses, infected heart valves, blood-borne infections, and pneumonia. After a history of long-term use, opioid withdrawal symptoms can begin within hours of the last use. When given by injection into a vein, heroin has two to three times the effect of a similar dose of morphine. It typically appears in the form of a white or brown powder.
Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications. Medications can include buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone. A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone. As of 2015, an estimated 17 million people use opiates non-medically, of which heroin is the most common, and opioid use resulted in 122,000 deaths; also, as of 2015, the total number of heroin users worldwide is believed to have increased in Africa, the Americas, and Asia since 2000. In the United States, approximately 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point. When people die from overdosing on a drug, the drug is usually an opioid and often heroin.
Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and it is generally illegal to make, possess, or sell without a license. About 448 tons of heroin were made in 2016. In 2015, Afghanistan produced about 66% of the world's opium. Illegal heroin is often mixed with other substances such as sugar, starch, caffeine, quinine, or other opioids like fentanyl.

## Uses

### Recreational

Bayer's original trade name of heroin is typically used in non-medical settings. It is used as a recreational drug for the euphoria it induces. Anthropologist Michael Agar once described heroin as "the perfect whatever drug." Tolerance develops quickly, and increased doses are needed in order to achieve the same effects. Its popularity with recreational drug users, compared to morphine, reportedly stems from its perceived different effects.
Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance to heroin and morphine developed at a similar rate. When compared to the opioids hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and pethidine (meperidine), former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to misuse and causing dependence. Morphine and heroin were also much more likely to produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids.

### Medical uses

In the United States, heroin is not accepted as medically useful.
Under the generic name diamorphine, heroin is prescribed as a strong pain medication in the United Kingdom, where it is administered via oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intranasal or intravenous routes. It may be prescribed for the treatment of acute pain, such as in severe physical trauma, myocardial infarction, post-surgical pain and chronic pain, including end-stage terminal illnesses. In other countries it is more common to use morphine or other strong opioids in these situations. 
The UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has produced guidance on the management of caesarean section, which recommends the use of intrathecal or epidural diamorphine for post-operative pain relief. For women who have had intrathecal opioids including diamorphine, there should be a minimum hourly observation of respiratory rate, sedation and pain scores for at least 12 hours if risk factors for respiratory depression are present. Women should be offered diamorphine (up to 0.3mg intrathecally) for intra- and postoperative analgesia because it reduces the need for supplemental analgesia after a caesarean section. Epidural diamorphine (up to 3mg) is a suitable alternative.
Diamorphine continues to be widely used in palliative care in the UK, where it is commonly given by the subcutaneous route, often via a syringe driver if patients cannot easily swallow morphine solution. The advantage of diamorphine over morphine is that diamorphine is more fat soluble and therefore more potent by injection, so smaller doses of it are needed for the same effect on pain. Both of these factors are advantageous if giving high doses of opioids via the subcutaneous route, which is often necessary for palliative care.
It is also used in the palliative management of bone fractures and other trauma, especially in children. In the trauma context, it is primarily given by nose in hospital; although a prepared nasal spray is available, it has traditionally been made by the attending physician, generally from the same "dry" ampoules as used for injection. In children, Ayendi nasal spray is available at 720 micrograms and 1600 micrograms per 50 microlitres actuation of the spray, which may be preferable as a non-invasive alternative in pediatric care, avoiding the fear of injection in children.

#### Maintenance therapy

A number of European countries prescribe heroin for treatment of heroin addiction. The initial Swiss HAT (heroin-assisted treatment) trial ("PROVE" study) was conducted as a prospective cohort study with some 1,000 participants in 18 treatment centers between 1994 and 1996, at the end of 2004, 1,200 patients were enrolled in HAT in 23 treatment centers across Switzerland. Diamorphine may be used as a maintenance drug to assist the treatment of opiate addiction, normally in long-term chronic intravenous (IV) heroin users. It is only prescribed following exhaustive efforts at treatment via other means. It is sometimes thought that heroin users can walk into a clinic and walk out with a prescription, but the process takes many weeks before a prescription for diamorphine is issued. Though this is somewhat controversial among proponents of a zero-tolerance drug policy, it has proven superior to methadone in improving the social and health situations of addicts.
The UK Department of Health's Rolleston Committee Report in 1926 established the British approach to diamorphine prescription to users, which was maintained for the next 40 years: dealers were prosecuted, but doctors could prescribe diamorphine to users when withdrawing. In 1964, the Brain Committee recommended that only selected approved doctors working at approved specialized centres be allowed to prescribe diamorphine and cocaine to users. The law was made more restrictive in 1968. Beginning in the 1970s, the emphasis shifted to abstinence and the use of methadone; currently, only a small number of users in the UK are prescribed diamorphine.
In 1994, Switzerland began a trial diamorphine maintenance program for users that had failed multiple withdrawal programs. The aim of this program was to maintain the health of the user by avoiding medical problems stemming from the illicit use of diamorphine. The first trial in 1994 involved 340 users, although enrollment was later expanded to 1000, based on the apparent success of the program. The trials proved diamorphine maintenance to be superior to other forms of treatment in improving the social and health situation for this group of patients. It has also been shown to save money, despite high treatment expenses, as it significantly reduces costs incurred by trials, incarceration, health interventions and delinquency. Patients appear twice daily at a treatment center, where they inject their dose of diamorphine under the supervision of medical staff. They are required to contribute about 450 Swiss francs per month to the treatment costs. A national referendum in November 2008 showed 68% of voters supported the plan, introducing diamorphine prescription into federal law. The previous trials were based on time-limited executive ordinances. The success of the Swiss trials led German, Dutch, and Canadian cities to try out their own diamorphine prescription programs. Some Australian cities (such as Sydney) have instituted legal diamorphine supervised injecting centers, in line with other wider harm minimization programs.
Since January 2009, Denmark has prescribed diamorphine to a few addicts who have tried methadone and buprenorphine without success. Beginning in February 2010, addicts in Copenhagen and Odense became eligible to receive free diamorphine. Later in 2010, other cities including Århus and Esbjerg joined the scheme. It was estimated that around 230 addicts would be able to receive free diamorphine.
However, Danish addicts would only be able to inject heroin according to the policy set by Danish National Board of Health. Of the estimated 1500 drug users who did not benefit from the then-current oral substitution treatment, approximately 900 would not be in the target group for treatment with injectable diamorphine, either because of "massive multiple drug abuse of non-opioids" or "not wanting treatment with injectable diamorphine".
In July 2009, the German Bundestag passed a law allowing diamorphine prescription as a standard treatment for addicts; a large-scale trial of diamorphine prescription had been authorized in the country in 2002.
On 26 August 2016, Health Canada issued regulations amending prior regulations it had issued under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; the "New Classes of Practitioners Regulations", the "Narcotic Control Regulations", and the "Food and Drug Regulations", to allow doctors to prescribe diamorphine to people who have a severe opioid addiction who have not responded to other treatments. The prescription heroin can be accessed by doctors through Health Canada's Special Access Programme (SAP) for "emergency access to drugs for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional treatments have failed, are unsuitable, or are unavailable."

## Routes of administration

The onset of heroin's effects depends upon the route of administration. Smoking is the fastest route of drug administration, although intravenous injection results in a quicker rise in blood concentration. These are followed by suppository (anal or vaginal insertion), insufflation (snorting), and ingestion (swallowing).
A 2002 study suggests that a fast onset of action increases the reinforcing effects of addictive drugs. Ingestion does not produce a rush as a forerunner to the high experienced with the use of heroin, which is most pronounced with intravenous use. While the onset of the rush induced by injection can occur in as little as a few seconds, the oral route of administration requires approximately half an hour before the high sets in. Thus, with both higher the dosage of heroin used and faster the route of administration used, the higher the potential risk for psychological dependence/addiction.
Large doses of heroin can cause fatal respiratory depression, and the drug has been used for suicide or as a murder weapon. The serial killer Harold Shipman used diamorphine on his victims, and the subsequent Shipman Inquiry led to a tightening of the regulations surrounding the storage, prescribing and destruction of controlled drugs in the UK.
Because significant tolerance to respiratory depression develops quickly with continued use and is lost just as quickly during withdrawal, it is often difficult to determine whether a heroin lethal overdose was accidental, suicide or homicide. Examples include the overdose deaths of Sid Vicious, Janis Joplin, Tim Buckley, Hillel Slovak, Layne Staley, Bradley Nowell, Ted Binion, and River Phoenix.

### By mouth

Use of heroin by mouth is less common than other methods of administration, mainly because there is little to no "rush", and the effects are less potent. Heroin is entirely converted to morphine by means of first-pass metabolism, resulting in deacetylation when ingested. Heroin's oral bioavailability is both dose-dependent (as is morphine's) and significantly higher than oral use of morphine itself, reaching up to 64.2% for high doses and 45.6% for low doses; opiate-naive users showed far less absorption of the drug at low doses, having bioavailabilities of only up to 22.9%. The maximum plasma concentration of morphine following oral administration of heroin was around twice as much as that of oral morphine.

### Injection

Injection, also known as "slamming", "banging", "shooting up", "digging" or "mainlining", is a popular method which carries relatively greater risks than other methods of administration. Heroin base (commonly found in Europe), when prepared for injection, will only dissolve in water when mixed with an acid (most commonly citric acid powder or lemon juice) and heated. Heroin in the east-coast United States is most commonly found in the hydrochloride salt form, requiring just water (and no heat) to dissolve. Users tend to initially inject in the easily accessible arm veins, but as these veins collapse over time, users resort to more dangerous areas of the body, such as the femoral vein in the groin. Some medical professionals have expressed concern over this route of administration, as they suspect that it can lead to deep vein thrombosis.
Intravenous users can use a variable single dose range using a hypodermic needle. The dose of heroin used for recreational purposes is dependent on the frequency and level of use.
As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users share a common needle without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as HIV/AIDS or hepatitis, can be transmitted. The use of a common dispenser for water for the use in the preparation of the injection, as well as the sharing of spoons and filters can also cause the spread of blood-borne diseases. Many countries now supply small sterile spoons and filters for single use in order to prevent the spread of disease.

### Smoking

Smoking heroin refers to vaporizing it to inhale the resulting fumes, rather than burning and inhaling the smoke. It is commonly smoked in glass pipes made from glassblown Pyrex tubes and light bulbs. Heroin may be smoked from aluminium foil that is heated by a flame underneath it, with the resulting smoke inhaled through a tube of rolled up foil, a method also known as "chasing the dragon".

### Insufflation

Another popular route to intake heroin is insufflation (snorting), where a user crushes the heroin into a fine powder and then gently inhales it (sometimes with a straw or a rolled-up banknote, as with cocaine) into the nose, where heroin is absorbed through the soft tissue in the mucous membrane of the sinus cavity and straight into the bloodstream. This method of administration redirects first-pass metabolism, with a quicker onset and higher bioavailability than oral administration, though the duration of action is shortened. This method is sometimes preferred by users who do not want to prepare and administer heroin for injection or smoking but still want to experience a fast onset. Snorting heroin becomes an often unwanted route, once a user begins to inject the drug. The user may still get high on the drug from snorting, and experience a nod, but will not get a rush. A "rush" is caused by a large amount of heroin entering the body at once. When the drug is taken in through the nose, the user does not get the rush because the drug is absorbed slowly rather than instantly.
Heroin for pain has been mixed with sterile water on site by the attending physician, and administered using a syringe with a nebulizer tip. Heroin may be used for fractures, burns, finger-tip injuries, suturing, and wound re-dressing, but is inappropriate in head injuries.

### Suppository

Little research has been focused on the suppository (anal insertion), also known as "plugging". These methods of administration are commonly carried out using an oral syringe. Heroin can be dissolved and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. The rectum or the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would likely be taken up, through the membranes lining their walls.

## Adverse effects

Heroin is classified as a hard drug in terms of drug harmfulness. Like most opioids, unadulterated heroin may lead to adverse effects. The purity of street heroin varies greatly, leading to overdoses when the purity is higher than expected.

### Short-term effects

Users report an intense rush, an acute transcendent state of euphoria, which occurs while diamorphine is being metabolized into 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine in the brain. Some believe that heroin produces more euphoria than other opioids; one possible explanation is the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine, a metabolite unique to heroin – although a more likely explanation is the rapidity of onset. While other opioids of recreational use produce only morphine, heroin also leaves 6-MAM, also a psycho-active metabolite.
However, this perception is not supported by the results of clinical studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of injected heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opioids; these subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness.
The rush is usually accompanied by a warm flushing of the skin, dry mouth, and a heavy feeling in the extremities. Nausea, vomiting, and severe itching may also occur. After the initial effects, users usually will be drowsy for several hours; mental function is clouded; heart function slows, and breathing is also severely slowed, sometimes enough to be life-threatening. Slowed breathing can also lead to coma and permanent brain damage. Heroin use has also been associated with myocardial infarction.

### Long-term effects

Repeated heroin use changes the physical structure and physiology of the brain, creating long-term imbalances in neuronal and hormonal systems that are not easily reversed. Studies have shown some deterioration of the brain's white matter due to heroin use, which may affect decision-making abilities, the ability to regulate behavior, and responses to stressful situations. Heroin also produces profound degrees of tolerance and physical dependence. Tolerance occurs when more and more of the drug is required to achieve the same effects. With physical dependence, the body adapts to the presence of the drug, and withdrawal symptoms occur if use is reduced abruptly.

### Injection

Intravenous use of heroin (and any other substance) with needles and syringes or other related equipment may lead to:

Contracting blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis via the sharing of needles
Contracting bacterial or fungal endocarditis and possibly venous sclerosis
Abscesses
Poisoning from contaminants added to "cut" or dilute heroin
Decreased kidney function (nephropathy), although it is not currently known if this is because of adulterants or infectious diseases

### Smoking

Inhaling heroin appears to rarely lead to toxic leukoencephalopathy. There are also documented cases of both severe acute asthma and exacerbation of underlying asthma caused by heroin inhalation, potentially resulting in death.

### Withdrawal

The withdrawal syndrome from heroin may begin within as little as two hours of discontinuation of the drug; however, this time frame can fluctuate with the degree of tolerance as well as the amount of the last consumed dose, and more typically begins within 6–24 hours after cessation. Symptoms may include sweating, malaise, anxiety, depression, akathisia, priapism, extra sensitivity of the genitals in females, general feeling of heaviness, excessive yawning or sneezing, rhinorrhea, insomnia, cold sweats, chills, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, watery eyes, fever, cramp-like pains, and involuntary spasms in the limbs (thought to be an origin of the term "kicking the habit").

## Overdose

Heroin overdose is usually treated with the opioid antagonist naloxone. This reverses the effects of heroin and causes an immediate return of consciousness but may result in withdrawal symptoms. The half-life of naloxone is shorter than some opioids, such that it may need to be given multiple times until the opioid has been metabolized by the body.
Between 2012 and 2015, heroin was the leading cause of drug-related deaths in the United States. Since then, fentanyl has been a more common cause of drug-related deaths.
Depending on drug interactions and numerous other factors, death from overdose can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours. Death usually occurs due to lack of oxygen resulting from the lack of breathing caused by the opioid. Heroin overdoses can occur because of an unexpected increase in the dose or purity or because of diminished opioid tolerance. However, many fatalities reported as overdoses are probably caused by interactions with other depressant drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepines. Since heroin can cause nausea and vomiting, a significant number of deaths attributed to heroin overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious person. Some sources quote the median lethal dose (for an average 75 kg opiate-naive individual) as being between 75 and 600 mg. Illicit heroin is of widely varying and unpredictable purity. This means that the user may prepare what they consider to be a moderate dose while actually taking far more than intended. Also, tolerance typically decreases after a period of abstinence. If this occurs and the user takes a dose comparable to their previous use, the user may experience drug effects that are much greater than expected, potentially resulting in an overdose. It has been speculated that an unknown portion of heroin-related deaths are the result of an overdose or allergic reaction to quinine, which may sometimes be used as a cutting agent.

## Pharmacology

When taken orally, heroin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism via deacetylation, making it a prodrug for the systemic delivery of morphine. When the drug is injected, however, it avoids this first-pass effect, very rapidly crossing the blood–brain barrier because of the presence of the acetyl groups, which render it much more fat soluble than morphine itself. Once in the brain, it then is deacetylated variously into the inactive 3-monoacetylmorphine and the active 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), and then to morphine, which bind to μ-opioid receptors, resulting in the drug's euphoric, analgesic (pain relief), and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects; heroin itself exhibits relatively low affinity for the μ receptor. Analgesia follows from the activation of the μ receptor G-protein coupled receptor, which indirectly hyperpolarizes the neuron, reducing the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters, and hence, causes analgesia and increased pain tolerance.
Unlike hydromorphone and oxymorphone, however, administered intravenously, heroin creates a larger histamine release, similar to morphine, resulting in the feeling of a greater subjective "body high" to some, but also instances of pruritus (itching) when they first start using.
Normally, GABA, which is released from inhibitory neurones, inhibits the release of dopamine. Opiates, like heroin and morphine, decrease the inhibitory activity of such neurones. This causes increased release of dopamine in the brain which is the reason for euphoric and rewarding effects of heroin.
Both morphine and 6-MAM are μ-opioid agonists that bind to receptors present throughout the brain, spinal cord, and gut of all mammals. The μ-opioid receptor also binds endogenous opioid peptides such as β-endorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin. Repeated use of heroin results in a number of physiological changes, including an increase in the production of μ-opioid receptors (upregulation). These physiological alterations lead to tolerance and dependence, so that stopping heroin use results in uncomfortable symptoms including pain, anxiety, muscle spasms, and insomnia called the opioid withdrawal syndrome. Depending on usage it has an onset 4–24 hours after the last dose of heroin. Morphine also binds to δ- and κ-opioid receptors.
There is also evidence that 6-MAM binds to a subtype of μ-opioid receptors that are also activated by the morphine metabolite morphine-6β-glucuronide but not morphine itself. The third subtype of third opioid type is the mu-3 receptor, which may be a commonality to other six-position monoesters of morphine. The contribution of these receptors to the overall pharmacology of heroin remains unknown.
A subclass of morphine derivatives, namely the 3,6 esters of morphine, with similar effects and uses, includes the clinically used strong analgesics nicomorphine (Vilan), and dipropanoylmorphine; there is also the latter's dihydromorphine analogue, diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin). Two other 3,6 diesters of morphine invented in 1874–75 along with diamorphine, dibenzoylmorphine and acetylpropionylmorphine, were made as substitutes after it was outlawed in 1925 and, therefore, sold as the first "designer drugs" until they were outlawed by the League of Nations in 1930.

## Chemistry

Diamorphine is produced from acetylation of morphine derived from natural opium sources, generally using acetic anhydride.
The major metabolites of diamorphine, 6-MAM, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide, and morphine-6-glucuronide, may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Most commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with these metabolites, as well as with other biotransformation products likely to be present following usage of street-grade diamorphine such as 6-Monoacetylcodeine and codeine. However, chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the diamorphine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opiate-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of these metabolites in his system. Furthermore, some testing procedures employ a hydrolysis step before quantitation that converts many of the metabolic products to morphine, yielding a result that may be 2 times larger than with a method that examines each product individually.

## History

The opium poppy was cultivated in lower Mesopotamia as long ago as 3400 BC. The chemical analysis of opium in the 19th century revealed that most of its activity could be ascribed to the alkaloids codeine and morphine.
Diamorphine was first synthesized in 1874 by C. R. Alder Wright, an English chemist working at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London who had been experimenting combining morphine with various acids. He boiled anhydrous morphine alkaloid with acetic anhydride for several hours and produced a more potent, acetylated form of morphine which is now called diacetylmorphine or morphine diacetate. He sent the compound to F. M. Pierce of Owens College in Manchester for analysis. Pierce told Wright:

Doses… were subcutaneously injected into young dogs and rabbit… with the following general results… great prostration, fear, and sleepiness speedily following the administration, the eyes being sensitive, and pupils constrict, considerable salivation being produced in dogs, and a slight tendency to vomiting in some cases, but no actual emesis. Respiration was at first quickened, but subsequently reduced, and the heart's action was diminished and rendered irregular. Marked want of coordinating power over the muscular movements, and loss of power in the pelvis and hind limbs, together with a diminution of temperature in the rectum of about 4°.

Wright's invention did not lead to any further developments, and diamorphine became popular only after it was independently re-synthesized 23 years later by chemist Felix Hoffmann. Hoffmann was working at Bayer pharmaceutical company in Elberfeld, Germany, and his supervisor Heinrich Dreser instructed him to acetylate morphine with the objective of producing codeine, a constituent of the opium poppy that is pharmacologically similar to morphine but less potent and less addictive. Instead, the experiment produced an acetylated form of morphine one and a half to two times more potent than morphine itself. Hoffmann synthesized heroin on 21 August 1897, just eleven days after he had synthesized aspirin.
The head of Bayer's research department reputedly coined the drug's new name of "heroin", based on the German heroisch which means "heroic, strong" (from the ancient Greek word "heros, ήρως"). Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led the commercialization of heroin.
Bayer marketed diacetylmorphine as an over-the-counter drug under the trademark name Heroin. It was developed chiefly as a morphine substitute for cough suppressants that did not have morphine's addictive side-effects. Morphine at the time was a popular recreational drug, and Bayer wished to find a similar but non-addictive substitute to market. However, contrary to Bayer's advertising as a "non-addictive morphine substitute", heroin would soon have one of the highest rates of addiction among its users.
From 1898 through to 1910, diamorphine was marketed under the trademark name Heroin as a non-addictive morphine substitute and cough suppressant. In the 11th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica (1910), the article on morphine states: "In the cough of phthisis minute doses [of morphine] are of service, but in this particular disease morphine is frequently better replaced by codeine or by heroin, which checks irritable coughs without the narcotism following upon the administration of morphine."
In the US, the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act was passed in 1914 to control the sale and distribution of diacetylmorphine and other opioids, which allowed the drug to be prescribed and sold for medical purposes. In 1924, the United States Congress banned its sale, importation, or manufacture. It is now a Schedule I substance, which makes it illegal for non-medical use in signatory nations of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs treaty, including the United States.
The Health Committee of the League of Nations banned diacetylmorphine in 1925, although it took more than three years for this to be implemented. In the meantime, the first designer drugs, viz. 3,6 diesters and 6 monoesters of morphine and acetylated analogues of closely related drugs like hydromorphone and dihydromorphine, were produced in massive quantities to fill the worldwide demand for diacetylmorphine—this continued until 1930 when the Committee banned diacetylmorphine analogues with no therapeutic advantage over drugs already in use, the first major legislation of this type.
Bayer lost some of its trademark rights to heroin (as well as aspirin) under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles following the German defeat in World War I.
Use of heroin by jazz musicians in particular was prevalent in the mid-twentieth century, including Billie Holiday, saxophonists Charlie Parker and Art Pepper, trumpeter and vocalist Chet Baker, guitarist Joe Pass and piano player/singer Ray Charles; a "staggering number of jazz musicians were addicts". It was also a problem with many rock musicians, particularly from the late 1960s through the 1990s. Pete Doherty is also a self-confessed user of heroin. Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain's heroin addiction was well documented. Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo turned to heroin while touring during the 1990s to cope with his back pain. James Taylor, Taylor Hawkins, Jimmy Page, John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Johnny Winter, Keith Richards, Shaun Ryder, Shane MacGowan and Janis Joplin also used heroin. Many musicians have made songs referencing their heroin usage.

## Society and culture

### Names

Diamorphine is the international nonproprietary name and the British Approved Name. Other synonyms for heroin include: diacetylmorphine, and morphine diacetate. Heroin is also known by many street names including Big H, Black Tar, Chiva, Hell Dust, Horse, Negra, Smack, Thunder, dope, H, smack, junk, skag, brown, and unga, among others.

### Legal status

#### Asia

In Hong Kong, diamorphine is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. It is available by prescription. Anyone supplying diamorphine without a valid prescription can be fined \$5,000,000 (HKD) and imprisoned for life. The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing diamorphine is a \$5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of diamorphine without a license from the Department of Health is illegal with a \$1,000,000 (HKD) fine and seven years of jail time.

#### Europe

In the Netherlands, diamorphine is a List I drug of the Opium Law. It is available for prescription under tight regulation exclusively to long-term addicts for whom methadone maintenance treatment has failed. It cannot be used to treat severe pain or other illnesses.
In the United Kingdom, diamorphine is available by prescription, though it is a restricted Class A drug. According to the 50th edition of the British National Formulary (BNF), diamorphine hydrochloride may be used in the treatment of acute pain, myocardial infarction, acute pulmonary oedema, and chronic pain. The treatment of chronic non-malignant pain must be supervised by a specialist. The BNF notes that all opioid analgesics cause dependence and tolerance but that this is "no deterrent in the control of pain in terminal illness". When used in the palliative care of cancer patients, diamorphine is often injected using a syringe driver.
In Switzerland, heroin is produced in injectable or tablet form under the brand name Diaphin by a private company under contract to the Swiss government. Swiss-produced heroin has been imported into Canada with government approval.

#### Australia

In Australia, diamorphine is listed as a schedule 9 prohibited substance under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). The state of Western Australia, in its Poisons Act 1964 (Reprint 6: amendments as at 10 September 2004), described a schedule 9 drug as: "Poisons that are drugs of abuse, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except for amounts which may be necessary for educational, experimental or research purposes conducted with the approval of the Governor."

#### North America

In Canada, diamorphine is a controlled substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). Any person seeking or obtaining diamorphine without disclosing authorization 30 days before obtaining another prescription from a practitioner is guilty of an indictable offense and subject to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. Possession of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking is an indictable offense and subject to imprisonment for life.
In the United States, diamorphine is a Schedule I drug according to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, making it illegal to possess without a DEA license. Possession of more than 100 grams of diamorphine or a mixture containing diamorphine is punishable with a minimum mandatory sentence of five years of imprisonment in a federal prison.
In 2021, the US state of Oregon became the first state to decriminalize the use of heroin after voters passed Ballot Measure 110 in 2020. This measure will allow people with small amounts to avoid arrest.

#### Turkey

Turkey maintains strict laws against the use, possession or trafficking of illegal drugs. If convicted under these offences, one could receive a heavy fine or a prison sentence of 4 to 24 years.

#### Misuse of prescription medication

Misused prescription medicine, such as opioids, can lead to heroin use and dependence. The number of death from illegal opioid overdose follows the increasing number of death caused by prescription opioid overdoses. Prescription opioids are relatively easy to obtain. This may ultimately lead to heroin injection because heroin is cheaper than prescribed pills.

### Pharmaceutical supply chain

#### Production

##### Legal opium production

Heroin is produced from opium, which is regulated differently around the world. Unlike coca leaves in Peru—handled exclusively by the state monopoly, the National Coca Company (ENACO)—there is no state company dedicated to the commercialization of opium and its derivatives. While international treaties—such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961)—require strict state control or monopoly over the legal production and commercialization of opium for medical and scientific purposes, in practice, only a few countries maintain such a state monopoly today. Notably, India operates a state monopoly through the Government Opium and Alkaloid Factories (GOAF), also known as Opium and Alkaloid Works, which is responsible for processing raw opium into alkaloids for the pharmaceutical industry and managing the legal opium trade for medical and scientific use. Legal opium production in India, as well as in countries such as Turkey, Australia, France, Japan, and the UK, supplies licensed pharmaceutical manufacturers under close supervision to prevent diversion to illicit markets.

##### Licensed pharmaceutical manufacturers

Heroin and its production and distribution are strictly regulated by government health authorities and subject to international drug control treaties. In countries where medical diamorphine (heroin) is legal, a small number of licensed pharmaceutical manufacturers are authorized to produce diamorphine from morphine, which is derived from legally cultivated opium poppy. All manufacturing and handling are conducted by these licensed companies under close government oversight, operating under stringent national and international regulations. Their activities are monitored by agencies such as the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), and the entire supply chain—from opium cultivation to the final pharmaceutical product—is subject to quotas, licensing, and detailed reporting requirements to prevent diversion to illicit markets.

#### Distribution

Diamorphine produced by licensed manufacturers is distributed to hospitals and clinics for medical use, primarily for pain management and, in some countries, for heroin-assisted treatment of opioid dependence. Distribution within the health care system is tightly controlled, and all use is documented and audited by health authorities. There is no commercial retail market for diamorphine; it is dispensed only by prescription and administered under medical supervision.

### Illicit supply chain

#### Production

Diamorphine is produced from acetylation of morphine derived from natural opium sources. One such method of heroin production involves isolation of the water-soluble components of raw opium, including morphine, in a strongly basic aqueous solution, followed by recrystallization of the morphine base by addition of ammonium chloride. The solid morphine base is then filtered out. The morphine base is then reacted with acetic anhydride, which forms heroin. This highly impure brown heroin base may then undergo further purification steps, which produces a white-colored product; the final products have a different appearance depending on purity and have different names. Heroin purity has been classified into four grades. No.4 is the purest form – white powder (salt) to be easily dissolved and injected. No.3 is "brown sugar" for smoking (base). No.1 and No.2 are unprocessed raw heroin (salt or base).

#### Trafficking

Traffic is heavy worldwide, with the biggest producer being Afghanistan. According to a U.N. sponsored survey, in 2004, Afghanistan accounted for production of 87 percent of the world's diamorphine. Afghan opium kills around 100,000 people annually.
In 2003 The Independent reported:

The cultivation of opium [in Afghanistan] reached its peak in 1999, when 350 square miles (910 km2) of poppies were sown ... The following year the Taliban banned poppy cultivation, ... a move which cut production by 94 percent ... By 2001 only 30 square miles (78 km2) of land were in use for growing opium poppies. A year later, after American and British troops had removed the Taliban and installed the interim government, the land under cultivation leapt back to 285 square miles (740 km2), with Afghanistan supplanting Burma to become the world's largest opium producer once more.
Opium production in that country has increased rapidly since, reaching an all-time high in 2006. War in Afghanistan once again appeared as a facilitator of the trade. Some 3.3 million Afghans are involved in producing opium.

At present, opium poppies are mostly grown in Afghanistan (224,000 hectares (550,000 acres)), and in Southeast Asia, especially in the region known as the Golden Triangle straddling Burma (57,600 hectares (142,000 acres)), Thailand, Vietnam, Laos (6,200 hectares (15,000 acres)) and Yunnan province in China. There is also cultivation of opium poppies in Pakistan (493 hectares (1,220 acres)), Mexico (12,000 hectares (30,000 acres)) and in Colombia (378 hectares (930 acres)). According to the DEA, the majority of the heroin consumed in the United States comes from Mexico (50%) and Colombia (43–45%) via Mexican criminal cartels such as Sinaloa Cartel. However, these statistics may be significantly unreliable, the DEA's 50/50 split between Colombia and Mexico is contradicted by the amount of hectares cultivated in each country and in 2014, the DEA claimed most of the heroin in the US came from Colombia.
As of 2015, the Sinaloa Cartel is the most active drug cartel involved in smuggling illicit drugs such as heroin into the United States and trafficking them throughout the United States. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 90% of the heroin seized in Canada (where the origin was known) came from Afghanistan. Pakistan is the destination and transit point for 40 percent of the opiates produced in Afghanistan, other destinations of Afghan opiates are Russia, Europe and Iran.
A conviction for trafficking heroin carries the death penalty in most Southeast Asian, some East Asian and Middle Eastern countries (see Use of death penalty worldwide for details), among which Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are the strictest. The penalty applies even to citizens of countries where the penalty is not in place, sometimes causing controversy when foreign visitors are arrested for trafficking, for example, the arrest of nine Australians in Bali, the death sentence given to Nola Blake in Thailand in 1987, or the hanging of an Australian citizen Van Tuong Nguyen in Singapore.

##### Routes

###### The Balkan route

The Balkan route remains the principal corridor for trafficking illegal opiates, primarily heroin, from Afghanistan to Western and Central Europe, with criminal networks-often highly organized and adaptable-leveraging both legal businesses and corruption to facilitate the smuggling, storage, and distribution of drugs. These groups generate enormous illicit profits, with the annual gross income from drug trafficking along the Balkan route estimated between \$13.9 and \$21.4 billion from 2019 to 2022, of which up to half is illegally moved across borders through complex financial flows that include shell companies, cryptocurrencies, and informal systems like hawala. The majority of these profits, around 90 percent, come from opiates, and the scale of this income rivals or exceeds the GDP of several countries along the route. The movement of these illicit funds not only sustains and expands drug trafficking operations but also undermines economic stability and governance in affected countries, making the Balkan route a persistent and multifaceted challenge for law enforcement and policymakers in the region.

##### Trafficking history

The origins of the present international illegal heroin trade can be traced back to laws passed in many countries in the early 1900s that closely regulated the production and sale of opium and its derivatives including heroin. At first, heroin flowed from countries where it was still legal into countries where it was no longer legal. By the mid-1920s, heroin production had been made illegal in many parts of the world. An illegal trade developed at that time between heroin labs in China (mostly in Shanghai and Tianjin) and other nations. The weakness of the government in China and conditions of civil war enabled heroin production to take root there. Chinese triad gangs eventually came to play a major role in the illicit heroin trade. The French Connection route started in the 1930s.
Heroin trafficking was virtually eliminated in the US during World War II because of temporary trade disruptions caused by the war. Japan's war with China had cut the normal distribution routes for heroin and the war had generally disrupted the movement of opium. After World War II, the Mafia took advantage of the weakness of the postwar Italian government and set up heroin labs in Sicily which was located along the historic route opium took westward into Europe and the United States. Large-scale international heroin production effectively ended in China with the victory of the communists in the civil war in the late 1940s. The elimination of Chinese production happened at the same time that Sicily's role in the trade developed.
Although it remained legal in some countries until after World War II, health risks, addiction, and widespread recreational use led most western countries to declare heroin a controlled substance by the latter half of the 20th century. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the CIA supported anti-Communist Chinese Nationalists settled near the Sino-Burmese border and Hmong tribesmen in Laos. This helped the development of the Golden Triangle opium production region, which supplied about one-third of heroin consumed in the US after the 1973 American withdrawal from Vietnam. In 1999, Burma, the heartland of the Golden Triangle, was the second-largest producer of heroin, after Afghanistan.
The Soviet-Afghan war led to increased production in the Pakistani-Afghan border regions, as US-backed mujaheddin militants raised money for arms from selling opium, contributing heavily to the modern Golden Crescent creation. By 1980, 60 percent of the heroin sold in the US originated in Afghanistan. It increased international production of heroin at lower prices in the 1980s. The trade shifted away from Sicily in the late 1970s as various criminal organizations violently fought with each other over the trade. The fighting also led to a stepped-up government law enforcement presence in Sicily.
Following the discovery at a Jordanian airport of a toner cartridge that had been modified into an improvised explosive device, the resultant increased level of airfreight scrutiny led to a major shortage (drought) of heroin from October 2010 until April 2011. This was reported in most of mainland Europe and the UK which led to a price increase of approximately 30 percent in the cost of street heroin and increased demand for diverted methadone. The number of addicts seeking treatment also increased significantly during this period. Other heroin droughts (shortages) have been attributed to cartels restricting supply in order to force a price increase and also to a fungus that attacked the opium crop of 2009. Many people thought that the American government had introduced pathogens into the Afghanistan atmosphere in order to destroy the opium crop and thus starve insurgents of income.
On 13 March 2012, Haji Bagcho, with ties to the Taliban, was convicted by a US District Court of conspiracy, distribution of heroin for importation into the United States and narco-terrorism. Based on heroin production statistics compiled by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in 2006, Bagcho's activities accounted for approximately 20 percent of the world's total production for that year.

#### Street price

The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reports that the retail price of brown heroin varies from €14.5 per gram in Turkey to €110 per gram in Sweden, with most European countries reporting typical prices of €35–40 per gram. The price of white heroin is reported only by a few European countries and ranged between €27 and €110 per gram.
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime claims in its 2008 World Drug Report that typical US retail prices are US\$172 per gram.

## Research

Researchers are attempting to reproduce the biosynthetic pathway that produces morphine in genetically engineered yeast. In June 2015 the S-reticuline could be produced from sugar and R-reticuline could be converted to morphine, but the intermediate reaction could not be performed.
