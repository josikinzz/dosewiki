4-Ethylmethcathinone (4-EMC) is a recreational designer drug of the stimulant and entactogen class. It is a structural isomer of 4-MEC and 3,4-DMMC. It has been identified in many countries around the world, initially in Europe but was first found in Australia in 2020.

## Legal status

In the United States 4-EMC is considered a Schedule I controlled substance as a positional isomer of 4-methylethcathinone (4-MEC).
4-Ethylmethcathinone is a controlled substance in the US state of Vermont as of January 2016. It is also covered by analogue provisions in many other jurisdictions.
