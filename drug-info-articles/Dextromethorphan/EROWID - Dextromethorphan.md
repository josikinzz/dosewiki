DXM
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[DXM Images](https://erowid.org/dxm_images.shtml)
 
Dextromethorphan is a semisynthetic opiate derivative which is legally available over-the-counter in the United States. It is most commonly found in cough suppressants, especially those with "DM" or "Tuss" in their names. It is almost always used orally, although pure DXM powder is occasionally snorted. The effects of DXM generally fall into the category of dissociatives, along with ketamine, PCP, and nitrous. 
 
[ [Main DXM Vault](https://erowid.org/dxm.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/dxm_dose.shtml) #
 
As with many psychoactive substances, dosages of DXM vary greatly, depending on the individual and the desired level of effects. Recreational doses range from 100 mg to 1200 mg or more.
 
Price #
 
Price Summary Needed.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/dxm_law.shtml) #
 
DXM is legal to buy, sell, or possess in the United States although it is increasingly common for stores to require that buyers be over 18 years old. If sold for human consumption, it is regulated by the FDA.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/dxm_chemistry.shtml) #
 
Dextromethorphan hydrobromide (C 18 H 25 NO) is a semisynthetic derivative of [morphine](https://erowid.org/chemicals/morphine/morphine.shtml) , a chemical found in the [opium](https://erowid.org/chemicals/opium/opium.shtml) produced by [opium poppies](https://erowid.org/plants/poppy/poppy.shtml) .
 
Pharmacology #
 
DXM is partially converted by first-pass metabolism into the active compound dextrorphan, which exerts cough-suppressing and dissociative effects through non-competitive antagonism of NMDA receptors. It is non-analgesic and does not cause sedation or respiratory depression. It is readily absorbed and has a half life is around four hours.
 
Production #
 
Production Summary Needed.
 
[History](https://erowid.org/dxm_timeline.php) #
 
DXM was approved for use as a cough suppressant in 1958 and soon became widely available in pill form as a non-narcotic alternative to opiate-based cough suppressants. Cough syrups replaced the pill form in the late 1970s to discourage recreational use.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
DXM; Dextromethorphan; Robo; Tussin.
 
The Experience:
 
Robo-tripping; Tussing; Dexing.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/dxm_effects.shtml) #
 
The DXM experience varies by dose. Different recreational dose ranges are sometimes described in terms of plateaus of effects. Low doses produce a mild stimulant effect. Moderate doses generally produce intoxicating effects that are sometimes compared to alcohol or cannabis use. High doses are dissociative in the sense of causing a feeling of separation from one's body, and are sometimes compared to the effects of other dissociatives such as [PCP](https://erowid.org/chemicals/pcp/pcp.shtml) or [ketamine](https://erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine.shtml) .
 
Onset #
 
DXM takes 20 minutes to 1 hour to take effect, with higher doses generally taking longer. Peak effects of recreational doses begin 1 1/2 to 3 hours after onset.
 
Duration #
 
Effects of low doses generally last 4-6 hours, with large doses lasting 6 hours or more.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
DXM causes physical and psychological effects that may be frightening or unpleasant. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are relatively common. Psychological effects can include profound disorientation, depression, a feeling of personal disintegration, or a feeling of "unreality" and disconnection that may persist for days. Chronic use may cause depression, psychological dependency, and possibly brain damage. Large doses may be associated with psychotic breaks. 
 
 In addition to the risks of DXM itself, many DXM-containing products contain other active ingredients that can be dangerous. Common additives include acetaminophen (Tylenol), which can cause fatal liver-damage in large doses. Products containing [Chlorpheniramine Maleate](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682543.html) such as Coricidin Cough and Cold should especially be avoided. See [DXM Health](https://erowid.org/dxm_health.shtml) for more information.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Do not take while pregnant. Dissociatives can seriously affect fetal brain development. Many DXM-containing products (such as Coricidin Cough and Cold) also contain other active ingredients which can be dangerous or fatal in high doses. See [Guide to DXM in Nonpresescription Drugs](https://erowid.org/dxm_info2.shtml) for more information. Avoid using DXM in combination with alcohol. Do not take DXM if you have recently taken an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). DXM and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not take DXM if you have recently taken an [SSRI](https://erowid.org/pharms/ssris/ssris.shtml) such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), or sertraline (Zoloft). DXM use in combination with other OTC cold remedies can increase risk of adverse reaction.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Dextromethorphan is believed to be physically non-addictive, but some heavy users report an uncommon psychological addiction. Regular use produces tolerance.
 
Long Term Health Problems #
 
There has been concern that DXM, like some other dissociatives, causes vacuoles (small holes) in the brain - a syndrome called Olney's Lesions. However, there is some evidence that these concerns are unfounded.
 
Risk of Death #
 
Risk of Death Summary Needed.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Effects of DXM at low doses can be similar to alcohol, producing carefree clumsiness with a touch of psychedelic and speedy effect. For some, intense and rhythmic music induces a state of euphoria and dancing becomes fun. On a higher dose, imagination can become vividly experienced (not always pleasant), feelings of dissociation from the body can occur and on very high doses profound alterations in consciousness may occur. 
 
 
Contraindications
 
- Avoid using DXM in combination with alcohol. READ THE LABEL - avoid using cold remedies which contain tylenol, CPM or other medications in combination with DXM. Make sure the product contains only DXM as the active ingredient. DXM use in combination with other OTC cold remedies can increase risk of adverse reaction.

DXM Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
DXM comes in many different forms. The most common are various over-the-counter cough suppressants (including Robitussin, Delsym, Pertussin, Drixoral, Vicks Formula 44, and several generic brands). Each brand contains different quantities of dextromethorphan, generally in the 20-30 mg per dose-unit (liquid measure, pill, capsule) range, as well as a variety of other potentially dangerous drugs. It is easy to mis-calculate dosages, so be careful and check to ensure that the product does not contain other [dangerous active ingredients](https://erowid.org/dxm_info2.shtml) such as CPM (see Coricidin Warning below). 
 
 The chart below shows approximate recreational dosages for pure dextromethorphan hydrobromide (HBR), measured in milligrams (mg). Extended release dextromethorphan polistirex has different dosage and duration.
 
- Oral DXM Dosages Thresholdunknown Light100 - 200 mg Common200 - 400 mg Strong300 - 600 mg Heavy600 - 1500 mg Risk of Death2,500 - 20,000 mg 1 | Oral DXM Dosages | Threshold | unknown | Light | 100 - 200 mg | Common | 200 - 400 mg | Strong | 300 - 600 mg | Heavy | 600 - 1500 mg | Risk of Death | 2,500 - 20,000 mg 1
**Oral DXM Dosages**
- Threshold: unknown
- Light: 100 - 200 mg
- Common: 200 - 400 mg
- Strong: 300 - 600 mg
- Heavy: 600 - 1500 mg
- Risk of Death: 2,500 - 20,000 mg 1
**Duration : 4 - 8 hours (DXM HBR) Duration (extended release) : 6 - 12 hours (DXM Polistirex)**
 
 
Some users report that DXM dosages are affected significantly by bodyweight and lighter users should start with lower dosages. Because everyone reacts differently, it is a better idea to start at lower dosages and slowly work up rather than jumping in at a higher dose. Some people are very sensitive to the effects and may be overwhelmed by dosages that are minimal for others.
 
---
 
 
Warnings Coricidin Cough and Cold (CCC or Triple-C) Warning : One of the most common products used as a source of DXM is CCC. This product also contains CPM, which can be dangerous at high doses. Most of the hospitalizations and health problems we hear about resulted from the use of Coricidin Cough and Cold. 
 
 Acetaminophen Warning : DXM products containing acetaminophen should not be used recreationally. High doses of acetaminophen can be fatal. 
 
 DXM products containing other medicines can be harmful if taken in doses above the recommended limits. Dangerous interactions can occur. 
 
 
 
Notes #
 
1. DXM by itself is fairly safe at doses recommended for medical use (10-50 mg) and becomes increasingly dangerous with dose increases, although there are only a few documented deaths associated with DXM taken with no other substances. Long-term health risks of high-dose DXM use are not well documented or quantified. A handful of fatalities have been reported from DXM-alone (more are reported from DXM combined with other drugs), but the dosages taken for these fatal overdoses are uncertain. 
 
 Two overdose deaths were reported by [Rammer, et al.](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6779) , but the dosages were uncertain. Chronic, daily use of DXM dosages of over 500 mg have been reported to Erowid by several individuals, and in a medical study participants were given over 900 mg per day without serious adverse reaction (!?). [Walker, Hunt, 1989](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6780) 
 
 As with any powerful psychoactive substance, high doses are more likely to induce difficult experiences, negative side effects, allergic responses, etc. Many people experience severe itching at doses over 100 mg, which can precipitate anxiety attacks.

**DXM Health Concerns** 
 
 
---
 
 
*** Every individual reacts differently to every substance. * Be mindful at every step. * Know your body. Know your mind. Know your source.** **WARNINGS** 
- Products containing any active ingredients other than 'DXM' or 'Dextromethorphan' should not be used. 
 
- High doses of Guaifenesin can cause severe nausea and vomiting. High doses of [Acetaminophen](https://erowid.org/pharms/acetaminophen/acetaminophen.shtml) can cause liver-damage and may be fatal. Some brands of DXM containing cough-syrups, including Drixoral Cough and Fever contain acetaminophen. High doses of [Chlorpheniramine Maleate](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682543.html) can cause severe and life-threatening symptoms including seizures, loss of consciousness, bleeding from skin, mouth, rectum, and vagina, and possibly death. Some brands, including Coricidin Cough and Cold contain Chlorpheniramine maleate.
 
 Do not take DXM if you are using, or have used an [MAO Inhibitor](https://erowid.org/../maois/maois.shtml) within the last 2 weeks. 
 
- MAOI's include harmine & harmaline, as well as many anti-depressants. 
 Check with a doctor if you're unsure whether you medication contains MAOI's. 
 When combined with MAOI's, DXM can cause "serotonin syndrome" with fever, hypertension, and arrhythmias.
 Do not take DXM if you are using, or have used an [SSRIs](https://erowid.org/chemicals/ssris/ssris.shtml) within the last 2 weeks. 
 
- SSRIs include many anti-depressants, including [Fluoxetine (Prozac)](https://erowid.org/pharms/fluoxetine/fluoxetine.shtml) , [Citalopram (Celexa, Lexapro)](https://erowid.org/pharms/citalopram/citalopram.shtml) , [Paroxetine (Paxil)](https://erowid.org/pharms/paroxetine/paroxetine.shtml) , and others.
- Check with a doctor if you're unsure whether you medication is an SSRI.
- When combined with SSRIs, DXM may cause "serotonin syndrome" with fever, hypertension, arrhythmias, etc.

 Nausea, stomach cramps, and other unpleasant gastro-intestinal effects are common and may persist for days after use. 
 Itching and other skin reactions have been reported. 
 The large amount of glucose, thickeners, etc., present in many cough syrups may be hard on your kidneys and pancreas. 
 Regular or frequent DXM use can lead to craving the experience and to emotional dependence. Although not common, some people go on to use DXM daily and can find it difficult to quit. 
 It is not yet established whether regular use of DXM causes physical dependence (physical withdrawal symptoms upon stopping regular use). Some users report a 1-2 week "hangover" period after stopping use which could suggest mild physical withdrawal. There is no evidence of life-threatening health risks from withdrawal, but there is little data available on the subject. 
 Regular users experience tolerance and require increased dosages to achieve the same level of effects. 
 Olney's Lesions: The theory that DXM may cause this type of brain lesioning is based on extrapolation from other NMDA antagonist actions and is not considered definitive.
 
 Lasting Disordered Thinking, Delusions, Paranoia, Psychosis: Erowid has received numerous self reports from people who have used DXM (dextromethorphan) continuously for months and then suffered from months or years of lasting mental and emotional health problems. There are also published medical papers discussing psychosis, but most are focused on acute drug effects, not on long term lasting distress.

DXM
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**DXM**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Over-The-CounterDrug
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
A bill to restrict bulk sales of Dextromethorphan has been introduced in the US House of Representatives. See [HR 5280 : Dextromethorphan Distribution Act of 2006](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-5280) and [Larsen Introduces Bill to Address DXM Abuse](http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/wa02_larsen/PR_050506_DXM.html) . 
 
 Dextromethorphan is unscheduled in the United States. It is sold over-the-counter as an approved drug and is legal to buy, possess, and ingest without a license or prescription. Sales for human consumption are regulated by the FDA and each formulation or product requires specific FDA approval. Some individuals who have sold DXM have been convicted of selling misbranded drugs, a federal crime.
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
DXM is increasingly difficult to purchase around the U.S. Some pharmacies and mega-stores like WalMart have instituted voluntary procedures to reduce the sale of DXM-containing products to minors. Some states have passed laws further regulating DXM-containing products, but it is still unscheduled (legal to purchase and possess without a prescription) in every state as far as we know. 
 
 We have received reports from several states around the U.S. that WalMart no longer sells DXM products to people under 18 and often asks for ID from those who wish to purchase it. Some areas are now restricting the maximum number of units (boxes, bottles) of DXM-containing product they will sell to one person.

As of June, 2013, it appears that Chinese pharmacies require purchasers of DXM-containing products present ID and the products are almost always behind the counter, but no prescription is required. Many pharmacies record the identity of purchaser along with amount purchased. Previously, DXM-containing products were sold over-the-counter in pills and cough syrups in China. Rules tend to be laxer in rural areas. (thanks am) (last updated Sep 2013)

Hong Kong #
 
We have received conflicting information about DXM sales in Hong Kong. Most recently, a visitor who said they had lived in Hong Kong for seven years and that to purchase DXM does not require a prescription from a doctor, but does require providing the pharmacy with identification.

Other DXM containing products require a prescription for purchase, perhaps based on the quantity per dosage unit.
