**What is "Kava-Kava"?**- "Piper methysticum" also known as "Kava-Kava". Kava-Kava is a member of the pepper family Piperaceae and has widely been used by South Pacific societies for more than three thousand years. In many of these societies, the term "kava" means bitter, sour or sharp. Piper methysticum means "intoxicating pepper" Kavalactones in the "Kava-Kava" is what produces the physiological effects.

Which type would you recommend someone buy to try it out? The regular dried lief, the extracts, the powder? Also could you discuss what a GOOD price on all of these are so we can use it as a basis to not get ripped? I been meaning to try kava for a while ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Forget the capsules, extracts etc, the ONLY way to take kava is by preparing a drink from the powdered root of the plant. Here in the UK, kava is not available for sale, you can however import it for personal use.


I buy mine from a grower in Hawaii...can't post the source here obviously ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Agreed. I get powdered root from Fiji. All those capsules and tinctures pale in comparison.


If your expecting an amazing high from kava you'll be dissapointed. It's a subtle, mellow relaxed feeling, best for chilling at home, reading a book, winding down from a long day.

Yeah I love Kava.  Havne't done any in about a year, but u got me thinking about it again.  Now I have to get some.


I highly reccommend purchasing your Kava online.  While you could purchase some capsules at an organic store and take a lot, I really reccommend pure powder that is meant to be strained and drank.

I recommend that anybody buying capsules check the nutrition panel on the back first to compare the %kavalactones that they contain.  It can vary pretty dramatically from company to company.  All of the capsules that I've seen are not only expensive, but contain a pretty low percent of kavalactones-- usually about 30%, but I've found a few with more.  There isn't anywhere near me that sells the actual roots, but the ones I've seen in online stores have significantly more kavalactones, sometimes as high as 85 or 90 percent.

I used to drink kava hot but was told that the traditional way is to drink it cold. If you really want to drink like the Fijians, use a cloth strainer and drink out of a hollowed out gourd with a group of friends.

I always use the liquid, it is sold in little glass bottles or vile with a dropper in it.

Go with the one that has the most Kavalactones in it. Just read the back side in the nutrients. It tastes really bad so be sure to mix it with a soda (It makes it kick in faster to!) I always mix mine with mtn dew. I use a shot glass or a small old medicine bottle, and make a nice "Kava Slammer".

If you get the good kava with lots of Kavalactones it will make your tongue go numb!

As for the capsules they make all sorts of liquid caps, and powder root caps. I 

try to go with the liquid caps if I can find them, but the powder caps work just as good, (its pretty much the kava-kava root, but crushed into a powder.)

You can also find that kava-kava also comes in a tea box, with the kava already in a tea pouch. These arnt that bad, they have some cinnamon, and other herbs in it to make it taste better, and you don't need hot water!

Also check out youtube, and search for kava kava preparations. Some videos show you how to make the traditional tea.

Enjoy! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

If anyone really wants to get some kind of decent effect you should use powdered kava from a reliable source.

^Yeah that's true, buying it online from a good source is good if you plan on buying the root alone(or the root powder). I've made good friends with a guy that owns a organic food store, and he always orders the best.

Places like "Whole foods" sell all kinds of kava products, and it's normally expensive($15-$50 a vile or capsules). Just be safe when you order straight kava online, try buying a sealed bottle somewhere and try it before you go and buy kava online.

Also kava-kava is **nothing** like **salvia**! It's pretty much a herbal klonopin, and it doesn't show up on a drug test!

Don't be stupid and try to take an entire bottle to feel the effects, kava in really high doses can seriously harm your liver!

Be safe and know what your doing ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

If 7-11 is selling it, its probably not going to get you high.


The fresher the root is which your grinding up or have already ground up, the more of a pronounced effect the Kava will have.

Yes, kava tastes like shit, makes me gag if I'm dropping the drops right into my mouth. That's why i mix it with mtn.dew, or sprite. I try not to taste it, just drink it in one gulp. I have mixed kava powder and ground cinnamon together and brewed a better tasting product.

Kava is the nastiest substance I have ever tasted except for MDA. It tastes like a combination of pepper, dirt, and numbs your mouth like cocaine. Kava works quite well for anxiety and I have gotten a "drunk feeling" from it with higher doses. It's not as good as benzos in my opinion though for anxiety, but still works.


However, the shit you would find at your local health food store will probably not be worth a damn. If you plan on trying Kava then order freshly ground root powder. *<snip>*

Try using indian tonic water (the stuff you mix with gin) instead of cold water to prepare your kava drink. Serve chilled.

I've been a Kava drinker for years and really have come to love the stuff.  It is definitely an acquired taste and the effect is quite subtle, but oh what a nice way to relax after a stressful day.


I like to prepare my Kava by using coconut water.  That is the traditional method that Kava is prepared on many islands in the Pacific and using coconut water also makes a major improvement over the taste of the Kava.


And I agree with the others here who say that using fresh ground Kava root is the best way to enjoy it.  The pills and extracts just do not measure up to preparing a good bowl of ground Kava root, plus, you get the (in my opinion) pleasurable mouth and throat numbing effect from drinking the ground root.

Have you considered getting a 'pre-paid' card? Works just like an ordinary credit card except you have to have to put the money on it before you can spend it, hence no status needed....anyone can get one. You don't even need a bank account, you just 'top it up' like a phone card.


Sorry if thats slightly off-topic, but I thought it worth mentioning. Not being able to order goods online is a pain in the arse lol

Ok normaly organic produce shops sell all kinds of herbal pills and shit. You can look around for the kava extracts. They usualy come in capsule form but most places cary the liquid. The liquids the best imo. It can get pricey bout 20 a pop. It hits u alot quicker than the caps and they have 60%kavatones.

All I can get hold of, I believe, are the Kava Kava capsules.


If the capsules are: Kava (root) 250 mg (30% kavalactones; 75mg)


How many do I need to take?

Ok my capsules are the same I think. Well to start off you don't want to take more than 10, I don't know if you have any history of liver problems, or anything like that in your family. To be safe I would start with 4, it takes me about 20-30mins for the capsules to kick in, as it only takes the liquid 1-5 mins.

I have busted the capsules open before and parachuted the powder before. You gotta make sure all the shit goes down and not let the TP break in your mouth or your breath is going to smell like fucking monkey grass.

I don't see why you cant take kava without beer or a mixd drink. All the extract/liquid is is pure grain alcohol. I wouldn't recommend taking shots of liquor and taking the caps, maybe like a beer or something.


What is the brand name that you bought? Are they Gel caps, or does it look tannish? Does it smell like? strong/weak?


Be carfulL!

Yeah I know what you mean, it all makes since... The kava "extract" tells me: **Contains** certified organic grain alcohol (83-93%) and Kava extractives.

Ok does anyone notice that something funny is going on? If kava is so bad for your liver, why mix it with fucking pure grain alcohol! I still want to be safe and not even try to take super high dose's. 


I make a nice cocktail, 60 drops of the liquid extract(with fresh brew kava), and 4 capsules. It really just puts me in chill mode, since I can't/don't smoke weed, this is the closest thing that I've found to it that's legal.

There are a couple hookah bars around me that sell kava drinks. Has anyone had experience with these? I think my friend has some "Kava Kava" pills from the vitamin store, which am I better off trying, the kava at the hookah bar or in the vitamin store pills?

Get the kava kava drink dude, if it's a legit place your kava brew is going to look like old coconut milk(white cloudy and smell funny) I don't know how freash it is, but if it's a kava bar then they should be making their own drinks.

Ask for some cinnamon mix'd with it, it makes it taste A Lot better.

Enjoy!

kava is kava dude, weather its just in a capsule, powder, or liquid. It may not be like the freash shit when they pull the kava from the earth, but it has all came from the exact same place. So it's not like your getting the scraps of kava because there is no such thing.

If all you have is capsules, break em all open. Check out this kava video in how to make kava tea: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkWU93hMPrA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkWU93hMPrA)

good luck bro! enjoy!

I disagree. I've had capsules and tinctures and they pale in comparison to kava tea made from kava root powder.

**Kava?**


Someone told me that Kava Kava pills that you can pick up from any health food store can calm anxiety in social situations. Anyone know anything about this?

Kava sold in an health food store never worked for my anxiety. But you can order Kava root that's powdered online that works for anxiety. *<snip>* it was cheap and it felt like a benzo. Search around next time though, this is a basic question with basic answers.

> **What is "Kava-Kava"?**- "Piper methysticum" also known as "Kava-Kava". Kava-Kava is a member of the pepper family Piperaceae and has widely been used by South Pacific societies for more than three thousand years. In many of these societies, the term "kava" means bitter, sour or sharp. Piper methysticum means "intoxicating pepper" Kavalactones in the "Kava-Kava" is what produces the physiological effects.

> 
> 
> **How do I take Kava-Kava?** First I want to say that "Kava-Kava" comes in all shapes and size's. You can buy the root alone, and crush it into a powder, and make a tea. You can find it in a liquid extract form, high concentration, and mixed with pure grain alcohol (83-93%!) You can find it in a capsule form, pre-made "tea-bags"(tazo tea's), and most head shops sell Kava-Kava in plastic containers mix'd with flavors,(such as koolaid flavors).

> **What are the effects of Kava-Kava?**-  The effects of drinking kava include slight tongue and lip numbing due to the contraction of blood vessels in these areas, milk talkative and euphoric behavior, calming, a sense of well-being, clear thinking and relaxed muscles. Sleep is restful and there are no after-effects the next day.

> **Is Kava-Kava Safe?**-(I'll read what it saies on the side of my kava-kava bottle). **CAUTION**: FDA advises that a potential risk of rare, but severe, liver injury may be associated with kava. Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have, or have had, liver problems, frequently use of alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if liver symptoms occur (unusual fatigue, abdominal pain, appetite loss, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Do not take with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use may impair ability to drive, or operate machinery.

Just drank some Kava about 20 mintutes ago not feeling anything at all yet, I used 3 tablespoons of pure Kava root blended with a hand blender for 4 minutes in a cup & a quarter of water, strained then left in the fridge to cool for an hour.

I've tried Kava extract before and got nothing, but I assume this is because the unprocessed root is more potent than an extract. Yes?

Not sure about that one I suppose depends on the source, all I can say is the amount I have taken hasn't had any effect similar to what I've read this stuff is supposed to do. I'm feeling a bit more stimulated & motivated to do stuff that much is true, kind of buzzing but that could just be my normal daily variation in mood. 


The source of this Kava is supposed to be real good, maybe I could try eating the whole lot without straining - anyone tried this? next time I'll double the amount & post results.


Edit: The stimulation was just part of normal mood, no noticed effect from Kava.

I think the substance is pretty much hit or miss. It just doesn't work for some people for some reason. Even for the people that it works for, it is not exactly a recreational drug. It just induces a subtle feeling of relaxation.

Subtle is an interesting way of describing it.  I tried four heaping tablespoons with 75mg pregabalin and the next thing I know it's five hours later and I can't remember what I was doing exactly except for that I had been chatting with a friend of mine at the beginning, who now won't talk to me anymore. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

i've had very good luck with the 30x extract - which is a root powder - just stronger...


both ways i've tried it - 1 teaspoon tossed and washed - it does taste yucky - but i love the numb feeling i get from it - great for toothaches or sore throat!!!


and i've tried doing 1/2 a teaspoon and got a relaxed feeling from it too


this stuff rocks for me!  it even helped me sleep without clenching my teeth!  YAY!

OK I'm an idiot, I used 3 desert spoons I now realise, & they were levelled off, now I know what a tablespoon looks like lol, I'll give 3-4 tablespoons a go tomorrow & gulp down the whole lot without straining.

You can try mixing it with other sedatives too -- it tends to play well with others.  I'd never had memory loss from pregabalin before (only thing that gives me amnesia ever is benzos, which are so bad for that that I don't even take them ever).  The one thing I don't like much is the nausea that seems to come with it for me, but in any case the use of it is much healthier feeling than say, alcohol.

I just got a pound of fresh hawaiian root powder, and it's a world away from the capsules and tinctures I'd been using before.  2 heaping tablespoons has got me on my ass, even with amphetamine still in my system, whereas the supplements were only able to quell minor anxiety.  I think blending it for a long time helps; maybe the "reverse tolerance" is simply due to more experience with the extraction process.

I got to drinking Kava while in Fiji.  I really liked it, not just the physical effects, but sitting around with the men, drinking Kava all night long, it was fun.  I have to say though, I bought some powdered root and yech, it tastes nothing like fresh root.

The local smoke shop by my school has a brownish Kava powder, I assume it is root powder-  I am interested in trying because I like valium and could use an alternative.  Is is necessary to use hot water and make tea with root powder?  One cannot just eat it?

You can just eat it, I parachute it.  Drink plenty of water with it though, to avoid indigestion later.

How do the effects of eating and extracting compare? Is either more efficient?

I ended up trying the 2 heaped tablespoons (basically 4 level tablespoons worth) of this root powder after messing up & just using 2 desert spoons the first time, I can safely say it worked nicely & relaxed me, I felt all over calmness & was more sociable around friends, with a big reduction in anxiety.


And back to the previous post where I pondered over whether or not the two desert spoons worth actually stimulated me, (I ended up coming to the conclusion it hadn't) but after receiving the 84% paste recently & trying a small amount of that 0.2g I wasn't able to sleep all night & felt a similar feeling, although I didn't feel a typical stimulating type buzz or anything at all like it, there was certainly something that was preventing me from reaching the onset of sleep. Just to note I've been sleeping really well of late - without any drugs, & I slept fine the night after, nothing was bothering me either I was relaxed.


So it seems for me anyway that taking a larger dose leaves me really calm, relaxed & at ease when socialising, plus when I need to sleep after larger amount (normal dose) I'm at will able to gain a very restful deep sleep, whereas a small dose below the amount that gives me that noticeable calming affect does the opposite, anyone else have this experience with Kava?

Oh yeah & to add this stuff is pretty nasty to drink, hence why I've decided to give the paste a go. I've chewed fresh Salvia leaves before & ok maybe Kava doesn't taste quite as bad but the texture & whole process of drinking it straight is almost as bad. 


I must add I haven't experimented much mixing it with other drinks, the ones I have mixed it with haven't prevented me from gagging & pulling faces ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif). The easiest to drink mix was half Kava & water blended then added to a can of red bull, but hell I'm not sure if it's because I don't drink coffee or caffeine drinks usually but I felt god awful that night, my brain was fucked = tons of pointless shit popping up & stuck in a continuous thought loop, I ended up getting out of bed early in the morning with a hell of a bad stomach ache & being sick, though the blended Kava I'd consumed had been lying in the fridge (covered with cling-film) for a few days previous, which I'm pretty sure was the reason for sickness. I wasn't able to get to sleep until 9 in the morning after going to bed early.

In the last 3 or 4 months I have developed pretty bad anxiety (used to get really bad panic attacks for a while too) a lot of the time, and even on good days I still have moderate background anxiety. I've quit blazing the chronic, which was a sad thing to let go, and I started CBT and I've been getting a lot better. I just ordered a pound of Kava Root and I'm really excited to try this and see if it helps any. Sounds like a really great herb, nonetheless... I've also got Valerian Root and Blue Lotus heading my way as well... has anyone tried Blue Lotus for anxiety? If so, any good results?  And also, I've heard that with both Lotus and Kava if you imbibe them and then toke up it completely eliminates the anxiety effect that pot can have. Is this true?

Kava is garbage IME. It worked the first time for me and made me pretty relaxed. Every time after that, even using 4 or 5 tea bags at a time had no effect whatsoever.


If you're having trouble drinking it try pouring milk in it.

Were you making it with cold water? Because heat destroys the kavalactones, thus rendering it useless.

Yeah kava isn't really meant to be a tea at all. If you are using the powder I always just mixed it n a bottle of water from a water fountain and chug it all down quickly cause it's nasty.

I concur Captaindammit, I received the paste & even after taking large amounts for two days in a row I have felt absolutely NOTHING from it, I mean not even the slightest, what a waste of money. The last time I tried the Kava root powder it had no affect on me either it seems for whatever reason it only worked for the first couple of times on me & then nothing. Will try waiting a few weeks & try the paste again, see if I get anywhere, oh well looks like I'll have to find something else. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

the strongest kava ive EVER had is this AMAZING extract that is --and holy fuck it is so strong. supposedly 1 teaspoon is equal to 2 large traditional kava bowls.

all I can say is that I could never even finish a brew made with half a teaspoon. half way through I was WAYYYYYYYYYYY tooo high..

kava can get you REALLY fucking floored actualy.. if you make it right and drink enough (alot if you have pure root powder).


but-if you cant find that--*<no sources> *any other "micronized" kavas are the very best.  I take 2 big spoonsfull drop it into some water stir for 2 seconds and gulmp down.

toung, face, entire head  and whole body go REALLY numb within Minutes.

it feels slightly stoney for sure like weed, it feels Super relaxing almost identical to klonopin, has an almost opiate like euphoria, and best of all it has the SLIGHTEST psychedelic edge like it makes things look more vivid kinda feels like the later part of a mushroom trip.


speaking of shrooms, the best experience ever had was we got out a huge bowl and some panyhose and brewed up batches of fijian root.  none of my friends had EVER tried it and I dont know if they were even expecting much but within minutes we were all so fucked up we could barely stand up. it makes you flat like sink into the couch.

anyways we were all feeling SOOOOO good that I decided to share my 7 grams of Panaleous tropicalis mushrooms with the whole room (1 gram is easily stronger than 4 grams of ANY street shrooms ive ever eaten)

there were 5 other people-i gave them all a gram. so i had 2 grams left.  I sat there eating quarter gram pinches for about 4 hours!!!!!!!!! i was like wtf why arent these working? all the sudden i ran to the bathroom puked so hard the visuals just EXPLODED in all directions-never had a more visual trip-

NEVER had such a laid back COMPLETELY anxiety free experience in my life.

someone could have walked in with a knife and stabbed me and i would not have cared.


kava and mushrooms=AMAZING!!!


(fijians have a saying that if you drink too much kava the ground will come up to meet you) dont underestimate this plant it can REALLY fuck you up. even if your tolerant to benzos and the like


Oh and sorry I have to correct someone a few posts up (unless they were purposly playing a joke on someone) NEVER NEVER EVER EVER put your kava in milk. it makes ALL the bad flavors come out a million times worse.

in plain water-i rather like the taste especialy since you go numb almost instantly like coke

Hi everyone.


I enjoy Kava and wanted to link this article for harm reduction:

[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2003/Apr/07/ln/ln03a.html](http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2003/Apr/07/ln/ln03a.html)


Basically, only use ROOT powder, not root bark, stems, or leaves.  The liver problems seem to stem from stems, barks, twigs, etc. due to a hepatoxic toxin.


Unless you know an extract is only from the root, I wouldn't trust it as much as root powder.

Do you guys think that Kava would be a good opiate potentiator? I assume there would generally be less chance of it causing dangerous respiratory depression than combining an opiate and a benzo, right?

**Kava Kava overrated?**


After buying capsules with liquid extract (looks more like sap/resin to me), I consumed 9 capsules which totaled around 720mg kavalactones. Its been 3 hours and I just feel oddly 'mind numbed'. I can only describe this feeling as not thinking about too much, empty headed and moodless. I did take these with a stomach full of a Venti sized Iced Chai Tea, so maybe it didn't absorb all at once? Is this it's full effect at work? Should I take more? I only way about 115 pounds. Thanks a lot!

Well, alone I found it was totally useless. The local naturist pharmacy here sells 300mg capsules with 30% of kavalactones.

I used to drink some whiskey with mineral water and then added the contents of like 20 capsules (honestly I don't remember how much I used), it created a foam that stayed in the top of my highball glass and it was fun.

I mean, it was a powerfull combo, I couldn't even walk for around 3~4 hours.

Maybe one's tolerance has something to do too.

I second mrjackjones, alone it does nothing. It works best in combination with other GABAergics, maybe benzos.

Why can't you take alcohol?

A common notion is that Kava is a bit harsh on the liver, and of course, so is alcohol.


The combination is not a good idea for that reason.

I've got an OZ of 40% Kava Powder a while ago. I tried it for the first time today, the numbing effect is amazing ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) Your mouth, tongue and throat all get a pleasant cocaine like numb feeling almost instantly. I must be one of the few people who really quites like the taste, I think it's a nice sweet and spicy taste, similar to Ginger. 


I'm not too sure of the effects yet. I took 5g this morning mixed with cold water, I didn't feel much but after a bong of weed it had me feeling great :D It definite synergises with Cannabis.


I've just made another drink with around 15g in it, I've given it a good thorough mix and now I'm letting it rest (seep) for half an hour to release the Kavalactones. Here's a quote from the net- "The powder is soaked in water for approximately 30 minutes to allow the water to completely soak through the powdered fibers."


I'll post an update later on ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Ok...whoa! It has worked A LOT better this time. Perhaps letting it sit in cold water for half an hour really does make a difference. (Remember to stir it aggressively to get it all mixed) Although I did use 15g of 40% powder this time, I think that's a fair bit. My mouth went very numb straight away, I think this indicates that it's of a high quality %)


At the moment I'm feeling what can only be described as 'fucked' xD But really, I'm feeling stimulated and sedated at the same time, I'm relaxed yet motivated and want to talk/type/do things rather than just sit here listening to music like I do on weed sometimes.


Anxiety and stress have now been greatly reduced. I've experienced some mild nausea or possibly just a numbness in my stomach for a while after ingestion but it's fading now and it's no worse than 10mg Valium or 100mg Tramadol.


Ok, I've kept doing other things while typing this post (it's probably been 15 mins or longer since I wrote the above). I now feel more sedated than before, less stimulated. I'm going to have a bong of Cannabis shortly, this should reduce nausea (still feeling some) and increase happiness :D (Great synergy!)

I've heard it described as feeling very physically relaxed but unlike a lot of anxiolytics (benzos, alcoho, etc), you remain very clear mentally? I've always felt this is pretty accurate for myself and is this what you mean by simultaneously stimulated and sedated?

I'm not that clear mentally, although I never am unless I'm on a stimulant like Dexedrine/MDMA or if I stop smoking Cannabis daily. At the moment I'm feeling quite fucked up - weird, wired and wonderful! I'm feeling rather nice, this is unlike any other high I've ever had, it's like a combination of weed, benzos, gbl/gbh, mephedrone, salvia, dxm, ketamine and opiates. Kind of crazy I know but I can't describe it properly, I keep getting Mephedrone/GBL style rushes! Quite intense with increased heart rate/breathing, sweating palms and restless legs! Yet at the same time I'm feeling very relaxed and I'm sitting back in my chair, despite my back having a strange sensation that it's twisting and my legs kicking about.


I've got a ringing in my ears and head and music has an echo to it and is strange yet compelling at the same time. I have an intense body high with a lovely feeling through my stomach (like Mephedrone/MDMA) and legs, I also feel quite warm and my eyes have gone super stoned and sensitive, this has receded again for the moment. Everything is interesting and looking around my room is very compelling!


The ringing in my ears is beginning to get annoying, I'm a GABA abuser so this is a problem I get sometimes when abusing GABA products. My lips feel numb still and my hands are cold. I'm feeling like lying down in a bed. (I'm 

still typing the post and the ringing has mostly gone or I've got used to it and I don't want to lie down anymore, I'm very focused on typing, previewing and editing this post.)


I'm also chewing on the inside of my cheeks, something I don't do on any other drug, not even mephedrone/mdma.


I have taken 2000mg Paracetamol (APAP), 30mg Dihydrocodeine and 1500mg Phenibut over the day but well spread out, I'm a fiend and I also have a cold so please excuse me ![:o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) I know this isn't the healthiest for my livers but it's certainly not a regular thing, I fiend slightly healther drugs ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I have taken 15g of the 40% root extract, from eBay USA. (Mentioned for natures of product comparison rather than sourcing) It was stirred well and rested for 30 minutes to let the water absorb the Kavalactones and to soak the fibers. This is a fairly high dose I believe, I've also done 5g this morning, my first ever go with it and I failed to stir it properly or let it stand. That's 20g of 40% root extract in total.


I have become obsessed with previewing and editing this post, I've been at it for nearly 30 minutes now, this is getting near stimulant obsession lol. 


I'm feeling less 'rushy' and wired now, my sweaty palms and restless legs have mostly receded.


Ok, to conclude (otherwise I'll be here all day :D) - a very interesting and different high, definitively one to try!

^clearly the kava is making you quite chatty. I'm not sure if this has been mentioned recently or you are familiar but I wanted to state it to be sure since you mentioned your liver...


In Europe, years ago kava became quiet popular for doctors to prescribe as an alternative to benzos. Then a lot of reports of liver damage/failure came out and many places banned kava or at least stopped prescribing it like they used to. Somehow however, in areas like Fiji where use is historically common, they've never had these liver failure issues...


In the South Pacific they know how to safely prepare the kava and to cut corners, the pharm companies producing those euro kava products were using parts of the plant that were never used by indigenous and it was determined THAT caused the liver damage.


What's the point of all this? If you make sure that you are using ROOT ONLY products, you really shouldn't have to worry about the effect on your liver. If you are NOT using root only (especially the quantities you've taken) you should absolutely NOT take 2 grams of paracetamol (acetaminophen for Americans).

kava kava is great!! I hapend to get a o ounce of fresh kava powder from a buddy that bought some with his cc online.

This is by far the best brew i've made. numbs my entire mouth and throat every time I sip. I feel a nice warm and relaxed feeling. the closest thing that i can compare it with a high dose of clonazepam. I still have a good bit left, going to just make bowls at a time. What's cool about kava is that it doesn't show up in a drug test, and it won't fuck you up like a lot of the other things out there.

I was in Fiji once, sitting around a table on the beach with a load of fijians, drinking this stuff, clapping my hands and shouting "Bula!"


Was quite an experience. Then I gave the equivilent of $5 to some guy who rode off on a horse and came back with about 2oz weed! 


Fiji is an awesome place to check out!

I tried this is a couple different ways and never felt anything at all... I read so much on it that I was kinda mad and took like 40 caps of "30%" ones in a day. I didn't puke or feel anything. It was from a reputable site too...


Am I looking for something that is mostly placebo? As in camomile tea... Or am I looking for something that I can actually feel like kratom?

You can definitelely feel kava. It's intoxicating. Anti-anxiety, like alcohol, but the head space is more similiar to weed. You can even get the spins from too much kava.


I've tried mainly pill-extracts available at most megamarts (in the "nutritrion/organic" section) or powdered kava from the asian market. Both ways feel mostly the same.


Haven't tried any internet vendors yet. You'll "feel it like Kratom" but it won't feel like kratom.

yes, kava causes liver damage with chronic high dosing. possibly even with just high doses, or chronic doses.


I want to try to figure out doses going by mg of kavalactones.. but that only works if the analysis is correct. So I also will eventually try to figure out dose going by mg of raw material consumed as is. I think that'll be more reliable than a water extract, which depends on your patience and lab skills.


I'm betting the dose is weight dependant.


Subjectively, the closest thing I'd compare kava to is a low dose of ambien. But way way less sedation. It feels more like ambien than benzos or booze.

Kava is great stuff! But most of the kava products out there are too weak and aren't worth your money. Most advise to buy the powdered root and make tea with a method such as [this one](http://www.konakavafarm.com/recipes/very-strong.htm). I've read the powdered root from Vanuatu is the strongest. So far I've only used a tincture, "Gaia Herbs" brand. Get the "Professional Strength" if you want the strongest available, I looked around online and couldn't find any tincture stronger than this stuff. It has 150 mg/mL kavalactones. It says 10 drops contains about 50 mg kavalactones, if you want to really feel it try to dose about 1000 mg ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Kava and weed is indeed pleasant. It's nice, and safe for me, on the comedown to 2CE, DXM, methamphetamine, and MDPV. And that's all the combinations I've tried with it.

Hello Kava users! I thought I'd wake up this forum.


I just got some kava root powder from a spiritual supply store in town(awesome store by the way) I'm not sure how fresh it is, but it is the powder form. I've tried kava a few other times, but it was always pieces of root that were shredded. Those never had any effect on me, so maybe it was just the vendor. 


I'm looking forward to giving this stuff another go, cause it sound like it would be very enjoyable. But I've had a very stressful few days. I just got done studying for and taking a major Praxis exam for graduate school. I'm still pretty wired from the test, so I really need a good chill out.


I will be sure to update after I make the tea!

Guys stay away from kava tinctures and pills. There is no substitute for the fresh stuff. Search around there are many good vendors. I order from one in Boca Raton Florida. Don't forget the rule 1 cup root, 2 cup water, one tbsp oil.

So, the whole liver problem things with Kava was actually found out to be mainly a chemical from the bark, leaves and twigs.... 


Here's a new story about it in chemical and engineering news:

[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/whatstuff/83/8346kava.html](http://pubs.acs.org/cen/whatstuff/83/8346kava.html)


So, extracts are more dangerous, as they often use leaves and twigs and stuff in there.  


Best to go with ONLY root powder.  I get capsules of whole lateral root powder that hasn't been processed with anything nasty.

I very much doubt that it would.  Opiate and GABA receptors are completely different as far as I know.  Anyone with a source feel free to contradict me.


I just mixed some kava in with my banana protein shake and drank it down, kava and all...not bad, actually.  I'm one of those who can't stand the taste.  (It was still an effort to get down).


Does anyone know if kava is similar to alcohol in its effect on fat metabolism? I'm trying to get myself a little more ripped for summer, that's all.  


Hopefully this helps me get through my temporary benzo shortage...

Well as far as whether or not kava works while in suboxone, i will let you know in a few days, i would imagine it will.(also going to try kratom on subs) I just got 2 ozs of  kava root from a local herb shop.


     The way i take my kava  is simply chew the ground root,(between cheek and gum) for 10-15 mins,then spit it out,  and I find 2-5 grams or even less (5 grams will floor me and i am far from a novice with drugs with a 10+ year opiate habit) using this method will produce very nice effects rather than using 15-30 grams making a tea for subtle effects at best,or eating half a bottle of pills with no effect. there is something in saliva that seems to activate the kavalactones or majorly increase the bioavailability. So, try this method of just chewing the raw root like chewing tobacco, and i assure you, you will have a whole new outlook on kava kava.  The effects i normally feel from kava are good relaxation, a nice body buzz and slight mood elevation. I would say its more like soma than an opiate or a benzo, but to me more enjoyable than soma.


       I tried this method after reading about how it was traditionally prepared, ie. having the virgins in the tribe chew (masticate) the root and spit it into a bowl for consumption. after many disappointing experiments with kava i found this method to be far and away the most effective. with that said kava is what it is, its kava, if you are expecting it to feel like heroin you are going to be let down.

So I bought a kava powder sampler pack. Came wit Fiji venuatu n papa new guinea. So far I'd say Fiji is very strong. After realizing u gotta squeeze n massage the kava that's in the strainer bag  I had about 4-6 tablespoons the first time I used the massage technique and it had me nauseous but very drunk/high feeling. It wasn't like any other high I've experienced. It was similar to several at once. Very enjoyable but had me tired hungover feeling an hr later. I recommend Fiji blend was my best experience tho the nausea sucked (due to too high a dose). Very surprising after trying the capsules tea n powder without squeezing n massaging while in cold water.

Ok so I took my dose of kava tonite (sampler pack first 2 doses of Fiji) after first dose felt relaxed n slightly talkative.  As I came down I redosed 1/2 original dose with Fiji. Half the effects. Then shit got weird. I drank bout 3 more doses bout 3/5 the original dose but of venuatu kava. After first 1-2 I got stimulant effects so I redosed trying to calm down thinking it was something else. About 15 min after last dose I felt like a full fledged panic attack n it was more in my stomach than my heart. As far as I could tell my HR wasn't high but I def felt like I was gunna have a heart attack. After 3 valerian root caps n a benadryl n purging I feel 75% better. Anyone have this experience b4? N yes I kno the dose amount was dumb but kava is sposed to b benzo like - not feel like a 12 hr coke binge lol.

Does anyone have any experience with Thompsons brand Kava tablets? They contain 60mg per tablet, I've been thinking of getting back into Kava. I realize that a lot of people say the roots are better, but I'm unsure if I'm allowed to import them into Australia since the laws changed.

The capsules are very inneffective even at large doses I expect the most you'll find is a placebo effect IME. One think I noticed b4 experiencing imported powdered root was the teabags with kava seemed to actually work around 2-3 bags or cups, relieved anxiety from PAWS (post acute withdrawal), however it was nothing close to the root method I use now. It's a night and day difference. With kava it's a very relaxing mellow but talkative buzz initially. And after about 45m-1hr it fades and your left feeling very tired but still semi relaxed. Although I often experience a headache after as well as a hangover the following morning. Still very impressive for a legal herbal high. It's like the benzo version of kratom IME. As far as Australian law here is what erowid says which checks out with other sources as well. 


[http://www.erowid.org/plants/kava/kava_law.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/plants/kava/kava_law.shtml)


Hope this helps! 


Kava is legal to possess & sell in Australia, but it is illegal to import into Australia without a license, it is "Schedule IV" in the import laws: AU Import Regulations.

Comment about Australian Kava Law, by Torsten of Shaman Australius, October 2001:

"It was once given to Aboriginees to help get them off alcohol. Some liked it a little too much and started getting health problems from it, so it was scheduled as a drug. We don't have different levels of scheduling like the US, but we have provisions for licenses for any drug. It is very easy to get a kava license. The government just wants to be able to track volumes and trading sources. It is completely illegal in one state. Due to our multicultural make-up there are special provisions that you are allowed to carry 3 months supply on your person into the country. It is also freely available in Islander and Fiji shops. No problem getting it really, it's just the wholesale is a bit dodgy."

Just a little feed back on kava kava.

Took 10g = 1 big spoon of 40% kavalactone extract from a well known source.

Felt the same as 3-4 beers, just a little more inconfortable on the stomach.

Same very little headache in the morning.

If you are muslim and want to know what alcool is like, you can try kava kava, otherwise no point at all to try it, as it is fare less tasty then a good pina colada.

Yes I have a bottle of it and it really doesn't do all the much unless you take a lot more then the reccomended dose, I have had 4 today and felt a little more relaxed, I felt like I was going to have a panic attack so I had 2 tablets and then an hour later another 2 more, it calmed me down, it wasn't placebo though, just very very mild, so now I am trying to figure out what other kava you can get in australia as the thompsons brand seem like the only one! Finally found something that might help my anxiety and the stupid fucking government bans impotation.


If anyone wants to PM me of an online vendor or somewhere I can get some good quality kava here in Australia I will be very very greatful (I don't know if this is against the rules, and to be honest I don't care I'm sick of this bullshit anxiety!)

I don't quite agree with the above. Kava can definitely be used as a recreational drug for some people at higher doses. Take 8-10 table spoons of ground powder with lukewarm water and you'll be in a dreamy, serene, happy mood with something resembling euphoria - you'll be in great spirits and contented....without the problem of guilt off having taken an illegal drug.. IMHO opinion it beats alcohol, diazepam and even low-dose oxycodone (up to 15mgs) any day!!!!


With regards to anxiety and vis-a-vis diazepam, high-dose diazepam will definitely put you to sleep faster and help your anxiety, but it is more chemical, unnatural in feel. I would never describe valium as a rewarding experience, but this can be said of kava.


Out of all the drugs I've ever taken only kava and heroin gave me a true sense of happiness (H is of course is in a different league, much heavier....insta nod in high doses!!!)

Kava vs alcohol


well, booze is far more intoxicating and also feels way more damaging to one's body...I mean come on.....ever had 100% alcohol poured over a wound for disinfection purposes??? I try to avoid booze as it just a friggin poison. Kava is way better and you don't run the risk of mood swings and aggression.


I rate kava 9 out of 10, alcohol 6 out of 10 (unpredictable, toxic)

I'd never had memory loss from pregabalin before (only thing that gives me amnesia ever is benzos, which are so bad for that that I don't even take them ever).  The one thing I don't like much is the nausea that seems to come with it for me, but in any case the use of it is much healthier feeling than say, alcohol.

excellent post. Agree about the healthier feeling and the amnesia from benzos. I binged on Valium for a couple of weeks a while ago and I really have problems recollecting what went on back then. Stick away from benzodiazepines unless you have an acute panic attack (and only take it occasionally in any case)

^^ I know that traditionally, whole fresh kava root has been chewed to good effect, but I'm not sure about powdered dried root.  Dried roots that have been sitting around for a while will typically have lost potency over time, much more so at that if they've been ground into a powder.

i purchase mine from a local herbalist (powdered root) and use: 1/2 cup kava, 2 cups water, 1 cup milk, 1 tsp veg oil, and a dash of cinnamon. Mix in blender for ~4 minutes and strain out and drink.


Yeah kava is a great mixer with almost any drug, 

especially anxiety-inducing ones such as jwh-018, or weed for that matter

Obviously kratom is ideal, but both could possibly be more ideal. I guess ill see if i can scrape together the money for some and try both. But i can hardly afford kratom right now so i doubt thats happening.

Oh snap, i wish i knew where to buy it locally. Ill check some online prices but the shipping might be what kills me in the end because i have a very good source for kratom, but its kava products are only the more expensive extracts and such, nothing as simple as ground of root; So i would have to pay twice for shipping. I can take a look around local shops but i don't know the area, living at my girlfriends aunts house and only been here for a couple months. Im sure there are plenty of stores in chicago but i don't have any way of getting into the city other than the train, and buying a train ticket defeats the purpose..

Probably the same reason people buy extracts of kratom rather than just consuming powdered leaf when the latter is more cost effective. They don't know any better because naturally when dealing with drugs you have an urge to work with a more "pure" product.

Does anyone have experience with parachuting compared to water extraction? I still have my doubts because almost everyone who takes kava complains about the awful taste which could easily be avoided by parachuting. But doing some searching on google I don't find many websites that advocate parachuting. 


Is it possible that the stomach has trouble digesting it if it's not extracted into water? I mean that's the same concept as crushing a pill instead of swallowing it whole so that you can absorb it better, right?

Not really the same thing in my opinion, whats the difference between crushing a pill into powder to absorb it faster and simply grinding kava root into a powder to absorb it faster? Extracting the active product from the kava root is basically the same thing as a cold water extraction of codeine. Except in that case there is a good reason to do that with codeine, but from what i have seen not so much with kava. 


Can one build up a tolerance to kava? Assuming you can, an extraction would only make sense for ease of taking large doses.

You would be parachuting a LOT of powder to get a dose. I use 1/3-1/2 a cup of powder. That is a lot to try to swallow down. Also I imagine your stomach might not enjoy breaking it down.

I brew it and put chocolate syrup in it. I used to not enjoy it and had to gulp it down and chase it, but now I get that sharp taste and numb tongue, and I enjoy knowing that a good experience is about to ensue.

That's a very broad range, and unlike other "drugs" kava doesn't need to be as carefully measured because it isn't overly dangerous. Brew up some tea and experiment with different doses to see what gives you a desired effect. 


Sorry though, if you still wanted a more specific answer.

I just tried some kava and so far it feels like vicodin when I take enough.. so its nice.


Does it really not build tolerance though? It sounds like bullshit marketing to me that kava doesn't build tolerance but actually continuously gets stronger the more you use it.

As was mentioned in your thread, drug testing questions aren't allowed here. 


Kava isn't metabolized into alcohol or similar compounds.

theres a lot of kava out all over the place now.

just a heads up to folks out there, pay the extra $ to get the "glass" bottle kava.


ive noticed that the plastic bottles of kava dont really do shit, and the only way to feel anything is to open every capsule, and make the tea.(which i'm sure will be some stout shit).


i'm taking the capsules with what looks like hash oil inside it, when i open the capsule it smells like straight kava, and earth.

i take 2 each afternoon and it's compared to drinking a few beers.

( i live in a place that drug tests out of the ass... so..)


There reallly isn't a ceiling effect, but if you take to much it can cause damage! just watch out.

I took some low alcohol content Kava Kava Root Extract, more then I normally take just to level out my anxiety attacks. But this time I got really sick to my stomach, my heart was pounding in my ears, anxiety hit me 10 times worse then when I didn't have any. My body went from cold to burning hot and my hands were cold and sweating. I could barely stand let alone sit up without falling on the computer table. And I was breathing hard trying to slow the spinning in my head. I honestly wish I never took that much. I can't sleep anymore... I've never been one for the hangover clouded feeling in my head. It drives me crazy, is there ANYWAY I can get rid of that feeling. Thankfully the rest has gotten better I just can't do this Vicodin clouded head feeling. I'm despite for some advice or ideas to make my head more clear. Please help. :[

Hi - I've done a little research online and it appears as though Kava is injectable, but the exact preparation and experiences are lacking. Just wondering if anyone on this board has done this or has any advise on where I should look to get further information. I understand the risks of IV'ing drugs, and I don't need any lecture about why it is wrong - unless it pertains specifically to Kava and something that may be potentially dangerous, above and beyond the typical dangers of IV injection as a practice. 


Thanks! Hopefully someone on this board will be able to help me with this! I love to find out as much as possible about the how's and why's of the drugs that I am choosing to inject along with preparation guidelines and experiences, but if it comes down to it, I have no problem being a guinea pig (to a degree ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).

At least 95% of the people who inject heroin do so because they are enslaved by the drug. The rest are predominately naive kids who are looking for that ultimate rush. Heroin contains all kinds of impurities and cuts too, so just because there are some who do it, doesn't mean its ever safe to inject something that's not "pharmaceutical grade".


Since people will concur that Kava doesn't provide near the high of heroin, there is very little reason left why someone should ever inject it. Never have I heard of that which you speak.


Anyways, I was wondering if anyone has a full or almost complete list of Kava's mechanisms of actions. I know there are quite a few.

I suspect people state that it produces this phenomenon because of cumulative MAOI-B action, meaning tolerance surely builds to the GABA mechanism.

I agree. Four lips put in for twenty-thirty minutes each and then swallowed got me hammered. The feeling is one of being drunk, high, clear-minded, and naturally at peace all in one. Its great because it feels like nothing else is needed. Make no mistake, this can rock anyone with a low or non-existent GABAergic tolerance. Yet I wouldn't compare its recreational potential to hard drugs. This is a powerful herb that can also be addictive. I wouldn't recommend taking it every day for more than two weeks due to its powerful antidepressant and GABAergic potential. The herb is great for anxiety incurred while using marijuana (though in my opinion one should stop abusing MJ if it doesn't like them persistently), doing hard work, relaxing after hard work, and long talk-a-thons. It must be handled with care.

That all depends on the Kava you get. Probably a range from a couple grams to well over a bottle of pills.

^Kava and kratom will probably synergize with other, since they can both have sedative and calming effects. I haven't taken them together but I've heard good reports from others. I don't think there should be much danger from mixing them, I've taken kava with opioids before, but I would try kava on its own first and then if you are going to mix them start with a lower dose of each to be on the safe side and avoid possible unwanted side effects, especially if you normally take high doses of kratom. I wouldn't call kava *that* similar to kratom, but personally I didn't really like kratom (at least the kind of kratom I've tried) and I do like kava. I am surprised you think kava is more expensive than kratom - I find kava to generally be around 25%-30% the price of kratom and you don't need as much of it for an active dose (note: we aren't allowed to discuss specific prices or vendors).

I certainly wouldn't call kava "addictive". It doesn't create a physiological dependence and it is not psychologically addictive in the sense of drugs we normally refer to as "addictive". Of course some people can get addicted to anything, but I would equate its addiction potential to that of pizza (actually personally I am grouchier if I go too long without pizza ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)). I have taken it daily for periods of 1-3 months at a time and had no problem at all stopping, no withdrawal symptoms, cravings, increase of depression/anxiety etc. And I am someone with a very "addictive personality". I have known people who took high doses daily for years (not because they were "addicted" but because it was commonplace and expected in their culture) and had no problems stopping for long periods of time.


You and others also refer to it as a "powerful GABAergic", but I didn't think that was really correct? The mechanism of action of kava is not understood, but the pharmacological activities of kava do not appear to be explained by any significant interaction with GABA or benzodiazepine binding sites. Animal studies have shown varying results, with some finding it had no effect at all on GABA receptors/binding, some finding it weakly enhanced the binding of GABA receptor agonists, or didn't enhance the binding but increased in the number of GABA binding sites. There have been a number of other theories proposed to explain kava's mechanism of action and it is likely due to a number of different mechanisms. Strong GABA agonism does not seem plausible from what I've read and experienced. Unless I am missing something?

This was simply not true with me. Two weeks of daily use was enough to provide fine, frequent tremors, anxiety, and insomnia upon stopping.


You are. I think you will find that virtually any source which relates Kavas psychopharmacology will reference GABAergic activity. In addition to my above symptoms after ceasing use, the feel of kava is consistent with GABAergic activity; I've taken many of these drugs. I think you have the burden of proof here since your opinion is not widely accepted.


I don't think I referenced it as a powerful GABAergic, but in my opinion any GABAergic is powerful due to the potential severity of withdrawal.

That's the thing though - "virtually any source" does not say that kava significantly affects GABA, all the actual studies on it seem to have different findings. I don't think it is "widely accepted" that kava has significant effects on GABA receptors. I'm not saying it definitely doesn't affect GABA in any way, I'm just saying from what I read it does not seem to be proven that it is a strong GABAergic or that that is where the effects primarily come from, or even that it affects GABA at all. Or that withdrawal syndrome is likely/common. Dependence/withdrawal symptoms are certainly not anywhere near as common as with benzos or alcohol.


> Only weak activity was observed on GABAA binding sites in washed synaptosomal membranes prepared from rat brain and this was abolished by extraction of the membranes with Triton X-100, suggesting that lipid soluble components were involved. No effects were observed on GABAa binding sites in rat brain membranes in vitro. Kava resin and pyrones exerted some weak effects on benzodiazepine binding in vitro but this did not correlate with pharmacological activity. In addition, in ex vivo studies, no effects were observed on [3H]diazepam binding to brain membranes prepared from mice in which selected kava constituents were injected intraperitoneally, whereas similarly administered diazepam (5 mg/kg) inhibited [3H]diazepam binding by >95%. Similar lack of activity was observed in in vivo binding studies; injection of kava resin failed to influence the CNS binding of the benzodiazepine-receptor ligand [3H]Ro15-1788 injected into mice prior to sacrifice. The pharmacological activities of kava resin and pyrones do not appear to be explained by any significant interaction with GABA or benzodiazepine binding sites.

> Kavapyrones have well-known psychotropic properties. The most common actions of the extract are relaxation and euphoria, depending on the circumstances of ingestion, whereas higher doses cause sleepiness and skeletal muscle relaxation. Several other actions have been reported such as anticonvulsant properties, neuroprotection and analgesia. No interactions with neuroreceptors have yet been found that would explain the multiple actions.

There are many more like this, whereas most of the ones that say it affects GABA say things like "proposed" "theorized" "suggested" etc. So far I have only been able to find one study that found kava to affect GABA receptors and other similar studies were not able to replicate the results.

I was taking it sublingually and orally.


The fact that it alleviates benzodiazepine withdrawal well, works against GAD, and anecdotal reports of drunkenness should be be enough in conjunction with the majority of sources to conclude that Kava works by increasing GABA.


[http://journals.lww.com/psychopharm...of_Kava_Extract_for_Treating_Anxiety_.14.aspx](http://journals.lww.com/psychopharmacology/Abstract/2000/02000/Efficacy_of_Kava_Extract_for_Treating_Anxiety_.14.aspx)

I don't have time to round up many sources. Even if I did you would probably still state that the majority of sources do not reference Kava as increasing GABA, though they do. Just do a simple search.

I just got some Full Spectrum type dealio from an online vendor. I have had a paste before from this same place and I am a little confused. This paste is somewhat slimey or gooey. It is not...as clay like as the cold water extraxt paste I had. Should I be worried about this shit? Is it normal?

I imagine the root is best but Kaviar Kava extract does the trick  also...from experience

84% kavalactone paste is the best. Some people say its expensive but maybe its the vendor? i find i can get atleast 5 uses for an amount that costs less than a dose of H smoked on foil...

I also mixed kava root powder in milkshakes and they actually taste good!

Hello all!  I am in SUCH a great blissed-out mood!  This is the sweet spot I have been chasing after with my supply of alcohol and benzos.  Of course nothing good came out of that...led me sraight to the lock down psych ward.  The withdrawal from benzos were horrible, even though they tapered me with Ativan...I just felt dead and numb - not comfortably - for months, PAWS was a bitch. SO.....NO benzos and Booze!!  That still leaves me with my high strung nature, prone to anxiety and panic attacks. I got some Kava-root tincture at the local health food store.  I made some Celestial Seasonings Tension Tamer tea and added some kratom powder and 60 drops of the tincture.  The minty, gingery taste of the tea goes very will with those additives.  


My evening combo:  10 perc

                              150 milligrams  lyrica

                              2-5g capsules Maeng Da

                              Two cups of the herbal tea, prepared with a teaspoon of the Kratom and 60 drops of root extract


I can't believe how good I feel!  No pain and no muscle tension, and -- the main thing for me -- my mind is at peace.  I am sitting out on my porch on this wonderful fall evening, listening to music, and it SURE is sounding good.  Everything just feels good.  I will wake up tomorrow and my shitty problems will still be waiting, but I sure as hell ain't gonna think of that right now.  I am going to sit out in the cool fall air and enjoy the trip.

Kava Kava isnt the same as kratom..idk maybe you got confused, that is more of an experience report...

But Good for you! I love kratom also :D Since you were talking about benzo paws and your abuse with the gabas, i thought you were going to say you drank some kava lol!

In fact, i think you should try it, and alternate between kava and kratom because kratom can cause dependency/addiction and withdrawals if you use for even 2-3 days in a row!

Good luck, and im always eager to help out with more info on the subject ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


damn i just noticed the extract was a kava extract! sorry about that ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) haha

anyways im glad you are going in the more natural, less harmful substance path!

That's OK, lol.  I really didn't mention Kava that much, did I?  I know there were a lot of other chemicals involved but I believe the Kava made the difference.  I just woke up  in the middle of the night and I still feel pretty calm and able to go back to sleep.

hell yea i think some of the kavalactones have like a half life of 12 hours but most of them around 6 hours if i remember correctly!

Have you tried the kava alone? I find it gives me a really happy, almost opiatey, kind of rush for 15 minutes! Unless of course im in withdrawals lol (its funny now, but ill remember this next time im in withdrawals ha)

does anybody know how quickly kava builds tolerance? I've used it as a sleep aid combined with passionflower and valerian for around a year or two, but about a month ago, I bought a bag of Hawaiian powdered Kava (which I later discovered was a poorly-reviewed brand) and made my first cup, and felt effects from just a few sips, but recently I've noticed that its effects are barely noticable. Also, is there any risk of physical dependence? thanks errbody

damnit i dont feel shit, i bought  the kava kava extract 250mg root powder capsules w/ 30% kavalactones, took 1 and dont feel shit..should i have just bought the tea at the store like the ppl at this 1 store said or what? Is the tea the one that numbs your mouth and throat? That would make it seem like it would be more likely to work


or is it because i just have a high benzo tolerance?

The "30% Kavalactones" 250mg extracts are very weak, and dangerous, since a couple of companies had reportedly used the leaves in their extract. You can only eat the extract of the Kava rhizmome and root, not of the leaf, since the leaf contians a unique kavalactone that causes liver damage, hence the FDA report on *every* Kava product sold in the US, regardless of its leaf content.


I would much rather suggest going with the Herb-Pharm Kava alcohol-based-tincture, in the glass bottles which comes in 1oz and 4oz bottles with a dropper bottle as the screwtop. That dropper bottle is used to measure out 40-100 drops (150-200 if you have a high Kava tolerance), which is squirted in to about 8 oz of water or juice. The effects are potent, and the quality consistent, and the "high" is consistent, too, due the precision of doses with a standardized tincture (extract in grain alcohol).

Stay away from those stupid little capsules or whatever. You cant make tea out of kava unless its cold. Kava to me has always potentiated any Methadone in my system I Think? Im not quite sure but honestly the only reason I bought the stuff was for the warmth I got from it. Now Im scared to drink Kava as my last few experiences caused breathing issues at night. I take Xanax so Im guessing it has something to do with that.

I find the problem is that if you take too much kava it seems to speed the elimination of opioids from the system, hence increasing withdrawals or making withdrawals come on faster. Personally I don't find it problematic in small doses. It may vary from person to person though, as some people report having no problems with high kava doses while in withdrawal (maybe it can also vary depending on what opioid you're WD-ing from and whether you've quit completely or are just tapering it?)


As for how much kava to use, that depends on the desired effect and the particular kava you have, all you can really do is start low and experiment. Pure powdered root or capsules that only contain powdered root are best (although the capsules are more expensive, I just get them because they are very convenient - easier to measure doses, require no preparation etc - and I can purchase them at the health food store, the bulk root is more economical).


As for other supplements, do you mean other supplements to help with opioid withdrawal? There are a ton, I can try to search for some threads that go into detail or I can give you the list of ones I've found helpful if you like?

kava has a very  noticeble calming effect that is very helpful.it helps with anxiety,depression ect.  it helps sum with pain especially tension headache type pain.the information  the op posted in this megathread sum of it is incorrect and probly copied from an overly paranoid warning label places on the back of a few kava supplement bottles.kava does work best if a drink is made with kava powder and sumthing like say pineapple coconut juice or sum kind of drink mix.it doesnt matter how old the drinker is its perfectly safe 2 drink it. a beverage containing kava  drunk by babies who r like 1 year old will not cauze them harm.its safer than coffee.it has many health benifits sum not mentioned here.

That's correct, root only: no liver damage.  Nearly all of the countries that banned it in the early 2000's have since lifted the ban as it became clear that only the leaves & stem of kava cause liver problems, which a few unscrupulous manufacturers had used due to the shortage of kava during that time of it's surging popularity.  Buy from a reliable vendor, kava from Vanuatu is most potent but I enjoy stuff from Kona (Hawaii).  Kava is fat soluble so it's best to soak it in whole milk, coconut milk, or soy milk to release the kavalactones.  I usually put 2-5 teaspoons of powdered kava with 3 cups vanilla coconut milk beverage, blend for a few minutes, then strain the mixture through a sock (used only for this purpose) keeping the sock open with a hollowed out plastic cup.  Temperatures above 140 F destroy kavalactone, so drink it cold, or at least warm, it is not a traditional "Earl Gray" type tea.  I kneed it like you would dough for 8 minutes in the milk, getting all the good stuff out just like they do in the Pacific.  I drink a couple glasses on an empty stomach and am feeling relaxed and slightly euphoric in 10 minutes.  Just like any other tea, you can keep adding more liquid to the pulp if you're worried about wasting any.  My local health food coop has kava root chips, which also work good after being blended.  With the powder you can drink it without straining, but I'd still run it through a wire mesh to make it a bit more palatable.  Aloha No!

In the process of making an extract. I was pleasantly surprised on the sheer synergy of a moderate amount with three beers; it felt like the euphoria of six beers plus weed with little-no nausea or otherwise negative effects.

Indeed the only real side effect that stopped me from dosing any higher (not really it just felt weird) was that my heart started beating somewhat faster and harder.  Afterwards I looked it up and found that kava is one of many plants with phenethylamines in it, such as saffron or nutmeg.  This made sense from the feeling it gave me, which was not only anxiety-relieving and relaxing on the body, but stimulating, energetic, and euphoric.  These effects were noted with the whole root (chewed just how it is, its fun) much more than with any other form.

The thing about kava is that it's not really a good substitute for any drug out there due to it's undesirable side effects, which include nausea, tiredness, expense, and route of administration (gulping a mud-like grog on an empty stomach).  It's hard to determine this threshold, since many experience reverse tolerance with kava which means they feel nothing the first couple times and later finally feel it but wonder why it was worth it.  I tried kava paste when I was 15, was a bit drunk at the time but even sober I felt no effect from it so forgot about it for 10 years.  I tried extracts & capsules, no effect. Then I notice my local health food coop has it in root chip form so I try it again, i feel something but it's hard to tell if it's just cause my stomach's empty & finally getting something in it.  

Recently I read "Getting Stoned with Savages" an exaggerated account of an American expat living in Vanuatu, & find out kava really can intoxicate you.  I love the fact it's from the South Pacific & natural, so I order some root powder, prepare it properly and voila! it works, effects felt in 10 minutes, like alcohol except worse in every way.  It's called grog for a reason, I mean it gives you a little empathetic buzz very similar to having 3 or 4 drinks, you're relaxed & might become talkative which makes you want more to keep it going, but then you will get nauseous & dizzy.  Plus you have to eat at some point but with kava you won't get any buzz drinking it on a full stomach.  The smell of it seems to get stuck in your nasal passages too which doesn't help your queasiness.  Even experienced users have a hard time stomaching it and take it more for the anti-anxiety qualities than for a high.  Most of the people who get excited about it are looking for a non-addictive substitute to alcohol, but alas alcohol is similar to the Winston Churchill quote  "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."  My advice, if you must try it, buy a quality 1/4 lb. bag, don't get all irrational and but a whole kilo like I'm stuck with.....

^I guess that just goes to show how different everyone is. Personally I have no problem stomaching it, have never noticed nausea from it and don't really even mind the taste that much if I prepare it in the traditional manner, it's just weird and earthy and numbs the mouth. I don't like drinking it without filtering the particles of root out first though, that is gross. I also don't find it to do *nothing* when taken on a full stomach, although even if you feel that is the case for you that shouldn't prevent you from eating, you can always drink it and then eat. I definitely do not consider it "worse in every way" than alcohol!

The reason kava beverage in Fiji is sometimes called "grog" is just because alcohol is referred to as "grog" in Australia and Fiji is close to Australia. It was like the native Fijians' version of alcohol, what they would drink instead, so it became referred to by some as "grog".

^ Well, i guess as they say "all things in moderation".  I'm happy kava works for you, just wondering how you prepare it, I use 2 heaping tbl spoons of root powder, mix with 16 oz soy milk and  1/2 teaspoon soy lecithin, blend it on high a few minutes, then let it set for 5+ hrs.  I read that people use water but some kavalactones are fat soluble, that's why I like soy milk.  I run it through a wire strainer but otherwise drink it down whole.  I'm kind of happy I don't like it too much though, just another habit.  I guess it is better than alcohol in that there's no awful hangover the *next morning*, but for me there's little variance between a recreational dose and an immoderate one which puts a damper on the good times.  Oh well...

Recreationally I have mostly used the traditional method of putting crushed root in a cloth bag and swishing it in cold water for a decent amount of time, which if done correctly can produce excellent results. Another method I have used is similar to what you describe, using a blender, some water and soy milk, (although I definitely didn't let it sit for 5 hrs) except that I filtered it using a coffee filter (I can't remember if it was best to add the soy milk before or after filtering). However honestly the taste doesn't bother me, but once when I tried root + water in a blender without proper filtration it was gross and hard to drink though, or once when I drank a *lot *of kava the taste was starting to bug me. No nausea though.


If I am just using low doses for therapeutic purposes (insomnia, anxiety, drug withdrawal, interstitial cystitis or bladder infections, etc) I will just put powdered root in capsules or buy some good quality capsules containing whole root powder, as that's easier.

Didnt read through the whole thread but in case anyone is interested, I placed a drop of grain alcohol kava extract on a small piece of paper towel, waited for it to dry, and Marquis tested it. Immediate red fading to brown over time.


May be useful information when purchasing root powder or capsules from a new source.


Can anyone verify my result? I can post a result for Mandelin and Ehrlich's as well if anyone is interested.

So I just got finished with Kim Stanley Robinsons Mars Trilogy and though I know it is fiction in it they drink Kava-Java.  It has me interested.  Is there a historical basis for this mixture of Kava and Coffee?  Is it  a modern invention?  Or is it simply fictional?

Kava kava & coffee have nothing to do with each other, kava means coffee in slovenian & croatian & there's even a brand of instant coffee called Kava.  There's a bunch of coffee houses with "kava" in their name but if you asked them what kava kava (piper methysticum) was they'd look at you dumbfounded.  I personally have experienced nausea & vomiting having coffee after having a second dose of kava (several hours after the first).  So in summary, I would not recommend them together.  An interesting sidenote, kava is called "awa" in Hawaii, and the word kava was used to mean anything bitter in Fiji & Vanuatu.  Reportedly the reason we call it kava kava is due to a marketing ploy, showing the word twice was meant to increase the buyer's awareness of it.

I don't think that's quite true. In Fiji they call kava "yaqona" ("q" is pronounced "ng" in Fiji - so it sounds like "yangona"), although "qona" can mean bitter - you are thinking of *Tonga*, where "kava" means bitter. "Kava" is not even a Fijian word, they only use it when speaking to Westerners who haven't learned "yaqona" yet ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). They *claim* that bitter is named after kava and not the other way around, but I don't know if that's true (kava use predates history). In Vanuatu "kokona" means bitter. All these terms likely come from similar roots though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I think you are right that traditionally there is no drinking of kava mixed with coffee. I have never heard of it.


I have seen reports from people on other drug forums combining kava and coffee though, (and saying they liked it, although I wouldn't do it *personally* as I don't like coffee), so it's not a complete myth as people actually do it, but I don't know if people got the idea from the books or vice versa - it's very possible they got the idea of "kava java" *from* the books. The first book is from 20 years ago, right?

All these terms likely come from similar roots though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The first book is from 20 years ago, right?

I believe they where all published in the mid to late 90's.  It wouldn't suprise me if people started doing it after reading the books.  That's why I asked about it on here lol.

Is there any pharmacological reason that Kava would not work in the 'traditional' way if one were using it for anxiety while also taking Neurotin and a benzo?


I'm looking for a way to lessen 'breakthrough' anxiety without taking another benzo or increasing the dose of either of the above-mentioned meds (which I am trying to get off and therefore, experience anxiety).

No it would still work but its not really meant to be used for a legitimate medical condition, more so for fun; in this respect it can be equated to alcohol. Talk to your doctor.

I have used kava while taking Neurontin and benzos and found it helpful in reducing my doses of those meds. I did find it to really synergize with the Neurontin though so be very careful with doses until you get a feel for how you react to it.

According to who?! Kava has many therapeutic uses. It's not just recreational. I have had at least 2 doctors recommend it to me (for multiple purposes).

Established medical procure (every industrialized pharmaceutical block). The problem with Kava is that it not only has many modes of action (which might exacerbate other conditions, such as SNRI and MAOI activity), but its not regulated and therefore a standardized, medically valid and appropriate dose is very hard to come by.

Do you mind explaining the various modes of action? I've heard it has GABA<sub>a</sub> affinity and even cannabinoid activity but am curious as to others. Also, does the S**N**RI activity responsible for the 'stimulant' type effect it can give?

I'm on 3.6g of gabapentin a day and a similarly high dose of vallium so I usually have't found anything to really synergize since those doses/meds probably *overpower* them (which is what I was wondering about with Kava).


I am using a standardized ethanol extract and have been taking around 325-400mg of kavalactones per dose FWIW

It works primarily through sodium and calcium ion channels, with MAOI-B and SNRI (these two causing stimulation, but mostly the former), and (disputed, but probable) action at the benzodiazepine site. Yangonin has affinity for CB1, but its only slight and it could as well be an antagonist. Due to it not being an institutionally accepted pharmaceutical there isn't a lot of research on it.

Hi,

Just ordered some powder Kava Kava and strainer bag. I think I read somewhere that it's good to make it with a cold drink...something that contains some fat, like milk. Allow it to steep for a while...even up to an hour and then squeeze the bag into the drink and hopefully it works. That's the method I'm going to try anyway. I did look up some recipes...so, I'll sit down and read more on it later. I'll post my experience...if anything. I've kind of learned that these online vitamins, pill, powders, leaves...whatever...tend NOT to work. But, I'm gonna give this a shot and hope it relieves my anxiety. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

Speaking of doses....how much would you  recommend for the powder. I plan to steep it in cold chocolate milk. I read somewhere that you should use a cold drink that contains some fat...such as milk. I don't like just plain milk, so I figured I would try chocolate. I have an extreme high tolerance for things. Any suggestions would help. Thanks!

2-4 grams 3x daily is the starter dose, but you can go much higher relatively safely.

I've tried capsules, drink at a local bar, Yogi brand Kava, and powdered Kava online. The results were weakest to strongest as I've lised. Really felt nothing of the capsules or the prepared drink. I was VERY surprised by the Yogi tea, seeing as I bought it from Meijer and have since seen it sold all over the place. It numbs the tounge and about 3 or 4 tea bags has you feeling gooood. But if I really want a good chill kava night, nothing beats the powder. Still want to try a root.

Living in Vanuatu the last 12 months.


Many locals will tell you Vanuatu Kava is the strongest throughout the South Pacific. Not a massive fan, but a few tips and tricks I've picked up from drinking with the Pro's...


1. Traditionally, Kava is a social drink, over the years, it has become less ceremonial. 4-5pm is 'Happy hour' and is when you local 'Kava bars' will be full of eager patrons. Not like a traditional bar, these are usually out door, no lights, no music, and talking is always in hushed voices. Studies have shown that Kava can reveal Social Anxiety. IMO Kava is best enjoyed with a group of friends, not many distractions, I.e no TV/radio


2. When drinking Kava, try for an empty stomach; there is a respect for Kava, and the pepper root plant it comes from in this country. Locals will not eat before having the first 'shell', after consuming, they will sit, generally in silence, and allow the effects of Kava to take place, after say 4-5minutes after the first shell, they will eat. Most Kava bars will sell some sort of food, the more traditional bars have home cooked, 'Lap Lap' or coconut milk Manioc. Any food is good, but warm is better.


3. If drinking Alcohol after, no more Kava, much like MJ, Kava before beer your in the clear, beer before kava you'll need looked after. ; )


4. Great mixed with pot, Nausea is a possible side effect, much like smoking and drinking alcohol.


5. Quality? Do you lips tingle slightly after drinking? You've got the goods!!


6. Don't sip, it is served in half a coconut shell or a bowl of similar size, straight down the hatch.


7. the taste isn't pretty, have some fruit on the side to munch on afterwards, pineapple or pawpaw my first choice.


8. After a few shells, try a glass of warm milk, helps with any nausea, and seems to extend the effects of the Kava


The Kava in Vanuatu, is prep'd from the roots of the pepper root plants, NEVER the leaves, this is how it is always drunk, I have tried powdered stuff, doesn't compete.

i just couldn't break through with this shit. I consumed like two shells every day for a month (squeezed and strained quality powder) and never felt anything. I've used kava years ago before that and definitely got krunk a few times. might be the prescription meds i'm on, whatever

Okay...I got my strainer today. But, I'm going to have to psyche myself up before I try the Kava again.....it was pretty bad. I'll wait until I know I know I'm off work the next day. This stuff really upset my stomach. It made me nauseous the entire day. I think what I'm slowly, but surely learning is that these herbal things that are purchased online...just simply don't work for me. :/

kava is interesting stuff. i once ate a heroic amount of it (capped) in one sitting and got a nice buzz a little reminiscent of the final stages of mdma comedown that lasted for a good portion of the evening. so, there is definitely psychoactive potential here, but the sheer amount of material that needs to be consumed makes it a bit too impractical for me to use with any regularity when so many other agents are available to me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Get yourself some whole roots.  Much more potent and easier to deal with in my opinion.  You just chew it.

Anytime I've done kava, granted it wasn't the greatest stuff, I'd equate it to a mix of opiate, benzos, and antihistamine (only much more mild).  I think it's either one of those things you love, or you just move on from.  Myself, I moved on.

Yeah it can. Tolerance builds rapidly though. I once took a looooooot and was 'drunk' for two days, accompanying a horrible nausea. The 'good' stuff is definitely 'good'.

You just put the powder in hot water and drink it as a tea. They serve it like that in Kava bars in my area. It doesn't do much of anything unless you take mass quantity, especially if you're used to using drugs. I go to the bars for the Kratom.

^Uh i don't think thats how you make a proper Kava kava beverage.


When i make it i grind the whole root first in a coffee grinder, then add that to about i teaspoon vegetable oil or coconut oil.

from there I add ~4oz whole milk in and mix it up. THEN, i add 16-240z COLD water depending on how much kava is used.

another important step i've noticed: Let it sit at least overnight, and stir occasionally if you can. Drink slowly.


This will provide much better results than "pouring hot water on it and drinking it as tea."  Heat, if hot enough, destroys kavalectones anyways.


anyone else have any recipes with good results?

Anytime man. I've tried a variety of Kava, fresh, and capsules. I would have to say that some of the more expensive capsules are just as good as fresh root. Plus, you don't have to deal with that horrid taste of cocaine/mud/pepper.

im pretty new to it, gone thru about 5 ounces of fijian n just received a pound of the good shit , ive sworn myself off xanax n basically any drug these days, besides my scripted methadone valium n mirtazepine .


 ive found it gives me everything i want in a drug (in my case anyway) , 

im now getting pounds from a vendor in hawaii at a very reasonable price,   at first i just get the numbness,  then nothing for 2 hours, then fall asleep for 20-30mins , then when i wake thats when i feel it, feels like a decent codeine high mixed with a weak benzo .  even tho it says not to i looovee driving on it , i cld cruise up n down the esplenade all day on the shit. im on methadone as well so i dunno if that helps or hinders the kava .  i dont even feel the need to take my daily valiums when on kava .  its also one of those things u need to take for a period of time before u really start noticing the effects .  im still tinkering with my teqniche, im using mahakea powdered root

One think I noticed b4 experiencing imported powdered root was the teabags with kava seemed to actually work around 2-3 bags or cups, relieved anxiety from PAWS (post acute withdrawal), however it was nothing close to the root method I use now. It's a night and day difference. With kava it's a very relaxing mellow but talkative buzz initially. And after about 45m-1hr it fades and your left feeling very tired but still semi relaxed. Although I often experience a headache after as well as a hangover the following morning. Still very impressive for a legal herbal high. It's like the benzo version of kratom IME. As far as Australian law here is what erowid says which checks out with other sources as well.

The government just wants to be able to track volumes and trading sources. It is completely illegal in one state.

Can someone put it SIMPLY how to fucking take this stuff? How many godamn milligrams? I have the root powder. How much mg, and can I just dunk it in my mouth and wash it down with water or do I need to do something special with it for it to work? Why is this simple information so hard to fucking find?

^ Here is my kava prep:


 Grind up root chunks to powder in a coffee grinder if it is not already powder. I use 5-6 tablespoons of powder. Add in blender. Add a few cups of juice, water, or fruity drink. Add a tablespoon of cream as well as a tablespoon of lecithin.  Blend it for a solid 5 minutes. Leave in the refrigerator for an hour or so. Reblend, and drink. Strain or don't. I don't.  When I say drink it's the traditional chug a mug in 2 minutes and repeat. The thought of sipping can have me nauseated. So it is a chugalug, usually on an empty stomach. Then a little food is in order. 


I first had kava success back in 2000. I had tried kava on and off since 1981 but never had success. Before the internet we were stuck with whatever a health food store could aquire. Finally ordered some good root and a properly made brew worked very well one night and I got it. 


It is hit or miss and can be frustrating, but once it happens you'll know what to look for.  I have had kava do anything from almost nothing to having the room spin around.  Sounds seem to get louder too.  It'd be nice by an ocean at sunset.

So what is the juice and cream and lecithin for? Is it necessary? I just put some raw powder on my tongue and I can't even taste it, but I seem to be reading that people find the taste awful? Is it to simply mask the taste?


If so, then SIMPLY PUT, I can just swallow the powder with water? I am looking for the simplest, fastest method here without fucking around. 


Thanks.


Edit: and again, how many milligrams??? I read somewhere 300mg, does that sound right? Right now I am looking to get fucked or "krunked" on this stuff, and plan to use it for anti anxiety self medication in the future, but tonight I just wanna get 'krunked'.

The juice is for the taste.  The fats (cream or lecithin) is for the kavalactones to come out of the root powder into the fat.  I had heard long ago that a fat needs to be present in the liquid.  Then again I hear that it is not now necessary yet with me it won't work as well if I don't have some form of fat.  That is why (for me) just tossing the powder down my throat doesn't work.  A proper brew is more successful.


Good kava will make your tongue numb right away.


If you do just eat the powder let us know if it works.  My kava knowledge is from long ago and I stuck to it.  So it may kavalactones are soluble in just a liquid without the fat. But for now I still use cream or lecithin.

Alright. I put 450mg into a bottle of water with a small amount of water in the bottom, then I broke open 3 fish oil capsules (fat) and squeezed those in too, shook it up and let it sit for a few minutes and drank it. I'll report back in an hour.


Edit: Alright. I was feeling really stressed before over something, and it seems to have definitely calmed me down, I feel, simply.. calm. Not exactly what I was hoping for, but this morning I did take 600mg Armodafinil. I have extensive experience with benzos/weed and some with shrooms, numerous 'nootropics' etc also, so I have decided to say 'fuck it' and put about 4grams into a pint of milk which I will now consume. Again for reference, [this](http://www.paradisekava.com/Kava-Powder/PNG-s-ISA-Grown-in-Hawaii-p26.html) is the stuff I have, which is apparently quite potent and the website even suggests that beginners use their weaker product. Also I have chronic general and social anxiety, whether that has any effect on how it will affect me compared to a 'normal' person I don't know.


There is also this 'reverse tolerance' I have read about to consider, which is apparently like where people smoke weed for the first time and don't get high (never happened in my case with weed), so that could play a role here too.

Kava doesn't blast you into outer space, unless you take loads and loads of it, in which case you have to deal with ataxia and nausea/vomiting, huge doses really aren't worth it(although, yeah I do every fuckin time, but I'm a druggie, ay?!).

Good point.  IMO, just be careful with this stuff.  I literally couldn't walk once or twice, and was trying to go put my phone on the charger, fell over and broke my nose, bled all over the fuckin place.  Kava kava WILL fuck you up, as much as anything, if you dose high enough.  It's not necessarily pleasant, however, and there is a hangover.

Well I drank about 4 grams in a pint of milk and it's been about an hour and I don't feel much different, does the stuff I bought look good on the site? Do I really need to strain it out or something, or is just mixing it with something fatty (milk, fish oil) enough? I also drank the powder. I read the powder can cause nausea if drunk but I feel fine.

The root should be good. As far as I know, consuming 4 grams of strong root should do something. Did it numb your tongue?


I consider kava's effect relatively subtle compared to some things, but I've never had a heroic dose and I've heard that does mess you up like described above.


Of course, if you have GABA insensitivity (eg benzo intolerance), I have no idea how that would affect things. 


The only other thing I've noticed is that kava *does* seem to degrade a bit in strength, slowly, even at room temperature, but if it's <1 year old this probably isn't a factor. (I do still like to refrigerate kava for this reason.)

Get roots, way stronger.  If you're gonna use powdered kava, mix it into a milkshake, preferably with reeses peanutbutter icecream.  Make sure to consume quickly as it gets bitter if it sits for awhile.  It tastes good fresh though, like honestly addictive.  The roots don't taste as bad for some reason, and you just stick them in your mouth and start chewing.  It's a bit awkward at first but after awhile you get used to it, like chewing tobacco I guess and you associate the numbing taste with a deep subtle euphoria, relaxation, and stimulation.  Kava has natural phenethylamines as well as kavalactones and flavanoids and probably other things in it too... it feels good to me.


Extract is decent but doesn't have the same feeling, it is stronger feeling in other areas... more anxiety relief and less buzz or relaxation.


Optimuswind, your kava is obviously degraded.  Does it numb your mouth a lot when you drink it?  Associate the numb with the high, and you should feel it fast also.  Within 2-3 minutes of first sip, a tiny bit slower than alcohol.  It's nothing you have to chug and make yourself sick trying tog et enough unless your shit is weak.  It's really easy to find decent quality kava just google it there's a nice website with kava, kratom, and all other kinds of natural botanicals and they've been around for a long time.  Should be very easy to find them with google.


Electrodevo, with gaba insensitivity you would still feel the effects of some parts of the kava buzz, it obviously works on something other than gaba (as well as gaba obviously) to produce it's stimulating yet relaxing buzz.  I know that kavalactones aren't the only types of chemicals present in kava (and I bet different varieties have different proportions and chemicals entirely) but I think (not sure) that kavalactones themselves are a bit of a receptor whore.

Works on GABA and is a weak MAOI, as far as I've been able to ascertain.  I haven't read anything that says anything else.


FYI you really, really want the root, not the rest; the roots don't cause liver damage, but the rest of the plant does, and, I believe, certain strains, but not the type that is usually sold.  I know there was something in ADD about this...

I find it interesting that so many novice users of kava consistently report being disappointed with their initial experience.  MAKE SURE YOU TRY IT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.  I have also noticed a reverse tolerance with kava, but when it finally works, you WILL notice it, it will not be as subtle as some herbal tea but will instead make you tired, slightly dizzy, and probably nauseous if you've had enough.  I enjoyed it for a brief period while looking for an alternative to alcohol, but without fail became nauseous & vomited once, and quit for good after that.  I noticed that while surfing kava forums there's only a handful of people (mostly recovering alcoholics) who made kava their DOC & use it daily, a very narrow but deep fan base. Wish you all the best of luck with it!


Just wanted to add an update, new research shows that moulds such as alfatoxin forming during improper drying of the roots may be responsible for liver damage: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3269575/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3269575/)

Yeah, I got numbing of the tongue each time I drank the stuff. It wasn't very strong numbing and didn't last very long. I took it a few more times since, using about 6-8 large tablespoons of it, and straining it through an old t-shirt in a bowl for about 15 minutes. Surprisingly the last time I did that, I didn't feel anything but the tongue numbing, wheras the first time I took it, I definitely had a feeling of calmness after taking much less. Each time was on an empty stomach.


It also gives me poor shits the day after. Is consuming the powder, even after straining, supposed to be done? I don't think it is, but the times when I did that I seemed to get the most calming effects, but I think doing that increases the next-day shits - is that also an increased risk of liver damage (if the roots weren't properly dried, that is - since none of us really have any way to be sure of that unless we did it ourselves) - or, does it not matter because the stuff causing the liver damage would be strained out too?

I started using kava again, even though I had bad experiences with the Hawaiian powdered kava I bought last spring.  Back then I drink the powder & felt nausea after each use, and one Sunday I had too much, vomited, and said "That's Enough" selling the rest of the 1 lb. I bought. 

     This time I purchased Vanuatu crushed kava root purchased from a local health foods store.  My prep. was as follows:  Funnel 2-4 Tbs crushed root into a nylon stocking, knot it up & soak in 16 oz cold water, add either 1/4 tsp. soy lecithin or 1/2 cup soy milk, let set for at least 20 mins. to soften the root.  Then I knead the nylon encased root for 5-10 minutes, then it's ready to drink (or you can let in soak for a few hrs).  It went down pretty good, still so grit at the bottom of the glass so I discarded that (it made me gag).  I always drink it on an empty stomach.  The first night I felt something decent in 10 minutes, which faded by a 1/2 hr.  I used kava for 8 days to be sure any reverse tolerance was taken care of. 

 Positives:  Some short-lived, not reliable in effects light-headed euphoria, relaxed muscles, and a better mood.  I was not as easily angered or stressed, but I certainly wouldn't call it being "high".  Negatives:  Inner-ear balance issues which were annoying, didn't taste bad but not good either,inconsistent effects (after the first nights better than expected results, those effects were not experienced again), even with 4-5 Tablespoons, it became a chore to prepare it each night as I didn't want to lose the reverse-tolerance (which didn't seem to be the case

I mentioned the aflatoxin contamination in improperly dried root above, I'd imagine that was only a problem with shady fly-by-night companies that got into the flood of kava products in the early 2000's.  Any of the main farms you can order from should be fine as they have a reputation to protect. anyway as it turned out).  I'm also hesitant about combining it with alcohol, & sometimes I'd rather have beer or cocktails.  I've never had luck with any kava pills or paste, one item I bought once suggested using a pea-sized amt of paste, I had 4-5 times that amount & never felt anything.

I've found the best way to get around the taste of a powderred kava is to make it as a coffee brew. 


Just brew your favorite ground (or whatever type) of coffee in your coffee machine, put the normal coffee in the fridge for a few minutes to get it down to about 100 degrees farenheight (gotta save those kavalactones), put about 16 oz of the coffee into your blender with about 2.5 tbsp of powderred kava and 1.5 tsp of Soy Lecithin, blend for ten minutes, strain it out with a muslin bag and drink over the course of an hour or two. You can put in some honey or sugar if you want too. 


Always helps me relax, talk, and concentrate on my schoolwork. And the best part is, you can just put it in a thermos and nomatter where you are, nobody will ever know it isn't just normal coffee. I drink mine in school every single day and haven't gotten in trouble yet. 


And a coffee brew is totally different effects-wise from any other concoction in my experience. I think the caffeine potentiates the effects because i think it's stronger.

I'm trying to decide if I want to buy some.


I've tried tinctures and pills before and all they ever did was make me tired or give me the mildest relaxation feeling which I wished was stronger.


However, it seems a few people on here really like it.


For some of those who really enjoy it, what do you like most about it and why would you recommend it to others?


Is it really a legit "high" or do you have to get to the point (like one poster said) to where you are falling over and can't walk before it's effective?


Also, I take Klonopin and Prozac so would want to be sure it doesn't mix badly with either, but considering I've already used weak Kava with them I'd guess it doesn't even though some have said Kava has slight MAOI properties.


Also, I don't know if I would feel less since I have a high tolerance to benzos.

I bought some quality ISA Kava root powder, a 1lb bag, I'm down to about less than 1/4.


The most I ever felt from it was a numbed tongue/throat, and a sense of calmness/relaxation - it definitely wasn't like being drunk and stumbling around, I just felt slightly calm. I, too, have a high benzo tolerance, so I don't know if that makes a difference.


I once tried two bottles with about 12 heaping tablespoons of the powder kneaded into the water, drank it all - hardly felt anything. Only ever really felt the 'calm' the first time. Each time it numbed my tongue and  throat for about 10 minutes, so I know I was actually getting the stuff in me, and I kneaded the powder in an old tshirt for about 20 minutes each time to make sure I got it all out. I wouldn't bother with it.

I just got an ounce of powdered Kava which I think is WAKA grade (whatever that means, quality I guess...) and the bag says to "take 1/16th a teaspoon (250mg) 1-3 times daily".


I don't know why that dosage was suggested, but it seemed small so I mixed a tea spoon in some milk and strirred it up and drank it over and hour ago and absolutely nothing has happened.


Does anyone have a suggestion for the correct dosage for this stuff??


Personally I don't believe Kava works unless mixed with something else strong.


When on Oxy I used some droppers of Kava from the health food store and noticed some mild effects but doubt it would have worked on it's own.


I don't know if I even feeling like trying more tonight but this seems like the kind stuff where I'd have to consume MASSIVE amounts to feel ANYTHING at all.


Anyone know how the hell to get any REAL effects out of Kava??


Hell, even a mild but noticeable buzz would be nice...

You need alot to make it work like a 1/2 a cup FULL of root powder. So maybe 6 or more tablepoons. Ye it does have an effect but Im sitll figuring out if its cost effective cos you need so much. I only bought from random ebay dealers so potentcy couldnt be assured so im still waiting to find that out myself tho im not that hopeful. Got some order myself form a supposed more reputable source.


The effect wastnt too bad but the duration was the worst part...only lasting about 15 mins for main effects and tapering off to nothing after another 20 mins or so ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png). Ive tried it a few times now and same shit however like i say each time it was not from a reliable source so we'll see how this next try goes.

KAVA is strange, it definitely makes me more sluggish and tired. Although if I take too much right before going to sleep I never really sleep, I get these intense closed eye dreams and time passes so slowly. Almost speedy feeling yet when I open my eyes and walk around I'm tired as shit. Eventually it puts me to sleep.


I haven't ever tried making the drinks but supposedly you get more out of it when you mix it with milk, etc. 


I preferred the paste than the ground up root since kava powder seems to clump up easily and can make you feel really bloated. Although, I have eaten a lot of powder before and got a really drunk feeling, yet not too much euphoria. 


IMO kava is alright, it's awesome if you're in some sort of Withdrawal, it really took the edge off of my phenibut withdrawal before I got some gabapentin.


Oh and they say kava is reverse tolerance, so you might not feel anything your first couple tries. Keep trying before you give up on kava.

Yeah, someone else on here told me they use 50 grams, and I only bought an ounce, so I'm wondering if I should just pour the entire bag into a cup of milk and down the whole thing?


No one can really seem to agree on dosage because there seems to be so many different strengths and types of powders, etc.

50 grams? Fuck. I eat kratom all day so I'm used to eating powder fine. But with kava root powder, atleast the kind I have, the shit feels like it clumps up in your stomach. I can't eat too much pure powder without my stomach feeling uncomfortable.


I don't really take kava too much and haven't found my "sweet spot" but 50 grams would be way way too much unless mixed. Take like 5 grams and see how you feel. Like I said, a lot of people including myself report not feeling anything the first couple of tries. It's supposedly a reverse tolerance drug which I have no idea how that works but go with it. There's tons of videos on how to make it into a drink, I'll have to try those sometime since they seem to drink a lot. Maybe I haven't had a true kava experience either.


The best time I had with kava was in phenibut withdrawal, and I was trying to ride it out. I stuck a whole clump of kava in my bottom lip like you would dipping tobacco, and just left it there for awhile. It seemed to work well although it gets stuck on your teeth easily. I think the islanders that use kava spit of the roots when they harvest them, something about saliva brings it out more maybe?


This vid might help.

^ I've never had any luck with the very expensive 84% paste or capsules sold at drugstores.  Dried root (powder) is the most commonly used form outside of the south pacific, and the most economical.  You can order fresh root frozen but it's expensive & not worth it IMO, though I have yet to try it as dried root satisfies me. I like the variety Nabawan from Vanuatu as it has lower DHM content & hence reduces any nausea you may experience with Tudei or others.  1/2 cup in a nylon, soaked for half an hr. then kneaded 5 mins. in 2 cups coconut milk gives a great effect, similar to alcohol but without all the negative side effects.

I like the variety Nabawan from Vanuatu as it has lower DHM content & hence reduces any nausea you may experience with Tudei or others.  1/2 cup in a nylon, soaked for half an hr. then kneaded 5 mins. in 2 cups coconut milk gives a great effect, similar to alcohol but without all the negative side effects.

Is there an interaction between SSRIs and kava? I searched but it's tough to find stuff on my phone and I'm seeing different answers.

That is an extremely high dose of lyrica (pregabalin) and I would not recommend this to other people. The first time I used lyrica I took 2 300mg capsules at work, (in a nursing home where the nurse in charge gave me the 2 capsules to get high ( she knew I was an experienced drug user) and I was pleasantly high from the 2 capsules) but I had tried heroin and was addicted to hydrocodone and blah blah blah dihpenhydramine... Blah blah blah almost died from Tylenol... 600mgs of lyrica is enough to feel something. It's no wonder you blacked out and compromised your friendship duh...

Three basic rules for a worthwhile experience 1. Empty stomach  2. Soy Lecithin 1200mg (give or take) 3. Quality kava  


5000mg kavalactones  or so. If you do that rite you will get the full effect. A bit of phenibut &/or etizolam will only help.

Tried some yesterday and am going to try a larger amount tonight. Seems like a worthy substitute for alcohol. And it blows those OTC antihistamines out of the water.

Kava kava is a very subtle drug- not necessarily 'weak', but always subtle- If you're looking for something that is better/stronger than benzos or whatever you're gonna be disappointed. It's not made in a lab, it's a root. Plus you'll all be getting old-ass, dried up, weak as fuck stuff too. It doesn't thrive outside of the pacific (I'm in New Zealand) as far as I know.


If your aim is to get fucked up then take a whole bunch as quickly as possible and then drink a couple of beers (or whatever, but you only want to drink 1-4 drinks depending on your tolerance to alcohol). That's what people do here, particularly young people, who wanna get krunk. Smoking weed helps too. You're never gonna get blotto off kava alone. Drinking on it is really bad for your liver though, so be warned.


I really don't understand why you're bothering. It's only fun if you're *literally* trapped on a deserted island. I can get the good stuff for like 1/20th the price, but I don't- it'sust  not worth the hassle. Take a trip to Vanuatu or Fiji or whatever, do it there- then you'll enjoy it...set and setting, as they say.

I tried kava today hoping for the anti-anxiety affect as I need something to deal with my anxiety while I learn to deal with it cognitively.


The first thing I tried was making a tea from pieces of cut and dried root. I added a bit of rooibos and mint so it didn't taste horrible. I drank this, didn't feel much. So I tried two tablespoons of kava in a muslin bag, squished/agitated in a small bowl of cold water for 10 minutes like I had read the traditional preparation to be. Drank that. It didn't taste too bad, but again I had included a little bit of rooibos for flavour. I still wasn't feeling anything. I'd read about someone who chewed the dried root so I tried that, made my entire mouth numb. By this point I could be feeling something, but I was kind of looking for a high or like an alcohol drunk, or even a benzo buzz. Didn't get any of that. I read about making the concoction the same way as the traditional way except with hot (not boiling) water so I tried that and it tasted much stronger. By this point I was definitely feeling relaxed and calm and maybe a little euphoric. I don't know if it took the hot water concoction to do it, or if it was additive effects of all of my experiments. In any case, I felt very, very relaxed. I lay down and listened to some music for a while, and then it seemed to wear off.


I made one more hot water concoction before going to bed, and by this time drinking it made me a little nauseous. I fell asleep right away though, but only slept for 3 hours, even though I feel like I've slept for 6.


I'm a little disappointed that the buzz wasn't quite what I was looking for (a replacement for taking too many benzos) but I do think if I save it specifically for those days where I'm upset or anxious or wound too tight or too emotional, kava can help me relax and get through that moment. The place where I bought it from had cut root or powdered, and I'm used to making tea so I got the cut root. Next time I'm thinking powder because that's what they use in the traditional preparation.

**Kava Discussion, Preferred Methods and General**


I need some tips regarding kava. I bought a bag of 4oz of kava about a month ago. I really took a liking to it, it was the instant Easy-strain mix. It gave me pretty enjoyable effects and I slept beautifully on it. I've not had much money for it since I ran out, but I'm planning to order a good bit whenever I do, quite possibly some kava paste or something as well.


So I'd like to ask those of you who have used kava, specifically those who have used or continue to use it on a regular basis, what's your preferred method of making it? Do you use a blender, what do you mix it with, have you used the paste, and how? How do you achieve the best effects from your kava, and how can I? I don't know very much about different methods of making and consuming it, so I'd like to hear from some people who do. What do you like about it, what kind do you prefer, do you strain it or do you just bear with it?


General Kava Discussion

I started out with the traditional method of straining the kava in a bag, kneading it for about 5 to 10 minutes. Sometimes I would add some kind of fatty oil or liquid like milk or olive oil (just a little) to help absorption, although I couldn't tell you if it made any difference tbh. Got some surprisingly strong euphoric effects that lasted about 45 minutes, with increased sociability, reduced muscle and nerve pain, and decreased anxiety as well. 


After awhile though the taste just really got to me, even smelling it would make me feel naeseous, as the traditional method can be very pugent in odor. I switched to micronized kava, which is an ultra fine grind that can be mixed in a protein shaker/blender bottle just like instant kava, except it seems more potent than the instant. After the ease of use with micronized kava I just use that now, takes all of 20 seconds to mix it and the liquid itself is thinner and doesnt taste nearly as bad, so its very easy to chug it in a few seconds.


Ive never tried the paste over extracts though. One thing I noticed is that taking it before bed always gave me very vivid dreams, dont know if anyone else experienced this.

You really need fresh roots, freshly ground, to get that satisfied effect from Kava.

I live in Australia and have tried various sources' powder. It never satisfies because the root has probably been ground and packaged too long ago.

When i went to Vanuata and the surrounding islands, i tried the real shit several times. 

The locals would sit there and grind up a fresh root each day. They said the root needs to be fresh or the powder will not work to its full potential.

Kava is one of my favourite drug experiences by far. Its just a shame you will rarely achieve those effects unless you have legit freshly ground root.

Kava really helped me get off alcohol when i was addicted and the doctor i had at the time wouldn't prescribe me benzos to help get off alcohol for some reason, and i couldn't afford to buy it off the streets.


So I used kava and a little bit of xanax (when i could afford it) here and there to get off the booze.

Just wanted to share some info about types of kava which contain Tudei, rather than Noble, varieties. 


<snip>


Pay attention to the Qualitative column listing yellow or orange. Remember, the natives who've used kava for thousands of years rarely if ever consumed the Tudei (two day) type because of negative effects such as nausea, and "kava hangover"   In fact Tudei kava is banned from export in Vanuatu. 


<snip>


As you can see from the results, one of the more heavily advertised companies, <snip>, tests positive for Tudei. It was the first brand I tried, not knowing any better, and always experienced nausea from it, compared to the <snip> I now drink which is much more pleasant.

Very interesting - the only time I actually felt intoxicated from straight kava was from a bag of root powder from Papua New Guinea advertised as tudei. I managed to slug down a couple of big cups of the nasty shit - it literally tasted like pine cones, skunk smell, and wet mud - and within about an hour I actually felt a pleasant, warm buzz, kind of like alcohol but a bit more euphoric.

**What are the "heady" effects of kava like?**


Bought some kava, coming next week, so I've been reading more about experiences and I read this is a particularly "heady" kava, kinda like how people call sativa a head high I guess. But what I'm wondering is (obviously from someone with experience with kava) am I going to feel spacey and weird like I did the few times I've had cannabinoids (synth and real) in life? Or what are the heady effects they're describing? I'm not particularly hoping for either way, just don't want to be in the wrong place if I'm going to get all spacey and mildly psychedelic like weed.

Nah, o wouldn't compare it tonweed thagbmuch really. Not so phychedelic but more benzo like. 


I'd say a Kava body high is like the body load from a benzo;  wobbly and tired. The head high is anxiety reducing and talkative. Really nice actually. 


But warning, ?Don't mix with Bupropion and you will have akave hangover the next day for like an hour.

Yeah I don't plan to mix it with anything. Just sometimes I need something to make me happy and calm, kava is less damaging and sounds like it has more fun effects than alcohol so I'm half using it for self medication of anxiety attacks and half for fun.

I used to make Kava smoothies and put it in a thermos. The school always just thought it was coffee. 


Oh, and don't filter if you can handle the chunky flavors. It makes it stronger if you eat that.

That won't be an issue, I'm getting micronized instant Kava. No real prep required. Put a couple spoonfuls in water and drink.

But what I'm wondering is (obviously from someone with experience with kava) am I going to feel spacey and weird like I did the few times I've had cannabinoids (synth and real) in life? Or what are the heady effects they're describing? I'm not particularly hoping for either way, just don't want to be in the wrong place if I'm going to get all spacey and mildly psychedelic like weed.

Kava smoothies? Doesn't kava taste horrible? How bad is the taste of kava, with nothing extra added, on a bad taste scale of 1 to 10. With 10 being the absolute worst tasting thing possible.


Just for reference (in my opinion):


A slice of pumpkin pie is a 1 out of 10 

Eating human feces would be a 10 out of 10 (I imagine so, anyways, based on how it smells, lol)

Poppy tea is about an 9 out of 10

Kratom tea is about a 7.5 out of 10


Where would prepared kava, with nothing additional added for taste, fit on such a scale for you guys? Are there things you add to improve taste, and if so, how much does it help?

Depends on the strain, freshness, company selling it, how it's stored. Most people don't find it extremely unpleasant. Some strains taste really bad and bitter and some are pretty nice from what I hear.


The taste will be better if you buy fresh stuff from a reputable vendor that has only certified noble kava, and your liver will thank you when it's not soaked in junk from tudei.

Hi all, I have some kava and recently started amitryptiline 25mg for preventing chronic migraine and am taking 5mg Dextroamphetamine for ADD, I already tried Dex and Kava which was nice and not overwhelming, altho I am worried about mixing it with amitryptiline which is a potent norepinephrine Reuptake inhibitor and so is kava, well kava is not as potent but it still is. So has any1 tried a low TCA dose with kava (I dont take alot of kava when I do, about 2-3grams) and Dex which is also a NRI.  I know the NRI effect from 3 different drugs is going to stack, I just want to know how much intense it could be before trying it.

Well my first real experience with kava was not pleasant. The main effects were feeling drunk and extremely nauseous, except with none of the fun effects of alcohol like being more social and mild euphoria. I'm considering just giving it to a friend. I don't think there was anything wrong with the product, my body probably just doesn't get along with kava. Oh well, almost everything is worth at least a try.

Can't believe no one else has posted... I have a weird question though.


Does anyone else get a persistent sweet smell in their nose for hours after using kava? It's almost like someone put brown sugar/maple syrup in my nose. It's not like super overpowering and annoying, but it's definitely there every time I use kava.

If you felt drunk and nauseous you did too much. Don't write kava off yet, the effects can vary a lot from use to use and with dose. Keep on experimenting with lower doses.

Very good advice. Different prep methods and products can help a ton with preventing nausea.

I don't want to let die this megathread since I'm starting to love kava so much!


Is great, I like how it works. The bad thing is that, for me, is quite inconsistent, one day I get so tipsy and another I'm quite euphoric for like 2 hours and another I feel almost nothing, I don't know how to control it, I think I still don't know how to create a potent grog or maybe there's other stuff that I'm not aware.

I tend to drink it within empty stomach and all.

I think I prefer heady varieties but heavy are better for me since I have insomnia sometimes.

I'm again bumping this (won't do it a third time...![:violin:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/data/assets/smilies/81C06197-3688-4C3F-9B4B-BC75E4C5ADF8.gif))


I'm quite krunk at the moment, I seriously don't understand how people call this plant "subtle", I don't see it "subtle" at all, maybe is because I'm not used to benzos (which I generally hate)??


I'm pretty useless at the moment, need to do my dinner but I would prefer to stay in my bed listening to music, cause this is sedating as fuck (strong melo melo cultivar) I only used 2-3 tablespoons and makas of 2 days.. (2 "extractions" each day).

I don't know, maybe I'm very sensitive to it? For sure the reverse tolerance works, no doubt about it, it's like once you take it several days in a row you get krunk very easily, specially the sedating effects come strong and reliably. I've been sleeping so soundly this last days even during kratom tapering.

I'm happy about it cause normally kratom tapering and withdrawal gets me into a horrible state of restlessness and insomnia and I don't want that at all (since I need to gain some weight I lost during the last stressful months). It seems quite true that kava potentiates dreams, I don't get better dream recall (my major "problem" with dreams) but they are incredibly vivid and real, not to the point of lucidity, tho.


I would like to find a really heady kava since the last two I got are mainly heavy or balanced, it's good but I think I would like to share a heady one with friends rather than a heavy. I live in Europe, could anyone help on that?


Viva Kava!


EDIT: these days I'm tapering kratom and using mitragyna javanica as a substitute (mainly). I have the suspiction that javanica is a light sero releaser by the effects that I get from it (little stomach glow/butterflies, spacyness...). Perhaps the slight mind-fuckery I'm getting from kava some days is really the javanica being powered by the CYP3A4 inhibition and MAO-B inhibition that kava kava can cause. Not sure tho, but maybe is interesting to some to know. At the moment I'm feeling an amazing glow/buzz and only had 1 gram of kratom 2 of javanica and the aforementioned amount of kava.

[@Neuroborean](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/539707/) 


After more than a year of use, I noticed the same things: inconsistency in the effects (same dose, on an empty stomach, same preparation...), insomnia with certain strains.


It's not that subtle indeed.


I didn't know for CYP3A4, but yes it's a MAOI (mild I think) and also an NRI. I believe it also acts on gaba and NMDA receptors.


To find a heady kava, maybe you should look at the reviews on kavaforum, I think we have the same seller (there aren't many reliable ones in Europe) and he has a section with comments per strain.

After coming across Kava recently, ita probabaly up there as my favorite drug behind opiates, benzos and pot.


I'm using it as a cannabis and benzo alternative. It works on the CB1 and GABA receptor. After 15 years of pot use i have chaotic anxiety. It satisfys any cravings i have to smoke (havnt actually thought about smoking since I first had it) and is great for winding down or for when I need abit of an attitude adjustment.


I would HIGHLY recommend this plant to anyone.

Since the mega thread was kicked up, I remember one time using a strong kava brew after coming home from a stressful day at work.  I was loaded with anxiety.  Almost shaking.  I made a proper kava brew and slammed down 2 mugs in 10 minutes on an empty stomach.  Over the next 15 minutes I can feel this peace just start washing away the anxiety as I floated away staring into space.  Some of the most euphoric relief I ever got.  I sat for 30 minutes just floating away.

But how the kava just washed away anxiety far surpassed that feeling in terms of euphoria.  I hope to try that again at some point.  Saying that, it is work to make a proper brew and takes some work to slam some down.  All that can be stressful too.  A pill is easier for those times.  But that night it was worth it.

That's because with benzos most of the euphoria comes from the joy of being released from anxiety, whereas kava is actually euphoric in it's own right in addition to releasing you from anxiety. Kava can also produce deep feelings of peace.

That is so interesting because I am the guy that sort of laughed when people said this drug or that drug gave me "peace".  Peace is a state of mind and something different than relief from anxiety and until now I never thought any drug/plant could give it.  But that statement rings true for me.  A plant that can, at times, actually give peace and not just relief.  I have to think about that.


It is called the drink of peace, seems our ancestors knew more than us.

I just orderer some kava from a well known european shop (there's just a few) and wow, I remember why I liked it so much, 

there's some very odd "glutamate" or whatever shit anxiety rebound after some hours... that in a way reminds me alcohol, but it doesn't happen ever so I don't know if it's some kind of nocebo, but the effects for me surpass alcohol and the way it energizes/synergizes with kratom it's just perfect. 

The heady kavas sometimes are too much for me, as the euphoria is QUITE pushing, at least for me, it's like pretty intoxicating and odd... the balanced and heavy kavas are my thing as I tend to use it to wind down and relax after a fucked up day and to help to be relaxed before sleeping (tho amanita it's probably the best natural sedating substance) 

In my experience it's better to use kava 2ice or 3ice a week, instead of everyday, not sure why, but it's more recognizable and the effects seem better for me.
