4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine


All I can gather is that its a mescaline analog, dose at 20-40mg and lasts 8-12 hours. Anyone got any extra information?


Also whats its legality in the UK and USA?

This substance is structurally derived from phenethylamine by substitution in the ring with methoxy groups, and so is class A in the UK.


As for the US, it's not explicitly illegal, but would probably be considered an analogue of mescaline.

i  think a reason a lot of mescaline analogues haven't made the rounds is due to potency, but this one seems to be active enough to meet producers & user's economic requirements.  Maybe we'll know more about it before too long.

Yes, if it was bought or sold for the purpose of human consumption it would most likely be covered by the analogue act. Just like most of the common RCs, 4-aco-dmt, etc.

it says alkoxy groups not allyoxy groups so I think it would be legal for the same reasons 5-meo-DALT is but I'm not 100% on this.

5-MeO-DALT isn't illegal because it has no alkyl substituent at the nitrogen atom. If this compound had only allyloxy groups on the ring it would be legal, but it has alkoxy groups as well and so is illegal.

It's not illegal if there's no proof it's intended to be taken.

Where to start...the names you give above don't mean much, you name four substituents and give three positions. I'll assume you mean that there are alkyl groups at the 3,4,5 positions on the ring of a compound called "thiophenethylamine". What is that exactly?

The PiHKAL synthesis of allylescaline seems somehow wrong. He reduces the nitrostyrene with LAH, somehow doing this without affecting the allyl group. What?

It's not, but it *is* in PiHKAL, and the UK's Misuse of Drugs Act has a clause basically saying "anything in PiHKAL not covered by the preceding vague and ridiculous terms is also illegal".


This also applies to the thiomescaline analogs, which are also in PiHKAL.

Erm...what do you mean it's not? It's got methoxy groups at the 3 and 5 positions on the ring. I also can't find the clause that says "anything in PiHKAL not covered by the preceding vague and ridiculous terms is also illegal", or any explicit reference to the book whatsoever. The clause that bans everything in PiHKAL is the one I quoted above, which covers all the drugs in PiHKAL (including this one, because it is "structurally derived from phenethylamine... by substitution in the ring to any extent with alkyl, alkoxy, alkylenedioxy or halide substituents").

I had thought you meant *only* methoxy, and being that I don't precisely recall the language of the bill I assumed you were right. The bit about PiHKAL is kind of famous, but Google isn't helping me right now. I seem to recall the UK government sent Shulgin a copy of the law.


Thiomescaline is not covered by the bit you quoted, but it *is* banned in the UK (if methylthio is considered "univalent"), along with all of the other active compounds in PiHKAL, to the best of my knowledge.

in fact, the 2C-G series, the HOx series, the BOx series, FLEA and MDOH are all not covered by the phenethylamine clause without this clarificaiton.

thio means replacing the hydrogens on the benzene ring with sulpur atoms and the phenethylamine act is the clause which catches all chemicals in PHIKAL, others have to be specifically stated. Thiophenethylamines and allylphenethylamines would be legal I beleive as long as there are no alkyl subtitutes.


4-allyloxy-3,5-meththiophenethylamine could be interesting

Luckily, I already posted it in ITT.

That is not an additional clause, it is a clarification which states exactly what I have already said, that in addition to all the  compounds explicitly named in the act, there are many others, including all the PiHKAL drugs, that are covered by this clause (which I am not going to post for a third time):


> any compound (not being methoxyphenamine or a compound for the time being specified in sub-paragraph (a) above) structurally derived from phenethylamine anN-alkylphenethylamine,a-methylphenethylamine, anN-alkyl-a-methylphenethylamine,a-ethylphenethylamine, or anN-alkyl-a-ethylphenethylamine by substitution in the ring to any extent with alkyl, alkoxy, alkylenedioxy or halide substituents, whether or not further substituted in the ring by one or more other univalent substituents.

EDIT: All the 2Cs are derived from phenethylamine with methoxy groups on the ring, and so are covered by that paragraph. The HOxs and BOxs are explicitly named in part 1(b). FLEA and MDOH don't seem to be covered though, you're right...

Probably not, but I bet 4-allylthio-3,5-dimethoxyPEA would be. Stick an alpha-methyl on too and it would probably be more potent than 2C-E.

I don't see how the sulfur of the methylthio group is univalent. But if it is somehow, maybe the sulfoxide would also be active, and that's definitely not univalent!

3C-AL looks more interesting than allylescaline, no?

I doubt there is much difference TBH, it's slightly more potent than AL sounds.

This is an annotation by that site and is not included in the MDA. Yerg was right, the compounds in PiHKAL are covered by the substituted phenethylamine clause.

Shame, about the legality. 3C-AL sounds quite nice, I saw somewhere someone posted it was indistinguishable from mescaline.

LAH doesn't hit alkenes.  LAH generally needs some kind of free oxygen in proximity to the group to be reduced to work.  The nitro has two oxygens, which aluminum loves to coordinate as the bonds get reduced.  Ketones and aldehydes are obvious substrates for LAH.


If he was doing a hydrogen with Pd/C reduction, on the other hand, there would be a bit of a problem.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

**Allylescaline**


I've just recently become interested in this compound. I can't find much on it, other than what's written in Pihkal. Does anyone here have experience with it? The Pihkal notes have me intrigued, especially the part which describes easy socializing and ease of free association. It would seem to be an incredibly rare compound, possibly incredibly valuable.

Well valuable.... wouldn't the same hold true for proscaline? And I unexpectedly came across that at some point (twice now actually) and it was not priced like an impossibly rare collectors item per se.

Yes this does seem interesting as may be cycloproscaline and isobuscaline, is there no existing thread on this? Well I suppose not.

What is needed I guess is a custom synth, decided by one or more people at some point. But we probably shouldn't discuss the exact dynamics of those things.

I didn't mean valuable as it pertains to money but rather as it might be of benefit to ones mode of life, philosophy, general level of happiness :D A rare experience.. I re read what I had posted and it definitely seemed like I was talking about money though.. Not what I had intended, I'm just really into taking psychedelics. Shulgins descriptions always do get my mouth dripping wet however. Fucking love phenethylamines.

@Quasimodo: Oh! well it's certainly possible, but as a general rule I have my doubts about RCs or analogues of classic psychedelics really trumping their 'parent' compound. The past has proven that most of the time, analogues focus a little more on this or that and may have some potential for having more side-effects... but actually trumping their parent? Rarely if ever. If you have lots of mescaline at your disposal I would probably not care one way or the other because it's pretty perfect. Maybe it could be more visual but that's about it. And of course the potency is so damn low, but that's why I said: if you have enough...


A lot of tryptamines are gems like 4-HO-MET, and they can be valuable on their own for sure but to trump 4-HO-DMT... I don't know, I think I'm quite satisfied! I know you never said trump, you just said allylescaline may be valuable, and perhaps it is... Who knows if it were more available it could reach a popularity status like 4-AcO-DMT has. I guess you're right, its totally possible. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I never meant to dismiss your suggestion in any way, I am just thinking out loud!!


Taking the alkylated 2C-X compounds as an example, proscaline might shine some light on where you might be headed with allylescaline or buscaline. 2C-iP does not seem like much worth but it has significantly different electronegativity, and the pi-bond in allylescaline makes it more constricted. Anyway proscaline sounds like it still retains some MDMA-likeliness mescaline also has, but more of a body buzz or euphoria and less visuals. I don't know if that trend would be continued.

I should really try my proscaline!!

Isn't this a bit close-minded? This might hold true for some people but I've found phenethylamine derivatives such as 2c-e and DOC much more interesting and valuable than mescaline (though I enjoyed mescaline quite a bit!). Additionally many have found DPT a lot more interesting than DMT... there are other examples. I don't think there is any reason to think that the parent compounds should have a higher incidence of being "superior" to the derivatives, aside from the fact that there is a much larger number of derivative compounds - of course more of them will be duds, there are just so many of them.

After closer consideration, yes it is.


I got carried away by the fact that a lot of them are very derivative (lol) though really substantial substitution still remains a different thing from extensions closer to home. But even that is saying nothing looking at DPT starting from DMT for example. If everyone was as closed-minded our unexpected 'black swan' discoveries would come at a much slower rate.


I guess a more proper response would have been "just don't get your hopes up TOO much", you know.. just because it is fairly new territory does not make it fertile ground. Who knows though.

I think the allyl(oxy) groups would interact with each other. Maybe less so if it had a 2,4,6 pattern like TMA-6.

I have tried this material several times. The first time was in combination with AMT, at a dose of about 40 mg of allylescaline, and 60 mg of AMT. These may seem like high doses to some, but I am not very sensitivity to psychedelics, partially due to my use of trazodone(Desyrel) (a 5-HT2A antagonist, amongst other activities), which I try to abstain from for a few days before I trip, and maybe due to my history of depression (has anybody heard of depression, with its supposed alteration in monoamine function, altering dose response curves for psychedelics?).


I had one of the most moving, beautiful experiences of my life, with intense visuals, euphoria, deep seated contentment with all aspects of life and the universe, etc etc, all the greatest aspects of the classical description of psychedelic experiences. Of course, including the AMT with the AL almost guaranteed a strong trip.


Taking it alone, a week or two later, was every bit as wonderful, albeit slightly different. Dose around 60 to 120 (again, higher than recommended, the aforementioned caveat applies) The usual AMT experience was gone, of course, but was not necessarily missed. I had a wonderful experience, with a clean ccome up and no GI effects, maybe a bit of sweating at one point. A feeling of moderate, very pleasant, and very calm stimulation, very different than that of any stimulant I have so far used (and that includes many). Vivid visualizations, geometric patterns (I usually tend to see wavy, swirly, rounded, moving patterns of color, these were more structured) of green, purple, and pink, not unlike the art and sculpture of some South and Central American indigenous cultures - jade jaguars, strong, blocky lines, square headed men with large teeth, shaped almost like blocks, and all subtle variations thereof. I was awash in wonder and amazement. Also spent time wandering throughout my imagination, considering the implications of general relativity, quantum theory, the holographic universe, string theory, origins of life, and many other things, some of which I only know enough about to come up with ideas that make sense to me, but would be silliness to somebody who new what the terms I was using actually meant - stoned theoretical philosophizing.

I am a little skeptical about the value of this chem although kebil's report is reassuring. Im hoping this isn't another 5-meo-dalt type case. In tihkal the reports make 5-meo-dalt seem quite interesting but as we now know, it is a very mild and I'm my opinion, uninteresting chemical. Im just hoping this isn't the case for AL, as the there are only a few pihkal reports and they are kind of a mixed bag. In any case, looks like this chem will be making its way into the public market soon enough, it will be very interesting to see what it has to offer!

this one is making it's rounds again right now;been waiting for it- just went in on 3gz w a buddy.


not very much info on it..ill be sure to update and write a TR once it's in hand and researched:D


i have a feeling this one is going to show much more promise than the only other mescaline analogue ive tried, proscaline. 


either there was a purity issue or shulgin was way off on the dosages of that one..


@Solipsis- did you ever try your proscaline? just curious if you noticed it to be less potent than stated in pihkal. ive talked to a few other ppl who agree w me, but we all had the same batch..the batch we had came around in like 09 and was being offered along with HOT-7..(hope thats not considered tmi..?)

I'd be excited to hear about this myself as well. Looks like I will soon have a source for this item, and would like to take a closer look at it. I've only worked with Mescaline once - was a tea extraction/reduction, but my roomate messed it up and unfortunately left the experience only about 1/3rd as potent as it should have been. Most horrible tasting drink I've ever forced down, but I feel like by doing so I've earned the right to try out the synthetics. No pain, no gain. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This sounds like the Holy Grail of psychedelics. Active at reasonably low dosages and with no GI body load. Lack of nausea alone would be a major advancement in PEAs. The visuals described above sound like full-on mescaline/LSD type visuals, rather than 2C-X type, which never seem to achieve the same richness.

I found it to be light. Pleasant but light. Not full range visual disturbance like with DOC by any means. Very light, pleasant, just poking at visually effective. 35mg orally and 10mg nasally lasted 12 hours, +1- no more than +2 with marijuana and alcohol. I have yet to explore in higher ranges. Very pleasant psyche though. It feels like it has great potential, but this might just be the mescaline trying to poke through the allyl on the fourth position. I will look into it some more believe me haha. 


Buddy said it was like Ecstacy with balls. I found it to be more like ecstacy after being neutered. Something wrong here? I don't know. I'll have to try again. I certainly wasn't put off by my first sample.

Here are some of my notes that I am going to just copy and paste from my other threads. I tried this this weekend with a friend.


Here's a timeline until I was tripping too hard to continue:

8:00pm - Took 24mg orally

9:00pm - No effects yet. In PIHKAL, I recall Shulgin saying that he started to feel some effects at 45 minutes in. Added 12mg oral

10:00pm - Feeling the sense of phenethylamine come-up in my teeth. People who have tried the 2Cs should know what I'm talking about. Still no other signs.

10:30pm - Very tired, try to lay down and take a nap

11:00pm - Can't sleep, get up. Still no visuals, play some videogames.

11:30pm - Some light nausea, definite body high, still no other effects

12:00am - Body high pretty overwhelming. No visuals yet though. A little speedy.

1:00am - Decide to take a shower - Visuals come up on the shower tiles. Everything hits all at once - textures become entirely unhinged from their surroundings, and the objects that they should be attached to. Some breathing. Still not very color-based, mostly texture based.

2:00am - Still seeing visuals. Still peaking.


And some qualitative notes:

-It was a really long come-up. It was enjoyable while peaking, but I'm definitely a bigger fan of the 2Cs. I woke up with a headache and feeling hung over, similar to Shulgin's experience. I've never really felt that off a 2C before.

-Visuals were mostly light to non-existent. However I did attempt to take a shower, and when I went into the shower, everything went crazy. The textures detached from the surfaces of objects they were affixed to and began spinning wildly. This lasted for about an hour. There was really nothing in the way of color/hue enhancement, just things moving about on their own accord.

-Body high was overwhelming at times. Felt like my skin was bristling with electricity. Was almost uncomfortable.

I'll have some in about 2 weeks time (hopefully) and will try it soon thereafter. I'll post a TR as soon as I try it.

I've found writing to be quite enjoyable on allylescaline thus far. And so, I've decided to come share what my experience has been concerning that. 


dose = 20mg(+-2) 


At T= ~51 minutes I began to notice something was up. Naught but the slightest hint of a body high at that point, mind you.


T= ~1 hour I began to notice something up with my vision. If someone had asked me I could not have said what it was. I also began to feel a bit of nausea coming on(something I seem to be prone to with phens).


T= ~2 hours I had just finished playing one of the most amazing games of [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) I had ever experienced (was the first time combining go with psychedelics. something I had been quite eagerly looking forward to.) At some point during the game the effects had become significantly more pronounced. I quickly wrote down that I absolutely HAD to check if my walls had always had such a striking resemblance to a squirming mass of maggots. 


In short, it would seem that only an unfortunate few must worry about a five hour come-up.

Hey, was just curious if you had eaten recently before you took the first dose. The effects you describe sound pretty similar too afew experiences I've had taking a phenethylamine with food on my stomach. That may account for some of the discrepancies in comeup time etc.

Sounds like an interesting chemical. Gonna pick some up myself.

My notes from a recent Alyllescaline trial. Received from one of  the two vendors that had it synthed. HPLC = ( 98.45 % )


22mg taken orally in a capsule. Hadn't eaten for six hours. Weight 77kg which equals roughly 3.5mg/kg. 22mg weighed on a .000g recently callibrated scale with a +/- of 2mg.


2:40 pm- capsule eaten. 

+35 - Body feels differnet in a very subtl way. Slight jitteryness. 

+1:00 - Not much if any change. 

+1:37 - Mild Nausea. Vision seems sharper but nothing more than that. 

+2:00 -  Still very subtlle effects most of which are physical. Phenethylamine taste in mouth and feelings in teeth. 

+2::30 - No new changes. Hoping this is building to something more. 

+ 3:20 - Hot flashes. Getting pretty warm and remained so for about 30 mintues. 

+4:00 -  Electric feelings in body reaching their peak. Seem to be on the cusp of OEV's.

+5:30 - Over the past hour it seemed nothing much changed. No true visuals ever developed. Clearly a museum  level dose for me. Over all effects were 90% physical in the body. 10% perceptual changes and mild at that. 

+7 -  Effects declined over the last hour and a sinus headache set in just after midnight and lasted for the next few hours(may have been the result of some JWH-122 that was smoked at +8:30, synthetic CB's sometimes do cause these types of headaches for me). Was unable to sleep because of headache but without it I probably would have been able to around midnight. 

Only other side effect noted was a restless feeling throughout body(mostly in legs like RLS) during and a little after the come down. Definately not a substance leaving you feeling better or the same after it's effects subside. 

Next time will try 35mg.

Seems that the PiHKAL dose range is on the low end once again. Will be interesting to see some reports when we "find the dose" so to speak.

Those two functionalities are quite different. Alkenes that are conjugated with a nitro group can be reduced by LAH; but isolated alkenes like in the allyl group are unreactive to metal hydrides. You would need to catalytically hydrogenate in order to reduce that allyl group.

The entire RC market is predicated on the philosophy of modification of existing compounds producing a similar - but distinct - experience.


Mescaline-like effects are not what is explicitly desired. A mescaline-like structure is. What happens afterwards, positive or negative, is the magic.

It's been a few year since I've posted here, but I have 250 mgs coming to me on Tuesday, and depending on what time it arrives, I will be sampling it that day or Thursday with a friend. With how little info there is about this, I will be sure to write as detailed of a report as I can. Would you guys say that after an allergy test, that 25-30 mg is a pretty agreed upon target dose?

I have some coming by the end of the week. I remember in the 25i thread a post about how well mescaline went with the 25i, I think they said it made the experience feel even more like LSD. I have both of these (25i and Allylescaline) when I get to trying this combo (not first time obviously) I'll let everyone know the results

Here is my report that just got submitted to erowid: 


Celestial Union


     Over my life I have experienced a myriad of hallucinogens and empathogens. They have all taught me many valuable life lesions and helped me through some tough times; but after experiencing the majority of the classic compounds I have begun to look towards the research chemicals for new insight. This is the story of a compound about which little is known, a compound called Allylescaline.


     Today is a special day, the day of the first annular solar eclipse in some thirteen years. It was decided that on this day, I would try this new compound along with my good friend Aurora, who is also well versed in the use of psychedelics. 

     130 mgs of Allylescaline was received from a trusted online vendor a few days prior to our experiment. On the morning before the eclipse, the 130 mgs of Al HCL was dissolved in 6.5 mL of DI water to produce a 10mg/0.5mL solution. Our plan is to take the AL around mid-day, giving us time to get to know the effects before heading up to the mountains to watch the eclipse, which was predicted to occur around 6:28 PM.

12:20 PM (T + 0:00): Aurora and I each consumed 10 mgs of Al by dropping 0.5 mL of the solution into a small glass of water and drinking it.

12:25 PM (T + 0:05): Strange bubbly feelings appear in my stomach, it could be a placebo, but Aurora agrees that she has it too.

1:15 PM (T + 0:55): I feel relaxed and mildly euphoric, but that is most likely pre-trip excitement that comes with trying a new compound.

1:30 PM (T + 1:10): We just consumed an additional 10 mgs of AL; I’m starting to feel a bit off baseline but not much. If it is anything like mescaline, it will still be about an hour until any major effects present themselves. The mild stomach feelings return again after taking another dose and my body is starting to feel tingly.

1:50 PM (T + 1:30): My vision is starting to become a bit fuzzy, like an old Television with bad reception, along with a mild, but very positive mood boost. Aurora confirms this and we notice some pupil dilation.

Alexander Shulgin was right about the come up in his entry in PIHKAL. It is very gradual and graceful. No anxiety what so ever, I just feel very relaxed and presently blissful. The only alterations to my vision are a brightening of colors.

2:15 PM (T + 1:55): My perception of color has been greatly intensified, and everything in my field of vision is slowly rocking back and forth as if our living room was on a boat.

2:50 PM (T + 2:30): Colors continue to become more vibrant (especially pink) and I feel like I’m entering into the phenylethylamine headspace I love so much.

3:00 PM (T + 2:40): We consumed another 10 mgs making 30 mgs of Al total. So far this seems to be a highly color oriented trip. Everything is so bright, accompanied with a feeling of very warm positive energy. 

3:15 PM (T + 2:55): The strange stomach feelings return, but it doesn’t bother me in the least as I feel fantastic.

My body feels so alive with positive energy that flows with all the colors in the spectrum, slightly reminiscent of MDMA, but way more colorful and lacking the amphetamine “push”. I am a solid ++ at the moment. Also music sounds like it has so much more depth, euphoric trance is defiantly a great music choice for this experience. Smoking hookah is fantastic. 

3:40 PM (T + 3:20): Just took 10 more mgs.

4:20 PM (T + 4:00): Seems like a good time to take another 10mgs of Al.

4:35 PM (T + 4:15): Eating on Al is not a problem at all; in fact it makes my sub sandwich taste superb.

5:30 PM (T + 5:10): Aurora and I take the rest of our Al, making a grand total of 65 mgs each as we prepare to head to the mountains to watch the eclipse.

5:35 PM (T + 5:15): Since we have not been able to get past a ++ with AL alone we decide to add 250 µg of 25C-NBOMe, this is done by administering 50 µL of water intranasally. We then get in the car to head to the mountains, since I am tripping my fiancé Moonflower drives us up to the trailhead, on the way there the road and everything on it looks like it is computer animated, like Jimmy Neutron lol.

6:00 PM (T + 5:40): We arrive at the trail head and meet up with a bunch of other good friends and we all start the hike up.

6:28 PM (T + 6:08): After a short but very steep hike our group had reached the spot we picked out, some colossal boulders which overlooked the valley we just traversed. This spot had an excellent, unhindered view of the sky, perfect for some eclipse viewing. We got there just in time because the moon had just started to touch the sun. 

Looking down at the city from our high perch, it almost looked as if the whole city had stopped in its tracked to watch the eclipse; every parking lot I could see was completely full. People were even parked on the sides of the main roads to watch this special celestial event.

6:40 PM (T + 6:15): The moon is quickly moving in front of the sun making it look like sunset, even though the sun is still somewhat high in the sky. We all take another 250 µgs of 25C-NBOMe and smoke a few bowls of cannabis as we watch the moon eclipse the sun with our special glasses.

7:33 PM (T + 7:13): The moon has completely moved in front of the sun sending the entire city into twilight, glancing at the eclipsed sun produced an explosion of prismatic ribbons of light and geometric patterns that lingered for ten seconds or so. This was the moment that the effects of the Al and 25C were at their peak. A definite +++.

At the moment of the total eclipse the whole city rang out with a cry of excitement, which echoed through the valley and filled the air with delight. It filled me with a loving feeling of total unity to be witnessing this cosmic event that has captivated human kind as long as we have walked this Earth. For those four minutes that the moon and the sun became one, so did everyone watching it. We were no longer individuals separated from each other, it didn’t matter who we were or where we were in life. We had all gathered to see this event as humans, as all humans have since we first looked up at the sky. This is the universe’s way of reminding us that we are all connected, individual islands that are joined beneath the ocean.

7:38 PM (T + 7:18) Once the moon started to move past the sun I came back to normal reality, barley able to fathom what just happened. As the moon moved away from the sun it seemed almost like another sunrise was happening, as light returned to the valley. We decided that is was a good time to head down, before the sun actually set; as tripping in the dark off the trail in the woods can be dangerous. Once we picked up the trail the 2/3 sun was setting, and it was the most beautiful sunset I had ever seen. Looking at the moon-shaped sun on the horizon and seeing the sky filled with radiant violets, oranges, and yellows made me fill so blessed to be privileged to live here on planet Earth. After the sun set the valley became polka-dotted with the bright white flowers of Datura that open right after sunset. As I looked at them I thought “someday I will try it, but not until I’m ready”. We all piled back into the car and headed home. We were still in complete awe as to what we had just experienced, as we walked back inside. “It almost feels weird to be back in the city after all that.” I said. 

We continued to trip for a couple more hours, and smoked hookah until we were too tired to keep our eyes open. All our friends headed home as the psychedelics had long worn off and Moonflower and I went to bed; I had no trouble sleeping at all. What an epic day!

Extensions and Commentary:

     Allylescaline is a very mild and gentle psychedelic; it would be a great option for any beginner to the world of hallucinogens, as it has little if any negative side effects. It would also be a great addition to any other trip that you would like to be more colorful and empathetic. All in all it is a great compound, thanks Alexander Shulgin!

Well, mescaline kinda feels like LSD anyway. And so does 25I for that matter, at least from that I've heard (haven't tried that one yet). So that makes a lot of sense. 


One **important** note: I would be wary of consuming 25I in combination with mescaline extracted from cacti. This is because cacti extracts contain large amounts of tyramine and other MAOi's. However, if synthetic mescaline is at hand, then you're good to go.

I edited my original post to be more clear. I don't have mescaline i have both 25i and Allylescaline. It arrived today. Had a small trial run prior to my full run coming this weekend. 8-9mg was active and come up was 1-1.5 hours. It might have been hastened because I held it under my tongue for about 5 minutes, who knows. 


At this dose there was no movement in my vision, but when I looked at my face in the mirror I could tell the color was off. I have medium-light brown skin and it now seemed like I could see some purple hues in there. Headspace was affected.


It reminded me alot of a light 25i headspace, but also had some similarities to my mental state when on 4-aco-DET. Thats just my personal experience and may not make sense to you, but 4-aco-DET to me is way diff. than 4-aco-DMT, its less sedating and more colorful  and this reminded me a little of that.


I am excited to try this at a proper dose and in combo with 4-aco-det, 25i & DOC, in that order (not all at the same time) in the coming weeks and months.

Looking forward to reading that ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I might try this one the coming weekend, as I have it too. it's the plan anyway.


Everybodies reporting that it's very mild, do you see any hindrance in taking it higher, like 100 mg?

Or did you feel that 42 mg was pushing it? How about side effects? Do you think they would get a lot worse pushing the dose up?

I certainly wouldn't jump straight in to a 100mg dose. Based on my experience I think my sweet spot will be in the 50-60mg range. Really felt like i was on the cusp of something, just not quite there yet, YMMV of course. I did have some very mild stomach uneasiness, but i'm not entirely sure that was due to the drug.  As always some people react differently so my experience may be different from yours.


Here's the link to my TR. total duration was about 8hrs.  [AL 42mg Trip Report](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/625967-%28Allylescaline-AL-42mg%29-%28MXE-40mg%29-%28JWH-203%29-First-time-Mild-but-worthwhile?p=10619830#post10619830)

I got me some this morning. I'll probably take 50mg tomorrow. I bet a box of nitrous charges would go nicely with this.

Optimal setting? Step outside if weather conditions are favorable, spending the day swimming or hiking sounds good to me, maybe an extended bike ride if that suits you more.


I took ~50mg capped together with a friend who joined me for the ride at around 45mg. Not yet sure what to make of it.


It turned out to be a very mild experience comprising an unspecific intoxication I find difficult to characterize, slight disinhibition together with a very moderate mood lift followed by persistent insomnia despite marked signs of exhaustion, and minor visual disturbances I wouldn't call visuals. The effects took around three hours to develop fully and subsided very slowly and gradually over the course of the following 6-8 hours.


AL didn't enhance auditory or visual perception to a large degree, but tactile sensations felt a lot more pleasant and there was certain synergy between physical exercise and music. The headspace was clear despite minor impediments, but there was no sense of enlightenment or insightful thinking. 


We both got the impression that increasing the dosage wouldn't yield a proportional increase in intensity, and suspect a less than linear dose response curve. I'll have to give it another try to confirm our hunch, increasing the dose byat least 50% again to get a clearer picture. But I'm not prepared to go much further in order to force something out of the stuff it just can't deliver.

My friend felt pronounced nausea and even threw up at some point, I on the other hand didn't experience any discomfort at all throughout the experience.

I'm still waiting on a rather slow pre-order myself. I'm wondering if anyone has tried insufflating it and if it burns and also if it's more effective. I've read that methoxy compounds are irritating to the nose but I've also heard of people snorting mesc so maybe it's not that irritating after all. Also, I read in Leminger's report on this substance that the free base is a crystalline solid with melting point 47 C. That should be vaporizable. It may, however, be harmful to the lungs so I wouldn't really recommend it.


 It sounds like it's more of a euphoriant than psychedelic, which isn't necessarily a negative. While I find visual patterning etc interesting, I don't really like full-on artificially induced temporary psychosis like you can get with powerful psychedelics like LSD. So this may actually be a good compound for me. I'll just get some 4 HO-DET for visuals. That's supposed to be almost pure visuals with little deep psychedelic mental effects (which I can do without cuz I just want to get high not commune with God), so maybe a combination of the two would be a nice mix. The AL would make you feel great mood-wise while the 4 HO-DET would kick in the visuals. AL sounds like something that may be better in a mixture than straight up.

it seems like plugging might be a good option with this given the long comeup, somewhat high dosage and cost.

Psychedelics seem like an odd choice if you "just want to get high" and don't want to have any "deep mental effects." Sounds like a long lasting stimulant might be more what you're after or something.

I took 30 mg of this in the weekend, at an electronic outdoor festival in a park, followed by 20 mg 3 hours later, I must say that I felt 50 mg was my sweetspot, I was quite happy to not have taken more than that.


Come up was slow and very gradual, 3-3.5 hour+


Duration was about 12 hours


This is like a more mellow and warm version of TMA-6. I could definitely feel that this is mescaline country.

colours were nicely enhanced, and there's a nice feeling in the body. Some slight nausea though, or more like butterfly's in the stomach kind of feeling. 

Not too visual, it's like patterns are just on the verge of starting to morph, kind of moree like swaying. Things seen far away were very blurry and fuzzy. Whole experience didn't get really interesting until some ketamine was thrown in the mix ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Then it was a lot of fun really.


The day after I had a hang over. I had  headache, I was very tired and very dehydrated. My girlrfreind, who only took 30 mg also noticed that she felt really dizzy several times the day after. 


It's an interesting chem and I will definitely take it again. But it will never become my favorite PEA, and I will most certainly never take it higher than 50 mg because of the hangover feeling the next day.


To the people who compare it with XTC/MDMA, you're clueless 8)

Uhh huh, I did notice that too. Not the headache, that was all but negligible, but I felt tired the next two days despite getting up extra late, and couldn't help spending a large chunk of the remaining weekend napping on the couch.

How close does this compare to actual mescaline, or would others(Fag/Ag/etc)feel like this one is more suited towards other comparisons? I know I can compare mescaline to many things but its actual vibe combined with everything else is a pretty unique state even at low doses let alone higher. I would actually hesitate in my mind to say I know anything that is really "mescaline like" in its actual trip duration/come up and with all the fairly exact similar feelings. I'm getting the vibe that this may be like a nice laid back psychedelic, I almost want to use the term lackadaisical, though obviously I haven't tried it but most peoples reports seem to claim to the low energy or more subtle feelings it seems to provide. I don't know what to make of this, as if I get any i'm not in the place to do any high dose experimentation nor do I really want to ATM, to me it seems like this could do good(be fairly visual, more indepth style experience)at the 50-100mg level, 75mgs seeming like it would be that brink between a 2.5 versus more along the lines of a 3/3.5. Its so hard to tell though because for me mescaline is fairly similar. Lower doses provide a laid back(150-450mgs), less visual experience, but once the dose is upped near or past 500mgs its really fairly visual and certainly a strong, non laid trip that rivals any really. 


Lastly I would inquire as to why you would call someone clueless when they compare it to MDMA? Obviously its probably not like a rolling experience but I find MDMA one of the easier chemicals to find traits in other psychedelics. Sure they might not have the same raging feelings a flooring MDMA experience can have...but..(for instance mescaline and MDMA is a very easy comparison for me to make, mescaline contains pretty everything that MDMA does just in a completely different flavor).


Really i'm looking for something that would nearly replace mescaline. I'm getting the vibe this just isn't up to par though obviously more experimentation amongst other things is probably needed.

Yeah, it's laid back no hint of the restlessness or wound up feeling I get on many 2C's and this exactly what about the experience reminded me of mescaline. Languid is the term that comes to mind. I'm not sure if you can force an intense let alone overwhelming experience out of it at any dose I'd still judge sensible to take, we have to wait until we have reports of trips in the 70mg-100mg range. Maybe it's light and subtle at it's very core, you know. It doesn't feel unsimilar to mesc but it's not a substitute. I didn't delve as easily into deep introspection following down those long, wide ranging but interconnected trains of thought, that's what I'd expect a synthetic mescaline replacement to deliver.

So I ended up taking 60mg last night bombed in a Rizla. I had drunk three 330ml San Miguel's about an hour before but I doubt this was anywhere near enough to dull the experience. Very slow onset, didn't really feel much of anything until about hour into the "trip". The first effects noted were a clarity of thought and slight mental stimulation. This continued to build in intensity and by the 2nd hour I started to notice tactile sensations in the body. Colours were more crisp and outlines became sharper. By the 3rd hour there was a definite lift in mood, but not what i'd call euphoria. The body high was very pleasant, and stretching felt great. Increased urge to talk and very mild empathy. It wasn't until I vaped some UR-144 that I noticed any visuals which were still very mild. Mostly a slight breathing effect if I looked at anything for a little while and the occasional electric blue flashes in my peripheral vision. To be fair I get them with just UR-144 by itself, though they are not as noticeable. Didn't really have much in the way of that classic feeling of awe associated with psys, but definitely a heightened appreciation for things. I took 3mg of etizolam about 10 hours in and chilled out in bed. Feel slightly off today, a bit drained but nothing major. All in all Pretty nice, but not something i'd take if I wanted to properly trip.

Languid is the term that comes to mind. I'm not sure if you can force an intense let alone overwhelming experience out of it at any dose I'd still judge sensible to take, we have to wait until we have reports of trips in the 70mg-100mg range. Maybe it's light and subtle at it's very core, you know. It doesn't feel unsimilar to mesc but it's not a substitute. I didn't delve as easily into deep introspection following down those long, wide ranging but interconnected trains of thought, that's what I'd expect a synthetic mescaline replacement to deliver. But maybe I kept to the surface because the setting didn't lend itself to mull over things.

Thanks Ag this is exactly what I was looking for! I was getting the feeling that this chem would either stay laid back or maybe if were a bit lucky show a bit of sparkle at 75-100mgs. Certainly want this one for novelty, though the dose price ratio seems fairly crazy from when I looked(sorry if this breaks pricing rules!)so i'll probably steer clear for awhile. I was really hoping AL would show its colors at a lower dose rather than having to ramp anything up, besides the general consensus being it doesn't do much(the only hope I hold is its one of those odd ones that doesn't show its real flair till a certain point, but who knows!). To me it sounds a bit mundane, though somewhat interesting. I know one thing for sure, its definitely to early to call it, or tell it on this one!


I understand you, for sure when talking about the comparisons considering its like I said, certain psyches can be compared to others only within certain traits or characteristics though, not as a whole(I've always been 100% against giving someone the "Dude this is just like MDMA/LSD/whatever!" line just because LSD is LSD not ETH-LAD/etc.)IMO. Also I would honestly think someone who enjoys MDMA would enjoy AL's laid back demeanor(I find this is a portion of mesc that is like MDMA in a sense for me, amongst a million other things!), maybe if their ravers they should look elsewhere, but if they want a trip with certain similarities to an MDMA experience than why not? Obviously one must always explain that this is a true psychedelic and will cause a trip rather than what MDMA provides but besides that. I guess I also have to point out I probably wouldn't say its like MDMA like stated above, if I found AL to be like MDMA I would describe in more detail how I thought so. Its just how I am. I contain no qualms with this even if the person's a complete noob but provides proper descriptions/insight further than "Dude just like MDMA/LSD/whatever!".  For me its all about the details, baby! 


Is anyone considering a varied ROA to reduce the come up(i've wanted to try IM mesc/other routes for the longest)? A three hour come up coupled with possible nausea doesn't sound like the greatest time, though I do notice a lack on entries in times of come up, leading me to hope its a rather subtle or easy transition. 


In conclusion though I can't put my finger on it really, for me mescaline was always a fickle thing to use, after a certain point in dose she'd provide you with excessively visual powerful trips, but anything on the lower scale was exactly like rolling dice, so many different chances of so outcomes. I guess it could all come down to the fact i've never had actual synthetic mescaline, which no doubt would change the experience again, but I have this similar feeling still that even then it would be a bit fickle, easier to dose to where you want, but still oddly fickle. Mescaline is the one that comes to mind as well for those trips where you dosed whatever expecting whatever and you were either blasted in the face or left with a slight sense of disappointment.  Ah well!

Someone should try plugging Allyescaline given how great phen psychedelics work via that ROA - might make the price/dose ratio a little less crazy, reduce come up time and possibly make the chem a bit more interesting.

This was my hope unless someone like psood wanders in having AL then we might get an IM report! Though I suppose others may be willing to venture those routes. Plugging or IM is what I would like to see, IMO it would cut that 3ish hour duration down to about one if that and hopefully eliminate the nausea people have received.

^Heh. I don't have any allyescaline because I was waiting to see some reports. Yeah, I'd have given plugging and then IM a shot if I had it -- the ways I've always wanted to try mescaline.

^I'd IM in a second with mesc if I had synthetic, but alas and plugging is to wasteful/can be(i'm an overthinker....)/mesc is so rare that I don't even bother going down that avenue. I really hope someone wanders along with a plugged or other ROA report. Heck if I had money to spare I would actually grab a small portion myself and try some IM'ing out myself(15-25mgs IM'd sounds like a nice time)! I mean AL certainly does sound playful and nice, one thing i've always truly loved about lower dose mescaline and sometimes even higher dose. Either way though at the end of the day, i'm glad to see this many reports sprouting up so quickly! Usually have to wait a second to get a few good member or atleast nice detailed reports from posters! The 3 hour come up is almost a killer for me actually, especially if its nausea driven, have things to take care of that easily but like to save those, and waiting three hours can be a bitch(though with AL it seems like you just go about your business than alerts start to take place, whereas with some you'll get antsy/etc whilst you wait), obviously though more reports are needed before we begin a defined analysis/keep such claims.

Don't get exaggerated ideas about the nausea, my trip partner so far had to throw up on everything, egg salad included. I felt none (next to none anyway) and kept eating a lot of extremely fat and unhealthy dishes before during and after the experience. It really comes down to your degree of sensitivity. The comeup was smooth and gentle though not entirely linear. I'd register some alarms within the first 20 minutes, followed by nothing at all for another hour. Things would pick up after that, a smooth linear transition up to t+3h and a last gentle push between t+3h and t+4h immediately before the plateau is attained. The timeline doesn't change with dose btw, I experienced the same development on a preliminary 25mg experiment I didn't care to mention before. 


I don't do IM or plugging, although I'm not oblivious to the advantages those ROA's offer but decided to refrain from utilizing them at some point. I have patience enough to wait through the comeup and it's part of my ritual in a sense, I don't need to insta-trip. There are some tryptamines which would catapult me up to a +3 within 20 minutes of necking the stuff or even faster dosing buccal or sublingual. That would work with AL btw, it's not nutra-sweet, but it doesn't taste like dixie toilet either, like some other phens do. 

However, eating them capped is my preferred ROA, and bearing a certain degree of discomfort is a price I'm prepared to pay -though there's a line (2c-t-2 doesn't cut it these days for example). Insufflation is my preferred ROA with some compounds (members of the DOX family and nbome's for example) though I avoid it when possible. Maybe this marks me as superstitous ignoramus but the subjective effects of AL remind me too much of 2c-t-7 and the molecules structure is to similar for me to go down that route.  


The last mild/gentle/light compound I explored was BOD, which I found a lot more interesting and enjoyable but that's perhaps *entirely* attributable to the unreasonably high expectations I had for the performance of a mescaline analogue.

Yeah, this will never replace mescaline, and I agree with Agnetha that it's probably just light and subtle at it's very core. To be honest, I didn't find it that interesting until I took some Ketamine on top, it made it a lot more visual and more deep. 

I've only tried mescaline once, 200 mg synthetic, which was a light trip, but still enough for me to get a feeling for it, and I think I can definitely say that TMA-6 and Allylescaline both feel a lot closer to Mescaline than any 2C I've tried.

Obviously its probably not like a rolling experience but I find MDMA one of the easier chemicals to find traits in other psychedelics. Sure they might not have the same raging feelings a flooring MDMA experience can have...but..(for instance mescaline and MDMA is a very easy comparison for me to make, mescaline contains pretty everything that MDMA does just in a completely different flavor).

Well, maybe it was a little arrogant of me using the word clueless, sorry, but it's just that for me MDMA is a empathogen, entactogen and stimulant.

Completely my experience too, except I staggered my dose (took 20 mg extra after 2.5-3 hours).

I didn't really get any nausea, as such, it was more like the butterflie's in the stomach feeling, more like an uneasiness. And yeah, the come up is so gradual that it's really nice actually, I dont see any reason to want to shorten it, unless your short on time of cause.


I think insufflation/plugging could work quite well with this one, but actually don't see a reason to do it, and it might be dangerous, who knows ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


Of cause YMMW but I think a good dose for most people will be 50 mg, some people who have a natural tolerance will want to take 75-100 mg, but I'd rather not.

Sounds about right to me. Was thinking it seemed roughly equipotent with 2c-c the day after my experience with it. Curious as to whether the hangover will increase with dose.

Your greatly confused old friend! Ask psood, I know hes discovered, IM'ing and plugging(though to a much lesser extent) provide states, especially with tryps or diss's(even phens really though I haven't tried as much with them) that are totally unique. Its weirdly hard to describe but after IM'ing a strong dose of DPT I finally understood how oddly unique the state of IM psychedelics is(I got a strong taste once with IM DMT but...). 4-subs go oh so well with it. Its so much more about the insta trip, which BTW IMO it is not, IV maybe but IM'ing or even plugging most things takes atleast 5 minutes before an alert or two show and about 10ish before your under much of a gauntlet. Believe me its some weird shit, I don't even like needles, been way to much of a pussy to IV myself, IM'ing I can manage but I hate it, but can't occasionally(once every couple weeks/every few exps, so notice I don't do it to often, plus I don't like having pin cushion thighs/give 'em time to recoup)return to that state. One further thing, IM psyches have such a perfect duration and even ride, its like you easily transition from A to B like sliding on perfectly formed ice than glide back down. I used to love the come up's as well(would have claimed to it was apart of my experience! In fact I have old BL posts about that shit... ha), but after a few hundred under my belt and times a changin' for me it wasn't as rational anymore. Its really good to hear though about the nausea, only reason i'm iffy is mescaline is one of the only psychedelics that I can fast on and take a fair dose of and still have a chance to puke, so I figured this may be in line but i'll just forget about that! As for plugging, anyone whos eaten 2c-B and than later tried plugging 2c-B will get it as well, haha! Oh and I would have to think as well, that it was your excitement that lead to higher expectations, i've had more than enough mecscaline experiments for one man to ever wish for, yet I know if I had the chance to try a potent closely related chemical that I would not only be excited but my expectations would be astronomic. Thinking of that i'm fairly glad I didn't get any AL right away, I probably would have definitely enjoyed the trip but still been disappointed by its apparent lack of "depth" or ability to "take someone somewhere".

Hmm, do you have a reason for this or are you just being cautiously natured? I've never noticed one ROA(except maybe IM for certain things that don't do muscle tissue well...)cause issue whilst another is good besides IV and thats usually for other substances. I would just make sure to let everyone know the obvious, cut the dose down majorly when plugging/IM'ing! I also feel you on the MDMA, I guess I just let class boundaries go long ago, just because something is classified as by a certain name, does not mean another chemical not under the same classification can have similar qualities. I just wouldn't cross the line of say purely claiming Mesc to be an empath or vice versa with MDMA and psychedelia. Just silly to bother with those sort of things in my mind, also is a bit negative usually so I avoid that as well! 


I wonder about insufflation to, its just I rarely travel that route since 99% of psychedelics play not nicely with nasal tissue. If someone is on their second trial maybe they could halve their dose and try to insuff it just to see how probable/effective it is? I would tell someone to try a bump during but its hard to judge how effective those are for some people(always been pretty ineffective with phens as well)!

^^ No, I don't really have any reasons for saying it might be dangerous. I was mostly thinking of insufflation and the 2ct7 deaths that occured. I didn't have any qualms snorting Metocin right of from the begining, but it just feels so safe and natural. I don't know about AL, I think caution is wise when it comes to insufflating it, keep doses low and don't mix with other compounds, but what do I know 8) 

Plugging it might be more interesting than I first thought. You're getting me all curious about that ROA, might have to try it. Which phens or trypts are great for plugging?

2c-x and mdma are particularly great for plugging, although I tend to prefer not plugging MDMA so as to not attenuate its duration. 2c-b specifically is amazing plugged, the intensity is right around insufflated intensity but the come up is SO SMOOTH AND CLEAN it's just incredible. I can take twice the dose of 2c-b that would make me puke snorted via plugging and not feel nauseous at all. Plugging other 2c-x so far have not cut down on nausea but significantly reduced the come up time. I hear plugging 2c-c is fantastic but I haven't tried this myself yet.

Ok, seems like I have to rethink my habits in this respect. I never had any qualms about plugging, neck&wash ist just second nature at this point and I do have an iron stomach (the only time I ever had to throw up on a psych was a couple hours into a horrible OD episode). Now IM poses a somewhat bigger psychological hurdle, but the bit about help?!? rediscovering DPT caught my interest. I just hate the awful drip/taste, the clogged nose, all of it. It's one of the most interesting trypts and I'm too disgusted to take it, haha. IM would resolve that problem at least. Hm, but I'm in no hurry to pick up IMing (or plugging for that matter), I have quite a lot of stuff on my to-do list, chemicals I never got round to taste up to this point. I hope to eliminate most items this summer, and will stick to oral dosing with compounds I'm not familiar with for obvious safety related reasons (I rather be able to relate what's happening to prior experiences, which is out of the window the second I switch ROA).

You hit right where I was, I hated(not really but its damn annoying, like DPT doesn't burn much but has a bitch drip that is hard to mediate/etc), also like I stated, DPT is weird IM. It reminds me of how nasal ketamine is like being quickly covered from behind by a plush blanket and slowly laid down, where as IM ket is like being placed into a barrel and thrown off Niagara Falls IMO. IM takes a second to hit, but once it does it seems to rip you away infinitely. IM or plugged DPT has a different "frequency" I would like to say about it, its essentially the same but the transition is so smooth/quick, its so enticing. Your just laid nicely into this state that to me is like the perfect mixture of 5-MeO-DMT and DMT, not exactly but like someone took certain pieces of each, of varying intensity and combined them, thats what DPT has always reminded me of in a sense, but then it has its own wonder. At this day I like it as much as DMT and find it nearly as worthy a tool, its hard for me to say because of the true oddness of the Earth shattering vaped DMT but..considering if I could I would IM DMT all day. Either way though IM and plugging are much more than "ways to avoid nausea or the long come up", they provide states that while essentially the same, have their own unique flavor which other ROA's just cannot match. I knew someone would come in and talk about plugged 2c-B, its another one thats weird. I doubt i'll ever dose 2c-b orally again, atleast to start the experience. 2c-B is one of the few things I would actually really hesitate to snort as well, so many things in my nose but 2c-B was a bit beyond irritating. The first time I tried plugging it i'm pretty sure I used a sub par dose on another psychedelic and I had to remain seated for awhile while the "rush" took hold(obviously nicely mixed in but I could tell that the B was really working its magic). IMO your holding on way to hard, once you try it out a couple of times you see that its actually pretty easy to equate experiences even between ROA, I know most times people have realistic numbers but for psyches, all we have is "Bro just halve the dose!" as a starting point, I mean sure its super scientific and all. See what i'm getting at(if you don't its the fact we don't have set numbers but people can still equate it out though maybe not terribly accurate)? I know you, your not inexperienced and I know you would easily be able to compare an oral trip between any other ROA and your simply convincing yourself that your first ROA needs to be oral(yes, oral gives a grander baseline technically but you also have high expectations of doing many substances this summer which takes time to do orally, there is no reason not to experiment between ROA IMO when there is no information on any dangers or perceived ones just start low, I remember years ago I could usually find at least one obscure report of someone IM'ing not to mention a lot of people plug...). Safety is great and is always a first line concern but when you create needless concern, well its needless and is simply anxiety.  I agree with Fag on the front that we probably should put a disclaimer for those wanting to insuff AL being the first go but thats because theirs no existing information and I don't feel safe enough in chem knowledge or even near so to claim anything about AL, really if you don't know indepth chemistry or have a real reason to fear, don't do it or else you'll start to monger! Thats to easy in this community and before not you'll have rumors flying between the even the middle level users at times. We should probably just use disclaimer's to make sure people know we just don't know and simply have their safety in mind. Gotta be careful how we approach IMO. Lastly if your terribly worried about changing your ROA(I still can't figure it out..do you have some untested goodies that you should fear or something? ;P)go for small doses. Only plug/IM 2-5 mgs of 2c-b or whatever it is your doing. One thing I also will note that I didn't is that I can actually tolerate low dose psyches via the IM route, maybe even plugging but haven't really tried with that. Orally I wouldn't take most phens in low doses if you paid me, just uncomfortable. My favorite thing has to be the fact it works so well to because I think your also confused because I rarely if ever start out my experiences plugging or IM'ing unless its something like 2c-B. I'll take a higher oral dose first and than hours later mix in the IM or plugged shots. It helps negate any tolerance formed and I like it better than bumping things. It also allows for long term experience on short terms psychedelics a much more possible thing. Everytime I prep my needles, throughout the micron filtering and it all, i'm sitting there like "Its all good, you've done this many times before." and shit like that, I really don't like IM'ing things but like stated, that state you enter. Oh and Fag, my favorite way to use 4-HO-MET besides plugged or IM is definitely insuff. Its perfect for small bumps, for me 12-14 mgs orally is a full go experience so I bump 3-6mgs and i'm in a good place, works great if I want to take a hike or something but don't feel like eating/prepping anything! 


Either way though at the end of the day, the only reason i'm even bringing up the ROA's is just the high cost per dose for AL right now. I'm fairly certain with the dose coupled with the reports being laid back things will lower but for now eating 50 mgs is pretty non-feasible for me! Really though I would love to see someone take it to the 60-75mgs level, as I just can't tell if it will ramp up, people feel like it won't but to me Mescaline kinda feels the same way until a certain dose. Hopefully we'll see soon enough. Also, I don't know if its been established yet but everyone who had a hangover was sure they were hydrated, nicely feed, and all that? I know sometimes on lower doses it can be oddly distracting and you can forget to drink or eat for awhile but considering so many people clearly listed a hangover its probably a bit more than that but a man can hope!

I wonder why the dosages here are so far off from PIHKAL? I know Shulgin tends to lowball them, but he's not usually off by a factor of 2. A bad synth going around maybe?

Very true what you say there.

I have no basis what so ever for being so overly catious about snorting AL. Actually, it **probably** would be fine to snort something like 20-30 mg, I just think it would be unwise to do it while on 150 mg of MDMA and a handfull of ephedrine or something like that. Absolutely [nothing](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/624889-3-5-dimethoxy-4-allyloxyphenethylamine) is known about AL's pharmacology. It's a true research chemical, in every sense of the word, and it being available the way it is might make some people forget that.


About the hangover, it's true that the night before I hadn't slept much, only a couple of hours. And yeah, I certainly didn't eat as much, or drink as much liquid these 2 days as I normaly would. So that certainly worsened it. Actually hangover is kind of a wrong word, it wasn't really uncomfortable, it was just mostly being very tired. I think in time I could even learn to enjoy it. just be sure you have the day after free to lounge.

No, the stuff's that's currently available is the real deal. It's also been tested and results posted publicly. But I've been wondering the same, why didn't Shulgin (or his test subjects) push this one further?

In pihkal it's like he concludes that " The material seemed wholly social in nature. No visual, auditory or olfactory sharpening was in evidence." (35 mg) and then just decides to leave it with that. 

I must say that with 50 mg I did experience visual and mental effects with AL , so I think it's just a case of Shulgin having had so many different possible compounds to test that he never really had the time. It's not the first time he's a bit off ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Maybe he synthed a couple of grams, and the test group never got higher with the doses before they ran out of it, and then moved on.

I wouldn't say *nothing* about the pharmacology is known, only in a pedantic sense in that we don't know anything about the pharmacology with *certainty*. It's structurally a very close analogue of mescaline with effects that seem to be in some sense subjectively akin to mescaline and so I think we can draw from that quite a bit about its pharmacology.

Yes, I see what you mean. We now it's psychedelic, that it probably hits 5-ht2-a/b/c. From then on we know close to nothing. I mean, it's not **that** close to mescaline in effects. it's just reminiscent of Mescaline. It definitely is doing something very different. It's not like some of the other mescaline analogues that are supposed to be very close to mescaline in effect.


"Some" studies have been made on most of the common RC's, but non has ever been done on AL, as far as I know. not even drug discrimination animal studies or what ever the various forms of animal tests are called.

I'm on 50mg right now, an hour after taking it in two parts an hour apart. I also took half a Unisom with the first dose to help ward off any nausea or anxiety. As I was taking the second dose I noticed some tingly sensations and some eerie sense that things were a little different. For the first half hour after the second dose the tinglyness got stronger and also started feeling a tightness in my gut, not really nausea but it felt like it could go that way. The tingles reminded me of the two times I've tried a San Pedro extract. The second half hour the tingles got stronger along with the almost-but-not-quite-nausea feeling in the belly. Now I'm sitting here feeling like I'm bathed in light coming from everywhere, and wherever I look at the white walls in my room or the white spaces on this page I see swirling bands of bluish green tinged with magenta. I've been in a really good mood for the past hour, but also there's this nagging feeling that I should be doing something more productive with my time right now...? I'm also remembering that the last time I took San Pedro, it was chilly and kind of rainy outside and I was instructed that I would have a better experience if I save the next time for when the weather is nicer and it's bright and sunny out, because that's the kind of weather cactuses like. And here I am today, taking a mescaline analogue and it's damp and rainy again. *Lo siento*, Saint Peter, *perdóname por favor*...

Excellent idea, Fagott! The nausea suddenly got a lot worse after I posted that, but some more antihistamines, Pepto-Bismol, and a good belly laugh* fixed that right up. Just got back from a walk outside, where at least it's not raining anymore but it's still pretty humid. Couldn't tell if I was too hot or too cold the whole time, but I'm too something, that's for sure.

I'm thinking about taking a dose in the 50-60mg range next myself. Though i'll probably pick up a bit more before so i can take it with some friends. @42mg I got the distinct impression that it would benefit from a group setting.

My girlfriend and I dosed roughly 30mg about a month ago. I honestly just don't remember whether I took 25 or 30 mg, but I scaled it precisely. It began with a strange and pronounced tingling in the stomach (for both of us, and as someone else mentioned in a previous post), and slowly progressed into a warm body high and mild euphoria. I found it to have little "psychedelic" effect and it reminded me more of something like MDA (although not nearly as intense). There was mild euphoria and a relaxed body sensation, but MDA like closed eye visuals and patterning. I also noticed while going through my phone that the lights were reminiscent of the visual change observed from taking molly in the past. We had intercourse on it, which was fantastic, however afterwards we both felt extremely hot to the point of discomfort. We spent about an hour sitting in front of a fan sweating and trying to relax. I attempted to sleep on it, but had annoying and disturbing, demonic closed eye visuals (perhaps from slaying demons in Diablo 3 for a few hours...). This did not really cause any sort of psychological discomfort, but I was forced to keep my eyes open and watch TV for an hour or two before being able to finally fall asleep. The next day I didn't experience any notable hangover, and no after effects have been noted since. I should note that I have never done mescaline, only 2Cs as far as phenethylamines go, so I can't really compare it to mescaline, but it was certainly nothing like any 2C I've done.


edit: As a last thought, I'm not really sure if I'd be interested in doing it again as I didn't find it particularly enjoyable compared to other substances, but I still have some left so perhaps I'll try a slightly higher dose in the future to see if anything more interesting occurs.


edit 2: I'd also like to say, as I've seen a few people complain about the comparisons to MDMA, that I do not mean to imply this drug was overly similar to MDA or MDMA. Like I said, I have never done mescaline. For that reason, my only real frame of reference for comparison would be MDA/MDMA (again it is nothing like any 2C that I have done). I found the affects to be very tactile in nature, but with a vague "trippiness" with eyes open. Furthermore, the CEVs really did clearly remind me of the CEVs from MDA. Orgasm on AL felt extremely similar to orgasm on MDA as well. I do not mean to hype this drug up as some new alternative to MDA or MDMA, only to try to make a comparison to make my report more clear, as describing these kinds of experiences is very difficult as I'm sure you all know. In conclusion, go into an AL experience expecting AL, but don't be surprised if you notice and feel that some of its effects are comparable to a mild MDA experience, albeit different. I'm sure for those who have done mescaline, comparisons might be drawn with that instead. So yeah, take my comparison with a grain of salt if you want, it's just my report!

I took a very small bump to test it out before consuming my full dose, and I did not feel that it burned very badly. Mind you, I didn't rail a line or anything so I couldn't comment on that.

Well, I spent the rest of the day in a good mood and feeling like I was bathed in light, but also coping with a nasty churning in my gut that wouldn't go away. Also had a couple bouts of diarrhea. I never felt like throwing up, it was mainly lower down in the intestines. It was pretty frustrating and kept me from really getting comfortable the whole time. Also I would go from being too hot to too cold and then back again in the space of a few minutes, that was pretty annoying too. I had to keep getting up and turning the air conditioner up or down, and when I was walking outside I kept putting my jacket on and then taking it off again a minute later. Then the next couple of days I felt pretty burned-out, like I was getting over the flu. In retrospect maybe I should've stuck with my original plan of only doing 30mg or so.


I forgot to mention too that I took some antacid about 20 minutes before my two doses. That helps with absorption of other phenethylamines so I figured it wouldn't hurt to try it with this one too. But maybe I took too much and it contributed to the nausea...? I think this one has a lot of potential, if you can get around the body load. I am going to try it again, maybe only 40mg or so divided in three doses without any antacid, hopefully that won't hit quite as hard.

I agree, it's not much like any of the 2C's at all. The body tingles, positive mood, and churning in the gut were a lot like the San Pedro extracts I've done. I didn't get any kind of entity contact, but it was only my first time, and sometimes those don't happen until you've taken something a few times and gotten to know it (and it's gotten to know you ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)). I think people compare mescaline to MDMA?MDA because the body tingles are similar between the two, and allylescaline seems to share that as well.

It's structurally a very close analogue of mescaline with effects that seem to be in some sense subjectively akin to mescaline and so I think we can draw from that quite a bit about its pharmacology.

this compound is structurally similar to, but still nothing like mescaline, due to the allyl chain at the 4 position. think back to 5-MeO-DALT: kind of like 5-MeO-DMT, except that it wasnt. at all. with the allyl groups on 5-MeO-DALT it didnt get interesting until about 75mg, when it started to get pretty rough on the body. this compound is probably very similar due to the allyl group. AND we still have no idea about the pharmacology of 5-MeO-DALT, let alone any allyl 4-subbed PEA

Visually AL is kinda on the weak side but, overall I found it to be a nice compound.I've trialed it to 50 mgs and found it to be somewhat introspective with a nice energizing body high.The overall feel reminds a lot of San pedro cactus but, not nearly as intense.Still pretty nice..It all depends on what your looking for i guess.I think it worth it.......

The weird feelings in the gut are probably the intestinal contraction effects. Mescaline is also reported to cause that. Pregnant women are advised not to use mescaline for that reason, because it also causes uterine contractions. I don't know what intestinal contractions would actually be. Probably wouldn't feel great though.


 I don't think the allyl group on the carbon ring would be harmful in itself, if anyone is concerned about that. There is an analgesic called Alclofenac, which is 4-allyloxy-3-chlorophenylacetic acid,  and it can be taken in doses as high as 3 grams per day without any significant ill effects. It's not an amine but aside from that it's pretty similar. I don't see any reason why AL would be any worse than mescaline, and natives have used that for their whole lives with no serious long term physical effects that I know of.

mescaline always made me kinda woozy, like i had the urge to toss [vomit] should i assume that this substance would too? has anyone who has actually tried it, give a report on the physical side effects? thanks for any info.

**Allylescaline HCL**


I have just received 250mg's of this material , and sujjestions on things too enhance this trip?   shrooms , grapefruit, any other 2ci, 2cp, 2ct2 , ketamine or mdma? 

Fasting or meditation? 

i will have a trip report by this weekend , because i cannot find much info on this specific chem.

Whoomp, there it is.  Fasting and meditation, good idea.  Combining a brand new drug you've never tried before, and for that matter, not a whole lot of people in the history of the world has tried before, with other drugs, bad idea.

Took 30mg before going out to breakfast a few days ago.  Bad idea, started feeling sick to my stomach, had to run to the bathroom to vomit.  That didn't bring back my appetite though, just ate a few bites of my pancake.  When I got home I just felt like lying in bed with my eyes closed.  I felt very sensitive to temperature, it was a nice day but felt cold without the sheets over me.  I also had a feeling of restlessness that still made it uncomfortable, even under the sheets with my eyes closed.  I did have some nice blue and green CEVs, but these kept getting interrupted by my body discomfort.  I wanted to eat/smoke pot since I knew it would make me feel better, but I thought either would just make me vomit again.  Finally I got up an hour or so later to go get a pot brownie, right as I was thawing it (I keep them in the freezer) I felt sick to my stomach again, had to run to the bathroom and vomit up what little breakfast I had.  Then I ate my pot brownie, it felt like just a few minutes had passed before I started feeling it, but I think it was more like 30 - 45 minutes, the allylescaline definitely affected my sense of time.  This was the only time I felt good during my trip, I layed down in bed much happier because of the pot, and enjoyed some CEVs as well as some "electric" feelings in my legs.  I did start feeling uncomfortable again a few hours later, so ate another pot brownie.  My digestion was wrecked all day, had heartburn when I wasn't feeling nauseous.  The CEVs were all the pleasure I got out of allylescaline, and only when I was on pot was it really enjoyable.  Allylescaline is not worth ingesting in my opinion, the rest of mine is going in the trash.

After only one try? Hm suit yourself but there are plenty of hit or miss compounds out there, in other words ones with unpredictable and widely ranging effects. Which can be a qualitative thing or a quantitative thing. With 2C-T-7 for example I found it very hard to pin down in both those respects. Admittedly it is not related to allylescaline...

Proscaline is something people seem to speak more or less highly off though, well that is my unconsciously-summed-up conclusion on the reactions I read about. Maybe not an experience remotely as memorable as mescaline tends to bestow but it sounds like a fascinating and good body high, even when you trade in for visual activity which I think mescaline itself is low on already. BUT that again is based only on 1 experience. I try to characterize the drug best I can using that one trip. Maybe it's better if I just take another trip, preferably multiple others... before I make any "claims" or characterizations, and maybe in that same way you cannot typify this one after 1 experience. Shouldn't we be honest about that?

Of course you have the right to throw in the trash or flush in the toilet whatever drug you want! But it would be a shame if others would draw conclusions without a consistent reproduction of your effects.


My advice? Take a little less, and try to be super picky about your set and setting. If the exact same feelings come up as expected then it's another story.


In all honesty, I have shelved my 25D-NBOMe because I did not find the vasoconstriction in my feet acceptable at that low a dose. Discomfort and worries about serious adverse effects are different things though, and shelving for me means I put it back at the end of the queue of NBOMe compounds. Dispite everything it had something interesting. I wonder about you or others seeing anything interesting of whatever kind in allylescaline.


Again I don't presume to tell you what to do.


And for the record I am hoping on 100 mg of this material to become available to me at a point in the future.


I remember a few people fantasizing about 3C-AL, no idea on what that sort of enthousiasm is based but I am ready to find that out and along with it has to come this AL.

I've read that lemon essential oil can help with nausea from shrooms, because of its 5-HT3 antagonism. I wonder if it would help with AL nausea too? Just an idea.

Good suggestion but I don't think it's even close to proven that all psychedelic induced nausea is 5-HT3 activation related. Maybe people who have applied something like ondansetron to a WIDE variety of psychedelics can illuminate this question. But it can just as easily be coming from nausea-related brain activity which would be a lot harder to isolate and suppress.

The typical AdvDD poster would be welcome to jump in at this point. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

yesterday i finally tried AL with my friend. this is a very gentle substance.


each swallowed 36mg in a capsule (we split a banana and a tiny bit of yogurt) at 9:30am, snorted 8mg at 11am, was down by 5:30pm. come up was extremely smooth, but took almost a full 2 hours to peak. no uncomfortable body load (felt kind of like 4-fa), euphoric, no nausea (but we smoked weed all day), very lazy, very kind to the ego, not extremely visual but beautiful kaleidoscope cev, connection felt with nature


extremely functional too, but lost all motivation to do anything. during the peak, which lasts around 4 hours, we were able to go swimming, cook burgers, and eat them. spent about 6 hours giggling. did not kill my appetite, but rather kept me hungry all day. sleep came easily at 11pm, but around 6:30pm we had about 10mg MXE nasally and a few nitrous balloons. weird and vivid dreams, woke up with no hangover.


great stuff for a first time tripper, or a lazy summer day. too lazy for festivals, much more lazy than shrooms

How does this compare to mescaline. I'm curious about allyl but have yet to be wowed by peyote and san pedro. I'm going to do an extraction so I know exactly how much mesc I'll do next time before I completely write it off. I think I'm going to try TMA-6 before allyl but been needed to branch out from the 2c-x series.

Does anybody think Allylescaline has a WAY larger doase range like mescaline ?

maybe it is 35mg - 150mg? maybe more?

Is there a cirtain point where side effects manifest ? or can you eat as many as you want like 4-aco-dmt?


I have 250mg and am sampling tomorrow  , I am thinking everybody is underdosing and missing the visual/ more mescaline effects

Whoa what makes you think it has*that* wide a range? Dmytry reported kaleidoscopic effects at the 35-40 mg mark, now maybe it was mild but 150 mg is around 4 times that! I am trying to think of compounds that have a range going up to 4 times a dose that would present with kaleidoscopic but mild visuals, the 2C-C and 2C-B kind would be benign enough for such a thing but consider 2C-E which has quite a steep dose response curve... Not-so-coincidentally I read the PIHKAL entry of AL today and around the 32 mg mark if I remember that detail correctly... people are reporting that going higher than that would be counterproductive at least.

Well you may have a different mentality and consider confusion and warped/weirded out levels of intensity a challenge but it still makes me think like it can just as easily become much heavier around 55-60 mg. Look, maybe you are right, I am not saying you are not. But I don't see grounds to believe that this would be an uneventful one that needs forced up-up-and-above dosing like 2C-D or DiPT to shine in different ways. And consider the possibility that it doesn't shine if you go higher and higher but it rather becomes fucked-up-feeling in some sort of way. Titrate your dose carefully, at active levels you don't go doubling like titration below threshold... assume it has a steep dose response curve and prove the assumption wrong instead of doing the opposite.

C'mon, handle it responsibly.


Also, I don't think you can just eat as much as you want with 4-AcO-DMT, are you sure it's not redosing tolerance or something like that, that made this okay for you in the past? I found 4-HO-MET to be okay to go from 20 to 30 to 40 and it was absolutely positive but intense. 4-AcO-DMT is deep shit and others report full effects around 20 mg (maybe 25 mg for some) and quite heavy at 30 or 35. That also means steep or at least semi-steep curving. Not adding 2 mg is doubling effects like the infamous 2C-E but keep such things in mind to stay sensible.


And what's that about mescaline? I have only had 330 mg synthetic crystals and not enough to continue trying it out until very recently. But right now I have reasons why I cannot explore it further. It's right about at the top of my list for that though and I wonder what 500 mg synthetic will be like.


So what is the dose-response trendline like for mescaline? I have also heard that doing megadoses above something like 750 mg isn't very good as a load for your liver at all. Which quite surprised me because I always thought it was so safe. It made me consider doing it I.M. in the future, needing less material and giving less of a load, and also avoiding any chance of losing material through throwing up. But there are virtually no information in I.M.ing mescaline other than that in some drug tests/trials in the past they administered it IV and IM.


What do you think the dosage range of mescaline is like then? And on what do you base that idea?

ok so if 750mg is a toxic dose for mescaline , that means a human body can roughley handle 500mg of mescalien no problem. why is allylescaline considerd dangerous way before the 500mg point , the structure is almost identical , just because it is more active in our brain shouldent mean it is more toxic?


and im not saying im going too eat 150mg of allyll , this is all subjective trying to gain info/insights into unlocking this chems full potential..

its got almost no side effects.  really.  it was all mental, no physical.  honestly i didnt even have jaw tension.  and shulgin is known to dose to just until he can feel effects.  if i do this stuff again it will be ~50mg all at once, maybe with a bit of 2c-i for visuals and energy.  probably in the snow.

The classic (extreme/very shocking) counter-example is thalidomide. Two "versions" of this substance exist. They are made up of exactly the same numbers and types of atoms and all atoms are connected in a very similar way, so that one version is the same as the mirror image of the other version (just like a right hand and a left hand). This is called chirality. They *are* almost identical, that is, *much* closer than mescaline and allylescaline. One version of thalidomide is a teratogen and causes severe adverse effects when ingested during pregnancy. The other is a sedative and antiemetic.


I'm certainly not implying anything like these side effects for allylescaline! My point is, that structural similarity is an *indicator* for similar biological effects but it is not always strictly complied with. Unforeseen effects could possibly occur!


Higher potency can certainly lead to narrower 'safe dosage window'. This is just not known at the moment for allylescaline. It seems unreasonable to just rely on this assumption, it is your health at risk.


Don't want to sound rude or offend anybody. Just wanted to throw in a bit of harm reduction resp. risk awareness.


I'm all for unlocking this interesting substance's full potential, as you say DylanG204, but this is best done in small steps beginning from small doses and not relying on assumptions that rest on unknown variables.

The story of thalidomide is always tragic but fascinating to tell, so nice one on that. But I think you are confusing people here talking about isomers. Because that is what thalidomide's issue was about and somehow it was not seen in trials and became a disaster. One of those things that takes a long-term observation or study to become apparent.


Allylescaline is not so new, but not widely used either. It may cause birth defects at doses even lower at psychedelic doses, and *it might be both existing isomers that do it*. The topic is irrelevant.

As a reminder to non-chemists: if nothing is defined about a compound, like S and R ketamine or dextro vs. levo amphetamine... then chiral compounds are a mix of 50%/50% isomers. ((There are also chiral compounds with more than one point of chirality, their stereo-isomerism would make a normally occuring, racemic (evenly mixed isomers) compound 25%/25%/25%/25% is 4 isomers exist.)) But just remembering the 50-50 part, is enough.


Now about mescaline toxicity: I think this is basically because the doses are so high and it is just too much too handle for the liver. I don't know why exactly, for example a compound like phenibut or piracetam is consumed in multiple gram quantities by people, etc. I just heard it is.


Allylescaline being so similar to mescaline but more potent in the brain because of it's actions on receptors... based on limited information I would say it would not be expected to show analogous toxicity as mescaline to the liver. So how potent in action it is, is here irrelevant to how the liver handles it.


Remember NBOMe compounds: they are not free of toxicity, but what is nice about them is that in the brain they are so selective for receptors... but if a liver is mostly concerned with either chemicals that are toxic because of their poisonous structure or degradation products or because of the sheer amount of it overwhelming and flooding it, then NBOMe's having such a low dose is in all probability a good thing as far as the liver goes (and kidneys as well).


Eating too much salt, using too much GHB (and the sodium ingestion that comes along with it)... that's an example of how everything can be a disturbance (toxic) to the body as long as the amounts are high enough to have effects of certain bodily functions. So as a rule of thumb: lower doses of things are better for the organs.

But for NBOMe's problems can come from their still being active and the causal consequences of the activation of receptors which is why they are still to be considered with much care.


So back to allylescaline and mescaline: if mescaline toxicity has little to do with what happens in the brain after taking it but more with the amount of milligrams that have to be metabolized and we have no reason to think that allylescaline is any differently, then it does not bear the same type of risks. However for all we know, the action of allylescaline on receptors can have quite different toxic consequences for the body... or the presence of that allyloxy group might be a problem, coming from metabolism of the group to a toxic breakdown product.


In other words toxicity of AL is a question mark but I did not mention mescaline toxicity to warn you about going to 150 mg with AL.


What I am just wondering about is how fantastic mescaline can get before it becomes a liver issue. Well 750 mg would be more than double than my 330 mg, but no idea what that means. It all depends on the dose-response curvature. Which is what I was asking about... does it feel linear like with LSD or steep like with 2C-E? Anyone with high dose mescaline experience is still welcome to fill that in for me.


Anyway sn23: sorry if I stepped on your point, I see I repeated some things you already explained or mentioned.

What have been your previous dosage trials with Allylescaline and what does you want to make your dose 100 mg other than it being your birthday? Happy birthday to you, in advance. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  But if you are in fact tripling your dose without there being information about the results, I just want to warn you that this is an irresponsible plan, ranging from potentially unneccessary  to potentially dangerous.

Of course the entire 'range' of potential does include positive results, if it turns out that way: enjoy it.

But:  ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Then again, around 50 mg seems to be okay and it does sound gentle so may I am overreacting.


I'd just rather see this community taking steps of +15 or +20 mg instead of doubling. Act responsible.

100 mg's? That trip report I'd like to read! It does sound a bit reckless though, probably not lethal, but who know's?


I've only taken AL once, so I don't know about the dose/response curve, but I remember that I for some reason thought that I was glad I hadn't taken more than 50 mg. Then again, there's probably some people who's going to have high natural tolerance to it, like other PEA's.


As some people already mentioned, Allylescaline is all about the greens and blues and magenta. Not overly visual, but quite pretty actually.

**ALLYLESCALINE  50mg**


Not much too say about this compound , within an hour i had a mild stimulation, by 2 hours effects peaked.

I had no mood  elevation , i did not feel good or any sort of euphuria though i was calm,  (havent done mdma in 5 months) 

very slight patterning over objects not very noticable, diolated pupils , 


Not very interesting at all. I will try it again in a higher dose, or maybe with mdma.. combining it with 2ci seemed too

increase side effects,   i rate this chem 1.5 out of 5

TLDR; Consumed 25 mg of AL, tripped for approximately 8 hours and was able to sleep fine. My dosage may have been small, but considering the circumstances it was still a fun experience having "static" in the background. To the experienced tripper wanting to transverse dimensions, this compound may be too subtle. To anyone wishing to explore the world around them in a fun light, without anxiety, this chem might be right for you!


Prenotes: 20 yo/m/average physical condition. I didn't have anything to eat 4 hours prior to dosing. I also took 25 mg of DPH approximately half an hour before the trip to ease any potential nausea.


Dose: 25 mg of Allylescaline HCL


T 00:00 (15:15) -Take one capsule containing 25 mg of AL. I feel a bit nervous about the coming trip, as it is supposedly a long lasting compound, I do not have any access to any benzos/weed, and I will be around my family. I have however been around them before in countless different states of mind. I have also read that this substance is gentle, and thus can be ignored. I am aiming for a (++) at the most.


T 00:18 -Slight hints something is happening. I have a tingling feeling that I commonly get with other PEAs during the come up. Feeling a bit chilly, but the AC is turned up very high.


T 01:00 -The AL is definitely present now, and is continuing to grow. Slight stomach discomfort and my throat is feeling like it is lined with a thick wall of mucus. I get the same feeling from 2C's as well.


T 01:18 -Visuals are there but very mild. Physical side effects noted before are still there and growing in discomfort. CEVs are colourful and include geometric/Persian carpet patterning. I believe that I am still fit to keep some degree of composure.


T 01:45 -Just had a small bit to eat, but I am still hungry. I feel as if I could be from an assembly line chain going into my mouth and continue to be satisfied with the constant food entering my mouth. yum. The mucusy sensation is still very present.

-So far I feel as if this chem can be compared to a more subtle 2C. There are a lot of striking similarities, AL is just less in your face. This may be because my dose was small however. At this point I have definitely plateaued, and I do not feel that the AL is interfering with my thought process whatsoever.


T 04:00 -Just returned from a hour and a half bike ride. Nature was simply beautiful to look at. My sense of smell was heightened, and colours stood out more. I did not have any obvious visuals. My mental state was that of reflection on some past events that I do not wish to get into detail about, but to summarize I felt most thankful to those who were least likely to help me out in my situation and I feel resentment to those whose job it is to actually help me out.

-As I stepped back inside, my visuals did become more apparent but still remained somewhat subtle. In other words, the just weren't in my face and I could ignore them if I so choose, but I could certainly see them.


T 06:50 -The effects are clearly decreasing in effect now. Overall I feel like this is a light version of 2C-E, but with none of the neutral feelings. Again the OEVs where very subtle to say the least, but the CEVs completely made up for it. I truly believe that at higher doses, this chem can become more visual to the open eye. I will have to save that experience for another day however.


T 08:45 -It is now midnight and I am calling it quite and going to bed. At this point I no longer have any real effects apart from the mucus feeling in my throat throughout the whole trip.


Next day: It didn't take me an overly long time to get some sleep. I believe the fact that my dose was so small may have had something to do with that however, but seeing as I have no hypnotics to force myself to sleep, I played it safe. Although this experience was very subtle, and for the most part truly only a plus one experience, I still look forward to exploring this compound again somewhere in the range of 35-40 mg. Finally, I did not get any hangover the next day as other have said.

Regarding all comments : 98% = novice comments regarding the chemistry of this molecule without a true knowledge about this RC  + very few trip experiments about this RC  who have really understood the first question --> thanks to these few people (thanks **imgoneblind**,...)


unfortunately this RC seems to be a true shit in terms of effects.


For sure definitely **nothing to do with Mescaline and the best 2C-X or the best tryptamines **

I don't know if it's shit, just that it doesn't lend itself to intense experiences. 2C-B falls into this category for me - I would't choose to do it to trip hard for an evening of introspection, but it's nice to have around.

any thoughts on combining a small dose of allylescaline with a san pedro tea or extract?


would this be a worthwhile experiment?

a safe experiment?  wasteful?

or could there be something worthwhile in the combination?  i haven't had a chance to play with AL yet, but i'm wondering what folks who have (that liked it) think it is useful for, besides a mellow glow.

has anyone who tried it taken more than say 45mg? i don't suggest anyone to take a huge dose of this, but is anyone "working his way up"? since mescaline's dose is very high, maybe the suggested dose from shulgin (for AL) is a bit on the low side?

All the TRs of this sound vastly less interesting than 2c-b, though. IDK, sounds pretty shitty to me, not as if it would impossible to have good experiences on it, but doesn't seem worth pursuing/buying, especially since as I recall it's pretty expensive.

I'm suddenly wondering if there is a special quality that enhancers may have, which is subtle but unmistakable and not the same if substituted with a threshold dose of a more potent psychedelic... or instead that is a load of crock, and like IamMe90 suggested this is just not a winner.

And I'm not even saying that I know or suspect that AL is an 'enhancer'. Fck, if you'd ask me for an example of an enhancer as opposed to a psychedelic, even that is tricky... maybe it is what 2C-T-21 sounds like from reports??

It is hard to draw a clear line between "enhancers" and "potent psychedelics," I think.. I mean, personally LSD has functioned as the most remarkable enhancer of all... it has served to potentiate every phen I've taken it with to an unreal degree, potentiating all of the best attributes of the drugs without adding any negatives. At the same time, it's quite a potent and psychedelic drug on its own. I assume many drugs have multiple uses like that.

I took ~20mg (slighty over half of a 35mg sample I weighted out, not sure how much i'd take - I chose caution) sublingually about 3 hours ago - presently a distinct mood enhancement, coming in waves, pro-social, and without the sort of deep wandering thoughts typically associated with psychedelics (indeed, this post is manifest proof of that - even on fairly low doses of psychedelics, I have trouble posting, because I keep going back and rephrasing things. EDIT: Well it DID wind up being a much longer post than I planned....). It almost reminds me of the way low doses of the APB's feel (the only kind of dose of those chemicals I've taken so far)...  Muscle tension is so far entirely absent (I usually get enough to be annoying on the comeup of psychedelics), and gastic discomfort likewise absent. If this is all this substance does, I'd consider it a worthwhile material - I imagine it would be great for going out dancing.

Presumably, we'd call a low potency psychedelic which binds with low affinity (and/or low efficacy) an "enhancer", while the more potent (hence presumably high binding affinity) psychedelic we took it with would be the "enhancee". The boundary is most clear-cut with something with way-high binding affinitys being enhanced (LSD or an NBOMe), and something of low potency (ie, low binding affinity)  or that has a low ceiling (so presumably low efficacy), but with a desirable or complementary effect profile. Then you'd end up with your high potency psychedelic kicking the low potency one off the contested receptors (providing a strong trip), with the enhancer, well, enhancing the experience through it's actions on the related receptors which the high potency one doesn't bind to (which are - hopefully, and probably - the ones responsible for the desirable effects of the enhancer). My point is that from a biological standpoint, the idea of some psychedelics being valuable as enhancers to others makes sense. 


IamMe90 - in your examples of LSD and 2C's, it would be the 2C's enhancing the LSD, working under the assumptions above. The LSD would be providing stronger HT2A agonism by taking the 2Cs' place on those receptors (Where the 2C's have lowish efficacy), while the 2C's are still binding to whatever other receptors they bind to that give the effects their distinct character (It's not unreasonable to hypothesize, knowing that all typical psychedelics are HT2A agonists, that the differences between them are due to how strongly they agonize HT2A (strength) as well as what else they interact with(character of the trip))...  It rather makes sense to me that LSD + 2C-X would feel to have much of the character of the 2C-X, but with a much greater intensity. 


25I-NBOMe (being a very strong and selective HT2A agonist) would make sense to use in combinations with an enhancer (by my terminology) as well, by this logic. I've been meaning to try adding a low dose of 25I-NBOMe or 25C-NBOMe to another psychedelic, to sort of test my theory. Certainly, if that didn't provide excellent synergy with weak-ish psychedelics, that would be a strike against my theory. 25C-NBOMe and AL sounds kinda nice...

I think some of you have unrealistic expectations for this material. Mescaline itself is a gentle and cleansing experience for most people, and not some kind of ego-shattering balls to the wall ordeal. So I'd expect a mescaline analogue to be the same way. I think there's a lot of potential here, if you can manage the nausea.

So i've got 110mg of this sitting here waiting for the right time to ingest it. My question is from what I've found I'm 

thinking of dosing around 30-35mg after testing 1mg to make sure it's not some insanely potent drug.

Any advice would be great as to proper dosing.

Fine I'll be the guinea pig and drop 70+mg since nobody else is gonna. A close friend recently passed away so I don't want to be grieving when I trip. But in I think in under a week I will feel ready to dose. Will come back with a trip report.

I think i'm going to be insufflating. When you say it doesn't burn that bad, could you compare it to a few other things?


I was hoping it'd be something like


2c-x>Allylescaline>MDMA


(2c-x generally being the most irritating to the nasal passages, particularly 2c-e or 2c-b)

burns much less than 2c-x, less than the fluoroamphetamines, about the same as coke without the numbing feeling

Well, I'm at T+9:20 right now, still coasting down slowly at +1, and I'll tell you I had very nice afternoon but not necessarily a whole lot more. Allow me to expand.


I refrained from taking my prescribed 18mg Strattera, not necessarily because I want to trip, but perhaps just out of laziness. 2 hours before dosing I ate a small bowl of soup.

At noon I dropped ~75mg. Within 15 minutes I felt some alerts. My eyes were a bit shaky. Everything was a bit shaky. By 30 minutes in I thought it had settled but by 40 minutes in I was nauseous. Weed felt like it helped for a moment but it didn't matter. I am always surprised by how much easer psychedelic vomit is than alcoholic vomit. It doesn't have the horrible swimming precursor, where everything is just spinning around you, and you don't even really see it happening; you just want it to be over. All of a sudden my stomach just said "fuck that stuff." and 45 seconds later a bubble popped in my throat and then was on the ground. As I vomited geometric kind of visuals started to appear in the bushes but they didn't stay for long. At the time (T+55) I thought I had absorbed all of the Allylescaline due to a farly empty stomach but it who knows if I did. Take my report with a grain of salt because of this.

At T+1:00 I felt a bit better. Thinking was fun and fluid, but speaking didn't come easily. No thought ever quite stayed long enough to make it to my vocal chords. My thoughts seemed very interesting but conversation seemed trivial. Perhaps it was, or more likely, I was being more self absorbed than usual. 15 minutes passed and I felt better still, though my stomach had not yet forgiven me. I felt in good humor. We talked and laughed; the mood was calm and light. No serious problems were to be conquered today. I just marveled at the little things, like the reflection of the world on the surface of a bubble.

At T+1:30 I felt a momentary surge where I thought I still had a lot farther to come up. My stomach churned and my vision... (I want to say churned as well perhaps) At T+2:00 I was pretty much at the peak and it became clear that those momentary surges of visuals were not going to pan out. I ate 2 slices of bread and my stomach thanked me. After being so angry, it finally decided it was done with being empty. After my stomach had calmed itself around the bread I ventured to taste a grape and it was truly fantastic. (I wouldn't say that taste was enhanced overall, but I did notice that several sweet juicy things i ate over the course of the day seemed especially good) The grape made me fiend for more and suddenly I couldn't get them in my throat fast enough. i was so excited by the freshness that I didn't worry too much about my pace. It wasn't long before I snapped out of it and slowed down.

At T+2:40 I went upstairs to roll a joint. During that time I thought I was near sober but upon returning to my friend D I suddenly realized how abosrbed in my task I had been. I could have been gone for over 20 minutes for all I knew. Clearly the headspace was what was important about this drug IME. There had been times coming up when i felt almost stranded for a moment. As if I left D's house, I would just not know where to go.  This did not last though. I really was pleased as punch all afternoon. I approached each activity with childlike enthusiasm despite retaining my slightly cynical humor. Each new game was fascinating but it was also readily apparent how silly all of it was. I could at the same time smile at a wonderful bubble, and snigger at how silly I must look, gazing lovingly at a bubble.

At t+3:20 I mention in my notes that typing on my phone, made me realize my thumbs were numb. Not sure how long that went on for but I thought I would mention it for science.

The rest of the day continued in a similar happy go lucky manor. Each activity was low energy, but I put my full attention into them.

At around T+6:00 I started to feel like I was coming down. By T+8 I had developed a headache, though I still felt some distinctly extra-cannibinoidal effects. Colors were still kind of vibrant. Opaque surfaces seemed to a reflection or sheen to them. My headspace was still kind of out there.


In conclusion I would say that 75mg is probably an excessive dose. By asking for psychedelia, I was wanting Allylescaline to do something it doesn't seem suited to do. I felt it would do better if advertised as an entactogen without a distinctly stimulant core. This can perhaps shed light on some of the vague comparisons to MDMA. Instead of "that's awesome. I love you. isn't this the best thing ever?" it was more like "o look at that. isn't that wonderful."

That being said I did vomit early enough that some could have been left. Perhaps those moments of intensity I felt peeking through my blissful state, were hinting that there was more to be had with Allylescaline. Though I doubt I myself will do it, I would like one more report of 70-100mg before we give up on higher dosing. I didn't get above a +2. But i'm not willing to bet it is impossible.

There was so much hype surrounding this compound, and other mescaline analogues, when the RC community was thinking about having it synthed. But it looks like a bit of a washout to me. Maybe it just hasn't been explored in a high enough dose yet, but the reports so far don't excite me to go and buy a sample. Thanks to those of you who did try it and subsequently reported their findings here though. It's great to add to the community knowledgebase!

:D Great write up, thanks!


So you think this is more of an entactogen than a psychedelic? You make lots of references to "bubbles" in your report. Was that a recurring theme during the trip, or is that simply your expressive style?

 Not style. A friend just found a bunch of bubble soap somewhere in his basement or something. We just spent a while at several different intervals, in his sunny backyard, blowing bubbles. We had fun experimenting with different bubble soap and bubble gun techniques to produce only vaguely different results. I guess it did become a theme though. I made many interesting connections with varying degrees of relevance to bubbles.


As for the comment Allylescaline being an entactogen, I'd say yes... hesitantly. It certainly wasn't like rolling. But it wasn't really tripping either. The reason I say entactogen is that the predominant effects were good feelings. I don't think (and this is a big think after only one experiment) that it could produce a full trip. i will note that they didn't come with empathy like and compassion like rolling. I was more involved in my own good feelings than the good vibes of EVERYTHING. 


again though, I'm not quite ready to close the book on this one. I wanna hear MrDaimondFDC's report. Maybe he can give us hope for this chem at high doses

does anyone have experience with insufflation?

I would like to mention that in the 2 days since my dose I have been unusually irritable. I got angry very quickly at stupid situations. This lead to a panic attack about 48 hours after dosing.

I don't know if it was the drug, or just be being depressed and angry at myself, that has lead to this irritability .

I just thought I should mention it for others who decide to test this chemical.

^There are others who have mentioned the same negative after-effects from this chemical. Reading through this thread, it seems to be pretty common actually. Thanks for sharing; it makes you wonder if it has some appreciable level of temporary neurotoxicity. Or maybe it causes a depletion of particular neurotransmitters?

IME most phens leave me irritable the next day. 2c-e was always good for that. I haven't tried my sample of allylescaline yet, so I can't comment on it. 


I don't recommend it, but I like to have a good trypt experience a day or two after a phen experience. It seems to help balance me back out and integrate the phen experience. I do love my trypts though.

100mg+ is certainly forcing it and would count as excessive in my view. Very interested in the results of your experiment though. My guess is, it wouldnt do much more than, say 60mg for me (I suspect the stuff has an almost logarithmic dose response curve until you reach clearly toxic levels).


Use the stuff as easygoing intoxicant with psychedelic overtones at occasions where retaining self control or interaction with square or sober folk is unavoidable. Good alternative to alcohol if you want to give a given day a special glow. It`s a niche product not the mescaline alternative everybody was hoping for. This should be accepted by now/

I got some of this compound recently. Not really keen on trying it yet but I did snort maybe 5 mg just to see if it burned much. Could definitely feel burn. No significant effects from it. From the reports here it looks like another waste of my money. I'll try it sometime when I have 12 hours to devote to it. 


I have a bunch of different RCs just sitting in a drawer and I have no real desire to use any of them again, the 2cx compounds, the 25x NBOMES, some diallytryptamine. As it stands now, the only mescaline analogue I think may have potential is jimscaline. 3-5 times the potency of mescaline and substitutes for LSD in drug discrimination tests (or whatever the correct term is), according to the description by Nichols et al. I don't know if that's animal tests or human. Looks interesting though. Oddly, no sources yet. Must he hard to produce or something, or maybe nobody just got around to it yet.


Anyway, since this is an allylescaline thread, my main point is that it doesn't seem to be a good compound to snort, judging from my little test. My other point, which is somewhat related, is that I needs me some jimscaline.

That combo was by far one of the best I have ever tried.  We split up 39mg each into some water and it started hitting us within 10 minutes.  by the time the LSD was peaking, we were already nicely tripping and it was a great mood to be in before transport to Lucy Land.


The visuals were too TOO strong but they were definitely there, as well as combined with the familiar phen feeling and just general wonky atmosphere.  I would definitely get this again.

Didn't the LSD just overpower the AL? From your description, everything could be attributed to the acid alone.

Nope they had great synergy, I felt each of them working together very well and each of my friends agreed.  I came down from the Allylescaline sooner then the LSD, and the enter trip didn't feel like LSD alone.  The Allylescaline made me very talkative, even more so than I already am on LSD.

I suppose that doing a combo for my first time would be a bad thing, but maybe I should just eat my 60mg sample orally then when I'm getting the jist of what its gonna be like do a blotter of 600mcg 25c?


I feel like they would probably both come down at the same time.


Also, 25c is a very talkative, stony, relaxing psychedelic for me, and it seems like it could be pretty synergistic?


anyone think this is a good idea?

I just tried this stuff today. 28 mg in orange juice 3 hours ago. Definitely not hitting the right combination of receptors. General gastro unease and body weakness are the main effects. Slight visual effects, like a general spongeyness to things, slight movement. Nothing that makes it preferable to being completely normal. Not erotic at all. You just want to lay down until it passes so the slight sick feeling will go away. Feels like something that might be good for a cactus to use to keep people from eating it, that's about its only value though, IMO. I think it hits 5-HT2b receptors more than anything else, which just makes you feel sickly. In conclusion, just another complete waste of money. The jimscaline article by Nichols only mentioned 5-HT2a and c agonism. Maybe that's the only thing that won't make you feel sick.

You're not supposed to put PEA structured chems into acidic drinks it lessens the absorption, apparently a more basic environment potentiates the absorption so you should take a tums before it next time.

Damn not to sound like a dick but I was really hoping for that 100+ experiment so it could atleast put an end to some things. Of course I want no harm to happen to the ingester but I have my doubts it would anyways but ah well maybe someone will get around to it someday or maybe this one is just a begign one as is......

for some reason, this hit me as being remarkably similar to how i felt first time i tried aMT, also at a lowish dose. i felt sick, the trip felt unitneresting and i spent the time trying to put it on the right track, and giving up and just waiting for it to end.... that being said, i have yet to try allylescaline, but for some reason, if i do get the same response, i will not be giving up, but trying other doses, as some chems take off at different levels... thanks for the report!

I've always had my beats on atleast some marked improvement of intensity though obviously what sort of added side effects this could bring are unknown and possibly make it less worthwhile. People always have to test things themselves though and out of all things to test at higher doses that might result in a bit of nastiness I know mescaline would probably be one I would rather deal with. With mescaline for me its always like people talk about AL, but given the right time or jump in dose mescaline can/will be a whole other ball game.

I thought I would just add that plugging definitely increases potency a lot. I plugged 30 mg and despite tolerance (4-aco-dmt experiences ~7 days and 3 days before), and what seems to be a naturally high tolerance to psychedelics in general, I got a lot more out it than I was expecting. Again, not much visual, but lots of tactile and pleasant body feelings. If I had to guess I'd say it would probably have been the equivalent of 70-100 mg orally.

I found 5-MeO-DALT and 5-MeO-DMT to have some similarities when smoked, but huge doses were needed with 5-MeO-DALT and there was quite a bit of nausea which increased with every hit - fun, but not really worth it. 


AL seems really interesting, sucks that I can't find it available anywhere...

This is not true. low pH (acidic) speeds up absorption and excretion. High pH slows absorption and excretion. 


It's all about the water solubility. Acids neutralise the basic alkaloids, which means they are more water soluble and the body can transport them around better.

its true that antacids like tums help absorption of PEAs, they make them neutral which helps it cross the intestinal lining much faster

A lot of people say its better to not do much on this chem, how about a little aquarium visit though? Is that chill enough or am I probably just gonna wanna be immobile for most of it?

I read about a rumor about someone who managed to get themselves killed with AL. Haven't been able to locate any report backing the claim up. The source insists the event took indeed took place, and even maintains a US vendors site selling the stuff went offline rcently in connection to the incident. 


Could anybody shed more light on this?

All of the reports of this incident (the death) have been very bizarre and third-hand. Rumors of poisoning and other nonsense, almost everything coming from third-party sources, etc.


I believe it is far too early to say that AL was the causative agent - in fact, it actually seems like a grim coincidence to me. 


So basically I don't think we have anything to worry about yet - we need a lot more information before we can draw any conclusion at all.

A little excursion to the Aquarium, a day on the shore or sightseeing are excellent choices. You're not stimmed or overly agitated but there is the distinct urge for locomotion and light exercise. Step out to dissipate this vague need for physical exercise and explore your surroundings. You won't be self-conscious or feel compelled to hiding a major high, it's pretty mild overall.

A word of warning: Snorting approximately 25~30mg of Allylescaline HCL resulted in a severe pain and inflammation in the nostril used for insufflation. I've been snorting 2C's for a while so it probably contributed to the damage, but the Allylescaline HCL seems to be particularly damaging.

Did this chem once before at the 70mg level (TR on page 8)

Came back to it again a week ago with a friend. We decided that it would make a really good headspace to use as a springboard for another trip.

We took ~50mg each Allylescaline and then 2 1/2 hours in (when we felt sure we had peaked, and our stomachs had settled) we took ~12mg of 4-AcO-DMT.

I don't have time to write a ful TR but lemme just say this, the synergy was VERY noticeable. 12mg 4-AcO-DMT would never have given me crazy visuals. And the Allylescaline certainly didn't. But together... WOW. I covered my eyes with a blanket to achieve complete darkness, and was greeted by crystal clear images of swirling patters that showed a sort of landscape. There were hills and a sun.... and a shadowy figure, whose shape was made of rippling black geometry, was standing between me and the sunset.


I've never had closed eye visuals like that in my life. Tryp Phen combos dude... they are something else.

 That sounds intriguing. Any advice about dose and timing, given allylescaline seems to take up to 3 hours to peak?

I decided to use my 64mg sample on a trip to six flags, I took it shortly before getting in and about 2 hours in I started getting a pretty nice phen body buzz that actually suited the rollercoasters really well. 


I got to smoke a joint shortly before this ride:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3k6LaOTc8U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3k6LaOTc8U)


and it was awesome, I felt like I was flying ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I also had a really sweet time on the superman ride front row. I was even having visuals in the concrete shortly before getting on the ride.


then I went on kingda ka, literally the biggest rollercoaster in the world.


I had about an 80 minute wait in line for kingda ka when I decided to take a blotter of 600mcg 25c-NBOMe. I started getting visuals from it about 45 minutes in and I was pretty much peaking when I got to ride the biggest coaster in the world :D


The synergy seemed to work pretty well, although I had a pretty hard time getting to sleep that night. residual stimulation does that to me often. It was a great day and one of the last of the summer.

I would say I'm a little more tolerant than most, to phens specifically. I had a big group of friends with me the whole time and I'm just pretty experienced with tripping in public.


In line for kingda ka I was cheesing big time lol and my pupils were huge. I was in line for the front row and a lady in the row behind me was talking to me and kept asking me if I was scared lol the convo pretty much went like this


'have you ever ridden this before?'

'yea when I was about 13 years old I think'

'are you scared?'

'Scared?! fuck no! I'm excited are you kidding me??'

'did you know sometimes the ride doesn't always make it to the top and it ends up falling back down the whole way'

'I'm excited for that!'

then my friend pat interjected with, 'he's tripping balls right now.'


and somehow she didn't know what that meant and she just kept asking if I was scared which kept adding to my excitement lol


it was fucking awesome going 125 mph and then corkscrewing down 450 feet though.

Allylescaline takes 5-6 hours for the visual peak in my experience.  Wait to take the 4-aco-dmt until about 4-5 hours in.

I tried 23mg allylescaline hcl the day before yesterday, and was very disappointed. The onset was very mild, and the peak was nice, but the come down was absolutely hellish and dysphoric. I felt like I was withdrawing from 20mg amphetamine for hours. All my muscles hurt a lot, and I felt terrible. The next day I had the worst hangover I have ever had from a psychedelic. All the muscles in my face and shoulders hurt like a bitch, and I was making weird mistakes all day like putting hotdogs in the freezer and milk in the cupboard. I felt absolutely awful the entire day. Very spacey, and out of it. It also increased my tolerance to amphetamines. 


Essentially, I felt like complete crap ever since about 3-4 hours into the experience. The whole thing lasted for about 8 hours, but 90-95% of the effects were gone by hour 6. I cannot overstate how bad I felt coming down and the next day. Even today, day 2 after the trip, I still feel a little crappy and out of it, but not nearly as bad as yesterday. Yesterday was hell. It was easily as bad as a hangover from high dose alcohol. 


It left me feeling so bad that I am not likely to ever try allylescaline again. Even today my jaw still hurts, and yesterday all my muscles just felt awful.

That seems odd. I did feel a but washed out & groggy the day following my 42mg experience. Didn't have the physical symptoms you describe though. Seems particularly odd for such a low dose. Go figure. YMMV I suppose.

Yeah, it is odd. Even stranger is that I got only mild physical side effects from 25i-NBOMe (although it was a low dose), and I don't get any real physical side effects from 2C-E. But I seem to be unnaturally tolerant to 2C-E, even in high doses I get no nausea and little to no physical side effects. With AL, I guess statistically some people are bound to have negative reactions. It's unfortunate, I had high hopes for AL. YMMV.

I still haven't tried my AL. DOC or 2c-i have been my go to for longer experiences. I've been contemplating trying it this or next weekend to see how it combines with mary and spinning records. I just still haven't figured out a good starting dose. Sonn went big with 60 and loved it, but I've read of some difficult experiences at 35 mg. Any suggestions?

Yeah, take 50 mg. if your not satisfied 3 hours in, you can still get added effects from a small booster, I'd say.


50 Mg was a good dose for me personally. I did also add ketamin though.

I've never done k before, so I'm not sure what that would add. What kind of duration am I looking at? I'm wondering because AL is supposedly a subtle psych, and I may want to add to it if I feel underwhelmed. I do like an immersive experience. I was thinking maybe a medium sized dose of 4-HO-MiPT could really add to the headspace and provide some visuals. I'll still probably just take the AL alone for the first time. I'm just trying to figure out what's what. Thanks!

My advice, just do it! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) start with 35 mg, if it's not enough at +3 hours, add 20 MG.


Wise of you to not add another drug first time you try it. I did add ketamine the first time though, but I felt comfortable doing that.


good luck, and report back ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The last post is absolutely true. Don't let your cat experiment this way because it may pose a threat to itself and others. 


My cat likes this with shr_oms


My cat did not like this with vyvanse, 25B-NBOMe, MDAI, ehtylketamine, or MJ

I tried it a few days ago. I took 10mg AL at 6H30 PM, a booster at 8H30 PM , another at 9h30PM, and another at 10PM. Boosters were a little bit less than 10mg. At 10H30PM, I took around 12-15mg 4-Aco-DMT.


While I find 4-Aco-DMT on itself sedating, and have a tendency to blackout on it on larger doses (35mg), I found the combo very stimulating. Usually I like to trip alone in my house, but on this combo, I needed to move. So, I went outside for a walk, with my earphones, and some morning psytrance in it. There are big electric lines near my house (735kV). I watched the wires and it was like a giganstic moving net over me. The poles had crazy dancing colors. Also, the stars were like blue, and a lot brighter than usual. The houses, with X-Mas lights, were like a big cartoon.

It was the first time I had crazy open eyes visuals like this.


But, the comedown was rough, I was able to sleep at 5PM, which is nearly a day after my first AL dose. It felt similar to a speed+E comedown, with being tired, but unable to sleep. Unfortunately, I didn't got any ketamine with me, it would have helped with the comedown, and probably bring back some crazy OEV, like I experienced before in LSD+E+K or E+K combos.

I tried the allylescaline/4-aco-dmt combo, but orally. Heavy trip, with massive open eyes visuals. But the comedown was long and hard. Impossible to sleep for 24h.


Was the comedown easier with snorted drugs?

I snorted near the tail end of the trip to keep it going longer, my initial dose was oral.


Unlike you I couldn't get out of my bed for the whole trip and sleeping was no problem.  I didn't notice any comedown.

Okay, the consensus seems to be that about 40mg is the right dose to take of this chem. That's not the right dose. You should take more than that, unless you just want placebo effects. I took about 110mg last night and allylescaline is definitely a full-blown psychedelic, and a nice one too. Be warned though, it's very nauseating at that dose. It made me throw up. 


**Take at least 100mg, this thread is like a thread about LSD where people dismiss LSD because they only took 40ug.**

Is that like saying caffeine isn't very stimulating becuase people are only having 100mg though? 


Dosing is generally a balancing act attempting to ensure that the optimum ratio of positive:negative effects is reached, and even from your enthusiastic report it sounds like you've overshot the "sweet spot"?


It seems to me like allylescaline is just a low intensity drug at its sweet spot. Nothing wrong with that.

 Please do write a trip report about this experience. I've put AL in longterm storage after few experiments. It was quite nice but not nice enough to keep me enchanted. So you're sure it's worth going beyond 100mg? I wouldn't have to see much more action than with, say, 70mg. I was under the strong impression AL's dose response curve isn't linear, and may be even described as logarhythmic.

I would say that a higher dose of allylescaline will result in more desired effects and more side effects, linearly.


Also a 100 mg dose would be sure to cause uncomfortable side effects in some people, while also being a comfortable average dose for others.  This drug has a variable dose for different people, just like every other psychedelic.  I normally have a very high tolerance to psychedelics but 40 mg allylescaline felt like a nice psychedelic/ecstasy-ish type trip, and not only that but made 4-ACO-DMT finally 'work' on me!  I took 4-ACO-DMT some many hours into the trip, and I finally felt what that drug should feel like, in a sense.


Just a guess, but I bet that allylescaline would be a great combo with any non-stimulating tryptamine, like 4-ACO-DMT.

Well, I thought it was worth it. I'm not sure if others would agree though. For what it's worth, it was one of the better trips I've had, even with the side effects. 


Umm, I'm not sure how people write those detailed trip reports. I have a really hard time just writing a full sentence with pen and paper when I'm tripping. And afterwards, it's hard for me to remember what was happening, like I woke from a dream. I can try to write one, from what I remember.


I weighed about 110mg (scale only measures hundredths of a gram, so I'm not sure exactly)  and swallowed it around 10pm. Around 12, I began to feel shaky, anxious and overstimulated. I decided I would take some clonazepam and atenolol to try and control those irritating stimulant side effects. They probably didn't do much though, because within 10 minutes, I was overwhelmed by nausea and I ran outside and threw up. 


That is the point where it really began to take effect. After I finished washing my mouth out, I started to feel very high and euphoric. I was fascinated by things in the room, especially our fish tanks and my phone. It seemed like that room/moment had a perfect mix of nature and technology, set up to make us happy. It was overwhelmingly beautiful, to see the fish just swimming in their tank on one hand, and this awesome invention on the other.


My brother wanted to watch a show on netflix, and I stressed that it had to be something positive, because I have serious problems with depression, and didn't want some dark or violent show upsetting me and ruining the trip. The show was fine, but it didn't work out too well, because my memory was a bit too messed up to keep track of the dialogue. But it was really funny to me because of how ridiculous the interactions between the people on the show were. We turned it off after about 10 minutes because it was confusing me too much, and decided to just listen to music and talk. 


At this point I got really fixated on a bunch of psychological and philosophical ideas, and started thinking and talking about them with my brother. This went on for hours, because if a word came up, it was like there were infinite trains of thought that radiated out from that original idea, and I'd immediately start running down one of them as soon as I thought about it.


Around this time, I had some minor OEVs, there was a screen or grid of dim light that covered my vision for an hour or two, and occaisonally there were flashes of multicolored light. My hearing was altered for a while too, things sounded like they had some kind of delay filter on them.


Towards the beginning of the trip, my legs felt rubbery and my hands and feet were freezing cold. I personally wouldn't go too much higher than 100mg because of that. Also, it makes it very hard to sleep, even hours after it wears off. So, I wouldn't plan on doing much of anything the next day.

I'm guessing it would go fine with LSD too. I'd be more wary of combining it with MDMA, although I'm pretty sure that AL doesn't really cause any release or reuptake inhibition of serotonin. Chances of SS are pretty slim, I'd say. But who knows really? Thread carefully, it's uncharted territory.

I have experimented with AL a few times in the ranges of 30-90 mg, all in separate, spaced out by several weeks, occasions.


The sweet spot for me seems to be around 75mg, if I am not going to mix it with something.  This seems intense enough to not feel like I want anything else.


However, around 30mg for me is still noticeable, and adds a nice background effect where one still feels very capable of conversing.  At this dosage I have also (on separate occasions) mixed various 2c-x and 25x-nbome usually also including mxe without any obvious side effects.


Overall, I thought AL was going to be very underwhelming, but its quite nice, and have not really had any huge side effects besides feeling antsy when it begins.

Nice report though, captures the essentials I think. Looks like it's been an awesome trip too.

I did put 21mg of AL in my nose around 15 minutes ago. Wow, this stuff burns a lot for a few minutes.

Can anyone comment on how much is necessary for some nice strong visuals? I plan on testing around 1-3mg as an allergy test, then doing 30-40mg. But a few replies back it was said around 100mg is needed for nice psychedelic effects. I'd like a very visual and immersive experience.

I'm not sure if this is the right drug if you're looking for strong visuals. It's quite pleasant and all, but not an intense experience at any reasonable dose. Better off with a couple of foot of San Pedro IMO.

Yeah it seems that way from the replies...But it also seems that people may be simply under dosing it. How safe does this compound feel to you guys? Any nasty cardio/vasoconstriction effects? I feel like around 120-150mg this compound may do what everyone is wanting it to do... **Please note I'm not suggesting anyone dose that high** just food for thought that the general dosing has been on the low side. Being a mescaline analogue and all, shouldn't it need a bit more than say 40mg? Just an assumption, I don't know shit about chemistry really.


In either case, has anyone tried this with LSD? I think that would be a particularly interesting combo.

I've only tried it a handful of times, with doses from 30 to 55mg. I got pretty bad cramping and nausea with the higher doses and haven't wanted to push it any farther. I suspect that's why no one else has gone that high either.

Took 60mg each person with a guy friend and 2 girl friends (4 of us total)


The girls said they wished they had taken a little less. We had to leave the dubstep show because the one girl was extremely uncomfortable around people. The guy said he felt fucking amazing and was having a great time. I didn't feel very intense effects, although I had/have a tolerance for such types of drugs. They dropped me off at home where I fell asleep during the trip. They said that they had a much better time tripping amongst the three of them at their place.


Felt like a low dose of mda to me, honestly, without the intense rolling feeling. Euphoria, light stimulation, and brighter colors and (barely) some tracer effects.


Everyone said it tasted exactly like 2c-e. I wouldn't know because I never took 2c-e.


Seems to affect females more than males. But that could have just been in this one case. 


Hope this information helps somebody somewhere. Cheers!


Wait.... Now that you say this I remember I did take a hit of LSD when I took my 60mg I just talked about in the last post! However I can't really say how it was because like I said I had a very light trip... Tolerance... Need to take a long break from everything and I am.


It was a good time though, just don't think the hit of acid was very strong and the allyl wasn't very strong for me in particular.


Blah

If you'd read the thread, you would see that people already tried high doses. Just one page back there's this post, for instance.

I took about 110mg last night and allylescaline is definitely a full-blown psychedelic, and a nice one too. Be warned though, it's very nauseating at that dose. It made me throw up.

Actually, if *you* had read the thread, you'd see I referenced the guy who dosed 100mg already. I actually said it on this very page, not even one back. Now that's gotta be embarrassing for you.

Anyone plugged this? 

Mixed with 4-aco-dipt?

Mixed with an empathogen? (Most likely one of the PBs or MDMA)

I really doubt there's any chance of SS with this.  I also really doubt it will help the AL trip at all.

**Trip report, 60mg allylescaline**


I just posted a fairly detailed trip report on an experience with 60mg allylescaline. You can read the report [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/694058-(Allylescaline-60mg)-(Cannabis)-First-Time-Tripping-In-The-Background).

We do not condone giving animals drugs (except any that they medically require and a licensed vet has suggested), and do not allow its discussion here. I assume you're more likely just doing the whole "say I'm feeding my animals drugs" to avoid self-incrimination thing - that's also against the rules here at Bluelight, doesn't protect you in any way from the law, and just makes posts confusing and silly.

So I did this chem a while back at 70mg and had some uncomfortable body effects (TR on page 8 if you care), but nothing awful. Now 2 people have said that doses >100mg get it to real psychedelic territory. 


Well I've noticed that some drugs have a 'DO NOT WANT' zone in between two different sweet spots. For instance I like 4-AcO-DMT at 25-30mg, or 50+mg. anything between 30 and 50 is too much to be fun (get bad body load and am too fucked to do any activities), but not enough to blow my mind. Ketamine is the same IMO. I love doing little bumps of K to just throw some depth into a psych, and I love K-holing. But in between there is a realm of straight Mongdom that I think is just a waste of time. Salvia is another example IME of a drug that feels awful at low doses and yet is ineffable at breakthrough doses. 


Now I'm not suggesting anyone try this, but what If we're all approaching this wrong? What if 30-50mg is the fun zone. 50-80ish mg is DNW and then past 100mg the body load becomes irrelevant next to the psychedelia. Maybe 150mg would be remarkable and we just haven't been willing to push it. It will probably be a 'Caution: Vomit Unavoidable' trip (a la Ayahuasca). But it might be worth it.

I hope someone has the strength of genitals to try this at some point. But maybe I'm just wishing pathetically for a real Mescaline analogue.

Based on my experience with this compound, I think it would be safe at those levels for someone with a regular sensitivity to it.

How did MAL Stand up to the test?

Mescaline test, i keep checking the big and dandy MAL section. 

I think people are just too scared to give'r a spelunk. 


I really wanna try it

AS i am one of those people who finds 100mg of AL Not that visual and no more affluent in terms of synesthesia and sound enhancement than lets say ... 35mg of 4-aco-dmt.

Which can be really awesome.

This compound was just placed on [this list](http://www.fhi.se/Tillsyn/Klassificering/Substanser-under-utredning-infor-framstallan-om-klassificering-som-narkotika-eller-halsofarlig-vara/) in Sweden. It does not mean it is illegal to possess, yet; as some compounds have been on this list waiting to be scheduled for 2 years (they're just overwhelmed by the new RCs and can't keep up the pace). On the other hand this means that if they can't arrest you, police and customs still may seize (...steal!) your legal goods and destroy them.

Saw this for sale a lil while back. I think I'd rather have some mescaline.

Well that kinda goes without saying doesn't it. But the question remains; is there a reason for Allylescaline to stick around separate from Mescaline?

This is what i don't get.

mescaline is a rather uncomfortable PEA for the initial come up.

Allylescaline, i find alot like 4-aco-dmt, almost un-noticeable until a high dose is taken.


I know MAL is available, can anyone in the AL board make a comparative to how it is vs MAL

I'm interested in getting several grams, and i want the one that resembles mescaline the most.


Proscaline to me, was just... devoid of character... 

AL is like 4-aco-dmt

MAL sounds appealing. But it could have nasty side effects.

CPM i think is where it is at.

I actually found out I still have like 30-40mg of this stuff left in my stash box that I forgot about. Might have to plug that as an experiment. Doesn't seem like that ROA has been thoroughly explored. And if it's not that strong, I have plans for a massive combo trip. I could use that Allylescaline dose as a platform to high dive into a 4-AcO-MET & MXE trip ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

As someone with experience with AL and 4-AcO-MET (thought not combined) I agree with the combo plan.  I combined it with 4-AcO-DMT though.

I have done that combo as well. But in low doses of both. Like 50mg AL oral and then 10mg 4-AcO-DMT insufflated at around t+2:00 This would be a much more— shall we say 'balls deep?' experience.

I tried Allylescaline only one time last New Years Eve combined with 4-aco-dmt. If I recall it was 50mg Ally & 30mg 4-aco-dmt.  I remember having rediculous fine muscle tremors throughout the experience. It was actually a bit embarrassing trying to take a ciggarette out because my hand was shaking so bad. During the peak I recall being really impressed with how the Ally bumped up the 4-aco-dmt visuals. I felt like Allylescaline was kind of boring on its own but got very interesting after downing the 4-aco-dmt. This stuff is probably best combined with a tryptamine. I wonder how safe this stuff would be with MDMA? My guy instinct says probably not.

Synthetic or extracted. Or the brew lol? Allyescaline is fucking fun at low doses and lasts for ages. Indeed the come down is gradual but looong lasting. It's gentle at low doses and mixes well with low dose 2ce. Mesc really ain't all that mind fuck unless you do a lot of it. 400 mg at least of hcl crystal extracted probably 90% pure (good enough in my book and I can't be assed doing more purification). Yellowish/brown crystals. Usually skin say 2-3 foot  of cacti for maybe a gram of rough extracted HCL salt in the end. Probably shit tek but meh...


 Allyesc I find no drama up to say 40-50 mgs up your nose. Burns worse than most 2cs though. Never done more than 50 mg snorted up me nose and fuck did it hurt but it got me to a nice place that was worth the pain IMO. Unlike real mesc I do not puke. Even crystal extract mesc makes me purge at least a bit. Never come across synthetic mescaline that was the genuine article. Funny as fuck have not seen this thread before and I was just ranting about cacti juice. Been ages since I had the pleasure of "Hellyescaline". Note psychedelics do not need to bring about profound revelations or deep spiritual experiences or all that other tossy bullshit, some are just fun.

My experience combining with 4-AcO-DMT suggests the same thing. And Bloodshed seems to agree as well. Perhaps this chem has a future after all as a mixer. I wonder how it would do with LSD which is about equal length.

Hmm I hear proscaline is still quite euphoric and recreational though. I still have some to try but it seems like my very modest sample dried up a bit without me sampling it, I'll have to see if there is even a dose there.

Anyway what I really wanted to say is isoproscaline sounds better than CPM so I think they should make that. Seems about equally difficult to synth.

The tremors don't sound too appealing though, was it the allylescaline, the 4-AcO-DMT or the combination you think?

I'm pretty sure all the tremors were caused by te Ally, 4-aco-dmt has never given me any shakes. It should be noted that I was the only one in our research group to get the tremors. But I'm telling you it was like I had advanced Parkinson's or something during that trip my hands and legs were just trembling for hours. I had NO other negative side effects and as bad as those muscle tremors were it hasn't stopped me from wanting to try it again. Also, the Ally/ 4-aco-dmt combo so utterly magnificent (except for the shakes) really impressive visuals at the peak that were nothing like the typical 4-aco- dmt visuals.

I had tremors and other body troubles on this chem. Granted that was at 70mg. But I definitely felt like (for lack of a better description)  there was a chemical pulsing , electrically charged, in my whole body.

I've been thinking of making a purchase just as a platform for amazing combos for quite some time now, kinda like how I use aMT but these reports of tremors are keeping me away, especially with the main combo that got me interested (psilacetin/AL). Will magnesium or low dose benzos be effective in cutting down these tremors? I'd like to not feel like I'm on the verge of a seizure for 10+ hours...

I've had nearly identical tremors in my legs from 4-ho-mipt and 4-aco-dipt. The only real difference on the Allywas I had the shakes in my hands as well. It was kinda embarrassing but it was not so bad that I won't ever try it again. I'm actually looking forward to it but it would very infrequent. No one wants to a jittery mofo while their tripping balls if they can help it.

You got similar tremors from iprocin and miprocin alone or with the AL combo? The only 4-sub thay gave me tremors was 4-ho-det and while they weren't intense they added to the paranoia and made the already lacking trip downright uncomfortable. Don't strong tremors indicate that your seizure threshold has been lowered? I honestly fet that if I would've smoked a ciggarette on that 4-ho-det trip I would've seized. If so I figure that a low dose benzo may bring the seizure threshold back up while the magnesium gets rid of the tension. Idk, I still might pick it up within the next couple paychecks and do some combo experiments after a single 40mg AL trip.

I seem to get leg tremors from the cone up on 4-ho-mipt on its own and really crazy leg tremors through most of the trip on 4-aco-dipt. I've only ever tried Ally one time and that was with 4-aco-dmt.  Despite those Parkinson's like tremors the rest of the trip was pretty damn magical and I agree that Ally like Proscaline and Escaline probably suck by themselves but are almost meant to be combined with a tryptamine. Just magic if you don't mind shaking like Michael J Fox for a few hours.

RecievedReceived my  my bathcbatch of of allyscalineallyaecaline todqytoday, phone is messinfmessing up! !


Stupid phone. On my iPad now, but will be a bit slower.


Got my shipment of 250mg off the stuff today, waiting for a good day outside and will be giving 80-100mg a shot I think from all the reports. May do an allergy test at 20mg to start with.


lol i have no idea how much i've ingested, all i can say is that essentially i'm fucking loving it. it feels like i'm in a cartoon. it's very light orientated - the pinks are beautiful on this compound. music isn't that interesting, frankly it's just something in the background while i trip in this cartoonish manner. i want to take more because i literally have no idea how much I've taken, but all i can say is that its fucking wonderful.


as for the muscle tremors, i literally can't even read it, it makes me laugh way too much. i dunno wtf you took but it clearly wasn't this, no muscle tremors whatsoever. i'm laughing just writing that out. i'm continuing to laugh while typing this sentence. 


it feels like i've taken mescaline to be honest. frankly i wouldn't be surprised if id ended up with a load of synth'd mescaline. 


nausea whenever i take a "dab" at whatever is in that bag, which usually goes away within 2 hours or so... but oh my god i want to throw up. 


the only thing that annoys me is this slight muscle tension i get for the come up phase - or what i think is the come up, because i seem to be dosing again again rofl. wow this stuff is beautiful. LETTERS ARE COLOURS AND TEXT IS FUCKED UP LOL


all i can say is wow. everything is like a cartoon. letters and words take on colours (synthaseia or whatever?) pink is very nice too. i wanna take some more. it's like that psychotic come up is moorish in some fucking devilish manner!?


OK I'm going to try and describe the trip:


very cartoonish, very happy, it's like wearing those glassesBUT IM NOT


MY AIRCONDITIONER IS MAKING SOME FUCKING WEIRD NOISE I WANT TO BREAK IT IM NOT SURE IF IT MADE THOSE NOISES TO BEGIN WITH OR IM JUST TRIPPING NUTS, BUT ITS COOL AND WEIRD. no I'm definitely tripping nuts because the noises tend to evolve into something else.


theres definitely some strange psychotic twist to this stuff that i'm LOVING, but hating at the same time

just feeling nauseous as hell right now, probably due to the fact i've eaten my way through about 200mg of the stuff tonight. STILL GOING STRONG.


PLEASE NOTE: this compound is definitely not a "beginners" psychedelic. i can imagine some people going completely nuts after taking this stuff, there's such an overwhelming visual element to it that it borders on psychotic - i'm only comfortable with this territory because i've been there whilst on other drugs.... 


but literally, taking 30mg!? what the fuck man that would do fuck all.

Yes i understand muscle tension. i typically experience that hellishly whilst racking up another line of alpha-php, but this stuff clearly is nowhere near as bad.


literally everyone thats essentially been micro dosing, take your dose and literally x3 = where the fun is at.


however i had taken 200mg of bk-2c-b prior to dosing my ally, it really lacks in the stimulatory department thats all i can say. you need to find some kind of safe-ish chemical to stimulate you otherwise you'll find yourself couch locked/bed locked but you feel restless. i would suggest taking some bk-2c-b prior to ingesting this stuff but that sounds dangerous on paper, but from my perspective its not whatsoever

this is one of the most fun chemicals I've had the pleasure of taking frankly. it's literally got exactly the same effects as mescaline in my opinion. no it doesn't cause fucking parkinsons LOL, and I've not had the please/displeasure??? of experiencing any muscle tremors, just fucking nausea whenever i redose. however my 250mg bag is running empty and i fear that moment when it runs out because i'm literally having so much fun.


like the whole synthasea I've never experienced before, however, on this stuff yup. i dunno if thats due to the fucking intense visuals or whatever, but words take on colours. letters are associated to colours. 


lol my whole fucking visual spectrum is so fucking betwixt at the moment - i have no idea anymore BUT I REALLY HAVE TO ADD, THIS IS NOT A FUCKING "FIRST TIME PSYCHADELIC EXPERIENCE" COMPOUND. this is literally the most visual thing I've taken, i don't even need music - it would be cool i guess, but it would just be background noise, i get so immersed with the visuals. they are really intense - at times bordering on psychotic, like i noted before. however i've been to that territory before so i know how to handle it, but i can imagine someone getting really fucking edgy etc. if they're not really experienced in... not even the psychedelic aspect, but i suppose you've kind of had to experience stimulant psychosis on some degree or level in order to remain sane while tripping nuts on this stuff.


at times I've found that it can get very fucking weird in terms of the visuals, hence why i'm coming back to my computer regularly as i find it keeps me somewhat in check, or it just distracts me from the visual fuckery that has become my world. in small doses. then i come back. then i go back out and explore the fuckery. not to say that the visuals have dissipated while typing this, they just take on a different edge aka my words just warp quite profusely, it's not hard to type, but i don't like looking at what i've just written because it fucking warps and takes on colours, words start becoming colours and whatnot, the spacing between words, letters, fuck i dunno everything is just fucked lol. and I'm having tactile rainbow colours appearing out of nowhere - which i like.


like literally i could see this being a complete disaster for someone who was expecting "LSD", though why you'd associate these two i don't know. but literally i can just imagine it being a total fucking disaster of an experience for someone not ready to accept that they are going to be brutally visually fucked, in a beautiful way.


literally 0 introspection whatsoever, when i think about things its normally just along the lines of wow my wall has a new face, or kind of pondering whether or not to take more lol. and literally for me, parkinsons guy made the whole experience a lot more entertaining, but I've been giggling a lot at random shit. however nothing comes close to IMAGING SOME GUY LITERALLY TREMORING and displaying fucking parkinsons disease at a super low dose, I LITERALLY CANT COMPREHEND WHAT THE LIVING FUCK WENT WRONG FOR YOU LOL, IT MUST HAVE BEEN SUCH A DISSAPOINTMENT, BUT I CANT STOP LAUGHING AT YOUR MISFORTUNE


however i think it does have to be combined with something stimulating. like i said i took 200mg of bk-2c-b about.... 12? i dunnno quite a while ago which is wearing off, it wore off about 2 hours ago or so, i say this because i noticed my pupils were no longer the size of fucking dinner plates which i attribute to the bk-2c-b. so I'm searching for something to fill that void. i did a line of alpha-php but it messed with the trip quite a lot, however, it lasts a longish time so i hope it keeps me stimmed out for a little bit.


like i highly recommend the combo to anyone. because the bk-2c-b is kinda trippy but its not really, like it lacks on so many departments, most notably the visual one. and the allyescaline adds to the journey beautifully in my opinion. i wish i had more bk-2c-b but unfortunately i don't.


I'm literally tempted to throw some aMT to the fire, but i seriously don't think thats a good idea with it being an MAOI and all. i have 3-4,ctmp on hand, but it doesn't add anything psychedelic and I'm running out of allyescaline quickly. thats why some more bk-2c-b would be ideal right now, but i don't have it. literally so tempted to throw some aMT into this fire. but i know thats a terrible idea ON PAPER


frankly the whole redosing thing just adds a different dimension to the visuals each time i dose up. I'm not sure what exactly, but it does.

get off the computer and enjoy our trip then! You should also know by now that everyone reacts differently to every chemical so laughing at someone else's bad reaction to a drug is just idiotic. Plus you mentioned you also took bk-2c-b and alpha-php so your attempt at describing the affects of allylescaline are sort of meaningless not to mention you said you want to add Amt? Bad idea imo, just enjoy the experience for what is is this far to avoid any ill effects you might get.. or you might find that just as hilarious as the parkinsons type symptoms that ballz_trippington got. 8(

Perhaps, on the other hand perhaps it will provide a characterization of high dose/abuse of this stuff.  Certainly I will scrub some of them out though.

Maybe I'm the exception to the rule, but I've never lost my shit like that even on "heroic" doses of psychedelics. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy getting fucked up. But even with copious amounts of alcohol, I keep my composure, easily have deep and complex conversations without being an idiot. 

Shit, even on 125mg of MXE the worst I get is having trouble finding the right word while saying the odd sentence.  If any drug turned me into what this guy was like then I just wouldn't do them.

Sometimes it seems like bluelight is flooded with people who are on so much shit (that they often don't mention, like benzo's which can make it possible to take massive doses like its nothing) that it skews the average... when your looking for dose information.


People that go on about how 100mg 4-aco-dmt is a normal dose or 60mg is "weak" etc.  I used to be on klonopin for years and I posted a bunch of crazy reports too with high doses of stuff... now that i'm off everything and rarely trip, REGULAR NORMAL doses of things work NORMALLY (like, 20-25mg 4-aco-dmt is perfect, would never ever take 40mg).  I notice normal doses work similarly to other normal sober people too.. doses WAAAY lower than most of what is said on bluelight nowadays.  People on here talk about 50mg 2c-e like its normal when its NOT - your tripping too damn much or taking 20 other drugs on top of it... 


So after reading a lot of reports on allylescaline i would guess that normal doses are more like 20-35mg and not what a lot of people are saying on here (i'm trying to decide if it seems worth the money / enough doses for a certain amount of money).  Its hard to tell these days with everyone overdoing EVERYTHING... LOL ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Hey glad I saw these last posts...

Indeed I do get tremors too. Not so much like parkinson's- but more like muscle spasms...Parkinson's are quite at a regular rythm tremor, while these aren't.

I get it on 4-aco-dmt and 5-meo-dalt relatively normal doses (20mg max). If I move around I'm fine but if I try to seat down and relax...well...it's like those spams when you're falling asleep and they wake you up...bzzzzzd ...like being zapped! Small electrical charges...straight from the central nervous system...specially affecting the legs. I believe that is due to neuro-receptors over-load. But it wears off when the chemical balance is re-established. No long lasting effects for me. But i know what you mean...it can be really unpleasent...a bit like hiccups.

Anyway...this is an ok coumpond...It isn't extremly trippy but to be honest not very interesting at 20 mgs dose. I felt the duration was long like a drunk stimulation , slighty tripy and ok. but it feels a bit sick on the body. Like being drunk.

**first time with ally**


Last night i was able to test 50mg ally with a 4-aco-DMT kicker at 3 and 5 hours in, 20mg and 30mg respectivily.


the  first 3 hours were plesant, very mild and not really what i was looking  for but very enjoyable very 2c-Xish. filled those hours with music and then a nice  walk, the music was fun and just flowed together without any thought each mix a journey of its own. its hard to remember the ally on its own but do know that i liked  the body load and the mental aspects, good therapy tool perhaps. i feel  that more ally is needed to really tap into its beauty. once we took the  first dose of 4-aco-DMT it only took about 10 minutes to kick in, and  that is when everything went nuts and the visuales both open and closed  eyed were intense. the combo is special and was what i was looking for,  and will for sure do again. not sure i have the dosage down but will  enjoy the journey to finding it. the come down from the 4-aco-DMT was  pleseant and really brought something out in the ally that really  sparked my interest to do some more research.

Don't worry, the feeling is more than mutual. 

I never compared alcohol to psychedelics. I was making a point that I can keep my composure while still getting very fucked up on most substances including alcohol. Sorry if you can't. 

You may very well have Allylescaline! Chances are you do. However, drugs affect every differently. YMMV! 

It's pretty ridiculous to expect every person who takes a substance to have the exact same reaction as you did.  I've done 4-AcO-DMT over 100 times usually @ 40-60mg and have never gotten the slightest tremor. The only time I combined it with Ally I got very intense muscle tremors that came on mostly during the peak. No one else that took the Ally that night got any tremors at all.

You got no tremors at all from 4-aco-DMT? Wow, I get tremors from all tryptamines, pretty bad ones actually, which is one of the reasons why I haven't done them for a while. When I tried allylescaline I didn't really like it much. Made me feel pretty sick and wasn't even enjoyable. Never tried it again after the first 10 mg. Why would I when it made me feel like crap? That's one of the things I chucked out. I've also heard of people dying on it, though I don't know the details. Might have been a bad batch or something. That is odd though that you only ever got tremors from that combination. I've also read that it causes intestinal contractions, as does mescaline for that matter. The thought of it just kind of creeps me out. Well, on that note, enjoy your allylescaline, everybody!

Well, apparently this one is very weak....   My friend bought 100mg (got 122mg) and today I first IMed about 18mg... then later IMed more maybe another 20-25mg.  Nada... nothing.   I thought for a while I was seeing brighter colors... and I had one 'chill' (the good kind, like a norepinephrine type thing) but i'm home now its only been like 4-5 hours and nada.. nothing at all.


I did binge on a lot of 4-AcO-MET 2 days ago though... so that is probably why ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Probably not the way you're doing it. Your doses were vey small, considering the minimum active doses of this drug are around 50mg. And, besides that, taking 18mg and then taking another 20-25mg later in the same day is a good way to make sure you don't feel it at all...

frankly the dosage needs to be pushed to the limits with this stuff, I've taken 250mg of it, and i just feel wonderful, everything is beautiful, its just like mescaline along with the horrific need to purge everything in your guts


its quite a forgiving compound in my experience, i feel as though i could take this and just go on about a day with a huge grin on my face type thing... along with the colours and heaving up rainbow vomit along the way

I'm hearing massive variation in reported dosages here. 50mg threshold? Meanwhile all of the trip reports on erowid indicate a 20-30mg dosage. I already know to expect that synthetix will have pushed the dose to the max, of course.


I'm considering picking this up alongside a few other items from a vendor that seems to be stocking it at a decent price. If I could take 30-40mg or so and get a "full" (though I know this one is supposed to be inherently mild) experience, I'd be fairly happy with the price-point, but quite frankly it's just not worth it to me if I need 100mg to feel satisfied.


Any thoughts?

I'm going to order this, i don't want to be biased when it comes to phenethylamines after only trying 25c-NBOMe which was definitely visual but THAT's it. 

I've heard mescaline being describe as intense but gentle/therapeutic. Would this be true for Allylescaline?

there is great variation in dosages also because some people reporting on it are doing it with tolerance and not mentioning it. it would alwqys be wise to read up nore than a few posts and start really low - better to risk not tripping at all than anything dangerous.

So this Friday I titrated up 6mg at a time over the course of two hours, to a total of 24mg. Very ligh effects--the "visuals" were mostly that fuzziness I tend to get on emphathogens, and a slightly high-contrast/cartoony look the the world, resembling doc. 


It was mildly languid/sedating, fairly pro-social, not significantly "trippy" thought-wise at least in comparison to tryptamines or lysergamides. I felt a mild body high, and a barely detectable stomache discomfort--thought at this dosage it was actually a "discomfort," 


All in all, it felt like a low dose (~1mg or so?) of DOC, except with less body load. 


I did like it, but it didn't particularly differentiate itself. Maybe next weekend or the weekend after, I'll try it at a higher dosage, and possibility in some combinations. 


I'm thinking DOC would be a good drug to dose concurrently with it, while either 4-aco-dmt, 4-aco-met, or 4-ho-mipt would be good drugs to take a few hours into the experience for a truly psychedelic peak. 


Outside of combinations, I think this might be a good drug to take for "chill" nights. Ie. hanging out with friends, but not looking to go out partying, get shitfaced, or lose myself in confusing psychedelia.

I believe 24mg is a very low dose, especially when it was taken in 4 6mg increments (where tolerance will play a factor).  I would try a good bit higher next time, or at least take 24mg all at once.  And work up from there.  Though the 200+mg that some are reporting are probably way excessive and due to tolerance, I have a feeling this one doesn't start to shine until 60mg+.

I agree that 24mg is low. I was titrating up at first for safety concerns (this vendor also sells nbomes and 2c-x chemicals, and then to see how the high scaled. I also was at a family gathering and didn't want to "legitimately" trip. 


However from what reports I've heard, it seems to take as long as 3 hours to reach it's peak, so I imagine that toerance--while relevant--might not have played as much of a factor as it could have. 


I did enjoy the chemical, and plan to try it from maybe ~40mg next time. I'm worried about starting too high for the sake of nausea--I heavily dislike nauseas body loads.

Hey !!!! I have tested this compound twice and this is my report ! (English is my second language so i cant do a full report without help) (feel free to corect me in pm)


First of all i really love this drug: very fun, long-lasting and a lot of positive vibe and laughter)


My first trip was 50 mg 1 hours after a good meal (with a little redosing of maybe 5-6 mg)  with 3 of my best friend at my home with beer (6-8 each), weed , black metal music play on my turntable on fast-forward (hahaha) , dark wood and candle .

We start around 7:30 pm. at 9:00 pm we were already tripping. No nausea or body load or any bad effect except the fact that i have only sleep 2-3 hours this night. Dark wood and extreme music was totally awsome. Perfect trip ^^

The following week was really nice and i was feeling that i was more positive in my life.


My second trip was 100 mg 15 min after my meal (3:00pm) at a local underground metal ''fest'' with beer (a lot) , and some speed later (9:00-2:00am) (waste of speed imo,) The result was fun, euphoric with more distorded visual, the loud music and party vibe of the place was very cool, i was very social and my mind was clearer that normal, no bad feeling or nausea or body load (my leg was a little heavier than normal) some strange effect at the end (the mix with the speed, alcohol and the Seroquel for sleeping was a bad idea) At 4:00 am i wanted to sleep because i wanted to be able to drive the next day... so what happened is when i close my eye to sleep : i see white spark, after 30 min of white spark i was able to sleep but not a normal sleep: each time i close my eyes i immediatly fall in a vivid dream !! After 30-45 min of confusing dream i open my eye and think ''I was sleeping of not ?'' i close my eye again and another vivid awake dream, 30-45 min later i open my eyes and ask the same question, ''i was sleeping or not ?" and this continue for the next 8-10 hours, when i finally ''woke-up'' i was feeling good, a little fucked up because of this crazy experience but no mental or physical bad effect.


Next time ( in 1 or 2 week) i will try 130 mg at my house with my best friend again (3-4), i love this rc so much, When you trip you can ask yourself deep question that normally you dont like to think about (feeling and stuff like that) and i know that can sound weird but the experiance made me love myself and my life more...


Have a nice trip !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Tried 30mg IMed a couple days ago after I woke up in the morning.  I didn't expect much considering the last time I tried it nothing happened (but i had a tolerance from a trip 2 days before) but it kicked in within 5-10 minutes.  I didn't really think it felt any better body-wise than methallylescaline.. less visuals.  I wasn't loving the way I felt so I didn't dose any more although it seemed IM is a good way to administer these (immediate comeup).  Mixed a little 4-aco-dmt later and it seemed to overpower the AL (totally changed the body feeling to 4-aco-dmt until that wore off).  I have about 75mg left for some other time.  


Think I preferred MAL.


Neither one of these mescaline analogs gives me that wonderful mescaline color enhancement where everything gets colored like i'm in Arizona or some desert (browns, greens, etc).  I haven't taken mescaline in years but I remember it had great color enhancement.

Yeah mescaline's color enhancement is absolutely wonderful... bright oranges, reds, browns, greens, and it seems I can determine subtle differences in shades with much greater acuity.

Just got a 115 mg sample and of this stuff I snorted about two thirds of it so far and i feel it but its by no means worth the money I mean I'm buzzing but not very hard and theres no visuals at all, all in all I think this shit isn't that great I'm kinda interested in methallylescaline though anybody got any recommendations as far as psychadelics that are a little more bang for the buck.

Ok i geuss I was a little hasty with my last post I'd only really given it like an hour to come on I'd say u should give this stuff a good two hours still no crazy visuals but def a killer buzz goin on granted I dosed on the high end but I would totally take back my last comment that its not worth the money

**allyescaline "AL"**


love this substance


16:30 25mg

1730: noticing it....very mild, but very nice...great headspace, mild visuals persisting through now (T+4 hours)


lovely lovely the old friend I've been missing for sure! 


I could be around anyone on this....going to double the dose next time, seeing as what i have read says the dose response curve is not that sharp

I guess you shouldn't start a new thread just to say this, bro. The idea is: new subject --> new thread, and we`ve already got this one: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/553393-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Allylescaline-Thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/553393-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Allylescaline-Thread)


That said, I am definitely interested in this substance. Its on my cart already!

Could you, please, detail your experience a little more? 25mg seems like a low dose, since people usually report doses around 50mg (right?).

Were there any side effects? This seems to be the biggest problem with mescaline analogs.

The two (methallylescaline and allylescaline) don't seem that similar to me. Even at 60mg allylescaline just seems to cause tracers while methallylescaline lasts so much longer and causes full-blown geometric overlay/underlay onto vision. Allylescaline is great imho but people seem to want too much from it. It seems to have that potential to be fully psychedelic at high doses but as this happens its more interesting empathic qualities break down and it becomes somewhat generic. Maybe the opinion could be adjusted later but it is as it is for now. 35 mg is fine; just recreation no revelation.

also I've decided this one I'm done with


I've tried it at 25mg, 50mg, and 70mg


It is just as good at 25mg as it is at 70.......there are mild visuals with both doses, no difference there..more body load at 70, minimal at 25


I will put it away, and maybe in the future i will do it.....but ill stick to 25mg....didnt notice any synergy with it and the 4 sub tryptamines either

Well this stuff is quite awesome. Swim is ripped and totally out to lunch at the moment with 25mg Allylescaline and about 12 mg of 5-meo-mipt. Swim mush say this is san awesome combo. 


Beer spread out accordingly since lunch time 


allylescaline 20-30mg 6 pm


5-meo-mipt 10-15mg at 730pm  


now 822 and feeling quite awesome. very heavy euphoria and jaw tension is present not to bothersome though but still very prominent. music is awesome people are in my house unaware of the experiment and it is the only thing keeping it real. some possible auditory distortions not sure. 


843pm slight visual aspect coming on the floor now. swim has been seeing tracers for awhile now. time is beginning to slow down. 


swim took 1 mg etiz to help with body load it is heavy but awesome just laying down in bed 9pm


1045pm visual is kind of subsiding although its not hard to say. the moxy is defiantly slowing down a little. its hard to say the euphoria is still ridiculously awesome. 


swim does recommend this combo. it is fantastic

Don't use the phrase SWIM, it's not allowed here - it won't help with anything anyway despite what you might think...


Have you been eating this material? It is not clear from the testimony?


I think the etizolam is much more likely to be 'slowing down' your trip than the moxy even if 5-MeO-MiPT usually does not produce that many visuals on its own, it's not a sedative like etizolam is.

This was an interesting compound to try, very colourful even at a low-mediumish dose (32mg Oral) Shame the rest has been given away, would love to give this one another shot at a higher dose. How is the response curve with this one?

Do you think it would be better to try this before diving into a mescaline trip (they would be a few months apart)? I was thinking of analogues for introduction and this seems like a mild alternative to the real thing.

Why? Mescaline is wonderful. If you can get the real thing, get it.

Yeah mescaline is the gentlest psychedelic ever, I can't imagine a bad trip on it.  It would make a great introductory psychedelic really.

Well, yes but I feel that I'd like to do mescaline spiritually in a specific environment. Until then I might try al just to get my feet wet.

If the idea is to get your feet wet, you can definitely do it with mescaline. I haven't tried those analogs yet, but mescaline was one of the most enjoyable trips ever. I don't doubt of its spiritual potential, but I am sure it can easily be an introduction drug. As Xorkoth said, I can't se a bad trip happening here.

Escaline, proscaline, etc,  on the other hand, are much less researched, thus less predictable. That said, I would try mescaline first if I had access to it.

After an "allergy test" yesterday of <1mg, I took a second allergy test today of around 3mg. It might be placebo, but I think I can feel a distant little something, a certain familiar warmth and goodness feeling in my body. Nothing mental or visual that I canpinpoint. Looking forward to testing a proper dose of this at some point.

**The most Zen I've ever been**


I have recently received a samply of Allylescaline and my experience is as follows. 


The most Zen, I've ever been

t+0:00 5mg

t+3:00 5mg


No tolerance expected, one week since last experience (6mg 5-MeO-MiPT)


With this batch of Allylescaline I have:

  Reagent tested, results as expected

  Allergy test at 100-200ug, no noted effect

  Allergy test at 1mg, no noted effect


Today I will be testing 5mg as a further allergy test, with the possibility of taking another 5-10mg a few hours later to push towards a threshold test, if desired


Breakfast of yogurt, toast and coffee at 9:00am


t+0:00 = 9:30am I have weighed out two capsules of 5mg each and another 5mg to be parachuted immediately


t+0:15 Slight excitement noticed, without checking in, slightly sweating palms, already? Unexpected. At this point I keep saying that it is likely 'all in my head'


t+1:00 GF and I have left for our friends house to walk her dogs


t+2:00 Occasionally feeling, alerts? Just a little? I am surprised by this and am starting to check in with myself a little more frequently now. Possibly in my head, possibly not. Either way, I am clear headed, conversational, not acting strange, and having a very nice time


t+2:30 Chill and mellow mindset, calm, but I have noticed that I am starting to experience 'anxious palette', where the roof of my mouth dries out somewhat. I've experienced this occasionally in the past while on Tryps and Phens


t+3:00 Dropped another 5mg. After considering my options, I have committed to attempt a threshold trip and am shelving the other 5mg for now. I am meeting a sober friend for a hike shortly and if the dose response curve is straight with this chem, another 10mg could make me feel a little goofy. Reminding myself that it's ok to take my time getting to know this chemical. Rome wasn't built in a day...


t+3:30 Feeling slightly stimulated. Feeling really good overall, slight palm sweating again, possibly a Phen thing for me?


t+4:00 Very small weed bump (maybe half an inch, packed into the end of a cig. Colours seem kinda fantastic, but considering that the Sun is low, being Winter, it may or may not be related. Cold air is incredibly fresh and I am loving it


I can see how this could become tactile and sexual, but nothing is forced at all


Feels completely like nothing, with a little bit of something...


t+4:15 From what I smoked I should not be stoned, and I'm not, but I do feel the chill of the weed. Feeling very lucid and calm, but never dipping down to baseline. If this is the most that a person could expect from this, than it is enough for me. I feel great. Period. I'll go higher for sure, but this, is a very sweet moment


t+4:30 Becoming more social


Friend has picked me up and we're headed off for our hike. My friend confirms that the Sun is quite normal and that my colour perception is enhanced. He also tells me that I seem to be in a really good mood


t+5:00 Lunch of pasta and potato salads


t+5:30 Arrived at the hike location. Getting out of the car I feel cold and I have a brief moment of 'I don't wanna...', but I realize that this is one of many possible responses to the cold, I put on my touque, pick a new response and off we go. I'm having no real difficulty with the snow and ice, no clumsiness or loss of coordination to speak of


t+6:00 Arrived at the lookout, great view and lots of birds that will land on you and eat right from your hand. I'm possibly a little over excited about this and am having a great time. The hike down is half walked and half slid, so much fun


t+6:30 Once at the bottom of the hike I pack a little weed into a cig. again. Still feeling great


t+7:00 Weed hit has taken this right back up, and possibly further. As we're driving down the mountain I have a slight sense of flying


t+8:30 Weed high seems to be fading somewhat and my eyes are feeling cool and fresh. I am getting so INTO each moment, I occasionally lose track, or at least mind, of where I'm going or what it is that I am doing. Although, as soon as I ask myself what it was I was doing, I remember with ease and clarity


t+9:00 1 cig. Tastes, smells and feels good


The brief thought of sucking the helium out of some balloons I see makes me giggle.


I really seem to have a lot of control around guiding my emotions in whatever direction I want. Very good feeling


t+9:30 Still there, no real drop yet, if there is, it's so subtle that I don't notice it


Am I still feeling it? Getting distracted when I stop to think about it, if I'm not feeling it, I'm definitely still effected by it.


t+10:30 Supper of rice bowl and vegetables


Starting to feel a little tickle in my throat, no idea if it relates


I feel as though my problem solving has increased today, nothing big, just lots of little, simple ideas to make my present moment smoother and easier. Problem presents itself... 'I could just do this... Problem solved.'


t+11:30 I could be at baseline, possibly, but I still feel really good. This could be the tail end or afterglow at this point


I keep feeling excited about this chemical/experience, and I am very excited and encouraged to repeat, at this dose or higher


t+12:00 My eyes are now feeling tired. I feel like I'll sleep well tonight


t+13:30 Just finished a movie, War with Jason Statham and Jet Li. Approx. 11:00PM. Today has been a full and pleasant day


I expect that I will sleep well tonight


t+14:00 Walk and final cig of the day. I could be at baseline, but I don't feel tired/wiped out/tripped out, just satisfied and ready for bed


t+14:30 Bed and quick to sleep


t+22:00 I wake at approximately 7:30am. Slept well, feeling rested and ready to go. No headache/hangover/tiredness. Slightly higher than normal energy level is sustained through the day and I have a very productive day


Reflections and Commentary 

Just prior to my second dose, I might have said that it felt a tiny bit morish. After the second dose, and after I committed to letting today be a chill adventure, the morish sensation seemed to lift. The extra dose? The resolution? Uncertain which might have caused it. All in all a positive experience. I am looking forward to repeated experiments with this chemical


I do not see this as a trip drug, per se, just an overall good feeling. If this was sold in your local drug store, the box would say 'Take this and feel wonderful for the next 12 hours.'


My visuals only consisted of deepened colours and a slight loss of sharpness at distance, but never so much that it became an issue. As my sober companions were driving, I had no problem reading street or highway signs and navigation on my phone was easy


On more than one occasion I commented that the feeling was similar to the beginning of a good beer buzz. A little more alert, an added touch of energy, a good mood boost and an eagerness to do something with friends


There were a couple times that I felt as though this could go to a really sedated place OR a medium to high energy place. I could veg. out on the couch or go for a hike. Either/or seemed to be satisfactory

I would think Allylescaline HCl would be less in effects and different than Methallylescaline HCl because its an added methylated to make it stronger?


wondering why the dosage on these two seem close to the same.  Never done them so no experience, just on paper, research for now

Allylescaline feels different than MAL but they share come up effects and somewhat similar body feel. The required dosage is less for AL, then MAL IMO - I wouldnt want to take more than 45mg of AL because of unpleasant feeling of being strung up and feeling weird, but would do so with MAL.


AL feels very light and transparent but with obvious body effects (may feel as bodily euphoria) and feeling of uneasiness if dosage goes over 40mg. No visuals to speak of for AL, but it does cause the attention to jump differently which may bring some dreamy imagery with eyes closed. IMO AL (usually taken at 30-35mg for this purpose) goes great with a company of friends, beer and a long hike - slightly energizing with good humor, interesting concepts interpretations, all while having an integrity to function fully! %) 

Also I find AL to be a great mixer for 4-sub tryptamines and lysergamides, in the case of a mixer, I use about 15-25mg of it - it extends, "smooths out" the trip and adds to visuals and sense of euphoria IME.


MAL is a lot more psychedelic compared to AL, definitely causes interesting OEVs and CEVs, especially at doses over 40mg. Highest I have tried it was at 75mg - felt like it had anti-cholinergic effects, because I started to really loose my memory and feeling quite disoriented, although had a very beautiful visuals - my every emotion would have a distinct color and it would wash over and paint my whole view, eventually coloring everything, mostly blueish colors with gold and green hues. I find MAL to be a great psychedelic mixer as well, same as with AL, about 15-25mg adds nicely, also like to mix it with AL in 50-50 proportions.


As for why dosages for both are so similar, I'd say it goes for most Mescaline analogs - AL, MAL, E, P, IP, even TMA2, TMA6 and 3C-P. For some it takes a little more, for some less. If you look at the molecule structures of them, you'd see that MAL is very similar to Isoproscaline and AL is similar to Proscaline, interesting...8)

Tried this for the first time yesterday. I was aiming for 50 mg, but accidentally ended up weighing out 65mg into a gelcap and decided to go with that. Come up was slow, first alerts at around the 2hour mark then a slow and gradual ride to higher intensity. It got pretty intense for me, with some mild OEV’s as well. I drank a smoothie containing ginger and coconut water along with my gelcap which I think helped ward off any nausea with the come up. However, at some point the body load got to be fairly uncomfortable which the ginger didn’t help with. 


Lots of electricity coarsing through my body, which caused me to contract and curl my legs to discharge the tension. This went on for hours. Spent a good portion of my trip in bed in an uncomfortable state. At some point decided to do some nitrous which really opened up the doors of full on psychedelia. The nitrous gave me full on OEVs (mostly a brightening of colors but also fractals) as well as some pretty incredible body sensation. At some point however I was precipitated into this really negative state. Felt like I was surrounded by negative energy and malevolent entities that were trying to attach themselves to me. Felt like I was having surgery performed on me. Very hard to shake the feeling.


8 hours from ingestion was still tripping pretty hard. This one has a long peak and long legs. Overall this wasn’t a really pleasant trip all said though it had some good moments too. I think the dosage was too high. Wasn’t particularly visual but strongly psychedelic IME particular on the level of felt-perceptual sensations. I haven’t tripped in months so had no tolerance, so 65mg may be perfectly suitable dose for people who have tripped more recently. I would have enjoyed this more if I stuck to 30-40 mg. Can’t say I’m eager to try this again soon. Though it has potential and I’m unwilling to write it off, I’d rather do a lysergamide. I planned on going for a hike originally but once the trip came on I started to feel a bit weird about being out in public, and so stayed home. The walking would have been nice and might of helped to discharge the tension in my legs. Sleep came without too much diffulty 11 hours after ingestion though I was still tripping somewhat mildly at that point.

Damn... I have had this feeling with multiple substances - it is indeed very uncomfortable. Having a good warm-hearted company heals that problem IME.


**levels**, if willing to repeat, I would recommend to use smaller amounts of AL, preload with Magnesium and perhaps Phenibut, and take some 4-AcO-MET 2-3 hours into the AL experience - I like this combo and had done it numerous times to very hedonistic positive results. Having alcohol is also fun with AL, although normally I don't like drinking.

Thanks Volsam. I really liked your report on this. Yeah, I'm willing to try this again as a mixer where it seems to shine based on accounts. I've heard of using magnesium to combat bodyload before but never tried. I'll be sure to get some next time I trip. Maybe I'll go for a run too before tripping. That was pretty uncomfortable and not eager to repeat. 


Can definitely recommend the ginger; it erased any nausea. Got in the habit of brewing ginger into my San Pedro tea and almost never got sick from that even though the tea alone is gag worthy. 


No phenibut or alcohol for me though. Gave up that stuff a long time ago.

I did about 18-20mg a couple of days ago. About 2 hours for come-up with some anxiety, took a glass of wine to help that. Went the anxiety went away, I laid on the floor a bit with my eyes closed. Music was great, nice inner feeling of joy, warm closed eyes imagery in orange-red colors (particular for me, I'm used to colder blue/green CEVs). I was energized, so I went outside for a while for a long walk. I was feeling great and everything looked new. I got a lot of insight about how and why I am who I am, I learned to accept some things from my past. Got some other pictures from when I was a child that I still have to work on. I went back home, watched a movie and some fishing TV show, ate a bit and went to bed about 9 hours after dosing. I had a small headache early in my trip and was tired a bit the day after but I keep good memories from that trip. 


A great psychedelic in my opinion.

Nice to read your little trip report. Do you have any experience with mescaline or other 'scalines? Would love to hear if you could compare them at all.

I have no experience with mescaline or the other analogues. It is somewhat similar to LSD but easier to manage. You just have to open your eyes and things calm down, no trippy open eyes visuals. No mind fuck like with 4-Aco-DMT, where you can get into loops.


A very healing molecule. If you want crazy visuals and complete ego loss, it's not the right one. But to get some insight and spend a nice evening walking outside and listening to music, it's a good choice.

Not too long ago I bought a fair amount of this to use as an enhancer for other substances, and the other day I went ahead and tried it with some 1cP-LSD.

Dosed 43mg AL, at the 2 hour mark I had 100ug of 1cP. Definitely got me more mileage out of the 1cP. Visuals were on par with perhaps 150-175ug. Added to the body high as well; very warm and sensual, nice phenethylamine energy rushes through the body, very sensual. As Shulgin would say, erotic excellent ![👍](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png)

It was interesting. But not euhporic. Unless it was something that it wasn't supposed to be. But it did cause some changes in my mannerisms. I had 400mg that I ate about 25mg at a time. Mescaline would be nice to try as it might be more euphoric in higher doses.

Yeah, it’s nothing too remarkable on its own, but throwing into a mix seems to “warm things up”, as it were. I certainly didn’t buy it expecting a revelatory substance, nor did I expect it to even hold a candle to mescaline.

I kinda wish we’d see a synth of 3,5-D or 2,6-D… I’d certainly buy some, anyways. Hell, maybe even some 4-D or beta-D. I’d give those a shot too.

It’s still a psychedelic worth trying.

this is the only 5ht2 pea agonist with a 3,4,5-substiutution pattern i had, only thing i remember is that it was more exhaustive than most 2,4,5-substituted 5ht2 agonists i had. nonetheless insteresting in its own.

Went ahead and gave some AL a whirl in combination with 750ug of nasally administered 25B-NBOH at the 3.5 hour mark. And I must say it went very well. 25B is highly visual on its own, but with the AL it was almost off the charts. At the same time, AL brought a depth to the 25B that was typically lacking. Definitely a combo that I’ll explore again, but I have no real desire to push the dose any higher. Not because of any concerns but simply because it was entirely satisfactory right where it was.

I'll be getting a few grams of this very soon, I'm excited as I missed out on it before.  Always thought it sounded lovely and very recreational, and it seems amazing for combos to add something to other psychedelics.

Yeah, I find it incredibly easy-going and warm. I remarked to my partner this last time (before the 25B) that I could certainly enjoy this in a multitude of settings, including a family function at a lower dose, or that it could even shine at mini-doses (perhaps 15mg) for just a pleasant, sparkly stimulation for the day.


But where it has really excelled is in potentiating other substances. I have a decent amount of this stuff, but I’ve found it to be so incredible in combination that I’m seriously considering grabbing another big chunk while it’s still around, as I could see myself using it with a good portion of my trips. Fantastic stuff when it’s used right and when your expectations are in line with what the substance is actually capable of providing.


I’d also recommend preceding AL with some ginger. I forgot this last time, and while I was fine, my partner proceeded to puke her guts out on the come up. She had a rough 45 minutes, lol.


I hope you enjoy the stuff, Xorkoth!

Thanks for the tips. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I am going to end up with 3 grams of it so I'll have plenty to do tons of experiments.  I keep reading about how it's top-notch incredible for combinations.

Took 32mg of this orally today.  About 45 minutes ago.  So far it is absolutely lovely, very good body feeling, light euphoria, and it's clearly still developing.  Gonna go hiking with my girlfriend and her mom.  I am taking notes and plan to write up a report, either a mini report in here or a full report if I feel inspired to.

I was going to take a larger dose but shared with a friend = he took 35mg & I took 65mg which lasted about 13-14hrs. It's a good contender for worst psychedelic IMO; not that it is horrific or anything but offers so little and is nor is it a comfortable day. The chemistry looks psychedelic but I wouldn't really know how to define the effects > 'psychedelic' would be very generous; slight visual effects suggest a psychedelic but none of the mental effects did : "(4hr) Seems to be at full effect; weird wibbly stimulation but with a drained lack of energy. Cognitively no greater clarity or other enhancements. One could interpret this as pleasant but there is no particular euphoric drive."* There was a lot of malaise; the body felt off all day with a bad fried feeling in the head (headache). It is possible that 100mg would have had a bit more interest but I have no interest in ever taking it again. My friend found it ok and 'a bit dreamy' (when it came on he also got a headache and retired to bed). He seemed to have got the same effects at 35mg as I got at 65mg. I would put it escaline>proscaline>allylescaline with the first being the best but they all produce a general malaise/bodyload and psychedelic effects are pretty muted. A weird set of drugs.

*my full trip report not really worth bothering with. I was also sick twice although that is common and no problem

Interesting, totally not my experience.  I found it to have literally the least bodyload or side effects of any phenethylamine I've ever taken at 32mg.  At no point was there anything negative and it was quite euphoric, though with little headspace or psychedelia, it was more of a strong lovely body high and a good day enhancer.  I started to write a report which I will finish later.


I told my friend is much like proscaline except better in every way.  Both are basically nothing deep or profound but just light and fun and enhancing.

I’m with you, [@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/). I think it’s lovely. I always preload with magnesium and citrulline malate and occasionally phenibut (1.2g). Never a body load issue.

And no, not too deep and profound, but adding ally to another full bodied psych like lysergamides or tryptamine really makes it shine; all of the positive qualities of allylescaline thrown in to that other substance. It just adds so much for me. And it makes the sex just transcendental. Magical stuff when you find how to use it to maximum effect. Splendid substance.

I just posted a trip report of my first trial of this, at 32mg:


##### Allylescaline (32mg oral) - First Time - A Lovely Introduction

Allylescaline - A Lovely Introduction at 32mg 8-5-2021 by Xorkoth  I recently got a chance to obtain allylescaline (AL), a mescaline analogue from PIHKAL that I had previously missed out on.  I have tried mescaline, proscaline and methylallylescaline (MAL) prior to this, as far as mescaline...

I'd like to get a good sense of this chem at a 'strong' dose. I've had experience with AL before but I rationed it out strictly at 25-30mg. I've got my hands on some more finally. Thinking 50mg, expecting some severe tummy trouble and potential muscle tension - that's okay though. I also have some dmt I could throw in if I want to blast off, I've heard good things about tryp-phen combos, although dmt is kind of a special case.

I probably took a good 50mg of it one time to finish off the bag.

Not euphoric. But it does give you character like the smart drugs do.

I lick my lips like margaret mcpoyle in IASIP now.

Has anybody else noticed a complete lack of tolerance from this drug? I can use it day after day after day with no loss of effects at the same exact dosages, and I've also pushed it up to 180mg with another 80mg 8 hours later, and it had me cyclically passing out into mundane visions of my future and shit. Allylescaline seems really slept on.


Shulgin's recommended range is great if you're looking for a mescaline-like experience, but allylescaline at least appears to have a ton more to offer than mescaline due to its increased potency and seemingly solid safety profile.

I've noticed a fair but not strong tolerance from AL. Less tolerance than LSD or an NBOME but most certainly producing a tolerance, not like DMT at all.

Posted this in the social thread but figured I'd paste it here as well:


My best friend rented an Airbnb and invited me along. The first night we did 3-me-pcp, 2cb and metocin. It was a good time. Nothing crazy but an enjoyable time.


The following night we did Allylescaline. 40mg each followed by another 20mg 3 hours later. Long come up with that stuff. Started ti kick in in maybe 40 minutes to an hour but didn't peak until about 3 hours in. It also has some long legs. I was still awake and pretty stimulated with lingering minor visual effects 15 hours after the redose, and that was even after 1000mg Soma, lots of gabapentin, red vein kratom and chamomile tea. 2.5mg of DOM had me tripping for 36 hours so maybe I'm just sensitive or metabolize some phenethylamimes slowly.


I really enjoyed Allylescaline though. Very gentle headspace and rather reminiscent of Mescaline. 40mg of Allylescaline felt similar in strength to maybe 400mg of mescaline, just with a somewhat less introspective headspace and a lower feeling of intensity. I've never had a strong mescaline trip and have taken it up to 500mg. Mescaline always feels intense without the trip actually being intense if that makes sense. Allylescaline was gentle, great body high for the most part, light headspace while retaining some introspection. It was also sociable with good humor. Mildly visual at that dose but what it did do visually was beautiful and it made colors pop. I see it being great for combos but it's still worthwhile on its own

Thanks for your report! I really enjoyed reading it. Allylescaline may be one of the few 'scalines I've never tried. Proscaline, mescaline, methallylescaline, and one day soon escaline (not to mention the 3C-s, although no TMAs.) Allylescaline just never crossed my path, but you make it sound lovely.

I did really enjoy Allylsecaline. Don't know much about proscaline but escaline sounds like pretty neat stuff. Only have tried mescaline and methallylescaline. Only did MAL once but I thought it was awesome. Wish I could acquire some more. Long lasting and very colorful.


Why do you say no TMAs? I'm sitting on some 3CP that I need to try. Nervous about psychedelic amphetamines ever since I had a traumatic DOM trip 7 or 8 years ago. Haven't touched a psychedelic amphetamine since. It's about time I give one a whirl

It was light hearted until it turned on me. It actually felt pretty nice until then.


I don't feel like typing the whole thing out and can't find the last post where I explained in detail. Basically I could not stop cracking up. Like everything was hilarious and I was laughing for hours. It got to the point where I couldn't stop (like hysterical laughter), to the point that I felt like I couldn't breathe. It quickly became dark. Was convinced that I was dying. Was begging my friends to call my family so that I could say goodbye. Had dark visuals including a visual of my lung being removed and the resulting cavity being cauterized shut. I'll try it again one day. It did feel like a special chemical until it went dark on me

Wrote this in response to a direct message but I feel like it has a place on this thread


"What is allyl like compared to other scalines?"

Allyl is a blunted, mentally and visually shallow mood booster psychedelic. I mean you still get the energy, the social improvements, color enhancement, but anything beyond that is scarce. Even in high doses, (I've gone to ~90mg) the only effects that seem to be amplified are nausea and stomach cramps. I took that high dose on recommend from someone on bluelight - completely bogus and a waste of material. (I only have experience with M and AL as far as scalines go, though)

I want to preface this by saying **do not do what I did and I am notoriously hard-headed towards psychedelics. **I have taken up to 180mg of Allylescaline orally, and ~95mg intranasally on separate occasions, as well as countless doses at lower ranges and in different mixes. For me, this feels like if mescaline had qualities inherent to LSD. Sharp and geometric visuals, profoundly sharpened and improved headspace and cognition, fantastic MDA-like bodyfeel and empathogenic effects, overall I find it to be a fantastic drug.


Compared to mescaline, it's more visual and tactile, less mental/"spiritual" and less empathogenic (though *barely* less empathogenic). If you put mescaline on one end of a spectrum and 2C-B on the other, it's like 20% of the way away from mescaline and 80% of the way away from 2C-B, if that makes sense.


I've vaporized this compound and it was pretty nice, but seemed like a waste of material.


Doses over 80mg for me involve cyclically passing out (as in, dropping straight to the floor like dead weight) having precognizant visions of my future, mundane moment like making a PB&J or performing a basement concert to like 25 people somewhere. Allylescaline is a beautiful and unique drug, however some people respond very poorly to it as far as escalated heartrate. My fiance [@Felidaez](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/588230/) uses it in PiHKAL doses (20-35mg or so), and my homie I'll just refer to as Mr. B took a 45 (or was it 60?) milligram dose and had to pop a few flualp bars (added up to ~2-3mg ot flualp total) to calm his heart down.

Even at a dose of >90mg the visuals remained minor for me. Almost every trip report I have ever read on AL does not mention strong visuals. It is interesting to me to see you respond so differently to this chem compared to everybody else. I'm not even sure it's the egregious dosing making the difference

I have super intense HPPD and tend to experience an overwhelming amount of visuals, it started after smoking a LOT of DMT and using a ton of harmaline and LSD. Before then, psychedelics were far less visual, idrk why. The visuals of AL aren't quite as in-your-face as some others, but when I'd pass out and have visions it was very similar to mescaline or a DMT-breakthrough.

There's not a euphoric dose for AL. There is something to learn from it tho.

I personally find it insanely euphoric via every RoA I've ever tried (intranasal, oral, and vaporized).

I took up to 50mg of it. Just found it to be a smart drug.
