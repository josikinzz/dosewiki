If I wanted to try it once, how likely is it I will become addicted and end up doing it often enough for long term damage to arise?

Firstly this depends on whether your body chemistry allows you to even like the effects of DXM or not. I absolutely hate it, but I fully assume this is due to my metabolism, which matters more with this drug than other drugs apparently.

Secondly it depends on whether you are sensitive to addiction or not. Actually the order of this list is irrelevant. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Probably for the best, it's a shame I didn't go for "Part 2.5", that would have really confused some people now ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


On a more personal note, I'd be curious if anyone knows the kind of dose ranges where this starts getting dangerous with low/no tolerance - my NMDA antagonist tolerance seems to have dropped back down, and I feel like giving this one a try, but I'm a very big fan of complete dissociation, so I'd like to push this quite high - but, hospital trips aren't on my agenda ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Long term side effects? From the articles I've read on DXM (mainly from erowid and studies found through google), there don't really seem to be any. Mainly talking about cognitive abilities (smartness). Using DXM once or twice shouldn't make me noticeably dumber, right?

I only notice any residual effects after 48 hours if I smoke a lot of weed or dose a lot of DXM before.  It's another story if you are dosing often (more than once every two weeks is often)

I'd try for the third plateau, maybe upper third based on your weight with a calculator and see where that gets you. Really though, I would not go beyond 1200mg no matter what personally, though I've never gone beyond 800 myself, and feel no need to (the 4th plateau seems like taking it too far). With a high third you may find yourself falling into a hole-ish state anyway.

I think I'd take around 700-800 for 3rd then, and 1000-1100 for 4th, based on what calculators have told me regarding my weight. I might just jump straight to fourth, being a bit of a masochist - I assume if I do this though puking is almost guaranteed?

 If DXM made me noticeably dumber, then yes I would notice. All smartassery aside, I guess it would be hard (impossible) to tell with nothing to compare to.


I guess what I was getting to was the fact that most people on a memantine (another NMDA antagonist) regimen actually report increased mental clarity after a few days of "brainfog." And aside from this, we know NMDA receptors are implicated in learning. So I guess I was asking if people had heard reports of people saying "yeah, I did dxm once [or a hundred times] a few years back and I really haven't been as sharp ever since" or anything along those lines.


We know drugs of the amphetamine class have the potential to make you dumber through neurotoxicity (though not a concern in reasonable doses). We know weed makes you dumber temporarily but us basically harmless long term. We know alcohol damages dendrites and causes neural restructuring in moderate doses while inducing brain shrinkage over the long term if consumed heavily/regularly. But it seems nearly nothing is known about how DXM effects learning and memory, which is astounding for a legal OTC medication. So I'm looking for anecdotes.

Yes, and probably hours and hours of horrible vertigo on the comedown. I'd really try the third first, you can get lost in it quite easily.

I'd like to mention some nootropics like piracetam/aniracetam are thought to possibly help mend the parts of your brain that become damaged with abusing dissociatives.


I did tussin myself for the first time in about a year a few days ago, combined it with 25i-NBOMe. It was fun, but the way it made my stomach feel has me feeling like I'll never touch that stuff again. So many better drugs out there that I didn't know about back when I was doing DXM.

**Getting high alone on dxm**


I am pretty new to getting high alone. My whole life I've always been with friends when I've gotten high on any drug, except for pot which I often smoke alone before bed. I'm used to smoking pot alone, it's a great way to mellow out at the end of the day and be alone with my mind and thoughts. 


I'm new-ish to DXM, but I have done it several times over the past few months with friends. Had some wild experiences and learned a lot. I've tried doing it alone 2 times now, because I want to experience getting high on a more powerful drug alone, especially DXM which I think might be better alone in some ways. This may sound kinda stupid, but I'm having difficulty learning HOW to be high alone on a powerful drug. It's just damn.. confusing. I didn't realize how helpful it is to have a buddy or gf around to help guide the trip and be supportive and grounding and just share the vibe with you. 


The first time I got high alone on DXM I didn't take very much, probably about 200mg. It was pleasant, I drew, listened to some Alan Watts lectures and thought about stuff, listened to music, hallucinated a bit.. Last night I tried again and took too much too fast by mistake. I took the gel caps, 40 in the span of 30 mins. Equivalent to 600mg. After about an hour I experienced the nasty stomach side effects, but about 1.5 hours in I was way higher than I expected to be. I had double vision, couldn't walk very well, couldn't read, could sorta talk but too fast and quite confusedly.. This is the kind of high that might be fun with friends, but I found myself very frustrated in this state alone. There wasn't much I could do other than lie down and hallucinate like mad. Which was great for a while, but my goal for the trip was to use my mind, which I find is often more powerful and I can think faster and more clearly on DXM. For some reason I experienced the opposite during this trip. I usually feel smarter and much more aware of higher realities on DXM but in this case I felt kind of dumbed down, which kinda depressed me. All I could really use my mind for was creative doings, so I took some photos and drew and tripped out. I tried thinking and writing and reading but no luck. Eventually I tried to sleep, still hallucinating like crazy, so it took a lot of effort, but finally succeeded. I also found myself quite afraid and psychotic when hallucinating in bed, so I guess that's the one part that deters me from doing DXM alone, is that it can be scary at times. I have done k alone once, which I find to be a very comforting drug, but DXM is darker and less protective to me.


I guess I definitely took too much - I have taken that much before, but never that quickly, and never alone. So it was foolish of me to swallow 40 gelcaps so fast. I guess doing it gradually over the course of a few hours will give you much better results. It really wasn't the high I was expecting. It was also the first time I had taken just gel caps and no syrup, so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it. Anyway, just looking for some other thoughts and opinions on getting high with friends vs getting high alone (on dissociatives) - maybe it's better to plan your trip beforehand when dosing alone? To eliminate getting too confused and lost? But yeah the dosage and speed I took it at surely had something to do with my disappointing high as well. All thoughts appreciated.

You can't expect certain things to happen on ANY trip. You just have to go along with the vibe of the trip. It sounds like you wanted to get some deep insight into yourself, but instead your brain wanted to do art and be creative. You shouldn't complain about it...enjoy it, go with it, let the drug be your guide to enlightenment. Maybe the DXM was showing you that you're a talented painter and you don't know it yet. If you have a drive to do something because of a psychedelic, just go along with it, don't be so controlling expecting a substance to obey your every whim. Maybe the trip was trying to tell you that you shouldn't be so controlling in your life and to broaden your horizons. The fact of the matter is...The high itself wasn't disappointing...YOU made yourself disappointed by trying to control, AND EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL, a psychedelic substance. DXM can OWN you and make you it's dirty little bitch QUICK if you take 2 much and aren't careful. Just know the dose that you are taking and how strongly it will affect you, then buckle up and enjoy the ride. Psychedelics can definitely be tools for mind expansion...BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO USE A CHAINSAW TO HAMMER IN A NAIL...it just ain'ta gonna work fo ya jethro. Wanna have a good, insightful DXM trip...Take my advice...

Take 1 4oz bottle of Long Acting DXM ONLY Robitussin brand syrup. (about 350-400mgs)

Wait about 45 minutes to start feeling it...

Download the album MOON SAFARI by the french band AIR.

Smoke a nice joint to yourself while listening to the music...

BLAM!!! You'll be in the middle of an awesome DXM experience which just got made WAY better by the joint that you smoked. Now all you have to do is kick back, listen to the tunes, and visit the moon...trust me you're on your way.

DXM + weed = The only way to take DXM. It helps with the nausea, makes the trip 10X more powerful and insightful, def makes it more euphoric. I won't even take DXM if I don't have at least a gram to smoke during.

If you run into problems on a trip and get 2 high, or scared, or anxious, or whatever...All you need is a benzodiazepine...AKA Xanex, Valium, Klonopin, etc....Put it under your tongue, let it dissolve, you'll be calm in 5-10 minutes. It will kill the intensity of the trip tho, so only take it if you must. It is a nice exit strategy tho.

That being said...Go along with the trip next time...It may show you a part of yourself that you've never had the opportunity to meet...If you want insight from psychedelics, you need to listen A LOT closer to what they're telling you. You could be the next Salvador Dali and never know because you didn't listen to the DXM telling you to express yourself thru art. THAT would be a shame...

If you have friends to get high with then get high with friends.. some ppl like me are not fortunate enough to have anyone to get high with and can only do it alone, trust me when your by your lonely all the time unless you have mad hobbies, you want to be high.  


With DXM though, I wouldn't do it around other people unless everyone else was using it, and the same amount as me, because you just look and act screwed up- I would be too self consious doing it around a bunch of people.. i think it is kind of a loner drug.  If you aint go shit else to do and want to disassociate from reality though take some DXM, and put on some tunes, turn off the lights and it makes for a very intresting time.

Mr. Hedges, very well said and I fully agree. The idea of taking a benzodiazepine to calm your mind is also good for when you have started to feel more sober but still have the "afterglow" and your mind starts to wander into the wrong places.  Try timing your come down so that you will be in a good place to stop what you are doing and just try to chill out or pass out.

> 			The first time I got high alone on DXM I didn't take very much, probably about 200mg. It was pleasant, I drew, listened to some Alan Watts lectures and thought about stuff, listened to music, hallucinated a bit.. Last night I tried again and took too much too fast by mistake. I took the gel caps, 40 in the span of 30 mins. Equivalent to 600mg. After about an hour I experienced the nasty stomach side effects, but about 1.5 hours in I was way higher than I expected to be. I had double vision, couldn't walk very well, couldn't read, could sorta talk but too fast and quite confusedly...but my goal for the trip was to use my mind, which I find is often more powerful and I can think faster and more clearly on DXM. For some reason I experienced the opposite during this trip. I usually feel smarter and much more aware of higher realities on DXM but in this case I felt kind of dumbed down, which kinda depressed me...

You really need to start looking around this thread, and related ones linked to in its OP: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/599034-The-Big-amp-Dandy-DXM-Thread-Part-2-Robojesus-forgive-us-our-sins.](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/599034-The-Big-amp-Dandy-DXM-Thread-Part-2-Robojesus-forgive-us-our-sins.) Please research drugs before you take them (you aren't even aware of the different plateaux of effects from DXM it seems).  This is also an informative read. [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/)


Why are you surprised that you had an entirely different experience after TRIPLING your dose? 200mg is just a mild headchange for most, 600 can be a rather intense psychedelic Dissociative experience with very significant physical side effects. Also, recreational doses of dissociatives are famous for causing extreme confusion and cognitive impairment, your reported effect of mental clarity was because you took a very small amount of the drug (much less than many would bother with since it is usually considered uninteresting at those dosages). You're seriously expecting the wrong things out of this drug dude.


Do more research and stay safe in the future, were you using a drug with a lower therapeutic index (or if you were taking one of the myriad drugs contraindicated with DXM for that matter), you could have seriously harmed yourself, and that's not cool.

Yeah. High-dose DXM is not a toy...I did 3 1/2 months of research back-to-front on it before my first dose. Longer for most other drugs. I was just impatient because I had never done any other drugs before. I hate to sound like my Dad, but there's no excuse for you to not have learned about what you were doing before diving in.


Now for the other side of the coin...at that dose, not moving is the best thing to do. Throw on some trance, close your eyes, and travel the dimensions with a blacklight on. It's a thing of beauty.

Kaity, please start posting all of your DXM related questions here in the Big and Dandy DXM thread.

As for something like an overnight weight discrepancy, I'd imagine hydration, food in/not in stomach, amount of clothing you're wearing, waste material in body, etc. etc. influence it and make such measurements pretty much devoid of meaning.

@ Mr Hedges: You're completely right. I didn't intend to come across like a control freak - I almost always completely go with the flow when I am high and let my trip guide me. Even in this trip, I had other intentions in mind but soon enough I gave in to what my body was telling me to do. I'm often creative on DXM, and other times I have spent more time in thought. I guess I assumed both were possible for each and every trip and that I had more control than I did - but my experience of DXM is showing me more and more how unpredictable of a drug it is. I swear each time I get high it's different somehow than the last. Anyway good advice though - I'll try to remain as open as possible for each trip.


Never Knows Best: Again it seems I gave off the wrong impression. I didn't mean to act surprised at the fact that 200mg was pleasant and 600mg was very intense. I've been high on large doses (600mg) several times before and very much enjoyed it, and still been able to think with a new kind of insight and clarity. I've also done a fair amount of research on DXM and I knew I could handle that dosage. I know my body, along with the dangers linked to the drug. As I mentioned in the post I assumed it was more the speed at which I dosed not the amount. Or both together I suppose. But I was also trying to ask more general questions - not just about dosage but about state of mind when high alone on DXM in general and what to do/not do. Maybe when going it alone though I just need to start with less than I normally would with a friend, because I have only myself around. Either way thanks for the tips. DXM, she is quite the strange beast.

**DXM first trip - dissapointed (too short)**


This is a report about a cat's first DXM trip (400mg) and his disappointment at the lack of duration the high possessed. The Cat had dosed beforehand at around 100-200mg to be sure he wasn't sensitive. He did not find the effects that intense.


He took his 400mg dose last night and found that while it was at its peak, it was great. He had drunky vision, trails when he moved to look at other objects and some flanging and some euphoria. This was great, but it just did not last long enough. After about an hour or so the trails left, wasn't as drunk and lost the euphoria. In about 3hrs, he felt almost sober (although he knows he wasn't), he can swear that it almost felt like he was sober. 


The cat wants to know if this is how long the DXM peak lasts, that fun really high, drunk, intense peak. (only one hour?). While he was at this level he realised the power DXM possessed, but once it faded so quick he felt disappointed. The opiate peak lasts about 30min for this Cat. Is DXM the same? As in the really good part is one or so hours? Thanks. 


The cat would also like to add that whilst playing a game at this level of highness, he had scores so ridiculously high, he forced himself to move and take a photo with his phone once the score of the online game came up at the end. At the time he was thinking to himself WTF this is crazy ridiculous and so easy lol. 

SWIM doesn’t really want to hit a 3 lvl plateau (no interest in spiritual exploration), he wants to use DXM for its fun and interactive purposes.


Help? or any feedback on short experiences?

I've taken DXM honestly about 175-200 times in my life, sometimes for as long as 50-60 days in a row, and at a dose of 750-1100mgs at a time...And I can truthfully say that even tho you are doing the SAME drug every time, it seems different every single time. Sometimes the same dose 2 days in a row would take me 2 different places, sometimes a dose of 700mgs would be as strong as an 1100mg experience on another day. DXM is an odd, dark drug, but it can occasionally be light and cheery...I've had so many different reactions to the drug it's incredible. Just know that with DXM at any dose, you're always rolling the dice...cuz poor mans PCP is NEVER the same experience...I think the longer and more you take it...it may actually get harder to put your finger on WHAT DXM actually does...the things that it constantly does for me tho...Music is ALWAYS beautiful, maybe more beautiful than any other substance...and it always puts a smile on my face, I can't help but be silly and act like a little kid playing in the snow. Other than that, experiences CAN and WILL vary every time you take this drug. BE SAFE and ENJOY! Make sure you have MUSIC...or you're just missing the point...

I've come accross approximately 600 mgs of this drug and I'm going to try it tomorrow. I figured I will start low: 50 mg, just to exclude enzyme deficiency. After this I will take another 250 mg. Now to my question, I've heard only about 1/3 people likes this drug. What makes it so special? Is it the overall dissociative experience that puts people off? I absolutely love dissociatives, so I'm very excited to try DXM.

DXM is bottomless and fathomless.  It cannot be appreciated at all with a single experience as it's range of possible effects covers a much broader spectrum than most other drugs.  It is not a first choice if you are just looking for a "fun trip" or to feel good.  While these are common effects at low to midrange doses, they certainly are not guaranteed.  At high doses DXM can be more difficult to navigate than LSD or shrooms at their hardest.    However, it can also produce effects that are life changing in a positive way.  I had to really use it a lot before I began to grasp its value as a catalyst to pursue spiritual growth.  In this regard it has been beneficial for me, but not without a price - namely some very, very frightening and difficult trips that almost put me off it forever, which in my case would have been unfortunate as I would have continued to view drugs as toys to be played with and used as a means toward experiencing pleasure only, and therefore rating their value according to that criteria alone.  I now believe that drugs are tools with many different purposes that differ from user to user and are unique to each, and as such I no longer believe that it is appropriate to judge others based on their particular reasons for use.

Mr. Hedges, you say you've taken DXM nearly 200 times in your life and agreed that it seems different every time. You say a 700mg dose can be as strong as a 1100mg dose, and that you've had so many different reactions to the drug its incredible. Synchrojet, you say DXM is bottomless and fathomless. These mysteries of DXM really baffle and intrigue me. It's been different every time for me as well, and I have also at times experienced highs at lower doses that were more powerful than when I consumed greater amounts.


I wouldn't call myself an enormously experienced drug user, but I've done ketamine about 50-100 times in my life, smoked pot for years, and enjoyed acid and MDMA/e a handful of times each. With each of these drugs, which range from dissociative to cannabinoid to psychedelic to whatever class M falls into, I've usually experienced pretty consistent effects that coincide directly to the dose. If I do a bump of K I will be mellowed and amused and somewhat dissociated. If I do a huge line, I will k-hole. My acid trips have ranged in intensity, but it's always been similar types of feelings, thoughts and hallucinations. Pot is consistent, as is MDMA/e (more or less). 


So.. what is the deal with DXM?!? Why is this drug different from all the others? Why have I experienced different *classes* of hallucinations on the same drug? K hallucinations always share common characteristics, as do acid ones. One DXM trip, all of my hallucinations were very tiny, and looked like photographs mixed with silhouettes, very realistic, opaque, perfectly still and far away. On my most recent one, all of my hallucinations were translucent, cartoony, larger-than-life, and filled up my entire vision. Sometimes on DXM I feel worlds smarter, and see reality on entirely different planes. Other times I feel dumbed down and cannot use my mind properly. Sometimes I feel relaxed, mellow and at peace. Other times I feel anxious and psychotic. I could go on and on, listing endless changes and variances in my trips, but that would take a really long time. 


I'm basically just looking for answers if you got any, or really any thoughts on the matter. I'm curious about others' experiences and about the science/neuroscience that might somehow explain any of this. Or perhaps it's far more mysterious and cannot be explained by science. Seriously, DXM feels like this hidden, dirty, magical secret that only a small group know about. I'm curious by nature (as I'd assume most DXM-users are), and I want to crack the case!

You have to take DXM in higher quantity if you want it to last. Less than 500 or 600mgs is only going to keep you feeling good for 4 hours at best. Even when you take higher doses 700-1200mgs, it still only lasts about 8-10 hours MAXIMUM, and a good 2 hours of that can be the afterglow affect. If you're not looking for self exploration, but want the fun aspects of the drug, I wouldn't take more than 500mgs, 600mgs ABSOLUTE MAX. Otherwise, you're going to end up somewhere it sounds like you don't want to be. The more you take, the longer it lasts, but the more psychedelic and introspective it becomes. Be careful, it's a thin line between drunken fun and TRIPPY mayhem...have a benzo on hand if things get too intense...

We ain't cats here bruv.


DXM can be a very fickle drug depending on how it is administered.  400mg is just barely scratching the third plateau for most people, I think you need to take more if you want a good experience. Also - if you're taking those infernal red Robitussin gels, *poke them open before you take them* or they won't evenly empty their contents. If you're using syrups, other pills, or powder, then disregard that.


Erowid doesn't seem to have one of those neat little graphs that they have for e.g. the MDMA "timeline". From memory, a good solid 3rd plat dose (say 600mg) will have a 2 hour onset, a 3 to 4 hour peak, and a 12 hour or so slow coast back to sobriety.


You definitely don'twant to overdo DXM (900mg+) or you're going to end up somewhere very Bad, and feeling like your head's been run through with a fork several times and then filled with sand.

And aside from this, we know NMDA receptors are implicated in learning.

We know weed makes you dumber temporarily but us basically harmless long term. We know alcohol damages dendrites and causes neural restructuring in moderate doses while inducing brain shrinkage over the long term if consumed heavily/regularly. But it seems nearly nothing is known about how DXM effects learning and memory, which is astounding for a legal OTC medication. So I'm looking for anecdotes.

i love first and second plateau doses of DXM, sometimes i'd rather have 100-200mgs DXM + benzo+ weed over MXE as dex is not as debilitating as mexy.  to each their own...

Here's a question.


When I used to take DXM... this was like 10 years ago... I would do it every weekend and my tolerance never increased.


Then I got into Ketamine and my tolerance went wayyy up. Took a break.


Then I got into MXE and my tolerance slowly went up again.


I wonder if I could still trip on DXM :lol:


anyway the title of this thread is no joke I clearly remember a three mile high electric Jesus Christ entering one of my DXM trips...

Thanks for your reply guys. I will not SWIM or cat here, I apologize.


I will probably just go for the 600mg dose and hope it lasts longer. If it doesn't then I guess potentiators will have to be implemented. The thing is the high is great, but it's short, like weed. Except with weed you can do it daily without any real consequence (physically). DXM doesn't seem to be a drug that can be used daily, but the high is similiar (length wise), get my drift at the dissapointment? 


Thanks guys. I really like this site and have found a plethora of information here.

Maybe not harmless. But you can succeed in life and smoke pot at the same time. Too many people disagree with this but it's true. I'm not saying drugs will turn you into Steve Jobs, but you're acting like there's no such thing as therapeutic drug use. Antidepressants do help people.


The human mind isn't perfect, and actually *can* be "improved" by altering it's balance of chemicals. You might have noticed that not every person on this planet is equal in terms of intelligence. Largely, the only difference between Albert Einstein and someone too dim to work at McDonald's is a difference in brain chemical balance.


If more cannabinoids in my brain helps me be a more social person, then who needs nature? I'll fix myself %) (This is why christians are against drugs. But I'll play God with my brain chemistry if I so deem it necessary.)

**Just drank 2 bottles of delysm**


Ok so I just drank two bottles of delysm about 15 minutes ago. I'm relatively new to psychedelics so I want to know what I can do to ensure I have a good trip. Right now I am just sitting around listening to the Grateful Dead. Anything I should keep in mind?

Dissociatives like DXM are pretty hard to have a bad trip on. Just relax and enjoy it.

If those were two big bottles of delsym you are going to be tripping pretty hard.

Normally I'd merge this with the Big & Dandy DXM thread, but since you're new I'll let you reply first. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I think the best thing is just to relax, have a happy mindset, make sure you have plenty of fluids to hydrate you throughout the trip, along with any music or anything else you need. I've never had any real difficult experiences in all of my dissociative experiences. All of my difficult trips were with psychedelics, so I wouldn't worry, just relax and enjoy.


If you have any questions, ask here, or check the [Big & Dandy DXM Thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/599034-The-Big-amp-Dandy-DXM-Thread-Part-2-Robojesus-forgive-us-our-sins.) and I'll likely move this there later once you've had a chance to reply.


Have a nice trip, and welcome to Bluelight! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) :D

and while Jesusgreen told you to stay hydrated and drink lots of fluids, don't become overly concerned with chugging gallons of water.  Just keep a big cold glass full of water on hang at all times and remember to drink small amounts often.

hope you re having a nice time, man 


but is it just me that doesnt really like threads titled "just ate/drank/snorted something" and then go on to ask questions about what the trip might be like or how to improve it? maybeim a bit anal about my drug use but i like to get my questions out before actually doing the drug. that way i have the best chance of being able to y'know read the answers....

I agree. There's no reason not to be well prepared before taking any drug, and it worries me how many people aren't. However this guy's post didn't necessarily suggest he hadn't done his research - maybe he was just looking for a few last minute tips and assurance.


After all, there's no harm in *extra* preparation ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I definitely wouldn't advise this. The DXM dose-response curve is anything but linear, and even small increases can be shockingly powerful. For me, jumping from ~290 to ~390 milligrams took me from a comfortable, cozy, intellectually stimulating high, to something that shredded my mind so mercilessly that it was a monumental effort to even understand the most basic concepts and ideas.


DXM isn't like psychedelics, which IMO are still relatively kind on your mind and body if you overshoot your aim. DXM can become a veritable psycho-spiritual buzz-saw if you take too much, so please don't "be a bit of a masochist" and jump straight into a fourth plateau dose, if you've never been on at least a high third plateau (and a mid-third-plateau before high-third-plateau, etc.).

Not to mention much of the caucasian population (I've heard 10%) is extra-sensitive to to the drug. I weigh just under 65kg, and 300mg (5mg/kg) was enough for a low 3rd plateau while smoking weed. For most of the come up period, I felt like I was super drunk and my head was swimming, but without a lot of the loss in cognition that would come with alcohol intoxication. This lasted roughly an hour. And as others have said, it's impossible to predict what experience you'll have, even when you know your dosage. You might have a reality shattering trip one time with 500mg, and then not experience much at all the next with 800mg. And don't forget that being an NMDA antagonist, DXM may greatly reduce much of your sensitization to other drugs. I forgot this and took around 4 rips out of a bong.. not a good idea.

Hopefully you had a nice experience.


For info on DXM for next time, check our DXM FAQ:

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/78090-DXM?s=&r=0](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/78090-DXM?s=&r=0)


I can appreciate the fact that you don't return to this thread here in PD within a day, but there is no reason for

this to stay open anymore and have a side-tracked discussion next to our central thread.


So this is merged in.


Since you are a super fresh user I will keep the redirection link active for a long time.

I've never personally understood what this 'dirtiness' is that people ascribe to DXM, although I've seen it mentioned often enough. Does anyone care to expand on what that they mean by *dirty* beyond 'I don't like it'? I personally haven't found DXM itself dirty in any sense, although chugging syrup can be unpleasant.


Is it the need to drink syrup coupled with the potential hot flushes/itchiness/other histamine reactions plus nausea or is it something more?

^ I think a large part of it is likely to be attributed to what you mentioned, but part of it is also probably because of it's reputation as a drug that teenagers often abuse. It's similar to why to some people salvia is seen as a dirty or stupid drug purely because of it's main users.

I think people are talking about two different things when they say dirty. First there's what jesus is talking about, how a large portion of DXM users are teenagers and how this leads to a reputation for a cheap, crappy way to get fucked up. Second, there's the way the drug affects you; Loss of social inhibitions (for some). A feeling between being drunk and being stoned if you get the dosage wrong (2nd plateau). And your perception of the world just becomes "weird." Many people end up thinking about things in a way they shouldn't, or that doesn't make sense to a sober person. And this makes people feel "dirty."


And drinking cough syrup sucks.

Well I think DXM is a dirty drug for me and some other people but not for everyone... and I believe this comes down to individual biochemistry, like how many enzymes you have of specific kinds. There are a few different metabolism pathways and it seems to me that if one pathway is the major one used by your body it might result in significantly more side-effects. Let's not forget that 10% of caucasian people are enzyme-deficient and don't get the proper effects. Apparently this does not happen with Asians (a genetic thing). At least *almost* not at all... Domo arigato mr roboto! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 

Not really sure how many African people do the robo shuffle lol. Or eskimo's for that matter.


Anyway I blame differences in the way you metabolize DXM for the wide range in effects. Maybe if I could give DXO a try, I could see what other people find so wonderful about DXM. Maybe I'm wrong though and DXO is not at all what makes for pleasurable effects. Maybe it's 3MM. 

There is another possibility and that is that some people might be more sensitive to other pharmacological effects other than NMDA antagonism responsible for the dissociation. For example some people might be exceptionally sensitive to histaminergic reponse and tend to have a scorching case of the robo itch, and similar to that you can imagine other cases where headache, feverishness and high bloodpressure and stuff like that may be much more apparent because of certain sensitivities. I'm not sure what makes me sensitive but on DXM, the feeling I get in my body absolutely sucks ass.


Anyway here are the metabolic pathways:


![figure4.gif](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.erowid.org%2Fchemicals%2Fdxm%2Ffaq%2Fimages%2Ffigure4.gif&hash=425c88cbfdfc4a2c607c40466864aef3)


[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_physiological.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_physiological.shtml)


> DXM, as the hydrobromide salt, is absorbed quickly from the GI tract; within 30 minutes, all of it may have entered the bloodstream (2,3). The polistirex compound is intended for continuous absorption, and may take 6 to 8 hours to fully enter the bloodstream.  
> 
> 
> 
> DXM is metabolized via two pathways, both of which lead to the same thing, 3-hydroxymorphinan (3HM). The first pathway goes from DXM to DXO (dextrorphan) and then to 3HM; the second goes from DXO to 3-methoxymorphinan (3MM) and then to 3HM. By far most of the DXM (up to 90% ) gets metabolized via DXO in normal individuals. 
> 
> 
> 
> DXM is converted to DXO by a liver enzyme called cytochrome P450-2D6 (debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase). About 7% of Caucasians and 0.5% of Asians have a highly inefficient (70 times slower) version of this enzyme, and cannot metabolize DXM to DXO effectively (10). About 0.5 to 2% of the population have multiple copies of the P450 gene, leading to extremely fast metabolism of DXM into DXO (155). After being converted to DXO, the enzymes P450-3A4 and P450-3A5 convert DXO to 3-hydroxymorphinan (77). 
> 
> 
> 
> The other pathway goes to 3-methoxymorphinan first (via P450-3A4 and P450-3A5), and then to 3-hydroxymorphinan. Most people do not metabolize much DXM this way, although people who lack the normal P450-2D6 will convert a substantial amount to 3MM. As 3MM is probably not psychoactive, this means that the 5-10% who lack the normal 2D6 enzyme will experience less effect from DXM (or more specifically, won't experience the effects of DXO). 
> 
> 
> 
> P450-2D6 functions by removing the methoxy group and replacing it with a hydroxyl (OH) (or more accurately, pruning the methyl off the oxygen); this step is known as O-demethylation. P450-3A4 and 3A5 replace the methyl group with a hydrogen (H); this is the N-demethylation step. Refer to the diagram of the DXM molecule in Section 4.2 for the location of the methyl and methoxy groups.

**DXM-First time experience-vomiting/nausea. How can I make my second time better?**


Before I start, the only psychedelic drug I've done before this is shrooms. I weigh 135 pounds.


Last week I took ~290mg of DXM from CVS Adult Tussin Long-Acting Cough Liquid.


I vomited around 5-8 times after an hour of taking it due to nausea and fatigue. My puke consisted of the nasty syrup and pizza. and felt a bit drunk and  strangely anxious for some reason. I was high, but it wasn't exactly pleasant until I got my hands on some marijuana around 8 hours later which made me feel calmer and it stopped the nausea. After smoking, I got some minor visual hallucinations, but my anxiety and nausea was gone.


The next few days i got a strange afterglow, not the same as MDMA but was still pleasant. I experienced some visuals and craziness again after smoking some weed.


I am thinking of trying dxm again, this time with weed right by my side. 

**

How much should I take next time? Should I try a different syrup**? because I remember before I smoked weed I was constantly spitting because of the nasty ass taste and syrup I felt in my mouth.


**I also have the same CVS Adult Tussin Long-Acting Cough Liquid and some Delsym 12 hr. Should I try mixing it up?**

DPH goes well, a motion-sickness tablet to suppress the puking.

Cannabis also goes well, and some people like to fast beforehand so they have a lower chance of puking.

1. Make sure DXM is the ONLY active ingredient of your syrup.

2. Cannabis helps as you discovered.

3. DPH can help with nausea associate with vertigo

4. Take some ginger before hand.

5. Make sure to get the taste of the syrup out of your mouth ASAP by chasing it with something

6. Have something acidic with it to help balance out stomach pH.

7. Dose on an empty or mostly empty stomach, drink some fluids as well, if you have to throw up this might make it less unpleasant (solid matter or dry heaves suck, pure liquid is least lame, ime).

I think that dose was fine, but maybe drop it down lower, increasing the dosage is only going to make the nausea worse.

one option is to clog your nose while drinking the syrop and keep it cloged while chasing the taste away with something to drink or some tooth paste 

also a vegan diet the day before and not eating for atleast 4 hours prior is a very good idea when taking dxm in the form of syrop

I always ate a *light* meal about 2 hours beforehand, drank a ton of grapefruit juice 30 minutes beforehand, ate grapefruit, anything grapefruit, drank the syrup with grapefruit juice as well, and had everything arranged beforehand so immediately after swallowing I can...

Lay down* with my head elevated*,** listen to slow droney music** nothing loud of too stimulating, very important ...music was the added dimension that made OOBE possible for me and also allowed me not to vomit. Lastly, *clench your teeth and keep swallowing! *


When you feel your body start to spin, even though you're laying down, the trip is about to begin.

When you pee, it's over. Then the speedy part begins.


Even though William White was discredited for claiming DXM caused brain lesions, the rest of his report was very useful for me. 

Especially the part about 1/3rd of the people who try it won't like it at all, 1/3 will try it but never reach the full potential, and the last 1/3 will go all the way to many third plateau experiences before their liver enzymes change and they begin getting a rash.


Also, it may take many months before some biochemical change takes place and your body allows the molecule to affect you.

Sounds crazy, I know, but it seemed like truth to me...many years ago...


Be safe, set and setting.


Enjoy.

get some grape/oj flavored syrup. dissolve it in 1 cup of grape/oj juice. grape vitamin water works good, as does regular oj. chug that down quicklike. oj is aite, i reccomend grape that shit tastes good. u can get it as wal-tussin at walgreens. 


take 2 benadryls to prevent a histamine reaction which will probably help with your nausea


cannabis is a great potentiator of tussin and has anti-nausea qualities as well


good luck


p.s. personally i can't trip without taking some benadryl bcuz i get a huge histamine reaction = red body, itchy, discomfort

and u make we wanna tussin a lil again hahaha

I think what it is is that, compared to ketamine, it has an extra "unpleasant" feel that ket doesn't have. I guess another way to quantify it would be "alien".

**DXM Coma**


I was recently reminiscing about my DXM days back in highschool, and I remembered something that ive always wanted to ask the Bluelight community for a while now - when I would do DXM back in the day, I normally did a bottle of Robo Max Strength Cough, which was enough at the time to put me at a good lower 3rd Plateau. 


The day after the experience, I would normally take a nap, as I was drained and didnt get any real sleep the night of doing the DXM. When I would fall asleep the day after, I would fall into a coma like state, where I couldnt be awakened whatsoever - if my parents came in to talk to me, they could get me to sit up, and have my eyes open, but I would just stare off into space, and not respond to anything they said or did. I absolutely do not remember any of this, but it happened MANY times. It was what got me caught doing DXM from them on a regular basis, was this coma like sleep that would happen, where I couldnt be awakened, and if I WAS stirred enough, I would get up and open my eyes, but be completely unresponsive and remember none of it.


Has this happened to any other DXM users here? and what could be the cause of this? Keep in mind this was normally at least 12-16 hours AFTER the end of the experience.

so you would have these coma like states of sleep, then still dose again?  Reading over your post like 5 times I now think you might be overestimating these coma like sleeps.  Once I started doing dxm and smoking weed in highschool, it wasn't uncommon for me to be completely unresponsive when my parents tried to wake me, until I managed to pretend to wake up so I could fall back asleep and then wake up thinking my parents never woke me up.


OTC DXM is fucking hard on my body, and yeah, if I was dosing 3rd plateaus consistently I'd always expect the day after to be a blissful state of derps and herps

Once I started doing dxm and smoking weed in highschool, it wasn't uncommon for me to be completely unresponsive when my parents tried to wake me, until I managed to pretend to wake up so I could fall back asleep and then wake up thinking my parents never woke me up.

Yeah, I would still dose, I was 15 years old, stupid and thought I was invincible. I didnt care what I was doing to myself. Overestimating how? I dont quite understand what you mean. Maybe im just not reading it correctly, but I honestly dont understand a majority of your post - how do are you completely unresponsive and then "pretend" to wake up? I know from what my parents told me that they would yell at me, wave their hands in front of my face, shake me, and I would have no reaction, I would just stare off into space with glassy eyes. I also dont remember any of these episodes. and what exactly are "derps and herps"? Not trying to be a dick, just trying to understand what you're saying.

LOL @ the cold fighter.  try some fruit buddy.


I took a bunch of crap DXM OTC pills one time back in high school.  Usually I did other kinds, but tried a different brand one night.  After I came home, my mom heard me puke in my bedroom.  I was so fucked up laying down in my bed, I tried to puke down the heat vent on the floor to keep it from getting on the carpet LOL.


Well anyway I told her I had ate some taco bell that night and wasn't feeling too good.  Haha... mom was so clueless she actually bought it.

Just wanted to say thanks to all for the replies re: the 'dirtiness' of DXM. Makes a bit more sense now, especially the 'dirty by association' re: high school/college kid behaviour (not something I've personally been exposed to at all). 


Threw up for only the 4th or 5th time the other night, in well over 100 experiences (most of them 3rd plateau). The other times were directly caused by dosing too soon after a meal and entirely my fault, so I can appreciate the dirtiness a bit from there. 


Here's a somewhat related brief summary of my last experience:


I have a limited recollection as I've somehow obliterated most of the memory of the peak - last thing I remember was lying down in bed with headphones on (as per my usual routine) with one vague recollection of my playing minecraft 'in my head' and that I'd found the edge of recursion becuase I'd dug myself to where I found a block of type 'minecraft', and activating it would let me play minecraft inside minecraft (in which there theoretically would also be another 'minecraft' block somewhere). I haven't played minecraft for quite some time.


Apparently I had enough foresight to throw up in the bath and that I helped my wife clean it up as well - all the while claiming I didn't exist. I have one fleeting memory of this point where I'd somehow mixed in the concept of recursion with tiles from a computer game I'd been playing a couple of days ago all turning 90 degrees and linking to something totally unrelated (not sure exactly what, but it was the most WRONG I have ever felt my entire life). I was like "_THAT_ shouldn't be there!!!!". I think the way I saw the vomit on the inside edges of the bath were forming squares, turning sideways and recursing in some way. This is interesting because my OEV's on DXM are minimal. Usually it's a broken black and white of my bedroom and I'm waiting for the universal computer to give 'me' enough cycles to overcome it and get back to normality.


The next continuation of memory was back in bed navigating my way back from my ego dissolution - getting stuck in time loops, deja vu and waiting for the 'reality shifts' to settle down. It seemed like I had specific waypoints for finding my way back, although the memory of these waypoints is also unsettling, the foremost being a surreal less than ideal situation - almost like it's my last savepoint and I haven't made the right choices to move on from it yet, and that this experience was not the first time I'd been back there...except it was is in this lifetime!? Eventually came down but could feel lingering 'closed eye' effects/thought patterns for the next couple of days. In a way it almost felt like I'm randomly wiring up neuronal networks in my brain - the intent is to improve myself, but the results have been so variable I'm not sure continuuing is a great idea, especially if it could involve recursion.


This was the result of something in the vicinty of 1600mg also potentiated by aniracetam. With regards to harm minimisation, I highly recommend you don't try this combination, especially at high doses. Normally I don't supplement doses, but in this case I was 4 hours in and feeling it way less than expected, so in a less than usually responsible state of mind I upped things by 600mg. Oops. (For reference, I weigh just over 200lbs / 90kg). Only second time in my life I've made a mistake of this order of magnitude.


It was still an amazing experience, but there are different types of amazing, and they're not all positive. It was my second definite 4th plateau and very different from the first (no 'ego death' that time), but still very shaken by it and not one I'm interested in repeating - going to take a long time to integrate it and it may be time to hang up the phone for quite a while so to speak. Going to stop attempted to solve/fix the universe/multiverse (or at least 'my' universe/reality tunnel) and settle for ongoing incremental improvement. Going to lay off the drugs and stick to meditation instead for the time being.


Love you all - be safe!

**DXM question**


This is going be my first time doing DXM. I did my research , but i have a few questions.

Info:DXM hbr 30mg per tablet (only DXM, don't wanna die)

I weight around 140.

12 tablets.


by taking all 12 tablets at once, what plateau will I likely reach? I'm quite interested in seeing/hearing things, as i've hallucinated before on ambien, but i hate not being able to remember.

Take 300 mg for a first try, anything more than this might be overwhelming. You can always take more next time, but 300 mg is certainly a recreational and dissociative dose, especially for a first timer.

Thanks, i think i want to enter the third plateau on my first time. I'm pretty mentally prepared, as Ambien has already put me through hell. Will 300MG give me the desired hallucinations? I'm looking for a very deep experience.

Seconded. I personally have never had  a good experience with it... But I definitely think I could if I wasn't chugging syrup to try it :L

It makes me feel bloated and sick, the last time I tried (my first serious attempt) I ended up forcing myself to throw up (first time I've **ever** done that too).

Sorry about posting in the wrong section! I'm new to the forum >.<.


Alright, well instead of doing cough syrup, i instead managed to get pills with 30mg dxm in each. I plan on taking a dose of somewhere between 400-550mg. 


Ambien for me was pure hell , but at the same time pretty fun. I got prescribed it for insomnia, a lot of my trips i don't remember, the ones i do remember came back to me sometime during the next day, and i really hated remembering the bad trip (i could probably write a report on my zolpidem experience). What i experienced during my bad trips is probably the worst i could ever be put through. Full blown hallucinations, i sat down and i was somewhere else, i got up and i was somewhere else, seeing bugs on the wall, looking through my kitchen floor thinking it was glass, textures on surfaces moving, clouds flying through me,etc.


I'm looking forward to this, hopefully i'll be able to remember it, and i'll write about my experience tomorrow morning. From what i've read off of here, erowid, grasscity,etc, i think i'll have a pretty good time. I should be able to handle it too based on the amount of pills i've taken in the past.


Cheers.

400-550mg will be pretty decent, we usually recommend starting lower  (300mg is a good amount for a first experience), but that's not overdoing it either. I don't see how ambien prepared you for this, it is not an NMDA antagonist and has subjectively different effects. Also, I really wouldn't expect visuals from DXM, and if you did get any it would likely be caused by messed up depth perception (i.e. Alice in Wonderland Syndrome type effects) rather than the crazy shit you get if you're prone to hallucinatory effects of the z hypnotics. 


What you'll be in for is a mental experience, and people recommend starting low so you can get a taste of it, it wouldn't be any fun if you had an overwhelming and negative experience with the drug (a lot of people don't like it, or dissociatives in general even). Do tell us how it went though.

Hey guys, I am very sorry for reviving this thread. The reason I am reviving it is because I want to report a trip I had yesterday night and send out yet another DXM warning to the community.


I took 600mg of dxm on an empty stomach... I expected to reach a high 2nd plat or a low 3rd. I entered the 3rd. Out of nowhere whilst watching a movie, I was thinking about my life while watching the movie. I came to conclusions about things that are affecting me right now. I saw them in a scary new light. I realized things I think I wasn't meant to. I put on music and closed my eyes. It felt like I was spinning around on my bed and opened my eyes back to normal. CLosed them again and dared nyself to ride it out, out of nowere I cam to some sort of hallway (not as we know it, more like a sense of one) but i opened my eyes and ruined it. 


I will never do dxm again. It wasn't scary, nor a bad trip but it wasnt good either. Just neutral. 


DXM is now out of my DOC list. Even the first and second platuea seem to be ruined now as I have realized the potential. Oh and it lasted forever had to take sleeping pills to end the second platuea towards the morning.


The DXM dose range is so weird, warning to ALL. Fine line between tripping and having fun.

I still stand by my admonition that anything over 400mg would not be ideal for a first time dose.


I initially said 300 but 400 at the ABSOLUTE most. Yes, 550-600 would probably be okay and maybe this is personal preference talking, but experiencing the first plateau before the proceeding ones lends a bit more to the experience of the second, as the two are quite different (albeit quite the same, if that makes sense), and the ability to contrast in this manner is preferred.


I'll also echo what NKB mentioned that what you'll be experiencing won't be entirely visual. It's more of an emotional and intellectual state of altered consciousness, no lesser than that of the traditional psychedelics like LSD, but quite different nonetheless. I get closed eye visuals at the higher doses, but they're very dark and boring, like gray squiggly lines, a bit like ketamine or MXE. High dose ketamine allows me to see actual entities, elusive phantasms. I believe these to be actual entities of energy in the traditional psychic meaning of the word, but I've gone off on another tangent.


**YMMV.**

Yikes. I'm awake now and ready to tell about my experience last night.


Starting off the only thing i've really done that's made me hallucinate is ambien. Now this was way different. For the first hour i didn't feel anything, about an hour and 30 minutes in i got really really hot, and music was really nice to. 

Then , things started getting really really weird.

My movements started to become mechanical, my vision got really really choppy, depth perception got really distorted. This lasted for about 2 hours.

It got a lot worse after this. I started to notice a giant delay in between me thinking what to say, and when it came out of my mouth. I felt like a little man sitting in a chair in my head. Things started getting weirder and weirder, i called a friend complaining , i walked to go get a friend, i called some more people. Nothing made sense, in my mind i was being "disassembled and reassembled" , it was the most frightful thing ever. I couldn't remember where i was, where i came from, or where i was going. My buddy ended up getting me to bed, but i lied awake for a long long times, being destroyed and put back together over and over. I also came to realize a lot about myself, and i was able to put my emotions into words, it was beautiful.

All in all though, i will never ever touch anything like this again, the horrors that went on in my mind are enough to turn me off from everything.

Thanks for the fun ^○^


forgot to mention:i ended up take 630MG instead of 360-550mg.I weigh 140 ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Why did you ask for advice if you weren't going to listen to any of it? It wouldn't have been so frightful had you started at a reasonable dose and worked your way up, ya'know, got an understanding of the drug.

Ooh, this is one of the BEST aspects of dissociatives. Watching movies and thinking that they're directly relevant to your life and contain hidden messages or inspire introspection that heavily reflects aspects of the film. You probably just made a poor choice of a movie, I'd recommend doing it with one you love and are very comfortable with.

That's because you took 10 mg/kg. That's an incredibly high dose for anybody. I waited until I had been doing half that dose for 6 months to try that level of DXM. You should have started with a fifth of that dose and worked your way up. I hate to say it like this, but what you did was patently bullheaded and dangerous. You could have had a cyp2d6 enzyme deficiency and ended up in the hospital like that for a week. You could have ended up with serotonin syndrome because of some research you clearly failed to do. I hope you take this as a lesson to do more research before you jump blindly into something you think you understand.


And try taking 300mg. You'll notice that it's a completely different kind of experience.

**Lemon Juice on DXM Poli**


Tried it today. It does not work.

It feels the same as it would if i were to take the bottle, its taking forever to kick in still.

Just putting some information because it is a myth at the moment and im just saying its bogus.

OP, I'm probably going to close this, since it's kind of a pointless thread with no question to answer nor possibility of discussion (and it's unclear exactly what you're getting at). We let things stay open before doing anything to new folks' threads, so feel free to weigh in/clarify.

The lemon juice was an attempt to use its acid to remove the polisterex coating, to make the trip stronger and kick in faster.

It did not work, however, but something interesting did happen.

The trip took even longer to kick in, but the weird part is, it kept getting stronger and stronger for almost 6 hours!! It got stronger than one bottle of delsym ever would have gotten. I was for sure at a 3rd plateau even though delsym makes it impossible to get there. Even weirder is that this peak lasted for another 4 hours. I was at least at the second plateau for at least 24 hours.


The only things that we(me and my gf) did that could have effected this trip to be this powerful and long with just one bottle of delsym are:

We took ecstasy the night before, but they were bunk piperazines, so I dont know.

It soaked in lemon juice for 2 hours.

We drank a lot of gatorade as we heard that it helps it kick in faster.


I have done this drug countless times, and a majority of those being a 5oz bottle of delsym. This time with the same dose, It was insane. And it wasn't just me, my gf had the same exact thing going for her.


What a new year.

While some of our subforums encourage a new topic to be created for every question (BDD for example), PD is not one of them. We try to keep things neat and tidy, due to the breadth of discussion we allow, and threads will be merged with the appropriate B&D thread at some point unless the topic is interesting enough to warrant its own thread. 


People do check these threads to answer to questions. If you look at this one, or others, I think you will notice that.

Definitely, DXM is an oddball even amongst dissociatives. Some people may not like that, but the higher plateaux definitely have a unique character about them. Hard to put my finger on it, or perhaps, I haven't really indulged proper in dissociatives in too long to be able to word it well.

Pills, Pros: no taste, no artificial flavors. The added sweeteners for flavoring of syrup can sometimes be attributed to nausea. 

      cons: gotta swallow a lot of pills. May* take longer to kick in. 


Syrup. Pros: easy to take quickly. Very easy measurement of dosage. Some users report liking the taste. May* have a quicker onset than pills. 

         Cons: Specific artificial sweeteners are attributed to nausea at high doses. Some users resent the taste.

Here be a dosage calculator for thee: [http://dxm.darkridge.com/calc.html](http://dxm.darkridge.com/calc.html)


You ought to do some reading if you aren't familiar with the plateaux, but basically depending on dosage the experience can take on some very different forms. There isn't a linear dosage response curve, there's some major qualitative shifts depending. First is completely uninteresting, second is a bit like drunkenness with some stoning. Those are the lower. Higher would be the third, which is pretty damn trippy and dissociative, fourth being a hole. And let's just not talk about sigma.


Really you ought to check out some of the links on the first page of the thread to familiarize yourself with things. I will say though that it is important to take ~100mg dose first to check for CYP2D6 enzyme deficiency, if you are able to really feel this, and it lasts for a long period of time, then you lack the ability to metabolize the drug properly and any further experimentation is recommended only under extreme caution.


Most don't like this drug, and taking it in OTC antitussive preparations certainly adds an extra dimension of nausea and unpleasantness. I'd say cannabis is a good call for its anti-emetic effects, but it reaaally potentiates this stuff. Of course, it is always possible to buy pure powder or extract it (unless you're lazy like some of us). So, don't be surprised if you end up hating it (A good number of us have had some great experiences with it though).

the taste of robotussin cough syrup is far superior to the generic brands around here (in Canada) lol. I like the taste in comparison, for some reason i can imagine the taste and visualize it; other syrups just taste nasty and thick. 


Robo gels are relatively easy to get down if you swallow 8-10 at a time, don't swallow one pill after another as that'll definitely make you gag. The syrup is pretty easy to chug but disgusting. I find they both take about the same time to kick in. I stick to robo gels now, it's just more convenient

According to the online DXM dose calculator ( [http://dxm.darkridge.com/calc.html](http://dxm.darkridge.com/calc.html) ) 600ml Robitussin for a 150lb person  exceeds a the maximum recommended dose for a 4th plateu trip.  Taking that much would be a bad idea and could be toxic ( serotonin syndrome ).


If you miss-typed and meant 600mg, that would put you in the 3rd plateu.  Strong dissociative trips are of an entirely different character than psychedelics and can be scary.  DXM is powerful at high doses and should be respected. That said you'll probably live through a 600mg (not ml) trip, even if some of it freaks you out.  I however would start at a no more than a second plateu dose first to get a taste of the DXM experience first before going full on dissociative.


To clarify what I mean by scary/freaky, I once took 1200mg.  I weighed 235 at the time so that measurred out to a 3rd plateau trip.  I experienced full blown reality melting open eyed hallucinations ( not illusionations like with most psyches ).  Also, for the first time ever I had somatic hallucinations where I would feel and see my body stretch and contort which was really amazing/scary.  Mentally, at times I felt like an outside observer while I was being manipulated by an alien intelligence.  It was very "lovecraftian".  While it was an incredible experience, I was honestly spooked for a couple weeks after.

Thanks. Ive decided to go with the syrup because some of the pills have polyethylene glycol in them, which, Im understanding to be some form of laxative. 

Id prefer not to get the shits half way through my trip..

I used to chug tussin until it started making me puke mid chug. 


Robogels always worked great and eliminated the nasty taste.


I can't even drink Coke anymore because that is what I would use to swallow the pills. YUCK


Have fun mate, I had some real fun times RoboTrippin!

**A question about DXM**


I am a fairly heavy dxm user, Just took 3 bottles of dxm robo pills(900mg) I have not taken this much in a long time.. Any idea what to expect from this dose and any suggestions as for things to do while tripping.. currently planning on listing to some trippy music:D

The pills take longer to kick in but seem to be slightly more intense and they also are easier to down, no nasty syrup

Syrup on the other hand tasted bad but kicks in faster and tends to make ones trip a little faster

It depends on your tolerance among other things. If you had a high dxm tolerance in the past chances are you still have it now. Dxm tolerance never really goes away not to mention the magic is lost for some people. On the other hand If your worried you might freak out or have a bad experience I recommend weed with this as as it guarantees it will go over good for me at least.

I think the trouble is your stomach has trouble absorbing the pure powder, and this can lead to disappointing experiences given the dosage taken. If ya dissolve it in something like PEG or whatevs this problem can be avoided. As for the possibility of scammers selling bunk shit, it's possible, that's always a risk when buying though, isn't it? Take what precautions you can.

Quite possibly, but you might as well start on the lower end, assuming that you don't. Discrepancy between experience had and what you should have had at a given dosage may give you an idea of what tolerance is present.

**DXM - length of trip**


on the famous DXM faq on erowid mr. white says 1st and 2nd plateaus last about 6 hours. Of course the length of your trip varies in each person, and for me a 2nd plateau lasts almost 12 hours.. well I can't sleep until at least 10 hours have passed. I recently moved back home.. and let's just say my freedom is a little restricted now in terms of drug use. I was wondering if anyone knew how to shorten a DXM trip or of something you can safely take that allows you to sleep before 10 hours has passed. Pot helps me pass out every night, but on DXM it only intensifies what I'm feeling. I can't trip during the day here, so it would be ideal if I could trip in the evening without having to stay up all night. any tips?

Theres that dxm that is slow release that makes you trip much longer but not as hard, it could be that you are using that.

OMG good question! I feel like an idiot... didn't even notice the little '8' on the pill bottle. so yes... i am. i hate drinking the syrup, tastes awful and i find it nearly impossible not to puke. and that's the only brand I've seen that sells DXM in pill form so.. I guess I have limited options.

But the "up to 8 hours" kind is plain old DXM HBr. It's delysm (12 hour version) that's extended release. I'd be worried that you are CYP2D6 enzyme deficient, custard. In which case this drug will last inordinately long since one with this deficiency can't metabolize it properly.


Also, after doing dissociatives, I generally can't sleep for 24 hours unless it's a low dose (2nd plateau if DXM I'm able to sleep on USUALLY but not if I dose over an extended period of time).


In short, expect sever insomnia if messin' with this stuff.

That's impressive, but yeah any appreciable dissociative dose for me will leave me completely unable to sleep for 24 hours. I'll usually just lie down in bed for the 8 hours I should be sleeping (to let the vertigo pass and messed up thought patterns pass), and my mind will wander off and think dream-vision things I won't remember, but I won't ever actually sleep.

DXM can effect you very very differently depending on person and mood, i used to do it almost daily for a little over a year from dosages around 300mg up to about 1.5 grams.


the actual duration of high and afterglow can be tricky to determine when you're smoking due to it's synergizing qualities.


I'd say a 1st or 2nd dxm plateau trip, the actual trip will last you about 5 hours and a long-lasting feeling of just brain-dead, restlessness and confusion (the "afterglow" of dxm).


On high level doses of non-extract, the time released dxm like dxm HBr time release or DXM Polistrex I've tripped for over 24 hours straight.  Considering the rate it metabolizes you need a higher dose but those trips can last well over 12 hours, easily (not recommened though, the metabolism rate can change from person to person as well, and considering you need higher doses with these, it can end badly).

Thanks for the tips - but seems I am still where I started. I guess if I want to avoid syrup/puking I need to stick to those long-lasting pills. Or if I want a shorter high I can man up and try to chug down some of that gooey mess. I guess I was more asking if there is anything anyone has taken that combats the long lasting stimulating effect of DXM and allows them to fall asleep while still tripping. But perhaps it's unwise to mix anything with such an intense drug in the first place.

FYI, gonna merge this with the appropriate B&D thread within the next 24 hours.


Also, it would definitely be unwise to mix DXM with any powerful CNS depressants to try to get to sleep. Just choose when to indulge when you can afford to be a sleep deprived zombie the next day, 'tis what I do.

I have never had it last 10 hours. And usually, i can go to sleep very easily after the peak (which may feel like 10 hours due to the time distortion , but is usually only few hours or so) . If you are not doing anything obviously stupid, such as what the above person said about taking the time released dxm,  and if you are not exxagerating 

the duration in your head, it is quite possible that you have are low in the liver enzyme that metabolizes it. this does not mean you have a bad liver, it just means that 

everyone has different amounts of various enzymes, since birth.  wikipedia suggests that 1 in 10 caucasians do not produce much of the enzyme to metabolize dxm. 

if thats the case, the dxm stays in your system longer, and you have higher levels in your body. There is nothing you can do about this. you simply cant do dxm and

expect to be sober in a reasonable amount of time. your body simply doesnt metabolize it at the normal rate.  


There isnt a solution.

Hmm. Well a couple of you seem to think I have an enzyme deficiency, but some of you are also saying it makes you insomniacs too.. so who knows. And apparently the '8 hour' gelcaps are just plain ol DXM. Although I do find the high is longer lasting and less intense than when I drink the syrup. Anyway. Seems there's not much I can do. SLeep deprived zombie sounds about right. I guess I'm just not used to the lack of freedom from being back home.. now I get to be all sneaky like back in the old days.. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

**DXM and Cimetidine**


Despite [this](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/302541-1200mg-dxm-1800mg-cimetidine) experience, I am amazed at how well Cimetidine has potentiated DXM for me today. 


Okay, so here's my situation: Been using DXM (@2.817mgDXM/kgWIEGHT but one time last week as well as right now I'm @ 5.634mgDXM/kgWIEGHT) a little more than every other day for the past week. Say, four out of the seven days. Today is the end of the binge... 


Anyways, I hadn't taken DXM for about 40 days before I indulged again last week. I also had stopped taking the piracetam and choline bartartrite I had been using for a very long time. 


 Now, I'm on suboxone maintainence. Today I took: 

----------------------------------------------------------------

t-2.00: 2.5g Piracetam & 3g Choline Bartartrite

t-1.00: 1.5 cups strong coffee 

-------

t+0.00: 5.634mgDXM/kgWIEGHT (in other words about 460mg DXM HBr)

t+1.15: 1000mg Cimetidine 

t+2.00: 8mg Suboxone (with ethanol to increase sublingual BA)

t+2.15: 125mg Benedryl/diphen

t+2.45: 600mg Cimetidine 

----------------------------------------------------------------


How much do you think I'm destroying myself with this (specifically this) combo? 


Regardless, I must say. Fucking fuck yea do I feel good. Not fucked up good. Just healthy euphoric. Heh, well, probably not *that* healthy ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And as an aside Cimetidine is EXCEPTIONALLY useful in potential the psychedelic/dissociative aspect of DXM. And some suboxone on top just makes this cake superb. perb.  Cheers!!! %)

While I don't have any precise info on hand to prove this (gotta make dinner so can't look it up right now), but I really don't think you should do more than 600mg of cimetidine .

It's not going to kill you or anything, but from what I've read 400mg seems to be plenty to potentiate, though some people go higher. Taking in excess of 1g is unnecessary, and not too healthy for you.

**Help please help me fast! (DXM)**


I am 14 (yes I know I am very joung) I have only taken DXM 6 times the shortest distance inbetween was only 2 weeks. I have never mixed my doses with other drugs. I have only taken PURE 30mg capsels with no other subtances in it. I waigh 60kg (before i waight a little more now a little less like 1 to 3 kg) and I am 174cm big. I am very athletic. 

(all my doses of DXM were never above 300mg I have never went above the second pletau usally I just go to the beginning of it because other wise it makes me feel to stupid!) 

No to the real problem I have had a hangover (It felt like I was high for 2 weeks !!!NOT FUNNY!!!)  that lasted 2 weeks the last time I took DXM well after those to weeks it started over again I noticed all the side effekts like fast heard beat, swaet breaks, drowsiness, short term memory, depresions (wich is very common for people in my age to have)  and stuff like that feeling difrent like a little drunk. And it wont go away yesturday was the third week and it still isent gone yes it has gotten better but I feel it got worse today. Like today I woke up at 5am and had short dreams. I was only like half a sleep and I was ale to wake my self up but when ever I closed my eyes and fell a sleep I had wierd dreams. I woke up about 20 times and each time I had a new dream. Now I feel a little drowsy and I have been having depresions(AGAIN!!!!!)... I am so close to telling my parents about the whole situation and going to a docter. But I am scared becasue I ahve had verious drug problems befror. 


I Havent taken any drugs in the last week and wont take any ever again I jsut want this to stop what can I do how long will it take. 


If you dont help me its jsut a matter of time I will tell my parents... 


If it stays this way for ever I might as well just comit suiside.... kill my self then it will be better ...

you will be fine, whatever is happening to you is more than likely psychological at this point. Also, don't kill yourself over this, plenty of times after using dxm for months i felt like i had brain damage, but really i was just too fucked up all of the time. I'd be willing to get that you were just having an off day, plenty of times i feel disconnected or strange without even touching a drug. 


try not to worry about it and i bet it'll go away

do you take any other drugs at the moment? if yes, then you should quit them too (especially weed). also don't be stupid and think about killing yourself. imo it is not very likely that you stay this way "forever". if you consider going to a doctor, then do so. you took a strong psychoactive drugs numerous times in a short space of time. shit happens, but you really should try and pull yourself out. you're only 14, man, it will be alright. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


good luck


ps: exercising helps me really to get rid of nasty thoughts and puts things in perspective for me. i started riding my bike very often to get to places last summer and it really helped me stay sane ;D

I'd give it a little more time before telling your parents and your doctor Lars. If you've coped with it for a couple of weeks, try and survive for another couple of weeks and see how it goes. Take it day by day, try and keep up your normal routine, or relax a little more if you feel stressed.  


I'm not sure if there's anything your doctor can really do for you other than offer reassurance. There's no magic drug going to cure you - so even if you do tell him you'll probably not get any help. And having "drug-user" on your medical record from the age of 14 isn't going to be good. 


The only answer is to avoid DXM and don't take it anymore.

You brain will be fine, just stay away from DXM for a while. Also don't even think of something as horrible as commiting suicide - it is never worth it. Many of the left over effects from drugs will disappear and you will see that you have many years ahead of you, and life can be absolutely amazing! Suicide is one of the most selfish things anyone can do - if you are worried about your parents reaction to the drug, then imagine their reaction to loosing a son! You will be fine, I assure you - at your age things feel like they are the end of the world, but as you go through life time and time again you will realize life is full of so many wonderful surprises and new experiences... 


This will pass, and you have so much wonder ahead of you in life =] Also there isn't really anything shameful about using psychedelics, even if parents misunderstand it, it can be used for expanding the mind and understandings of the world. If you were using a horrible hard drug like Heroin or Cocaine then I could understand feeling full out guilt - but all you took was a psychedelic something that can be used to explore your mind. The only thing is you realized that spacing out trips between longer periods of time in essential to psychedelics. Just be safe and try not to do large sessions close to each other, but I would completely stay away from DXM for a while. You will be fine.

If you're so worried about alternative perceptual models being integrated and utilized into your waking life, stop taking these substances.

There are days I feel like that without drugs for sure, because these compounds can have very serious psychological repercussions.

Your brain is highly plastic, especially at your age, so what you do can shape how you think.

Abstinence from all drugs can be helpful, but the fact is, if you want to continue this type of research, be prepared to accept different ways of thinking.

thank you for all these wonderfull replys I have been waiting for a site like this which can help me undertsand. For anyone out their who thinks I wont stop. I am never gonna touch a drug again. Maby alcohol but not until Im atlest 18. I hope this will not have any long lasting effeks. Well I have heard of a other case where a 15 year old did the same and had really long depresions I think I just ge worried becasue it doesnt go back to normal fast enoughf I will try waiting a few more weeks if it get wors I will tell my parent an go to a doc and a pychiatran if it goes away I will tell them when im like 20 or 30 and well loughf about it. I will tell anyone else who wants to try drugs or who is in drugs. I understand why drugs are illegale now and I never went that far that I was able to check out my inside I only felt good at some points...  

If their are any long lasting brain damges I will have to live with them... I think I do it to my self though by making my self think I have them I kind of start thinking I have them and it happens. 


thank you so much. And I actually didnt think about having drug abuse in my record thanks for that to... 

But a drug is a drug so one or a other way my parents but be embarresd if they found out

That's imho a sign of you feeling better or at least not worse enough to not crave for it.

 ( i`m not hundred percent sure if i`m cool with my statement. because i craved for things while feeling bad and knowing it will make it worse if i do it again. and actually did. 

but some things left me feeling so bad for too many times that i would no more crave for them.  Amphetamine for example took me about 8 years to finally have learned my lessons.)


However give your brain a rest. And most important, follow your daily routine. The more activities the better.

You will feel better after time.

i was not talking about dxm. i talked about amphetamine. and i din´t use it 8 years straight.

some years i didn´t touch it at all. mostly a few times a year. 

sometimes more often and most use was almost 6 months daily.

but i had several psychotic breaks after tweaking too much.

that happened just too often and the last one was too hardcore. that was 3 years ago. 

i didn´t touch it again.


and about dxm.

the following is something i wrote on another forum about dissociative induced mania 

(it´s kinda off topic here, but it might interest you).

i used dxm about 5 months almost daily. 

300mg when i got up and 300mg in the evenings. and on the weekends i took trip doses from 600mg-1,2g

i had a few breaks where only took benzos and or amphetamine.

multinutrient supplements, cod liver oil supplements, mixed nuts, whole grains, mixed berries and bananas, grapefruits, all the protein you can get like seafood, wheat, poultry, beans, beef, and a lot of clean water.


this diet in combination with sobriety should clean you right up. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) remember your brain stays in development until around 25 years old and has an early window of opportunity when it benefits most from experience. stay in school.

If you wouldn't like that, which I guess you wouldn't right? then lets not support criminalising other drug users.

when the dxm and its effects leave your system, you will feel fine. Drugs have a way of psychologically making you feel crazy,depressed, suicidal, and everything in between. Just know that you will inevitably feel fine and you need to lay off the DXM for a bit.

urgh god no thats not what i meen... I know why they were made illegal not becasue the police wants to take us the great feeling away that it gives us but because people are not the same when their high they get adicted and they damage them selves with out being ale to stop. You can prettty much control anything in your normal state but once your hoooked your hooked this is what the state wants to cut down and you will only be able to stop when you understood this... This is why all the legal drugs like alcohol, weed(just in holand and california if you get a perscription) and nut meg are legalbecause the high they give it not adicting enoughf to rewin a life. And weed is just illegal because it opens gateways to new drugs that why they are debating if it is supose to be legal lised...

Kid, most of the people on this board **are** like you.. We just don't think it sucks.


DXM is a dissociative, not a psychedelic.

They're both hallucinogens, but act by different physiological mechanisms.

You should stop taking DXM asap. I think DXM may have screwed up your ability to spell common words. Bad spelling is one of the first signs of drug induced brain damage.

Does DXM cause brain damage?


From personal, long-term experience, no, but I've heard of people who say it shook them up with thoughts of insanity after their first time. If you can't handle it please don't do it. About a quarter of people report feeling DXM effects up to two weeks after dosing because of some biological, enzyme deficiency.

I think you will be fine dude, time heals everything after many of my trips I have felt strange for weeks especially if they had negative vibes. Just do what people have said, eat healthy, get exercise, stay busy, meet up with friends etc. Its good that you have decided to stop using drugs, Whether it sticks or not you cant say but overall that is the best choice especially if you suffer from depression and remember you dont have to cut out all drugs completely, what about a joint now and again or a few beers. your a teenager, and these days people are starting things younger (Were I am from majority of people started smoking grass before they were even teenagers and by the age of 14 have probably tried a good few substances. Not that I think this is anything but recless behaviour.) A good plan is wait till you are older, while people go back and forth about pro's and con's of drugs there are definate effects on still developing brains. Good luck, take it easy

It's alright, I've been through similar things. It just takes time, the first step is to stop worrying. The quicker you can stop stressing the quicker it heals!

You're young and your brain can fix itself easily. You sound like you're getting panic attacks, mixed with puberty and some depersonalization.

It's alright, give it time, you'll be great! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) When I was young I went through similar things, and I'm still a smart motherfucker ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I just registered to this website just to ensure you you'll be fine ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And it is a very good decision of yours to never take drugs (especially DXM) anymore. Because the way I see it is this; 

I personally find drugs very important, simply because it gives you different perspectives on life and therefore really broadens you horizon and fearing drugs without a reason is among the most foolish choices that society can make. The problem, however, is that drugs are so powerful that only a small part of the people can truly handle it without getting backstabbed by the dark side of drugs. 


But if you manage to quit (or control) it, and when I read your posts I think you can, then to me you'll belong to the very most strongest people in the world. You were open to something new, you were almost destroyed by it, but you hit back with sheer willpower and prevailed. Keep up the good work, and you will win a psychological battle that consumed even the strongest men. 


I mean, you're stronger than Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Each bottle should last 12 hours?  In theory anyway.


3 bottles sounds like a lot, I'm no DXM expert though...

A friend of mine from high school downed 2 bottles of Delsym one night, and woke up the next morning with his jaw muscles completely locked, meaning he couldn't open his mouth for multiple hours.  He told me this was very painful, and had never happened to him with regular DXM.  


My advice to you would be to start small, and work your way up to the higher doses.  Everyone reacts differently, and you never know when you're going to be the one with the freak side effect.

Delsym? Three five oz bottles?


Too much, and on top of that you would be deluded for days. Mix one 5oz delsym with 300-400mg dxm hbr and you'll feel like you're climbing through the plateaus about two hours in. As always, dxm must be the single and only active ingredient listed.

When I was a kid I used to do a lot of DXM and I usually did delsym, I'd generally take about 1 gram of dxm for a very strong trip, which was one large bottle. Tolerance might have been a factor, although at the time of the bulk of this I was a skinny 14 year old so who knows. And yeah, it lasts around 8-12 hours.


Really tussin is better for tripping off of then delsym, but delsym is a lot easier to drink. Still, DXM Hbr is really what you want, not polystirex.

Robotussin makes pure dxm gel pills but I'd go for robotussin cough syrup. DXM must be the only active ingredient listed, doesn't really matter if you choose syrup or pills beyond that point.


It doesn't matter much. Basically, Hbr hits faster and in my opinion has a stronger, more psychedelic high. Polystirex is easy to drink and lasts a long time but it also takes several hours to really come up.  


Also, polystirex is worse for your liver and stomach. 


With DXM Polystirex, less of the DXM is converted to DXO than with Hbr. DXO is good, highly dissociative.  


With Polystirex i usually would take 500 mg to 1 gram for a strong experience (as in, I couldn't stand up for many hours). One gram of DXM [polystirex should be fully dissociative if you don't have a high tolerance. With Hbr the doses are different and I don't quite recall them because it's been years since I did dex, but I found this here chart (first table)- [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml)


I think the doses for Hbr are lower, maybe 500-800 mg, but you should read up more instead of just taking my word for it.


If you're looking for a proper psychedelic experience, Hbr seems better than Polystirex to me.

What? You want to hit 4th plateau?


Delsym isn't strong enough on its own, IMO. The polistirex version takes a long time to come-up and lasts for far too long. But, if you combine the polistirex and hbr formulations in one trip there's a good chance you'll achieve the 4th.


Like I said earlier, you'll start at a low plateau and then feel like you're climbing up through them. Dose the HBr and polistirex at the same time. Usually I don't get nauseous and throw up but I have every time I've dosed this way, so be prepared. You'll feel the HBr come on first, and then after two hours the Delsym will kick in and start elevating you through the plateaus. Take enough HBr to achieve a weak 3rd plateau. For me this would be about 600mg. When the 5oz bottle of Delsym kicks in you'll begin your trip to the stars.


I've only ever achieved a 4th plateau once and I saw god multiple times in many different forms. It was a shape-shifter.

If your hell bent on using Delsym, do a water extraction...


Use a 2 Liter bottle, pour your syrup in it, fill the rest with water until about an inch or two til the top, shake it all about for a little while, turn it upside down and go to sleep! When you wake up, powder in the cap!

no i totally dont care but be careful dont do it more than just  once and do not go further than the end of the sedond pletau and dont forget to do the elgic test by taken 60mg and waiting fir an half an hour then if nothing happens take the rest. remember that it is extremly impotant to have a good setting eslse you will have a bad high. remember everything obver the second pletau is or might be brain dmaging. Please amd really please domt take it more than at very most twice simce their is a mental addiction and once you have it its not as esay as you think its like sex (fapping) addiction you really cant stop. Maby you should do it alone to not get anyone else in the situation. did you read what i had? you might get a 2week hangover like me. And the high will last up to 3days including the afterglow! 

and remember to be cReful dince it is a unsafe drug. You will feel side effeks which will occure maby stong maby week. 

And kne more thing remember that dxm is a real drug and is not as good as everyone always sais. If i were you i would just buy 4 nutmegs and eat them its like dxm but you will have halusinations with out side effeks and remember not ever to mix dxm with anything else espeshialy MAO Hemmers. I once took dxm and the next week i took nut meg and a week later i got sick for 7 days it was horrible. Please be carefull and remember it is adicting and next weeks is my 4th week and i still feel the stuff and i will never ever ever take it again! please tell us what exsacly your gonna do and what kind of person you are if you have depresions or anything else?

you will only have flashbacks if your experience with dxm was very traumatic, like seeing someone get shot in front of you, things like that can get stuck in your head. If it was just a strong or unexpected experience you'll more than likely be completely fine and worrying about it will just make it worse. Just relax you'll be okay.

lol


DXM is fine if you do it more than once, it's really no more dangerous than other dissocciatives; brain damage hasn't been proven and there's nothing to suggest that 3rd and 4th plateau doses are harmful (or any more harmful than lower doses), so long as you aren't indirectly harming yourself accidentally (blacking out and falling down). Yes it may hurt some people psychologically but dissociatives aren't for everyone. As well, i think you mean 60 milligrams rather than grams, 60 grams of dxm would be a bit much for an allergy test ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) read this to learn about the dangers and how to be as safe as possible [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/) not that i recommend you trying it again but it doesn't hurt to know more about it.


i'd be really interested to hear about tripping on DXM with DP/DR. I somehow developed DP/DR over the last few years and since then DXM makes me space out insanely bad, not necessarily in a bad way but it feels different than it used to.

If it was just a strong or unexpected experience you'll more than likely be completely fine and worrying about it will just make it worse. Just relax you'll be okay.

> DXM is fine if you do it more than once, it's really no more dangerous than other dissocciatives; brain damage hasn't been proven and there's nothing to suggest that 3rd and 4th plateau doses are harmful (or any more harmful than lower doses), so long as you aren't indirectly harming yourself accidentally (blacking out and falling down). Yes it may hurt some people psychologically but dissociatives aren't for everyone. As well, i think you mean 60 milligrams rather than grams, 60 grams of dxm would be a bit much for an allergy test ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) read this to learn about the dangers and how to be as safe as possible [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/) not that i recommend you trying it again but it doesn't hurt to know more about it.

WTF? The kid said he wasn't ever going to take drugs again for the rest of his life. I suggested that there are some drugs that are worth taking at some point in his life. I didn't say go out and take them tomorrow. Try and think before you post - it might stop you from writing such fucking drivel.

long term psychological damage is possible but it doesn't happen to every one. I would give it a month before you feel completely normal, if after a month you are still having problems then you should consider getting outside help, not that i think you are damaged forever but you may just need to talk to someone about your experiences and problems with depression. I'm not sure about your heart, sometimes mine goes crazy when i am under stress, other times i just think it is irregular when i am fine, i try not to think about it as i just make myself worry more. 


do you have any friends you can talk to about your depression? or even a guidance counselor at school? 


Eating and staying hydrated will definitely help but i think talking to someone would help just as much. Even if DXM really messed you up psychologically you can use this awakening to deal with issues you may have had before or were going to have later in life. It is much easier to deal with your problems as they come up rather than letting them go untreated until you are much older. Your experience can be a positive thing that led you to get the help you need rather than something that permanently damaged you.

**wow omg 15 ounces of 12 hour delsym**


yea its beeen about 36 hours now im finally comming down. i couldnt barely walk before. i was not inside my body. it felt too small. i got lost going to the bathroom and had to curl up in a ball at one point to find mymyself. i couldnt stand to look in the mirror i looked like death and my eyes looked disgusting maybe it was just me tripping but idk. even ar 24 hours i was a mess still ,y mom loooked blurry ii couldnt even see her down the hall as i tried to avoid her.  but during the first 12 hpurs i became one with the iTunes visualizer with music [playing. random shit. rap at first but then like the backstreet boys even played. and it was still cool. my body was just in compleete shock i was walking like a zombie. my legs n shit felt stiff. it was out of control. everything was wack. crazy fucking trippppp. od rather gp the regular dxm way tho. this 36 hour shit aint for me. i think at points i even thought my brother was with me and shit. hes away. but that aspect remindedd me of my ayuasha trip where i didnt even fully break through with syrian rue and mimosa hostilis

This does not sound too serious, however, should it persists much longer I'd see your family doctor or a urologist. DXM deifinitely can cause urinary hesitancy while active, and I wouldn't put it out of the realm of possibility that it left your urinary muscles sort of whacky. I'd guess it should go away fairly soon.

DXM is a dissociative which is covered by Psychedelic drugs (check the BDD guidelines) - hope that is okay ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's not that serious. DXM can temporarily enlarge your prostate some which puts pressure against your ureters (tubes from your bladder to your penis). It can also make you feel like you need to pee when normally you would not need to pee. This makes you feel the struggle of pushing out pee when there is not much pee to push.

**Best way to dose on DXM(Gel Pills)**


I have 300 mgs worth of DXM gel pills(20 pills, 15 mg's each) and Im wondering how I should dose on them. I have a fully empty stomach and wondering if I should take them all at once or seperate doses(1 minute each pill). I've taken it before so I don't have that thing 1/10 people have and haven't fully experienced it because I had a full stomach and threw up. Please and Thank you for your imput.

Take them all at once. (Don't try to swallow a handful of pills.)


You are going to have some kind of discomfort from the pills period. Because of the coating.

First of all I would take one every 10 seconds...

Second I would eat 30 min after your last pill or 2 or three hours after your last pill

I have used 40 of those gelcaps on several occasions. I take them 10 at a time with some water. Once they kick in hunger is no longer a concern.

Just eat a little something, it really doesn't make a HUGE difference if your stomach has food or not. At least it never did for me.


Me and my friends used to get high, smash food, then take the same robopills. One bottle a person at least. Fucks you up pretty good...


You could always do an extraction too. Search google for Agent Lemon tek.

I've never had erection troubles from it, but after recreational doses even the next day I can't come (I think it's the residual SSRI effects). I imagine a low (100 mg) dose in a person like me would allow marathon sex with orgasm still being possible eventually (and not too much dissociative fog). Probably best to test it with wanking first to see how you react if you plan on using it for endurance or you risk inducing a sore battered vagina. If any one tries it please post dose/weight/time to orgasm.

I live with my girlfriend so I have the information you seek... Usually this happens from DXM polisterex as it is long long lasting so it has a VERY nice afterglow that has waves of euphoria and those waves of euphoria transfer into sexual energy and then I have extreme amounts of sexual energy and the thing is, it seems like you can't climax but you are close to the climax for a really long time and it is quite amazing!

I used DXM 3 times in the course of 3 months, and since then I've had tinnitus (ringing in the ears) 24/7 and I have also developed a condition called visual snow. My last trip went somehow went horribly wrong after a 333mg dose. Within the first hour, my body felt like it was running VERY hot. My head felt like it was burning and I knew something was wrong. I went to take a cold shower and I remember as I was standing in the shower, I felt a strong sensation of burning/anxiety/jitteryness pulse all throughout my legs. It's a feeling I'll never forget.Since then I've felt mentally slower than I used to be and my memory is not as good as it once was. Sometimes when I smoke weed now, it makes me feel dissociated and not myself. 


Over the next few days I felt fine until I stayed up all night working on a project. At some point during the night, I started feeling completely spun out similar to the comedown of LSD. I couldn't focus on anything for longer than a few seconds. I ended up going to school the next day still having not slept, and I started to feel very dehydrated. My skin was clammy and sweaty, and I felt very hot the entire day. I felt mentally whacked and out of it. Over the next few days, I was not able to sleep and never felt like I came down from my trip. At night my thoughts were racing out of control, and I felt like I was going through episodes of psychosis. Eventually I had to go to the hospital. I didn't tell them I had taken DXM, but they attributed my racing thoughts to extreme anxiety. They prescribed xanax and this helped me sleep. I also saw a psychiatrist who told me that my neurotransmitters were fried and out of control so he prescribed me seroquel to help bring me back to normal and help me sleep at night. 


Over the next few weeks I slowly recovered. I'm not sure what went wrong that day, but it's been a year since then and I still don't feel 100% normal. I feel like I've mostly recovered but there are still some lingering effects still effecting me. 


If you've tried DXM or are thinking about trying it, I would strongly suggest that you don't use DXM. While the trip might be entertaining, there's just not enough research and knowledge available about the long-term effects of it and what it is actually doing to your brain. If this happened to me on a low dosage, I feel like it could happen to anyone. It's not worth it and there are better psychedelic drugs available that are MUCH safer.


Edit: I also think it's important to add that I tripped on acid a month or two ago and the the trip was AMAZING, however the comedown was extremely unpleasant. It took me back to that spun out and out of it feeling that I experienced from DXM, which is scary for me. I wasn't able to sleep for a while and my anxiety was kicking into high gear. Fortunately I was finally able to fall asleep, and I woke up feeling 100% normal and refreshed.

yeah, but you are being biast.. just because YOU had a bad experience from it, doesn't mean that other people shouldn't take it. and you are also wrong in the fact that there is a ton of research done on this drug. Have you seen William White's faqs? I have had experience from other drugs that gave me what you describe... Bad anxiety after, visual snow... all that jazz. But it goes away... and you realize it has alot to do with whats in your head..

**DXM Abrupt Trip End**


Hello all,


I'm brand new to the site and I figured I would get in and start posting.  I am going to start off by posing a question to anybody that may have some sort of idea about why this happened.


I took 450 mg of DXM (Hbr) in the form of gel caps, each containing 15mg of DXM each.  Despite the fact that I am moderately experienced with DXM, I was thrown into this trip at a decent 2nd plateau dose.  Initially, I was struck with a minor paranoia, but eventually it subsided into a great trip.


Approximately 3 hours after that initial dose, I was feeling slightly dissociated, music was incredibly driving and my mind was racing with scattered and crazy thoughts.  I decided I wanted to take my remaining 120 mg of DXM, which I had planned to do earlier but hadn't gotten around to.  When I did however, I almost immediately felt a cessation in the strong psychedelic effects of my initial DXM dosage.  I am wondering WHY this could be??


My best guess is something having to do with DXM's neuroprotective effects at NMDA Receptors, but I'm looking for something a little more concrete and explanatory.  Thanks for the help in advance! I was loving the trip but was really let-down and depressed when this sudden wall was hit.

Boy its been a long time since ive refreshed myself about dxm.  Kinda stayed away from it after a kilo of dxm lol.  Anyway....


DXM and redosing will jump ya high up faster than a super bouncy ball on a concrete pad thrown by a baseball pitcher.    Im not sure why you hit a wall and came down.  That has never happened to me.  Only questions I can think of are ...  Have you taken any prescriptions? Other drugs? ect...  DXM can be effected by those quite ait.

Never heard of this happening, I cannot speculate as to why it occurred.


Oh wait, you just said the "strong psychedelic effects" not all effects, and it three hours, I guess you just slipped out of that plateau or whatever. <shrugs>

i sort of doubt i'd ever even try it or anything...but what does DXM really feel like? is it a suppressant that makes you tired? i say i'd never try it but i guess i probably have...many times over years ago...considering i have robo-tripped on robo dm. so my statement is stupid now so let me rephrase it...what does straight dxm...without any other bs feel like in low and high doses? is the trippy feeling the desired effect from it?

Thanks for the speculation.  Yeah, I'm guessing that the more "psychedelic effects" were probably close to resolving themselves anyway.  It was just such a peculiar and abrupt change that I wanted to know if there was perhaps a scientific explanation.  But alas.

**Discussion about Dextromethorphan**


This will probably be a few paragraphs long, I just feel like typing out my thoughts, maybe start a discussion about it.


I been a dex head for about 2 years now. A friend introduced it to me one night and it was one hell of a ride I loved it but after months of abuse and a few months of constant cough syrup abuse I hit the ceiling of my tolerance to DXM. I had a complete 100% tolerance to DXM at one point I had a big old bottle of syrup and took about 1,000MG. Now 1 gram of DXM should have sent me straight into the astral plane...and probably a hospital if any body seen me wacked out on dxm..dont do 1 gram lol. but it didnt do jack shit lol so I quit DXM for a few weeks.  If you done DXM you know how easy it is to have too much of a good thing.


I was not like..addicted to DXM I did not HAVE to do it everyday but during that time I had nothing to do with my life so I just did dxm till once day I was like i need to fuckin do somethin with my life. I don't do too much DXM anymore, but maybe once a week I'll get a craving to be on dxm, I don't always go get my dxm fix but 40% of the time I do. This mostly occurs when I am just bored and honestly have done everything I could possibly think of to do that day. I still enjoy DXM but don't really trip from it at all. I have definitely reached my trip limit, after probably over 400 trips lol and that may even be an understatement I did 2 bottles of tussin a day for 2 months till I seen the other products non-syrup.


I want to do it today but really do not do cough syrup anymore, i stick to the other products cough syrup is nasty! I see Duract at the shop, does anybody have any knowledge on chemistry to see if there is any possible way to Extract the DXM HBr from this? I know other brands can do a cold-water extraction and I have done my fair share of those. Duract is crap because it does not have any real alcohol or anything to really help absorb the DXM. While I was reading the ingredients I noticed they have SUGAR ALCOHOL inside...I'm sorry but whats the point in that? Theres a great number of people who would feel like shit from all that, and it does not absorb easily. 


For me, to this day i do not trip from DXM. My usual dose I would take..really just dilates my eyes, I feel spacey, I have that really good head pressure feeling. But when I bump up the dose Its basically ***to me*** like just getting black-out drunk. I put that in bold and shit because I don't want anybody to read this and think they can take this to feel black out drunk, because thats not how it works.


Its almost like everytime I do DXM its a different thing, different effects. I feel like this is the way it is.


I started on the floor, the floor being 0% tolerance. Within about only 8 months I reached the ceiling at 100% tolerance. A month after this happening when I mustered up the will power to take a break I sort of floated down to the middle of the room. I tried it again and it was like new but the "magic" was gone. A friend and I one night had a bunch of DXM in the form of DXM POLY which is simply DXM coated with edible plastic for time release. I did one or two bottles of this, became pretty messed up I did not have rational reasoning skills and ended up drinking 4 grams of DXM POLY within 6 hours. Being dehydrated since I did not drink anything I was kicked out of my friends apartment and ended up passed out on the side of the street was taken to the hospital, I swear to this day I had an OOBE and talked to "god" or a "higher power" when this OOBE was done i was hovering about 80 feet above my body next to an ambulance with paramedics and police above me trying to wake me up, there were people around watching, I saw a darkness come over and it all was black till I opened my eyes in my body again, and the same ambulance, the same paramedics,and the same police/people were around me, I DEFINITELY was in some spirit form outside of my body.  Needless to say the friend who kicked me out of his apartment, we're not friends any longer, dudes just a pure idiot.


After that hard 5-6 days of tripping with a 3 day afterglow after that it was never the same. DXM did nothing. But I feel as if I have broke through the ceiling, and have opened up a whole new world of effects.


I feel that abusing DXM causes a person to disconnect from reality. Not a total full blow psychosis but, it makes life dull, and its like whatever another day, dont really have anything to look forward to and nothing really brings excitement. The first stage of DXM abuse the person will feel as if the drug is making them a better person, more happy and social, but continuing the abuse they still think this is true but its really not. But on the other hand DXM use brings this strange, different form of intelligence. Like at one point me and a trip buddy were talking telepathically. I have somehow some way been able to predict things that will happen with having no information before hand, for an example while on DXM I would think "Oh i want some McDonalds I want to get some" than somebody would bring me home Mcdonalds within the hour. Or another example I would somehow out of nowhere get the thought of a friend calling me, than not too long after what do you know, that friend is calling me. It happened so frequently that I would at times write down the names of a few people that I know, and after taking DXM I would go for a walk, and I wrote down these names in order of the people who I would see first, and I found that every time I did this It happened exactly as I wrote it down first i saw this person than this person. I had, and still sort of have the ability to do this. It mostly occurs with emotions now after I quit doing DXM a lot. Like I get this weird sensation, almost like being anxious and I feel as if somebody is unhappy or angry, than in a few minutes, it is always within a few minutes that somebody walks through my front door like a friend, or a parent or a sibling any other family member and they are angry and screaming about something. I have noticed that the brains of two DXM users link together, almost like being telepathically connected on some frequency sending out some kind og wavelength that each other can pick up on to communicate. And I have done research and you can google DXM + telekinesis and you will find this is not just the delusions of a dried up DXM junkie.

OD -> PD


FWIW this will likely get merged with the DXM megathread, which is no bad thing.

Dextromaniac, sorry to hear about your friend. I can understand him kicking you out if *you *were messed up at his house and *he *were sober, but as it was, you were *both *high. Not very friendly ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


As for any perceived paranormal events on DXM.... I'm forced to approach such phenomena rationally, since magical thinking has led me nowhere positive in the past. All logical explanations must be exhausted before I can accept anything mystical. I've had a number of experiences where I've predicted the future, seen my environment from a detached viewpoint, could hear people's thoughts, etc. It all boils down to the same thing: DXM enhances one's "mental model" of reality, allowing one to view and work with much more data than usual. Our minds are reality simulators, on DXM, more so. The McDonald's Prediction was probably arrived at from the following: 1) the knowledge that your friend had or would have the munchies, 2) The McDonald's location was convenient, and possibly 3) your friend had been previously talking about McDonalds, and that you may have overheard his mention of it subconsciously. The Out of Body Experience could have occurred because at a few point your eyes picked up the scene, and your mind took and processed that data, giving you a 3D representation of your surroundings from a different perspective.


Every time these sorts of things have happened to me--some were quite astonishing--I could, with effort, uncover the clues leading to the paranormal event in question. Like most people, I'd like to believe there is more to life (and indeed I do, to an extent), but I just can't afford to deceive myself ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I believe that mostly everything paranormal has a logical explanation, but some stuff the only logical explanation for it is that there is no logical explanation at all. I have had so much stuff happen to me, from being frozen, something turned me around, than my head was forced to look up at the north western sky and I heard Beta waves as if I was forced to be an alien satellite. This one is more funny, and probably just my body messed up on DXM but ya never know ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I specifically remember my first OOBE that happened while I was actually awake. I was meditating in a chair in the center of a room but against the back wall. I had my head down with a blanket over my whole body and my forehead was resting on my forearms so it was pitch black. There were two people in the room at the other corner listning to justin bieber of all things...i dont know why. Well I closed my eyes and was meditating having, me time and i heard what sounded like a giant freaking big fat insect fly up behind me, it landed on my neck than stopped buzzing, it felt like it dug its fangs or stinger into my neck and i immediately went numb. I could not move or scream but my breathing was normal. I morphed through the blanket and was above my body once again but up in the corner of the room looking at my two friends, i still heard justin bieber and saw their faces and looked at them. But I started to panic at this point and I lost controll of my OOBE and i was back under the blanket fussing around trying to move my fingers and toes and re-gain control. Than I heard the buzzing insect again but this time it was buzzing away from me than I was able to stand again and move my body and freaked out, I was like WHOLY SHIT WHAT JUST HAPPEND TO ME they were like..wow. Thats the one bad thing about having people know you do so much DXM they don't believe you when something like this happens.


But on a different subject, would butt plugging DXM be a good idea? Lol Its funky to think about but with my high tolerance I wouldnt mind trying the anal route once.

ahh..ahaha....ahaha..![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) I dont have any empty pill capsules or else id give it a shot xD I mean, the purpose of butt plugging is the fact that it bypasses the liver and goes straight into the blood than passes the BBB (blood brain barrior) but I dont think this would be healthy (or safe) with just straight up DXM, because when we take DXM the liver converts it into DXO and THATS what we trip from, so i dunno if straight DXM HBR into the blood stream would really be that fun, I can of course let DXM HBr sit in the open air for a week or two than that should degrade it into DXO.

**dxm**


im new here and i dont know if this is the right place for this. i love dxm and after a month long binge (at least 3 bottles a day of tussin) iv decided to do it only once a month because iv noticed that for me it wastes away my muscles extremely fast even when i only do it once a month (im also a bodybuilder and that is very frustrating). i was just wonderring if this happens to anyone else and if anyone knows if it is from the dxm its self or one of the other ingredients in the cough syrup? (i use robitussin long acting cough). im thinking if its not the dxm i could just start doing extractions. any input is appreciated thnx

I would first recommend knowing what ingredients are in your preparation of DXM. You want a DXM-only product to avoid overdose or organ damage. But, I have to tell you DXM is not something you want to be using everyday for a month esp. at those very high doses. That is concerning, and DXM is neurotoxic, whether or not that is supported by studies, it is true. Going on such long and heavy binges is so unhealthy for your brain, entire nervous system, and entire body. It can cause irrevocable cognitive defecits - that is permanent brain damage, when used in such a fashion. If you have used it like this, I would suggest stopping altogether for time being, and would actually suggest you never touch it again even on occassion. DXM is one hell of a drug, but you really have to use it sparingly from the start. So, my sincere advice is to stop the DXM altogether, and get health-conscious in all ways to help repair your body and brain as best as possible. I might even suggest taking some neuroprotective supplements to help your brain out a bit. I am not very versed in the area of such supplements, but I know others here on BL are and can give could advice. When I started with DXM, the longest binge I ever did was 5 nights in a row, each night 150 - 250 mg of DXM, and just that had some lasting effect, along with my continued occassional use. Really, stop the DXM and get yourself healthy.

Some looking around our steroid discussion forum shows a consensus that recreational drug use (as opposed to maintainence meds or some other rx regimen) is contraindicated with any serious attempt at body building.

**planning a 4th plateau dxm trip. Need advice**


so this weekend im planning my first 4th plateau trip. i know the dosage and everything im just have a few questions. what is the best enviorment? i was thinking a semi dark chill room. i will be with my friend just watching tv or something. and will i be able to drive the morning after? the highest i've gone so far is a mid 3rd plateau. Should i listen to music or will it really not make any difference. thanks for all the help.

You probably won't be doing anything at all as 4th plateau is analogous to a hole. Leave the room dark, get some good music playing (playlist, don't count on being able to change it yourself).


No driving next morning. Your cognitive functions and motor-coordination will still be impaired to some degree. Well maybe you'd be fine if you dosed really early in the day/morning, but in general I'd say no if you're gonna be dosing this high.

Yeah, you probably should be able to at some point. I mean, you'll know when you're able to I guess. I've had dissociative experiences where I felt perfectly sober and able to do things the next day, and some where I felt it would be unsafe to operate an automobile for upwards of 30 hours (though that wasn't with DXM).


It's very variable IME.

ok so really as long as i don't have to get up at like 7 in the morning and go anywhere. Im pretty experienced with dxm do you think i could do this without a trip sitter if im just barely hitting the 4th plateau or a little more.

If you don't tend to do stupid dangerous shit on dissociatives, then I don't think you'd need a sitter. I've never believed in the sitter concept anyway (well maybe for deliriants and dosing things at certain strengths in public), but I'm a very misanthropic and solitary individual.

^It will definitely effect the quality of the trip, chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine and while one or two might not cause noticeable drowsiness over the the normal effects of DXM, any appreciable number can definitely influence the flavor of the experience. CCC is bad for you of course, and though this may be ignorable in smaller doses, given that chlorpheniramine and DXM are both substrates of the CYP2D6 enzyme, they're gonna potentiate each other somewhat and you shouldn't risk finding out just how much given the amount of DXM you'll be taking. It would be seriously unsafe.


If you don't want to drink all that syrup, see if you can find some gels, or do an [extraction](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/257562-DXM-Subthread-Extraction).

^Yep the difference can be quite startling, at least it was for me the first (of two) times I used CCCs, had 4 of them, expecting to just cancel out some caffeine stimulation so I could rest and--wham-o!--was markedly inebriated for a while.

^I can't always even keep two down. Cannabis would be my advice, or any other anti-emetic you have on hand. Have something to take away the taste from your mouth, I find milk works well, I'll also eat a handful of tortilla chips (well I did this and it worked well, will have to experiment with it again next time I indulge in DXM).


4 though....an [extraction](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/257562-DXM-Subthread-Extraction) might be worth pulling off if you can.

I would be more concerned with my liver and gastrointestinal system with that quantity of syrup. HFC, propylene glycol, dyes and flavoring additives... I already feel like I'm poisoning myself with flavored medicine syrups as it is, and that's at therapeutic doses! Do an extraction , it's [super easy.](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/409243-DXM-Polystirex-to-regular-DXM)


The best trips I had was when I would dissolve the robo pills in some warm lemon juice and down them. Least amount of nausea from OTC preparations, and it seemed to hit faster. I've always been a poor metabolizer of DXM though, so the effects have never sat well in comparison to other dissociatives I've utilized.


Out of all the unsweetened non-dairy "milks" I have consumed, hemp milk is the best tasting! However, in this application, coconut milk may be your best alternative. The types of fatty acids in coconuts would probably wash away the bad flavor more effectively than other nut milks.


Seriously recommend hemp milk though, I've only had it unsweetened and can't wait to try it in it's sweetened variety.

^you drank 4 bottles and it wasn't intense? That does not sound right at all. Did you throw up? How many mg did you take? What period of time did you drink them over? How often do you do DXM/other dissociatives, what's your tolerance?

Coconut milk can have a laxative effect.  Personally, I don't think that would be very pleasant with 16 oz of cough syrup.  Then again, I'm not sure how strong of a laxative it is, and other people may not have as much trouble digesting robo as I do.

**Uncontrollable Itching on DXM**


So a few months ago I had a pretty heavy DXM trip with a friend of mine, the trip was perfect no hinges or hangups (except one really uncomfortable moment in Denny's). However my friend at one point in the trip began to scratch his entire body. Not like a frantic uncontrolled itch, but a very calculated scratching starting at the very tip of his head and moving systematically down his entire body basically scratching every itch of himself. I couldn't help but laugh at how serious of a situation this was to him. I asked him about it and he told me that this happened to him every time he took a heavy dose of DXM. I believe this isn't an allergic reaction because once he finished he didn't feel the need or urge to itch again.


So I guess my question is, if anyone else has had a similar experience with a situation like this and could shed some light on it. Is it purely just psychosomatic or is it a looping type thing like an OCD tendency.

yes. its called robo itch. i used to hate.


the remedy is the OTC benadryl, or any other anti-histamine will do.


for me, these gets rid of that nasty itch completely, and also makes the comeup smoother and less nauseating.

See that's the thing, it's not the dreaded robo itch, because it doesn't linger. Once he is finished scratching every inch of his entire never the same spot twice, it stops.

He's tried antihistamines before with no avail. That's why I'm starting to believe it's purely some form of psychosomatic reaction. (Like my inability to have dirty hands when tripping without vomiting.)

Are all the people who experience itching on DXM taking syrup rather than the pure powder form or something? I have taken DXM (pure powder only) a lot, at doses ranging from 500 mg up to 1.7 grams and never once have I itched in the slightest during or afterwards...

^Well most people take the syrup, but I've gotten the itch from gels too, and sometimes I don't get it at all. 


.5-1.7g, interesting dosage range, do you not like the lower plateaux, or is it just dissociative tolerance, or perhaps poor absorption of pure powder by the body?

I have taken lower than 0.5 grams (although not for a long time) and the high just bores me. So I tend to take around a gram normally. I have never tried getting wonky off gels or syrup so as for the absorption rate of powder in comparison to other forms, I can't really say. Also I do have high natural tolerance to most substances, although I rarely use dissociatives. Perhaps once a month... I do prefer being right out of it if I am going to use rather than just a little wonky! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I'm writing this reply in attempts to describe the curious effects of dxm and how it relates to spirituality/the universe.


Last night i robotripped relatively hard. I've found the visuals aren't exclusive to dxm and are similar in other hallucinogens so i won't bother trying to describe them. I do however wanna delve deeper into the sensations you feel and the connectiveness with the universe. I found myself being pulled left, right, up, down, forward, back. And i was quite intrigued by this. I like to associate gravity with our connectedness with mother earth and i feel like this connection was broken and i was more connected with the universe than with the earth. Your sense of gravity is certainly thrown off in this state of mind. I felt like my body was being sucked into a vortex on my left, right, top, bottom, front and back. The more i thought about what might actually be causing this the more i believed that it may just be that im more connected with time and space or more aware of it. When you get pulled in all directions it would really make sense that we're just more aware of the space in the universe(or the universal ether) that we are passing through. I could literally feel the earth/galaxy hurling through space, i could feel the dark matter rubbing against my face, being pulled to one side or the other in accordance with the earth, it almost felt like a vacuum was attempting to suck my entire being into it or the pulling to the left was actually just the earth spinning. The immense time distortions were there because time really was slowed in reality for me because my awareness was directed outward unto every individual square inch of space. Has anyone else felt like this? I'm sure you have but have you had any similar thoughts about these effects?


edit: I believe that what you believe is what makes up your reality. Since psychedelics break down your belief structures in the brain it allows you to experience the universe without subjectivity and in turn you can actually become aware of the little movements and wobbling of the earth and the inertia it holds. Hell even right now, sober, i can still feel the humming of the earth beneath my feet but because ever since i was born my body has grown rooted into the earth i've *learned* my center of gravity and dont need to worry about the movements of the earth warping me or my center

Yeah, I get those senstations on high dose dissociatives, I've never interpreted it quite like you though. But that pulling/spinning/omni-directional pulsing that you feel in ways incongruous with experience of the human physical form I have associated with raw existence and probably other things that would be words would be wasted on. I just think it's an effect of anesthesia, I sometimes get similar feelings when transfering between sleep and wakeful states.

Well, there are many different dosages you could do.  If you're just starting out with psychedelics (and with DXM in particular) you don't want to jump right into a very high dose.  Start with a lower dosage.  [This resource](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml)is a good place to get started.  That's why I asked what your previous experience with DXM was...

Take a look at the other drugs in Mucinex besides DXM. You really don't want to be taking that much of anything besides pure DXM. We're not just a bunch of sissy's trying to tell you the right thing to do. It'll make you feel sick and trust me i've had some nasty times. 


I can't say for sure if any store product is totally safe. But I do know some are definitely better.

DXM is likely enough to cause emesis, on its own, or at least the inactive ingredients in DXM containing products are. Get something with DXM as the only active ingredient, your innards will thank you for sparing them the guif.


As most all nyquil products contain APAP, which is very hepatoxic in large doses, you should not under any circumstances attempt to use such products for recreational DXM experiences.


Now get to reading [The Big & Dandy DXM thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/599034-The-Big-amp-Dandy-DXM-Thread-Part-2-(sort-of)), and the linked threads there in. Definitely read the William White FAQ as well, you need to educate yourself on DXM usage, and the risks involved with certain preperations, as well as drug interactions, and what to expect from the substance itself.

Does weed make DXM much more stronger? I took 100mgs last night to see if I had the enzyme deficiency, waited an hour and I had a small buzz so I drank another 500mg. Smoked a few cones and woah, for my weight 85kg, it should be a light 3rd plateu but I went way beyond that. Was completely disconnected from my body for a few hours and even saw the tunnel of light at one point. DXM is some fun stuff ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Yeah I didn't realize how much stronger it makes it, I didn't have much weed either, only a cone. Later on I was blown away.

The 4oz standard tussen IMO is nothing more than alcohol, hardly any trip whatsoever.

There's like 1.6mL of alcohol in a 4oz bottle, that will not effect anything. If you mean the second plateau is more of a drunken/stoned feeling than trippy/dissociative, yes that's how most everyone feels about it, but that's not necessarily an undesirable thing. And I moved your post into the appropriate thread.

Okay, so from last wensday-today i took 1st and 2nd plateau doses everyday. Anyway, im worried that i did damage. Im not going to use it again for a long while, but i have a horrible headache. Today i felt crazy, i felt like i wasnt me anymore, i was confused about everything. Anyways what are the chances i did damage from a week of dxm?

No, you didn't do any damage to yourself. Chronic dosing of dissociatives lead to some persistent and effects and psychological weirdness though. Just be patient, be mindful of your health, and you should get better soon enough.


If this is really bothering you, it might be best to avoid other drugs to help you return to normalcy, especially cannabinoids and psychedelics.

The worst damage you probably did is giving yourself a bit of a tolerance. also you'll have probably lost a few pounds, DXM seems to give you short term weight loss for some weird reason, well it did for me anyways![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

DXM is a SNRI (most people ignore this aspect) especially at low doses, you will probably feel a little sludgy and depressed for a week or so at worst. The SNRI aspect of DXM is actually more damaging than any of the dissociative f/x it produces I would wager.


Eat lots of protein, get excercise, abstain from drugs, and get good sleep. If you do all that you'll probably snap back in a cople of days. 

It's stupendously unlikely that you have caused any permanent damage.

Also, im probably going to get called an idiot for this, but i used coricidan cold and cough for all the first plateau doses, because they were a lot cheaper then robitussin (only 2 bucks at family dollar)

So anyway, i took like 4 of them each time, because i wasnt going above the daily max for CPM (which is 24mg, i was only taking 16mg)

Oh thats not too bad. Just try not to actually trip on those triple c's. When I was a kid I used to pop 16-32 of those at a time and im ok but ive heard of people dying from less than that. Its a good idea never to take triple c's to get high.

using regular-sized (read: medicinal, not recreational) doses of DXM after a binge helps me return to normalcy.  i'm talking 30mg-60mg daily.


i doubt you've done any permanent damage.  i've used 1gram+ daily for a week at a time and haven't noticed much in the way of permanent effects.


were you eating and sleeping less during your small binge?  part of your weird feeling could be attributable to lack of sleep and food.  sekio gave sound advice above.

When I used to take benadryl in high school (yes, very stupid) I was on a week binge of taking a whole bottle (32) everyday. The high was crazy for $1 and it was kind of psychedelic (would make me see cartoon sketch movies UEV and had conversations with people in my head.) and I hallucinated animals and trails and all sorts of stuff OEV. Point is, after that week I felt like a complete different person. I was really depressed and thought this was how I was gonna be forever. Low and behold, a week later and everything was back into place. So just relax and you'll be good ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

There was a period of about a month in my life, at my first foster home, in which i met A.R., currently sober from 6 months on the shit, drinking, and looking to relapse. we were really bad for each other and she introduced me to 'moosing', slang for how she said mucinex when people asked what she was fucked up on. at first we started out talking just a little bit but it was so lovely that we just kept taking more and more. we never came down. i'd been too fucked up on duster, which we also did, and got caught shoplifting from target a month later, and when my case worker decided to send me hundreds of miles away to the middle of nowhere without any of my stuff i panicked and took about 2500mg in the transport car. i began to see shapes of all colors and sizes zipping past the car, sometimes bursting into random smaller colored shapes. when i got there i couldn't walk on my own and for some reason remember walking across a wooden board over a trench to enter this half constructed house in the middle of nowhere. there were three younger foster girls there who painted my nails sea green and indulged my weirdness while my foster mom called poison control or something, i remember she was on the phone and said something like that and it upset me into a robot dance. i ended up overdosing and having to be taken to the hospital, i remember being burning hot even though it was nearly 65 degrees in the room, feeling confused but somehow content with the chaos, i remember looking at my thumb very closely and it was HUGE with a fisheye view and i could see every single tiny detail and asked the doctor 'is this thumb REALLY attached to my body' to which he laughed and assured me that indeed it was and i think i replied something like 'nu-uh' and then i remember waking up with a moose-over in a small town hospital bed.

this stuff is NOT to be played with, once you get going, coming down feels like the world has lost all it's color and shine and existing without it seems too daunting of a task. if you like the high, it's very easy to become lost in.

I know that DXM and opiates potentiate each other and most people I've talked to use DXM before dosing codeine, but has anyone tried it the other way around? how long after dosing codeine would I then dose the DXM (pure powder)?


A couple of weekends ago I took some powder to a friends and we all dosed ~800mg for a day-trip. Chilled by the pool with some greens to help kick it off and were all sent to a world of cartoons. For me everything looked like a Time magazine political cartoon and my friends were getting messages from iTunes visualisations. With Smashing Pumpkins in the background after dark the trip took on a stereotypical 'goth' vibe. At one point we cracked out the paints and painted murals just to see what would come out of it. This is what my friends missus ended up with the next day:

I have a question regarding my last DXM experience. I was aiming for a 3rd plateau dose and i'm not actually sure what I got...So i'm just going to describe the effects and see if you guys could help me out.


I took 600mg all at once and waited, I expected to feel a noticeable, strong onset but it really just came on casually and not strongly at all. After maybe 1 - 2 hours I just felt kind of drunk and talkative, I put on a Pink Floyd dvd but found that the music was not overly enjoyable to listen to (guess dxm doesn't enhance music for me ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ) and turned it off. 

I didn't really know what to do then, until I got the brilliant idea to just start dancing. This proved to be quite entertaining and my dancing skills were phenomenal (or at least It felt like it, I probably sucked).


Eventually I got sick of this and laid down and closed my eyes, hoping for hallucinations or anything similar. What I got was sort of hallucinating but not very intense, just this black spirally like thing infront of my eyes that twirled and changed shapes, it wasn't overally pronounced though. Accompanying this was the sensation that my body was stretching and shrinking beyond normal lengths, and I seemed to lose feeling in my ears and head (guess that was the dissociative part).


That's about all that happened, I didn't experience any interesting thought patterns (which is the main effect I was aiming for) nor did I see any interesting visuals/hallucinations which was also a bummer.

Oh and I didn't experience any strobing or flanging effects either, all very tame.


So what plateua do you guys think I reached, and what amount of dxm do you think I will need to take to reach a decent third plateau in the future?


My weight is 77kg also.


Oh and also, I have no tolerance, that was the 3rd (and as of the moment last) time I used DXM, the other times were just as unsuccessful, if not more.

Heres a calculator that is helpful for these scenarios:

[http://dxm.darkridge.com/calc.html](http://dxm.darkridge.com/calc.html)


Just going on your experience alone you didn't reach 3rd plateau. If you felt distinct dissociation and more than just mild stimulation you were at least to 2. All of this varies, but for me I only stop enjoying music crossing from 2 to 3. The fact that you enjoyed dancing so much leads me to believe that you were between 1 and 2, for me overtly physical activity is not enjoyable at the upper plateaus....

Thanks for your help man. I only felt dissociation when I laid down, closed my eyes and really focused. When I was moving with eyes open I just felt kind of drunk.


I seem to have such a high tolerance to all drugs (that I have tried), it's really quite irritating. It always takes me double or more of what everyone else takes to get me on the same level. Never understood why.


Ah well, how much difference do you think it would make to take the same dose on a completely empty stomach? When I took the last dose my stomach was only relatively empty as I had eaten 2 - 3 hours earlier.

how many hours in were you when you laid down?  i find that you need to be laid down/eyes closed/meditative during the comeup itself to get the dissociative 3rd plateau effects.  otherwise it ends up just being like a really intense 2nd plateau.

I think I laid down with eyes closed maybe 2hrs in, possibly a bit more. But the come up/onset didn't really seem that strong in the first place

About a week after whenever your last trip was, try doing 50% more than you did before IF your goal is to get to the upper levels. I do it on a completely empty stomach like eat a very light meal the night before you trip then by morning youll be good. I might have missed it but are you doing syrup, gels, or what? Sometimes that makes a difference.

Syrup. So You reckon I should do 900mg next time, that won't overshoot it will it? I don't think i'm ready for 4th plateau yet haha.

And yeah, I was actually thinking I might do it in the morning right when I up as that seems to be the only time my stomach is completely empty.

Others can chime in here too, but imo I think that would be about right given your weight and tolerance level... a 4oz bottle of robitussin has 354mg of dxm... so 2.5 or 3 4oz bottles... use your best judgement

are you smoking cannabis with your trips by any chance?  keep in mind that a lot of DXM reports online are of people combining with weed.  600mg + weed is as intense as 900mg w/o, really.

BTW, do you happen to be on a MAOI or SSRI? I was on 100mg zoloft for a couple years without knowing these drugs are dangerous to mix with dxm. Fortunately I never had any serious reactions, but I noticed once I got off my SSRI my dxm trips were more potent and clear. Just a thought. Good luck.

Nah not on MAOIs or SSRIs, though I did take a tetracyclic antidepressant (mirtazapine) until very recently and still had the drug in my system when I last used DXM. That was probably a stupid idea (tetracyclic's can still lead to serotonin syndrome from what I hear). I was actually wondering myself whether or not that affected the intensity or general feeling of the trip.


Not counting serotonin syndrome for a sec, do you think being on antidepressants would effect the intensity of a trip (as in make it less intense)? Because I didn't get any opened eye visual effects (like tracers) during my last experience and just felt fairly drunk.


Next time I use there won't be any antidepressants in my system though.

Yeah like I said I can definitely feel the difference off/on my ssri when using dxm. Its not as intense for me, at least not the effects which I would prefer to be intense. It seems to increase negative effects and decrease positive ones... I think this might have been your problem. Time will tell. Let us know if otice a difference.

Had an awesome trip today in the woods. Perfect fall weather. Had an awesome trip report too but then my computer crashed and I hadn't saved it. Fuck. Im coming down now and I feel like Im going to forget everything. I think I had some real revelations, too. This sucks.


Anyone ever start making involuntary noises... Almost like chants or loud rhythmic hums in the upper plateaus? I did this for the first time the other day while listening to music. It surprised me and I was like WTF but I couldnt stop doing it.

DXM can create state-dependent memories, so the next time you trip on it, if you focus on your last trip you might be able to remember some of what you had written.

Awesome. Hopefully i will.


Does anyone have experience with the agent lemon extraction? I was wondering if thers any way to make a big batch and save the extract? Does it go bad somehow? And what conditions should i store it in?


Anyway... I dont think I added enough naphtha... I did everything by the book and added 1/10 the amount of my ammonia/syrup mixture but I could never get the clear naphtha layer to form... I shook the hell out of it too.

i don't think it'll be labelled "non sudsy"... you've gotta shake it up and see if it suds up.


wal mart probably changes their ammonia fairly often, idk how old the guide you used was


could also be not enough naptha, like you said


what type of syrup did you use?

Cvs brand tussin, only active ingredient dxm hbr. No guaifenesin or other shit. I added more naphtha and yielded a slightly larger amount of clear liquid on top, but something was still not right so i ended up scrapping it. I will retry again after more research or i figure out what went wrong

I've noticed that taking omega 3 fatty acids for some time before tripping (a consistent dose of fish oil daily for a week prior and during)  drastically makes the experience feel less confusing and a lot less chaotic if that makes any sense.

My first attempt at agent lemon I got ammonia from Lowe's that said clear ammonia. During the extraction I ended up getting a lot of suds so I scrapped it. I looked very closely on the ammonia and it said it contained surfactant.


If you get the extraction to work make sure you turn it into dxm citrate because if I recall correctly I remember reading dxm freebase will degrade into dxo rather quickly if not used right away.

i have a question for all you dxm people.  one day i was at work and i ate a bunch of cough drops that i later realized had dxm in them.  about a half hour after eating them i realized that my body felt kind of numb?!?  Nothing other than that happened.  Could i have accidentally gotten a bit of a buzz off the dxm in the cough drops.  it was kinda cool ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

yeah, even small doses of dxm (less than 100mg) can produce a bit of a buzz.  i think dxm cough drops are either 10mg or 20mg a piece, so.

**DXM sensitivity**


Is there anyone here who is sensitive to DXM yet experienced with the substance? I have taken it twice, and plan to take it again, even though I seem to be one of the sensitive ones. There isn't much information on the subject, only people mentioning the enzyme deficiency. There's nothing about how safe it is to take in these circumstances or how the effects vary by dosage. 


This sensitivity transforms DXM into a completely different drug, that's why I'm looking for more information about it. Personal experiences and useful tips are welcome. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I used to enjoy it when I was younger. I used to drink bottles of cough syrup, until after a few trips, the taste of cough syrup made me retch. I should probably get some powder one of these days, but lately, I've been finding dissociatives quite unpleasant. DXM is worth a try though, if you haven't.

Dextromethorphan. It's usually used to reduce coughing. At high doses it's a dissociative hallucinogen. At high doses it can also cause sweating, fever, shallow breathing, diarrhea, and spasms.

Eh.... I enjoyed it at first but I was on zoloft and left confused most of the time.  Walking with your friend asking what day it is over and over again is never good.  I'm surprised I didn't die on that shit.... cause I swear I got so overheated on dxm and I was walking in snow.  I wonder how it would be now that I'm off my medications.  Well not really.  All it did was make me feel stupid and I'm sure it still will.


And I know never mix dxm with an ssri but I was being stupid and did.

na i never had itchy type shit [like u might imagine] .. you feel weightless , , also , its worth noting .. while on something like shrooms if u have even the slightest hint of a bad trip - the whole thing might be considered a bad trip .. with dxm even if u have one worrying thought , the overall trip is always good [in my exp] .. only thing to watch out for is authority otherwise youre gud


i feel like these ppl arent talking about the same shit as me

It basically means you trip harder and way longer on smaller doses, so it just means you need to be more careful than most with your dosages.

**DXM Question**


So I weigh 250+ and I have done DXM. I wanted to know how true the mg/kg dosage was. I have gotten effects off of as little as 150 mg of dex and my latest endeavor was 700mg. The two times I've done 700 I hit the third plateau. I've only recently looked at mg/kg chart and noticed maybe my experiences shouldn't have been as strong as they were according to the chart. I do have naturally low tolerances for weed, alcohol, and LSA. Could that be the case with DXM? I'm also going to attempt a little over 1000 mg tomorrow if anyone has any pointers lol

10% of people have enzyme deficiency that results in significantly stronger experiences from the same dose. There are ethnic groups that show different statistics than 10% though, apparently.


Perhaps you are one of these people, but IIRC 700 mg would be incredibly tough for an enzyme deficient person so unless you are dissociative tolerant maybe you are just a regular hardhead.

Yeah I don't think I'm one of the people. Maybe it just felt strong because I'm new to it and don't know it's full effects.


Just posted a thread asking the same question. I seem to be sensitive to most things and dex isn't different. My weight doesn't seem to effect me dosage-wise compared to everyone else.

This. 


Though from the accounts I've read, the drug is especially unpopular among these people, but if you're careful things might work out well.

That's perfectly normal, before I had any dissociative tolerance that would happen to me too (now it just leaves me disappointed, will have to try an extraction some time so I can actually get down more than 720mg). The mg/kg dosing tables aren't infallible, it's just a useful guideline for most people.

With my dissociative tolerance i usually need to dose around 1.2 grams of pure dxm hbr to hit the third plateau. But in my high school days 600mg would set me straight.

I might be sensitive to it... or maybe I just know its effects very well. I can feel a noticeable head change with only 30 milligrams. The last time I dosed with 186 mg, I was having quite a nice time looking at some very complex CEVs, this after a medium-sized toke of some low-grade cannabis, to which I'm also intolerant. The CEVs weren't bright and in-your-face like the classical psychedelics I've tried (LSD, shrooms, mescaline), but were much more intricate and detailed (3D rotating landscapes, particle simulations, refractive surfaces, etc.). My eyes were also involuntarily crossing and I was getting that "visual chaos" people describe at much higher dosages.


So yeah, I'm probably sensitive to it. To me dexing is pretty much like frying, but with more interesting visuals and a less-appealing body load ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have dilluted dxm hbr in water before for storage/dosage purposes but in the case of ethenol i dont see a problem with that seems like same concept. I have used everclear before with dxm to aid an extraction and the dxm content and potency seemed uneffected the dxm was exposed to the evercleaer for at least 20 hours and no change was present.

dextrodoctor,


May I ask how much DXM and water you used? I've got 5 grams of DXM HBr, and wish to make the most concentrated solution possible. It will still taste nasty, I'm sure (I sampled 2 milligrams; it was very bitter), but it should be better than chugging all that nasty syrup.


Oh yeah, what is your experience concerning the absorption rate of DXM/water compared to DXM/alcohol compared to syrups or pills?

Well the solubility of DXM Hbr is 1.5g/100ml room temp water so in your case I would use around 13-14 ounces of water it may not be most concentrated solution possible but that would ensure that it all gets dissolved evenly. I have used 30 ounces of water with 10g DXM hbr and got satisfactory results, the solution will taste terrible but is easier on the stomach than syrup, making it easier to keep down. 

As far as the absorption rate would go im assuming your trying to maximize DXM intake while limiting DXO conversion, And when trying to do that the dissolved solutions are the best way to go. But me personally i don't notice a difference untill it comes to things like pills (which take forever) or delsym (where alot is converted into DXO).

**DXM Tolerance Question**


I have used dxm for about a year now and have devolved quite a tolerance. I'll admit that at one time I'm pretty sure I was addicted dosing every other day as high as 1500 mg on some occasions. But since then I have got a better handle on my dxm use using maybe once a week. My theory is that by only using about once a week and only taking 354 mg my tolerance will slowely decrease as I'm not taking anymore of the higher doses. Does that sound right? All answers are appreciated.

I have to urinate often, and I sweat a lot, on DXM. I think this is due to inpurities in the cough syrup building up in my system since I'm a daily user. Sometimes I get pseudo-spasms, like, I just want to move my body spasdomically. I don't get diarhea usually, although it has happened before!

The only way tolerance will decrease is if you stop taking DXM entirely. Taking small doses won't reduce existing tolerance, it will just make tolerance develop slower.

Ah, the *key*word I wasn't using: solubility. Thank you, Dex Dr. According to [InChem's](http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim179.htm) DXM page:

Your estimate of 13-14 fl. oz. is slightly on the conservative side, which is good.


I'm not sure if their ratio for ethanol describes volume or weight... I'm leaning toward volume. There is no mention of how well it maintains in ethanol, but I'm guessing it's a long time if kept away from light.


With either solution I'll still be doing good, I do believe.


> As far as the absorption rate would go im assuming your trying to maximize DXM intake while limiting DXO conversion, And when trying to do that the dissolved solutions are the best way to go. But me personally i don't notice a difference untill it comes to things like pills (which take forever) or delsym (where alot is converted into DXO).

I've had decent results from both standard and time-release preparations. Can't figure out which is better though... With regular DXM you get a faster onset, faster comedown. With DXM polistirex, the trip takes longer to progress, and it's easy to stay wake all night, but the afterglow is so much better for some odd reason.

**Redosing DXM**


I dosed 900 mg at 1pm, 600 at 4 pm, and it is now 11 11 pm. Im considering redosing on another 900 mg to achieve the cev's and listen to my headphones. How does this sound like it might work out

I eat like a gram a day, in two or three doses. I'm uhhh.. disgustingly decadent. I'm trying to evolve my brain into a DXM brain. It might be crazy, but that's okay. I guess I'm addicted, but that's okay with me as well!

Badly.  The best way to get mileage - and that wonderful colorful, spiritual, introspective high - from DXM is to dose at about 200mg every three hours with white grapefruit juice until you're there.  No need for massive doses my friend.  Your current approach will likely only produce a blurry drunk fucked up feeling, which if that's what you're after - just drink - lower staggered doses with the potentiator is the ticket.  And oh btw, be VERY CAREFUL with this - that white grapefruit juice will make a WORLD of difference.  Do not underestimate this drug or it will kick your ass like no other.


Also, as a quick addendum, there is no need to post stories of heroic doses of drugs for respect here.  We pretty much equate that with stupidity and immature attention seeking.  I'm giving the benefit of the doubt on this one because the doses you claim are incongruent with the question that contains them ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Second, it was completely relevant to what I was asking, I think it wouldve been difficult to answer my question without that info.

The last time I dosed with 186 mg, I was having quite a nice time looking at some very complex CEVs, this after a medium-sized toke of some low-grade cannabis, to which I'm also intolerant. The CEVs weren't bright and in-your-face like the classical psychedelics I've tried (LSD, shrooms, mescaline), but were much more intricate and detailed (3D rotating landscapes, particle simulations, refractive surfaces, etc.). My eyes were also involuntarily crossing and I was getting that "visual chaos" people describe at much higher dosages.

Thanks for your great reply. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I believe you are sensitive to it. I have never tried smoking cannabis on DXM, even though each time I took DXM I was presented with the opportunity. I felt so horrible, I thought smoking weed could in no way make the experience better (although I seem to be very resistant to weed's effects), and I feared tripping worse and more intense. I trip very badly on DXM, I hate the drug really, but it is incredibly mysterious and sort of out of this world I might say.


It seems DXM affects people who are sensitive to the drug differently since there is very little DXO conversion. I've found that the high DXM:DXO ratio is responsible for the extreme side effects (muscle spasms, heightened reflexes, jaw clenching, shivering, twitching etc.) I have while on the substance. Do you or anyone else experience things like this? These side effects weaken my body a lot, and it just doesn't feel safe at all. I feel sick and mentally deranged on DXM, but at the same time it violently throws my subconscious in my face, which makes it a great learning tool. I'd guess (as I've never tried one) DXM is similar to a deliriant for people with this sensitivity. 


It's so annoying I feel this desire to try the substance again, I'd go higher since I felt better on my third plateau trip than on my second, but it was so tiring on my body I'm afraid to do it again. Is there any way to achieve a third plateau mental state without feeling like I'm incredibly sick? Maybe a lower amount of DXM combined with something else?

The sleep is a problem. I usually only snag like 4 hours a night, and then after a few days of that, I sleep in for like a good ten hours. As to my function... I have no function right now, so being high 24/7 is fine. I can ride the bus, read a book, go shopping, and even pass a few classes at community college just fine.


The tolerance is a weird thing. If you get really tolerant to DXM, it's like a different drug completely. I just feel kind of ghosty, protected, and fatigue-less when I'm high. Rarely do I get a "trip" any more. My gait seems to be permanently odd, but I think it was always that way?

Vaermina to me it seems like you just have a lot of physical reactions which is abnormal but annoying and a very good reason to avoid a drug. But I too was able to get high on very little amounts of DXM and I too felt like I was very sensitive. But natural tolerance only varies a small amount compared to how quickly usage tolerance builds up with chems. like DXM, and how quickly it can change the high. When I started using DXM i could get to deep third plateau From 500-600mg but  now if I wanted to just scratch the surface of third plateau i would have to consume at least 1200mg of Hbr and I have to find a way to rapidly absorb it to avoid plateauing and landing on 2nd.  Every situation and person is different.

Everyone is different but for DXM i get the best results from dosing all at once i hate hitting a DXM sigma that can sometimes occur with redosing over 700mg too many times. Also it is offensive and not fair to equate ones dosage of a substance to stupidity. I agree that it is not a good idea to dose large amounts of psychedelics in most cases especially if one is inexperienced or mentally undeveloped. But if one knows what they are doing is experienced and has accurately prepared a dose for the effects he  desires he shouldn't have to be branded as a fool trying to prove that hes badass. This was a legitimate question and the doses dont seem too high some need 600mg without much of a tolerance to get to 2nd Plateau. And i at my highest tolerance required 1300mg to get to low third plateau.

Cannabis has famous synergy with DXM, and grapefruit juice works well as a potentiator. But given the side effects you experience, it might be best just to forego this one and see if you can't get your hands on another dissociative.

@dextrodoctor  

@Never Knows Best


Yes, avoiding it probably is the most sensible idea. I was actually planning to try ketamine in the near future, but it obviously is harder to get so I'm going to have to wait for the opportunity to arise. 


Related to what dextrodoctor said, considering that you enjoy the drug I'm sad to hear about your high tolerance. From what you say it's variation seems huge, since when and how often have you been taking DXM? I also have a friend who is able to get powerful effects from relatively low doses (although his tolerance has now grown higher, but still is considerably lower than yours), but his trips never exceeded 10 hours in length as in my case.


Related to the Elder Scrolls reference, yes I did name this account after the daedra. I thought it would be a fitting account name for this forum considering she's the daedric prince of dreams/nightmares and of aspects of the mind, hehe. :D

Well my high tolerance is my own fault and didnt happen over night. In my high school days i would frequently abuse DXM taking it every couple of nights and drift off. After a few months of doing that and a few 4th plateau trips my tolerance began to build. Then I started using Ketamine and rarely PCP an then recently in the past few years MXE. My dissosiative tolerance is massive but at this point i cant do much about it. I have tried taking breaks from dissosiatives as long as five months and although it helped a little with my ket. and MXE tolerance it didnt seem to affect my Dex tolerance at all. I just try to take it easy these days and switch up my drug use as to not abuse certain things. And when i do come across dissosiatives i just suck it up and take more I dont really mind because when i dose dxm I use pure Hbr powder that I pressed into tablets which makes it worlds easier to ingest.

It's not a combination I had ever considered trying, since I've almost always gotten extreme paranoia and anxiety from cannabis alone. But lately I've been taking gabapentin and chinese ephedra, and find I can get a lot more stoned before any negative effects manifest. Not only that, but those two substances also make for a happier, more pleasant DXM trip. So, when I added pot to the mix, it somehow didn't impart any anxiety or paranoia at all. In fact, it improved my mindset and removed part of the body load, making for a very comfortable trip. I could actually see the cannabis affecting the visuals as it came on. I might post a 3D rendering of what I saw sometime.

Hmm, mostly jaw clenching, much like I get on LSD. Sort of a need to work my jaw and yawn a lot.

DXM is nothing like a deliriant, IMO. Deliriants are unenlightening in all respects and give you the short term memory of a fly. DXM is a grand experience. It's like flipping on all the lights in a dark room. I think that might be scary for a lot of people, but with DXM it's easy to see things objectively, making the process easier to take than with other entheogens.

If you *really* want to proceed along this route, try hitting a low 2nd plateau with some gabapentin in your system, and then add cannabis in small hits until you're where you wish to be. And definitely, definitely lie down with eyes closed, as moving around and looking at things on the higher plateaus makes the experience feel more toxic.

redosing on DXM doesn't work too well.  each subsequent redose gets more deliriant like and less euphoric.... mainly just gets really confusing and awful.

i don't think its good for your brain to quit large doses cold turkey.  my theory/analogy is that abrupt stopping of high doses sort of scars your receptors.  low doses might make your receptors more malleable, and then your body is better able to recover/heal.

why dont you just give the dxm a break for atleast a month or so. do cannabis or some psychedelics instead they are much easier on the body and mind than a dxm habit in my experience. You even admit you feel you were addicted to it, might as well get some distance from it and reconsider your use.

big big difference between needing 600 for 2nd plateau and redosing 900 after 1500 for the day.  Sure it varies from person to person, but someone with a tolerance to the point of 1500mg in a few hours in all likelihood has had enough experience with dxm to know the answer to the question posited.  For example, nightwatch points out that redosing seems to increase the blurry aspect of the high (if done improperly).  Flame me all you want but I know this drug up down in and out and the simple fact is that very few people need 1500 mg only to be followed by 900mg a few hours later to get simple CEVs.  I mean, come on.  That dosing will jet right past CEVs into the "what the fuck did I do to myself!" category real, real quick.  Like I said, benefit of the doubt.  Reason for saying it?  Because there is some doubt number one, and number two, some newbie reads his question without anyone pointing out the problematic aspect of those doses and downs 900mg off the T.  So yeah, I stand by the post because 99% of users don't dose that high, peri-fukken-od.

i suppose i didn't pay much attention to the doses listed.


i've done more DXM than any one human should ever do, and 1500mg is still a massssiiveeeee dose for me.  i've only taken more than 1500 one time, and it was one of my worst trips ever.

Anyone else have trouble urinating on DXM? I couldn't seem to piss very well. I also had the sensation of having to take a huge crap but turned out to be gas lol. Is there anyway to avoid gas or is it just the kind of syrup I used? It doesn't happen every time, just once so far.

It's a side effect of syrup, you could try taking simethicone or something for it.

At the risk of having this turn into one of "those" threads... My highest was 888 mg DXM polistirex on two separate occasions. The first tore me away from everything so severely that I felt I was becoming nonexistent and/or brain dead. Not pleasant, and no real visuals to show for it. The second time resulted in a week-long trip sparked by a really bad peak due to less-than-ideal circumstances at the time. (It's best to always be on the same page as those you may be tripping with.)


Anyway, what I was getting to (in relation to an ongoing topic) is that higher doses don't always guarantee visuals. And that low doses can sometimes be surprising, even for seasoned trippers.


Visuals on DXM, I think, are attained by "tuning in" to a certain frequency, or layer of consciousness. It's like having this virtual scratch pad I can sketch on. The more I get used to using it, the more I'm liable to see what I'm building as an actual visual, and the more elaborate the structures I'm able to build.


It has now gotten to the point where it's like I'm running the best physics and graphics software on the best supercomputer, with real-time control over complex content, and with a heavy dash of creativity thrown in. The good (detailed) visuals still aren't very bright, much like looking at a sharp, printed image from a printer that is running out of ink ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


All in all, DXM's visuals are very astonishing. I think people who are doubtful of just how powerful the human mind is should try to reach such a level, with DXM or without.

I know it doesn't seem like harm reduction advice, but in my opinion daily dxm is not dangerous at all.  I did it for well over a year, then stopped cold turkey for a few months, then picked it up again.  As long as one is well aware of the obvious mistakes, such as taking multiple compounds, etc., oone can manage nicely with daily dxm dosing.  My doses were similar, maybe a tad lower as I got to understand the drug.  I now take it with white grapefruit juice, and use only the gels.  My tolerance seems to have stabilized and I get wonderful mood lifts, cognitive enhancement, etc, from the type of use I'm involved in.  I imagine that for some this would be a nightmare, but for others, dxm is an amazing drug.  It's especially useful for probing one's internal spiritual matters.

Another question. Is tap water OK to use, or will it harm the DXM in some way? The only other water at hand is this "artisan" stuff which contains the following in mg/liter:


silica 85

calcium 17

magnesium 13

bicarbonate 140

total dissolved solids 210


...with a pH of 7.5. According to InChem: "pH of a 1% aqueous solution" of DXM is "5.2 to 6.5." Not sure if it really matters or not, just wanted some feedback before I move ahead, now that I have everything in place.

I'm fortunate to live in an area where our water is minimally treated, though I may go with this bottled H2O (which, as an irrelevant side note is labelled "artesian water" [ostensibly from an aquiferous source], not artisan which would imply that is was crafted ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

What's your favorite dose to do DXM on? I tend to prefer 3rd plat... exploring my imaginary worlds is wonderfully peaceful and stress relieving. I feel like once you've gone to fourth plat a few times and really enjoyed the experience, the lower two plats don't really matter at all.

I love the 3rd plat for tripping balls but 2nd plat has a special place in my heart for taking the dose and bussing into my city and just having a ridiculous day. The last time I did that I had in depth conversations with hare krishna monks and bought one of their books.

I've been reading about Leary's "8 circuit model of consciousness" lately and the 4 "upper" levels of consciousness seem to line up as parallels to the four plateaus of DXM. First plateau can bring about euphoria, enhanced thinking, and generally just feeling good... the second plateau is when the dissociative effects grow stronger and the visuals really start to appear. People may feel like they can connect with others more as their barriers of self begin to break down and visions start entering their minds once their eyes are closed... my friends have sometimes felt like DXM really increases emotional connections between them, so while they may not necessarily gain the ESP and psionic abilities Leary and co. described, but they definitely begin to see their normal ways of thought change as dissociation lets them "step back" and observe things from a slightly different angle. The third plateau lines up smoothly with the 7th circuit of consciousness... as dissociation and visuals are cranked up a few more notches, the concept of self has become heavily eroded (however, it has not yet been completely removed). As people begin to heavily lose themselves in their dream worlds, they may feel like they're beginning to merge with something greater and outside of themselves, although the shift is not all done. And the 8th circuit of conscious, ego death and extreme dissocation, need not be explained. 


Maybe I'm just a junkie with a fried brain, but I feel that the map Leary attempted to make of the mind and the map we have of DXM highs just link together awfully well. I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on this.

I have abused DXM so much in my lifetime that now when i take it it just feels like "the other sober state of being" because i was in that mode of consciousnesses for so long it started becoming normal. I took a long break yet DXM still feels nothing like it used to and i now require a radical dose to become "intoxicated" off of it. These days i just occasionally use DXM in conjunction with psychedelics when my stash of other NMDA receptor antagonists like Ketamine or MXE run out.

i've been saying this for years, even a low-to-mid-first-plateau dose of DXM can make a 5HT-2A trip three-fold more interesting.

Well weight and your ability to metabolize it come into play, I'd expect if you have experience with it you know better than we can what to expect from a given dosage. If you want us to speculate, I'll go with the second.

I'm not. I've had 2+ years experience with it. I'm just limited on my dxm And only had 300mg (one bottle of Robitussin soft gels) And It seems as if anything below 300mg doesn't even get me to 1st plateau. Therefore I'm trying to find some potentiators.

Well, if you've been using for years, you should wait a few months until your tolerance goes away. Take more DXM. Lose weight. Take DPH with it and drink a large amount of grapefruit juice. Take DXM on an empty stomach. All of these tips in combination will have DXM leaving a much more profound effect on you... 


I'm not sure if you know this, but the plateaus of DXM are based on a combination of the user's weight and the amount of DXM, rather than the amount of DXM alone. Bookmark this site for future reference: [http://dxm.darkridge.com/calc.html](http://dxm.darkridge.com/calc.html) If you have the time to spare, you should really read the DXM FAQ sometime too. You'll learn a lot more about how DXM should be used and how to get the most from it. Be safe! 


If under 300mg won't get you to a first plat trip, how could mixing a bit of alcohol with 300mg bring you to a third plat trip? Please, please, please read about the drug before you do serious harm to yourself! Just because DXM comes in an over the counter form doesn't mean it's a safe drug by any means.

That's really unfortunate, dextrodoctor. Were you taking any MXE or Ketamine during your "long break?" Some say those two might raise DXM tolerance.


Haven't looked into it, but I wonder if it's possible to use other drugs to lower your tolerance, similar to how DXM is is used to lower tolerance to amphetamine and opiates?


BTW, your encouragement helped a ton. I decided to go with a DXM 5g/H20 400mL (12.5 mg/mL) solution, since the house isn't very warm this time of year. Very little crystallization at the bottom so far. Bitter as heck ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Have you noticed that DXM, in addition to having that acrid flavor, is actually somewhat numbing to the tongue as well?

I found something that may be of interest to everyone:


[Decreased Kidney Function Leads to Decreased Cognitive Functioning, Study Finds](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121119093659.htm)​

So I have some questions:


1) Do you believe that your past DXM use has led to reduced cognitive functioning, particularly in the areas of abstract reasoning and/or verbal memory?


2) Were you mainly using:

a. cough syrups

b. pure powder

c. pills

d. Coricidin​

3) Were you using other drugs at the time?

a. If yes, what drugs were you taking?​

You can see where I'm going with this: glucose overdose -> kidney malfunction -> reduced mental functioning. It's probably a shaky theory, but one worth considering, I think ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have no mental issues after taking at least a week long break (thats how long the mental fog takes to lift) from DXM I have ingested all forms of DXM be it pure a solution cough syrup pills over 300 different times sometimes at ridicules doses at least 30 instances I doses above 1000mg. I do think Im too young to notice issues with my kidneys or liver. I took an official IQ test (which I dont really hold in high regard) at the age of 15 (when i first started using DXM) I scored at 138. 4 years later at the age of 18 I scored a 144. My memory however is fucked but im a poly drug user and a constant sativa breatha.  


I dont know how useful the iQ score thing is the rise is most likely to me getting better at math in high school so I did better on the matrices.

Thank you for replying, dextrodoctor. I don't know much about IQ tests, but if they rely heavily on accrued knowledge then they are useless, IMO. In fact, there are many different types of intelligence out there, and I can't see any standardized test accounting for them all.

I take a low dose of DXM every day - 150mg time release. I've been doing this for years and I have had some health problems, but my doctor at the time could find no connection. There's really not that much sugar in the syrup. My last standardized test was the GRE - 1540/1600. Back before DXM, I had a 1350/1600 on the SAT. Frankly, the overall beneficial effects of DXM more than compensate for any harm it might be doing - my brain works more or less properly, I can relate to society if I care to, etc. 


Summary of health problems:  I developed sarcoidosis and after 6 months of prednisone and chloroquine therapy, insulin dependent diabetes. I will note that blood sugar levels are critically important to cognition, as any diabetic can tell you.


I believe that DXM enhances my my ability to reason abstractly, I generally take syrup, I rarely use other drugs.

So i just thought i would put this out there but recently i've been using low doses of dxm every once in a while but today i took 8oz which wasnt that much since i have a considerable tolerance but even though this is all familliar territory i found this trip to be especially helpfull with depression and my mindset. I have wrote down my thoughts which were vary insperational and its been a long time since i actually learned anything from dxm and i think this will be a good trip to end on, but i know for sure that i will use my new found insights in everyday sober life


for some reason it put a smiley face instead of a 8

@tantric: Thanks for the info! Do you feel any effects from your daily dose after all this time?


@kyle1: Glad to hear your last trip worked out so well! DXM does work as an antidepressant, but I find that it wears off too quickly. A few above-baseline happy days is usually enough to integrate myself back into everyday life, though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

These RealD 3D glasses helped me TONS during my trip last night.


![reald-3d-glasses.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fanimationdynamics.com%2Ffiles%2F2011%2F01%2Freald-3d-glasses.jpg&hash=1f02578b86e3c7d1b8194b3cc3b04b09)


No clue why, but I pulled them on during my trip last night  (had them laying around because I'd just seen the Hobbit), and they really helped some with my double vision problem. Someone else should try it out.

Haha, that's hilarious :D I tried that same thing using a pair of old beater glasses once, but it didn't help one iota.


Back when I was using DXM 2x/week my eyes stopped crossing involuntarily even on the higher plateaus, but now that side effect has returned. That's okay though, my best trips are always had laying down with eyes closed anyway %)

Well, as for the nausea, try obtaining a purer form of DXM. No matter what people say, you can still get pure DXM HBr online. If you can't find any, try an extraction. Heck, even DXM polistirex is worth the trip, and extracting it is super easy to do.


Synthetic cannabinoids are still available, and shouldn't show up on any drug test (don't take my word for this; do your research, man!)


Diphenhydramine should still help with the itching, even if you have abused it in the past. Never got the robo itch myself, but I'm sure there are plenty of things you can do to alleviate it (hot shower, rolling on the carpet, etc.).


You should read through the DXM FAQ if you haven't done so already. Even though much of its information is outdated (esp. concerning DXM's neurotoxicity [or lack thereof]), it's still a useful resource.

**About to trip on massive dose of DXM- Need replies**


Hey guys I am well experienced with dxm and attempting to reach fourth plateu tonight. I really need some advice on what im about to go through and more importantly HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?


I just finished taking 1200mg robogels. I plan to just lay down and listen to trance music but i must be able to function on some level in about 9 hours at school. We will just be hanging out and watching movies all day. Will i be able to walk and talk? Im a little worried. I have somewhat of a tolerance. 3 days ago i took 600mg for the first time in 2 months. Then the next day i took 900mgs now i am taking a massive 1200mgs and just need to be prepared for whatevers coming to me. It should be kicking in soon so replies would be great while i can read them lol

I don't know, will you?


Taking ridiculous amounts of DXM multiple days in a row means you probably have tolerance of some sort developed, but at the same time DXM can have a long duration when you take whopping big doses. The half life can be up to 4 hours, so after 12 hrs you will still have anywhere from 50 to 150 mg DXM in you... (plus metabolite DXO)


If you need to function why did you take such a humongous dose?

If you are familiar with the effects already why do you ask? You would know that walking may very well be impossible - I would probably be immobilized by that dose, not sure what kind of tolerance you need to overcome that. If you can walk, you will probably look like a robotic Pinocchio. Talking and functioning: again, this dose just seems too high to really pull it off. Although if you passed the peak, the effect may be wearing down. Who knows what you will be capable of then, I doubt anyone can answer that for you.


Think before you act next time, learn a lesson from this... about consequences and impulsive behavior.


At what kind of school is there only hanging out and watching movies? Special low key day before the holidays? By then you probably will feel if you are up to it or not. You'd better come to terms with the possibility that you might have to skip that... or if you absolutely cannot, just accept that you will try and do whatever you can and whatever it takes to make it work. Now surrender to the experience and see later about the rest. Otherwise not only will you have to face up to the aftermath but also get a shitty anxious worrisome trip.

I actually used to robotrip a few times at school during the high school time, but again i mostly went for 1st or low 2nd plateau dose so i was mostly functional.

The problem is that everybody saw i was high as hell so it was not a really smart idea, you probably will be come down to that level, but if you dont want others to see you are strange/high definitely avoid to do it or use a MUCH LOWER dose.


I have trouble sometimes distinguish different plateaus of DXM, i never used doses big as yours so maybe i never went beyond low 3rd plateau level. I am a pretty skinny guy so i should be more sensitive to lower doses, but actually i always found myself functional and able to walk and do things while pretty mentally dissociated when others at the same dose where totally incapacitated, i dunno if and how much tolerance did play a role so the whole thing of the high DXM plateaus division confuses me.


Anyway i would strongly suggest you not to trip tonight and save you drugs for better times!

Maybe somebody can help shed some light on something that happened to me two days ago...


I've been taking roughly 60 mg pure DXM HBr diluted in water every two-three days for a couple of weeks now, mainly for depression. It's been helping. Two of these times I took 125 mg without any undesirable effects.


So two days back, I had a morning dose of 60 mg and was quite happy and stimulated all day long, the usual effects in other words. Feeling as good as I was, I decided it was time to try a higher dose, something I've been planning for a while but never got around to thanks to non-optimal conditions. At 8:00 pm I dosed myself with 250 mg right before a meal. By 9:00 pm this second dose was coming up fast (right on time).


But this time the high wasn't good. It was dysphoric, my emotions were severely blunted, there were very few visuals, and my imagination was hardly enhanced compared to previous trips. I've had similar effects from syrup in the past, but never to this degree of unpleasantness ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) On the plus side, I felt more dissociated from my body than normal. I was barely receiving input from my limbs.


There are only two factors I can think of that would cause this sort of reaction: 1) this was my fist time using pure DXM powder at this dosage; 2) I took a small amount of DXM earlier in the day. So I can only figure that it had something to do with the DXM/DXO balance of the high.


Theoretically, my initial 60 mg dose might have used up enzymes needed to break the DXM down into DXO, thus resulting in a higher DXM/DXO ratio, right? Does this account for the effects I experienced? If not, how might I prevent this from occurring again (aside from not doing DXM)? I don't have any PEG laying around, so could I prepare my gut with glycerine or something to help aid absorption?

/\ yeah, tnw, I'll be trying that but at a more reasonable dosage, as DXM's effects are too extreme for heavy treading.


Having taste-tested the pure stuff for awhile, I must say unadulterated DXM powder is absorbed rather slowly. Pretty much like (Robitussin+Delsym)/2 in terms of active length. So taking it with a shot of liquor is probably the way to go (besides, a little pre-trip buzz probably wouldn't hurt ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ).

^^ yeah, the difference is pretty astonishing when i use alcohol to aid in the absorption of powder.  i always drink a beer or two, a shot should work just as well tho.  without alcohol powder takes like 1-2 hours at least for me to feel effects.... with alcohol its like 20-40 minutes.


the little bit of a buzz definitely helps the comeup jitters too.


don't over do it tho, of course.  the few times that i've drank too much alcohol with my dxm it was **very** unpleasant.

15:04 GMT About to take 150mg of DXM first time. Will report back on how it goes.


15:28 Got the 10 gel caps down, 3 every 5 mins or so to avoid too much nausea, as i heard that it can cause nausea.


15:56 Whoa, stomach feels like it's rolling, but no nausea. Starting to feel pretty good, like a low-dose ketamine line or so.


16:36 Okay so it has been an hour, just went and smoked a bowl and feel pretty out of it, but all signs of nausea are gone, no discomfort in stomach. all around good so far.

Here is a tip for DXM nausea.

Get yourself some scopolamine aka hyoscine, not only does it stop nausea, it stops you getting the runs from the syrup. 

You can find it in travel sickness medication (travacalm H.O in AU)(joy rides in the UK) in the US it's not OTC, but i doubt it would be hard to get the scopolamine patches prescribed to you.

It's best to take it when you start feeling the DXM, dose needed is half a mg, so like two tablets or half a patch.

I'm a near daily abuser of 3mg/kg to 9mg/kg on average. So when I stop using for a day or more, I start this thing where I cry randomly at past memories, or cry at things that are slightly sad. I blame the DXM comedown/pseudowithdrawal, but has anyone else had a similiar experience?

DXM is an effective treatment for a psychological condition known as Pseudobulbar Affect, which is a condition where people have uncontrollable fits of crying or laughter

so i asked this like a year ago but the only person that answered kinda just drifted off topic. has anyone else noticed muscle loss with occasional dxm use? and if so, do you think theres a difference between extracted dxm and just pure dxm cough syrup (such as robitussin long acting cough) in terms of whether muscle loss occured with just one or the other? it seems like it might have something to do with the sweeteners or other inactive ingredients from syrup in recreational amounts but it seemed like i still lost a good amount of weight doing extracted dxm polystirex (delsym water extraction). might just be from some kind of musclular water loss that lasts a couple days after use, it does kinda dehydrate the shit out of your body. 


btw took couple month break from dxm after the binge that i wrote about a year ago. now i use it once every month or two without any aparent ill effects. i know that the binge did do damage to my body but not nearly as extensive as youd think. i know that i noticed alot more cognative damage from a week on speed (one or two good recreational doses of pharmacutical dex in the mornings with around 6 hours sleep a night) than i did with a 6 week binge of tussin everyday. my mental state was obviously fucked but i rebounded back in a good week or two. only (possible) lasting damage is that when i smoke too much weed i hallucinate pretty intensely but im honestly not even sure thats from the dxm binge

excessive DXM use can cause [Rhabdomyolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis).  the artificial sweeteners and other junk in cough syrup probably don't help.


supplementing with Coenzyme Q10 can help prevent Rhabdomyolysis

So, I've robotripped several times, but it's been something close to five years. I did my research back then, and I'm doing more now. I only use products that have DXM as their sole active ingredient, and due to an unfortunate orange-flavored experience I will only use those little cough gels now - perhaps later I'll try an extraction, but for now I'm trying to keep things simple for myself.


I have a general plan, and would appreciate some input...


* I'm going to start with ~150 mg, then either wait til another day or take another 150mg (perhaps split into smaller amounts). I weigh 135 lbs/60kg, and while I've taken 300+ mg all at once before, I know I'm sensitive to it and want to see how my brain reacts to it now. From what I understand, my past trips had me floating somewhere between a high-2nd and low-3rd plateau. I have no intentions to go any further this time around. 

*I remember seeing a suggestion in one of these threads that when using the gels it's best to poke them to help with a more evenly timed release? Is the DXM partially "infused" in the gelatin, or could it be possible for me to like...drain the contents out? Sorry I can't word that in a more sophisticated way...

*I've been using meth close to daily for the past 4 months or so. I know I ought to take time off and recharge my mind and body before taking DXM - the combination of the two sounds like a really stupid and un-fun idea. Does anyone have experience/advice regarding how much time I should allow in between?

regarding your first point... 150mg or 300mg are likely both good doses to aim for, since you already know that you don't react abnormally to DXM.


second point... i have heard of people taking the fluid out of the gels.  imo though the best way to dose gels is with a single alcoholic drink... either one beer or a mixed drink with one shot in it... the alcohol greatly helps your body absorb DXM, this is why most cough syrups have alcohol in them.  don't go more than one drink though or you'll just end up feeling more drunk than tripped out.


third point.... i have a friend that loves to combine DXM and meth, but he's been tweaking fairly regularly for about 6 years...  probably best to wait at least a few days.

@taco bell: IME, OTC preparations are a lot more recreational. The pure HBr powder I bought online is nowhere near as enjoyable. It has something to do with absorption. As previously mentioned, cough syrups contain stuff like polyethylene glycol (PEG), glycerine (?) and alcohol, which causes the DXM to be readily absorbed into the bloodstream. Pure powder acts differently. It seems to come on just as fast, but the high is just not the same. More stupifying, more dead-feeling (emotions are wiped out to a greater degree), fewer visuals, less expansive/creative mindset. Basically, all of the negative side effects, without any of the good parts.


I now wish I had spent my money on actual cough syrup, or looked a little harder for MXE. But I'll still try a few more experiments with what I've got. I haven't tried mixing it with glycerine or anything of the sort, only alcohol, which didn't help one iota.


Maybe I've just reached the dreaded "50 Trip Limit," which would really suck ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

i prefer powder.  less nausea, easier to dose, and if you chase your dose with a SINGLE beer absorption is just fine.

According to [this](https://books.google.com/books?id=OWFiVaDZnkQC&pg=PA530#v=onepage&q&f=false), the plasma elimination half-life of single therapeutic doses of DXM in people with normal CYP2D6 concentrations is 3-4 hours, and ~29 hours in poor metabolizers.

^I'm definitely in the latter group, since I can feel the effects of even a tiny (40 mg) dose almost 40 hours after dosing.


I may have found a way to enjoy therapeutic doses of DXM powder. Two days ago I mixed about 60 mg DXM into orange juice, and sipped it slowly over a 7-hour period. The come-up was as smooth as it gets; no harsh transitions whatsoever. The depression I was in began lifting within the first hour, and continued to lift as the day wore on. By the time I was finished with my juice, I was quite happy indeed. I even had the energy (and motivation) to work on some 3D stuff, something I haven't been in the mood to do for quite some time now.


Yesterday the afterglow/hangover was in effect, and it wasn't exactly pleasant. But I started feeling better over time, so I took a lengthy hike (bears or no bears), toking some cannabis along the way. The whole experience was nothing short of amazing, and I may even have gained some true insight into how to manage my bipolar disorder more effectively, and better weather the rough times (it all comes down to regulating my behaviors, and not allowing myself to be like a ship tossed at sea).


So today is another DXM day. It would seem that taking low doses every other day might actually be improving my condition. Only time will tell.

Thanks for the advice, but I've already decided against that for the time being. Dosing via gelcaps would require me to evaporate the water from my solution, since wet gelcaps don't last very long ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

i definitely know what pure DXM HBr tastes like, and its definitely one of the most vile tasting substances to ever touch my tongue


perhaps 40mg/60mg in a tall glass is dilute enough however  personally though i would just split that dosage up into 4-6 gel capsules


glad that its working out for you though! i remember that warm glowing feeling well. it goes away with extended abuse of large doses, but if you stick to 40mg you should be able to carry on that way for a long time.

I completely agree. The only thing that I could say was worse is neat GBL, and that's because it is a membrane irritant. DXM.HBr is truly vile. Yeuch.

Hi guys, I doses DXM last night out of stupidity and I'm planning a strong 2C-E trip tuesday evening or wednesday. should I expect a milder trip due to DXM's SRI action? and if so how much should I dose accordingly if I want the same intensity of a 25-30mg 2C-E trip?


thanks.

It shouldn't interfere with the trip at all, dose as you normally would. At least, such is my experience with DXM & 2C-E. (And thanks for asking in the B&D thread)

I need some help, guys.


I just received 10 grams of dextromethorphan from the same vendor I bought from previously, and tried mixing it into plain water as I did with the last batch. But the stuff will *not *dissolve! I literally spent hours stirring the stuff yesterday -- even adding more warm water -- but no luck.


It tastes just like the other stuff I had: bitter with a slight numbing quality. The crystals (as viewed through a loupe) are slender and squared-off, like short matchsticks. Does that sound like DXM to you? Or was I sent some other chemical?


Is it possible my vendor sent me freebase? If so, how could I get it to dissolve into water? Introduce an acid? The only ones I have at hand are vinegar and cream of tartar.


Any help would be greatly appreciated~

If it is freebase, just adding vinegar should do the trick.

I would contact the vendor though and ask if they did send the freebase, or which salt as a precautionary

Just ask them if they sent you the freebase instead of the salt (did they say it was the HBr or???). Simple as that, don't say because it won't dissolve or anything, because that's kind of leading and they'll try to say what they think you want to hear.

Alright, thank you.


Here's all the info my supplier gives:


Dextromethorphan, 98-101%, Certified

CAS: 125-71-3

FORMULA: C18H25NO​

I just tried adding a little vinegar, and the DXM is now dissolving into water as hoped.

I have never heard of any form but HBr, and DXM.HBr is very poorly soluble in cold water. If vinegar helps, so be it but it probably just needs heating.

No, heating the water did not work. The mixture was heated to the point of being uncomfortable to the touch (over 100 degrees fahrenheit) and more water was added, all to no avail.


From a DXM fact sheet:


Solubility in water 1.5 g/100 mL at 25 C (77° Fahrenheit).​

I raised the water volume to 1500 mL for 10 grams DXM, for a solution of 10000 / 1500 = 6.67 mg per 1 mL water, or 667 mg per 100 mL water, well below the saturation point. The DXM should have dissolved.


Anyway, my supplier kindly replied to my request, giving me specifications regarding my purchase. My DXM is definitely in freebase form. (In retrospect, I should have simply asked for the specifications, not whether I was given freebase or a salt, which makes me look inept [which isn't far off ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ]).


The stuff is definitely active... I took some with a cannabis edible yesterday and had a most amazing time ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


If it is advantageous to do so, I'll probably use lemon extract instead of vinegar for the final solution, for obvious reasons.

ugh... while the lemon juice does work for dissolving DXM freebase into water (not that I had any doubts), it makes the solution taste somewhat like orange peels or grapefruit juice. It's too late to use vinegar now... but at least it's still a helluva lot more pleasant than drinking Robitussin or Delsym ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

but i had a thought -- did you weigh how much DXM was in the bag you received?  maybe the reason it didn't all dissolve and the reason it seems stronger is because your guy sent you a fat bag.

Considering the fact that I'm well into the 2nd plateau when I should be kissing the first, I think you're right. Man, I was going to edit out my entire post, but oh well :D


And no, I haven't been weighing my shit like I should. I figured I'd just make the lot standardized and dose slowly. Ridiculous that I should have expected that sort of behavior to keep working out.... next time I'm definitely purchasing an mg scale, no more messing around with unknown doses!


BTW, has anyone else tried slow-dosing yet? It's been making DXM much more enjoyable lately.

I speak for myself but I have noticed Cognitive deficits after two years of weekly abuse in doses than ranged from 800-1080.

Granted that was a long time to use Dextromethorphan. Other that Cognitive however, I haven't noticed and type of organ damage yet.

"if you don't use it, you lose it"


DXM tends to make me cognitively lazy.  during periods of heavy use i tend to avoid tasks that require heavy thinking.  i think this may have more to do with cognitive deficits than any actual direct lingering pharmacological side effects.  though, i think both factors do contribute to an extent.

exists, if you have DXM freebase, it's essentially non-water-soluble no matter what you do. (heating, dilution) You'd have to dissolve it into concentrated citric acid or something of the like, to form a water soluble salt.


Or dissolve it in chloroform/dichloromethane and gas it with HCl.

Thanks sekio, but I've got it handled already. Lemon juice was slowly added to the DXM/water mixture until all the DXM could dissolve. The result is somewhat cloudy, but it's just me consuming it and I don't care about its appearance ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


So you hear a lot about people smoking cannabis while tripping on DXM, how it's awesome and all that. But have any of you guys tried combining cannabis *edibles *with DXM? I've done this a few times now, most recently being last night. Took an estimated 140 mg DXM (consumed slowly, all day), followed by some fairly potent cannabis/chocolate frosting on an empty stomach. Total daily gabapentin: 1800 mg. Very pleasant high, everything became very interesting and I even got some nice acidesque visuals in the dark. No trouble going to sleep, either ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Does anyone have any idea how long the background tolerance of DXM lasts, or how to reduce it? I've found that I can barely trip off of 600mg now after not using it for months, but mixing it with a bit of diphenhydramine hcl seems to do the trick for me at doses as low as 300mg.

what form of DXM do you use?


i used to barely trip off of 600mg.  for the last 8 months or so i've stuck to 300mg doses, and now when i bump it up to 600mg it gets fairly intense.  i think the repeated low doses have softened up my brain towards accepting the bigger doses.  not sure.


i haven't gone above 600mg in 9 months to a year, but i'm fairly sure that a 900mg would kick my ass rightly now... whereas 2 years ago i could dose 1200mg and drive a car and talk to a cop and he wouldn't suspect a thing...

**Took DXM. Feeling very nauseous. help needed!**


About and hour and a half ago I took around 250mg of dxm in syrup. At the moment I'm feeling really dizzy and nauseous. I probably could throw up if I really wanted to but id rather not. Will this nausea pass in time? As far as I'm concerned this is horrible and I just want it to go away and start feeling the good effects of dxm. Should I just sit tight and wait for this feeling to pass? Thanks.

if you start to feel the effects then just go throw up, you'll feel much better, since the DXM has likely absorbed already you won't ruin your trip or anything. I generally wait till 2 hours, if i'm still that sick i'll say fuck it and throw up. If you have any ginger around, eat some, it'll help, as well as smoking cannabis. 


carbonated beverages may also help though could make things worse.

I would usually take 600 mg and almost every time feel nauseous for a while starting at about 30mins after ingestion or right before the drug kicks in. Couple of times this lead to vomiting but other times it just went away and I would never feel nauseous during the trip itself. From what I've understood nausea is very common with DXM so it's nothing to worry about. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I feel nautious from the syrup constantly. Best thing to do, take like Diphenhydramine or after an hour or two just throw up. Its not like even a full vomit, you just puke up foam and syrup remains. You feel tons better after.

So are you guys getting nauseous from pure DXM powder as well? I used to always either upchuck or get diarrhea from syrups, but have had no such things happen with the powder. It's nice to know that not every DXM experience has to GI distress ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I found the powder to cause plenty of stomach discomfort. Cannabis can be effective but obviously smoking before the peak can lead to a much more intense experience than one is expecting.

DXM does that to me too sometimes (with higher doses of syrup), but I still think it's worth it. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)8(

Last time I took 300mg~ I ended up puking and just feeling like shit, shaky and just like hell, didnt get to any sort of third plateau by any means and the whole experience frankly sucked lol. been considering giving a 600mg+ a go but the nausea was brutal last time

Does Zicam still make their DXM-only 500mg shots? I tried 354mg of DXM last night and loved it. The entire experience allowed me to connect with my younger cousins who unexpectedly came over to hang out. Euphoria, increased sociability, double vision, slight "spinning," difficulty reading, and extremely visionary later in the night. Meditation with crystals outside was transcending to say the least. I must have reached mid to high 2nd plateau. Unfortunately I couldn't meditate for the entire trip and dissociate like I planned, but tonight I'd really like to consume a higher dose. I felt as if I didn't need to push this compound further, but after thinking more about the effects and my previous experiences with MXE, dissociatives seems worthy of my time, and I haven't much else going on right now.


Is 500mg a reasonable increase in dose from 354mg? I might end up having to purchase syrup again unfortunately. Although I had minimal to non-existent nausea, I'm worried that an extra hundred-fifty mgs will send me spinning into the the trash can. I avoid puking at all costs. I do, however, wish to reach low to mid third plateau, listen to tunes, meditate, and explore my mind. I'm heavily experienced with psychedelics, but DXM is helluva different, even than MXE.


Also, weed extremely intensified my trip. I decided to take one hit (no tolerance) to ease myself to sleep. It increased my trip and I actually started hallucinating and having anxiety/panic issues which normally happen under the influence of cannabinoids.

I thoroughly enjoy DXM. In my opinion, it's one of those drugs you keep as a special treat (every 2-3 months or so), this keeps the potential damage down and allows the magic to stay alive. The most fascinating and euphoric parts of this drug are optimized with these conditions:


-Alone, at night, in a calm environment 

-Quality headphones and electronic music (DnB for me, whatever floats your boat though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png))

-Dark room

-comfy bed

-Sitting in a meditative stance, with my eyes closed. There is something about this position that increases the CEVs on a good third plat and the sensations of falling in a deep, black space/flying/spinning/ disconnection of mind and body. Awesome!


If you never done these listed above, give it a try on a good dose! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Does anyone know whether or not long term use of NDRIs such as Bupropion XL (300mg per day) has any significant effect on recreational dxm use? I know SSRIs and DXM is not safe, but what about this other variety of anti depressant?

Buproprion is cyp2d6 inhibitor, and has been known to make DXM really uncomfortable (ymmv). [Evidence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15876900) suggests you may well respond to the DXM like a poor metabolizer.

Why don't I hear more about people using a pure dxm powder? Surely it would be more comfortable than ingesting a quarter liter of syrup or upwards of 80 or more cough gels? 


I've just come across a source and to be quite honest its pretty much on par with buying bottles of syrup, plus a nominal shipping fee. Is this just because people don't want to put the effort into getting it when they can just hit up the local pharmacy or what? A friend of mine in the US actually orders bulk packs of tussin cough gels to avoid skepticism at the store, so hes paying shipping fees anyway.


Maybe its just a Canada thing? Either way, in the future should I choose to use dxm it will be with a pure powder form.

Guys, I have an important question. I want to hear honest thoughts on it.


I have struggled with depression for a while, and none of the standard SSRIs work for me. Neither do mood stabilizers. Although I do not use DXM to "treat" my depression, I usually take a premeditated dxm trip about once a month; sometimes more often, sometimes less often. I do this because it is very spiritually uplifting to me. My DXM trips give me a lot of perspective about my life, my inner self, and makes me feel connected to "the life force." You might say DXM is to me is what church and spiritual exercises are to the religious. 


With that said, however, I am still depressed on the average day and resort to self injury and other bad habits. As a result, my psychiatrist would like me to consider another couple of antidepressants. One he has mentioned is Abilify. Another is Celexor. Anyway, as much as I think antidepressants are a load of crap based on past experiences, I am leaning toward taking his advice. 


If I were to start taking Abilify, which is a dopamine antagonist, or Celexor, which I think is another SSRI, would I still be able to engage in my spiritual DXM trips? The though of giving them up is like being asked to give up my religion. But at the same time, I have heard that doing DXM while on an antidepressant can cause Serotonin Syndrome or other complication. I want to hear your thoughts on it. Will I really have to give up my DXM?

Yes, you would have to abstain as DXM and SSRIs can definitely cause serotonin syndrome. If you are resorting to harming yourself then I would suggest giving the Celexor a try, I have several family members on it and it seems to work well for them(they also didn't respond to other SSRIs). I personally would be weary of Abilify as it gave my sister some pretty bad side effects. Why not at least try the Celexor? DXM will still be here if it does not work out.

Hey. First off, I can definitely relate to what you're going through. I've also had pretty minimal results with the handful of medications I've tried, and have found DXM to be a very powerful anti-depressant. I haven't taken DXM in some time, because I started taking it fairly regularly in low doses as an anti-depressant, and inevitably developed a huge tolerance. But before then, I definitely found DXM to be a very useful tool for exploring the depths of my psyche, as well as a profound connectedness with the world. (not to mention some fantastic creative endeavours.)


In terms of the two medications your doctor suggested: Abilify.. if it's giving you more dopamine then it should have no interaction with DXM. I believe DXM is an SRI and will increase serotonin directly but not dopamine. (I also take Wellbutrin, an NDRI, (norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) and haven't found that it interacts with DXM expect for perhaps at high doses (my medication may indirectly increase serotonin) - but nothing like serotonin syndrome. The worst I've got was an increased heart rate but nothing dangerous. 


If you were to go with the Celexor though, it being an SSRI, you may not be able to take DXM anymore, or at least make sure you exercise caution. I was on an SSRI a while back and was taking 5-HTP before bed to help with insomnia. As 5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin and makes more serotonin available in the brain... I definitely experienced an interaction between the two and was unable to sleep a few nights due to a racing heart. I assume DXM would interact similarly if not more intensely. 


So if it's between the two I would choose Abilify. I agree with you that mainstream antidepressants such as SSRIs are often useless. They've done some recent meta-studies on the effectiveness of SSRIs as antidepressants, and something like only 1/3 people find relief from them. The Wellbutrin I'm taking has definitely helped me somewhat though, while SSRIs did nothing for me. You could also ask your doc about that.


One last thing and I will quit rambling. Because I have found DXM and ketamine (both NMDA-antagonists) so effective for me (and apparently others) as anti-depressants, I've done a lot of research in this area. A lot of studies are currently being done on ketamine as a very effective anti-depressant to those with "treatment-resistant depression", as well as a couple of other drugs that fall into the same category. Anyway just thought I'd share that.. posted a couple of links below. If you just google "ketamine/ dxm/ nmda antagonist + depression" a lot of links come up. I hope that within the next couple of years some of these drugs can be put on the market. Seems like it could be a massive turnaround in the field. Anyway, best of luck to you.

abilify inhibits the liver enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.  this means that while on abilify you might respond to DXM as if you are one of those 3% poor-DXM-metabolizers.  if you do try the combo, lower your dosage accordingly.

off topic slightly, but got a simple DXM-nausea question:


Does anyone know of any herbal/natural remedies that are effective at countering nausea while on DXM? I've always used gravol (dimenhydrinate) and found it to be very effective. Tried 500-1000mg of ginger capsules recently but it wasn't nearly as strong as gravol and I ended up hurling. Would be cool though if there was something more natural out there that packed the same anti-nausea punch as gravol.

custard, get DXM powder, mayan. The cost is comparable. Do a google search for DXM's CAS number, and you're set. Much better than adding insult-to-injury by drinking crappy syrups. And a scale never hurts, or so I hear ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

cannabis, eh? i often smoke while on DXM to enhance the high, but it's never been a very effective anti-nauseant for me.


as for DXM powder.. i have heard of such a thing but i don't know if it would be any better than the form I currently take DXM in. I take the gelcaps, so the nausea I get has nothing to do with drinking the vile syrup, I think it's just my body's reaction to the DXM itself. So would taking the pure powder decrease the nausea? Also how does one obtain/extract the powder? Seems like a lot of effort.. when it's so easy just to swipe a bottle from the neighbourhood drug store.. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Well, the powder is pure dxm, no fillers etc.. You literally buy the powder online just like you do any other research chemical, just have to find a vendor. Then again if you're swiping your bottles you probably don't care to put in this kind of effort.


Popping 40 gelcals with nothing inside of them is, I would imagine, probably enough to upset your stomach. They're certainly better than the syrup I would assume (I cant get gelcaps here in canada). But the less amount of excess useless shit you can consume the better imo. Id mix it in a drink and wash it down. 


As far as the wellbutrin thing goes, I can't say anything with any certainty but I'd imagine you shouldn't be doing dxm or other psychedelics while on meds like that..

I'm a little confused by this but I get your point. 


I definitely want to stay on the buproprion but would it hurt to give it up for a few days in preparation for the dxm? I've been on it for 3 or 4 months now and haven't tripped on anything since that point.

gel caps are still really tough on the stomach, custard.  nasty dyes and a lot of mannitol.  i've had gelcaps and powder both (a lot of both, really), and powder is definitely way easier on the stomach.

I don't know how else youd do it, upwards of a gram or more of dxm powder isnt going to fit inside a zigzag for a parachute and I wouldnt want to muck around. Use as little water as possible and chug chug, washing down with koolaid with half the water added or something else really sweet.

i use 00 size gelcaps.  can fit like 500mg in a single one.  shouldn't ever need more than three of them.


you can buy empty gel caps at health food stores and vitamin/supplement stores, or just order them online.

Like I said, do a search for DXM's CAS number (125-71-3 for DXM hydrobromide). Weed out the sites that talk about legal highs, and do an additional search to see if a prospective company is legit.

You won't be able to do that forever.

> 		
> Click to expand...


Well the high comes on a bit differently, probably because syrups contain polyethylene glycol and other shit. It's basically the same high, only without the nausea or other gastrointestinal distress (which makes a big difference really).


I have just been mixing the DXM into water (I used lemon juice to dissolve the DXM last time, since it was in its base form). I then take the DXM water and mix it into powdered soft drinks, like fruit punch or whatever. I seriously can't taste the DXM at all! I just sip the mixture slowly so the DXM comes on nice and smooth. Slow dosing makes DXM more euphoric, and drinking DXM-laden juice is the easiest way I've found to dose myself slowly.


> Also exists, be wary of taking DXM on a frequent basis. I did the exact same thing.. took it every other day for about 2-3 months at low doses.. and the buzz/afterglow felt like an antidepressant from the heavens. But eventually my tolerance got higher and higher to the point where I'd have to take more for the same effect, much more frequently, and the afterglows were completely gone.. high faded after a very short time.
> 		
> Click to expand...


Yeah, I know that I'm developing a tolerance, but DXM is the best antidepressant I've ever tried. I am a much better person when I'm high & happy, so it's worth it to me to keep on taking DXM frequently.


> How long have you been taking it/how often/what dose? If you don't mind me asking.
> 		
> Click to expand...


I don't mind. I've been taking DXM every other day for about 100 days now. I started out with 40 mg/day, and am currently up to 120 mg/day. But it doesn't take 120 mg to get the same effect as 40 mg; my tolerance isn't *that *high.


> anyone else get those on higher doses? like your hands get an electric shock and you seem to "black out" for a split second?)
> 		
> Click to expand...


Nothing like that, only zaps that travel throughout my body (mainly felt in my tongue) whenever I turn my eyes or head too fast. And like I said before, it happens when I haven't had DXM for a couple of days.


But when I *have *taken DXM, I'll get what I think is a seizure when falling asleep. Feels like I'm going to die or start uncontrollably twitching or something. I think what is really going on is that when I'm high on DXM and I start to drift off, my mind hasn't gone into "shut down" mode yet, and I'm conscious of my body falling asleep.

I may have asked you this already, but which form of DXM were you working with when you made this observation? Did you extract it yourself?


I truly cannot taste DXM in the beverages I mix it into. If I could, you can be sure I'd be taking it some other way!


BTW, you mentioned mannitol. I wonder if that substance might change the DXM high to a degree? Mannitol is sometimes used to breach the blood brain barrier in order to deliver drugs which would otherwise not be able to cross. But I think they apply mannitol directly to veins inside the brain; I'm not sure it can be used any other way.

99.9% pure DXM Hbr is what i was mixing into a drink when i made that observation.  for me its bitter as hell and creates instant cotton mouth.


and yeah i think Mannitol might affect the DXM high, but not nearly as much as if it was injected.


Mannitol is also an Osmotic Diuretic, and it really flushes my system out a lot (#1 and #2, heh).

**1st dxm trip one 3oz bottle of adult robitussin**


Since I have retired from dxm after doing it five times I figured I'd share each one. Anyways My first dxm trip was cool I remember it like it was yesterday.


I had found a 3oz bottle of it last summer so I drank it I mixed it with some sprite and jolly ranchers and then my family decided they wanted to go to the movies so I was happy that I was gonna trip at a movie theater.


So IMA skip to the trip about an hour after I took it I started to doubt it five minutes later I started to feel happy and the movie was more enjoyable. 


We were watching expendables 2 by the way. Anyway I got up and my eyes felt like I had smoked some Skywalker og very hazy I felt very light It was effortless to walk thats about all that really happens no nausea and I had popcorn after that I just enjoyed the car ride home no musical euphoria though I slept like a baby right when I got home

So I've been having a problem with DXM, fellow drug enthusiasts. (Probably not surprising, since I've been taking it every other day for a while now.)


Earlier I mentioned that


> I'll get what I think is a seizure when falling asleep. Feels like I'm going to die or start uncontrollably twitching or something.
> 		
> Click to expand...


This has been happening like clockwork every time I dose, and has been going on for a couple of weeks now. I am prescribed mirtazapine for depression (not sure it really helps) and I take that right before bedtime, along with melatonin and sometimes diphenhydramine and/or cannabis. On my DXM days, I'll usually take 120 mg along with 1200 mg gabapentin spread throughout the course of the day.


I'll try to describe in detail what it is I've been experiencing: As I'm *just *drifting off to sleep, I'll suddenly jerk back awake with a start. Sometimes this is accompanied by a leg kick, sometimes not. Often I'll be very disoriented/confused upon awakening, and if I don't move my body around it will feel as if I'm in danger of going into a full-on seizure. I usually remain semi-vigilant until I can fall asleep normally.


This sounds like myoclonus, right? I've had myoclonus sporadically throughout my lifetime, but it never felt as serious as what I've been going through lately (and never lasted any length of time after awakening).


Perhaps this is sleep paralysis? I've had SP many, many times, but it was always upon awakening (usually in the morning), so I cannot compare the the type of sleep paralysis I've had to what is going on currently.


Long shot: maybe it's serotonin syndrome, since both mirtazapine and DXM have been known to cause SS?


Or maybe I just fried my brain!


Whatever it is, it feels potentially fatal, though I do realize subjective feelings do not equal reality. So what do you think it could be? Should I just go with it?


I'd really like to keep taking DXM, since it's the best antidepressant I've tried. I have already begun the tapering process to get me to a lower dosage. I might score some MXE and take that for a while.

sounds like its maybe just a [hypnagogic jerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk)


diphenhydramine produces those in me pretty reliably

^^ Same here. I think its a hypnagogic jerk that is


DPH makes me feel like shit and doesnt put me to sleep, I end up writhing around because my joints feel weird as hell and im vasoconstricted. 


Anyway, I'm not going to bother questioning your use of dxm, but no one can reliably tell you anything about anything based on your symptoms. We're as good as webMD: go there and you'll find out youve got onset testicular cancer. Best shot is to lay off the DXM and see if you notice a change.


Also you should lay off the melatonin, its bad to take frequently unless you're using it to reset a sleep/wake cycle. That could very well be a reason for your problems, your body stops producing its own and you become reliant on the outside source of melatonin. Honestly, sounds to me like you're just self prescribing yourself a bunch of stuff because you read somewhere it may help with such n such.. I don't mean to be offensive. Does your doctor who prescribed you the mirtazepine know about the other stuff?


Really if you're here saying you feel like its fatal, pull your damn head out of your ass and stop using

Yup, that's exactly what I'm doing, and I'm not afraid to admit it. But I'm also not afraid to admit to myself that the drugs benefiting me might also be causing me problems.


I can now say with certainty that I am getting diminishing returns from DXM, that its antidepressant effects are indeed waning.

Fuck, no he doesn't. The dude doesn't even work for the county anymore, and the only doctor I've seen lately has been my family practitioner.


I'd don't really trust psychiatrists/psychologists. My problems cannot be cured (or even properly handled) by modern psychiatry anyway, so all I can hope to expect is to get prescribed more medications to treat my symptoms.

Good advice, bad advice. You are essentially telling me to discontinue the use of a psychiatric medication which I've been using for over 3 months. DXM might not be officially recognized as an antidepressant, but it does have AD properties, and it is unwise to stop an antidepressant cold-turkey. I will continue to taper my dose until the brain zaps abate. Once that happens I'll wait a little longer, and use larger doses much more *in*frequently (i.e. on special occasions only).


Thanks for the responses, ia, tnw.

I've gone and done a bit of research and have come across a number of sources claiming at low (coincidentally 120mg) doses DXM acts as an SSRI of sorts. I had heard about this before vaguely. Nonetheless, my reasoning for being against it was what you presented to the thread, the fact that you were having adverse effects.. and I guess I'll address that partially with the rest of your post in this thread..

So you're self prescribing yourself drugs because you say others have not worked at all (lexapro and other iirc from the other thread), and at the same time, you are/were seeing a psych and not telling him of your drug use, who then prescribed you something else. You seem like a somewhat intelligent guy but you're aware of how drugs can interact with each other right?


You bring up that you don't really trust psychologists/psychiatrists, and with the fact that you're withholding your drug usage (recreational or 'self prescribed' leads me to believe you're likely withholding a lot of other relevant information to your situation from them as well. You seem to denounce modern psychiatry because you feel it cannot cure you. Well no, psychiatric problems cannot be "cured" in the same sense as a flu or a broken leg can be cured no. You mention you have depression, perhaps severe and what you believe to be "non-treatable." 


I question why you seem to think you can treat it on your own better? Your entire logic is an affront to the whole of not just modern psychiatry but psychiatry in general. If you want help finding the solution for an equation, how can you expect to get the proper solution when you hand the person willing to help you an incomplete equation?


I've been where you are, and I still end up there myself. I've been on an antidepressant before and personally I felt it helped for a while, but things became *worse* over time.. not in the sense my depression got worse, but side effects and other shit from my life. I understand how disillusioned you can feel with the whole of the psychiatric profession, it is not cut and dry like other professions and it can feel at times like they are blindly guessing at what to do.. but if you don't give them a proper picture to work with they cant help so much.. if you are 100% honest and give your doctor as much honest information as possible they can guide you towards the best possible treatments. 


Treatment is the key word, they are treatments.. they are not cures. Another key thing here is the fact that no drug, no substance is going to instantly change things. A huge part of therapy is learning to change your behaviours and learning to find triggers and other things for your depression, learning how to avoid learned responses and change those. Im in correspondence with a few psychologists on other boards and they are quite often incredibly frustrated by patients who just want to get drugged up and not put in any work or effort to attempt to fix their situations.


When it comes to depression and the likes drugs are mostly used as a catalyst for change, they can help you get out of bed and they can help you begin to see things from a different perspective to build new pathways for feelings and emotions from input stimuli. Nothing is going to change if you don't put in the effort to change, and from the sounds of your post you really aren't looking to change all that much.. you're not willing to relinquish any form of control it seems like, so you have bigger issues than depression. You need to start being honest with yourself and honest to those you seek to get help from if you really want things to change.

I said to stop using the substance if you're really noticing horrible effects from it (and I would consider whatever feels "fatal" to be a horrible effect worth eliminating the drug for). This did not mean stop using entirely immediately cold turkey. 


Honestly man, I'm not trying to be a douche or be anti-dxm because I enjoy robotripping once in a while myself, but when you come in here saying you're having feelings which you describe as fatal.. it just seems fucking completely obvious to me that you should stop using no matter what the substance is, be it a psychotropic drug or the milk you drink, and if you have to taper, then taper.

I took 500mg of DXM, forgetting that I'm on Wellbutrin a couple months ago and and tripped WAY harder. I also had very vivid open eyed visuals, which would usually take 1,200mg  for me. Has anybody ever tried this combination? DXM and Wellbutrin? The trip was weird! Not in a bad way, but probably 80% good and 20% bad if I we're asked. The only reason for the 20% "bad", is because I was having to not let myself throw-up cuz my stomach was twisted. I'm not condoning mixing DXM on ANY anti-depressant. I wasn't even thinking about the contradictions. I've just been on Wellbutrin for a good minute and didn't think about it. I mean come on. I'm so used to taking it so it's not present mentally anymore.  I know that Wellbutrin is a Norpinephrine Dopamine Re-uptake Inhibitor and doesn't effect your serotonin levels, but if I remember correctly, DXM is closest to a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor. Basically? Everything I said says "Serotonin Syndrome" written all over it. Watch your DXM intake on other meds (obviously) but especially anti-depressants. Hope this helps somebody. %)

[according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6), Wellbutrin (Bupropion) is a strong inhibitor of the liver enzyme CYP2D6, the same enzyme that metabolizes dextromethorphan (DXM) into dextrophan (DXO).

Hey, I also take Wellbutrin and have definitely found it to interact with DXM. I was on 150mg for several months and found no interaction, but I've increased to 300mg since then and that certainly made a difference. I find that mentally my trips are pretty much the same, but I get a very unpleasant physical side-effect now. Once the high starts to come on, I get these 'hand spasms'. My hands twitch and spasm very frequently and I have no control over it. It doesn't hurt or anything but it's quite frustrating because I can't do certain things I like to do while on DXM, like draw, photograph, play music, or pretty much anything that requires a steady hand. It's also much harder to relax and be introspective when my hands are jerking like that. 


Has anyone else who's taking Wellbutrin experienced this? I'm wondering if there's some kind of sedative/anticonvulsant I can take while I'm dosing to counteract these spasms. My friend gets prescribed lorazepam which I know is an anticonvulsant so I might try that. I also get prescribed zopiclone (a non-benzo sedative) which may be helpful.


*If the pharamceuticals aren't available when I'm tripping, I also have some herbal sedatives I recently acquired: Chamomile, hops, passionflower, lemonbalm, kava kava. (There's also cannabis of course.) Anyone know if any of those have anticonvulsant properties and would be effective?

I take it in the gelcaps. (though I want to buy some pure stuff once I have the funds.) My dosage is fairly high recently.. I was taking DXM pretty frequently for a couple of months as an antidepressant, so my tolerance gradually skyrocketed. I'm trying to take it only once a month now.. but yeah I guess my dosage would be around 5-600mg.

Erm.. based on what? You'd hit third if you had zero tolerance. 4th takes 1000 or more, according to any of the calculators Ive ever come across (set to 140lbs) and based on my past experience (which frankly was a long time ago now). 600mg is a number balked at by many.

i have a wild hunch.  your hand spasms sorta sound like dopamine toxicity.  maybe the mannitol in the gel caps is causing your wellbutrin to cross into parts of your brain that it normally doesn't reach.  (mannitol alters Blood Brain Barrier permeability).  most other DXM preparations don't have mannitol.  maybe try robitussin syrup for your next tripinstead?  if you do try a different type without mannitol, report back and let me know whether or not you still get the hand spasms.  like i said, its a wild hunch, so who knows.


it could also just be the way DXM itself interacts with wellbutrin.  either way it doesn't sound too enjoyable.  if you start to notice hand spasms in the days after using, definitely quit mixing the two.

Interesting. I didn't even know there were so many inactive ingredients in the gelcaps because they don't list any of them on the product itself. Searched on dailymed.gov and found all of this:


FD&C blue no. 1, FD&C red no. 40, gelatin, glycerin, mannitol, medium chain triglycerides, pharmaceutical ink, polyethylene glycol, povidone, propyl gallate, propylene glycol, purified water, sorbitol, sorbitol anhydrides


Sheesh. Makes me want to try the pure stuff even more.. Anyway, I guess I can try the syrup again. I find it impossible not to puke from the stuff but it's worth a test run. Do you happen to know why they put mannitol in the gelcaps and not the syrup? And no, the hand spasms only last for two or three hours I think. Definitely stops before I have completely come down.

i don't know why they put mannitol in the gel caps.  maybe to help absorption in some way.  mannitol is also used as a sweetener in some stuff, but that's obviously likely not to be the reason they put it in the gel caps.

No, back when I was seeing a psych he as well as the counselors at mental health knew that I was experimenting with DXM and nutmeg. They weren't happy that I was doing so but, oddly enough, they also weren't the ones to warn me about serotonin syndrome; I had to find out about that one on my own. After learning about SS, I stopped taking DXM until off the SSRIs.

Of course, though I do not know about *all *the possible interactions. I checked up on mirtazapine, but could find no contraindications. Do you know of any? I'll check again anyway, and I'll also investigate melatonin (which I haven't taken nor needed since your message about it) just in case melatonin is converted back into serotonin in the brain.

Because I know myself better than anyone. Because I can try out many drugs without gaining approval first. Because psychiatry is only one step above peudoscience, and psychiatrists tend to randomly throw drugs at you to see what works.

I will concede that you make a good point there.

Thats what I said, but he claims to be 140lbs and he claims that 600 gets him to the 4th plateau. Who am I to argue his own personal experience? I mean, I guess I can question whether he is mistaking 4th for 3rd, but maybe he just has a stupidly low natural tolerance, or maybe he just cant do the math properly and is really taking 900.. I didn't feel like it was something worth pursuing anyway.

ok, my friends about to try dxm for the first time. he has 16 coriciden cold and cough tablets, he heard that coriciden is dangerous because he would also be injesting chlorpheniramine maleate along with the dxm. he also heard that chlorpheniramine maleate is souluble in water so he tried to extract it out of the coriceden with ice water and was left with pink powder. he doesnt know if the powder contains the chlorpheniramine maleate or not and isnt sure if he should injest the powder. he thinks that if the exctraction worked correctly he should have like 300 mg of dxm mixed with dyes and bindings left.  wich he says is the right amount for a first time user. does that sound right? im just tryin to look out for him. should most of the chlorpheniramine maleate be gone since he did the cold water extraction?

for your very first time you don't want to do more than 100mg.  5% of the population has an enzyme deficiency that causes dxm to react way more strongly in them.

He's still set on 300 mg he has a pile of pink powder and doesn't know how to measure the amount of dxm that's in it. Not sure what I can or can't ask about on this forum but he had 16 CCc tablets totaling 480 mg he didn't want to pop all 16 in their pill forms because of the chlorpromazine malate in them. He read that if he performed a cold water extraction the cpm would dissolve in the water and the dxm could be strained out, he did so and was left with pink sludge that dried into a powder. He heard that some dxm gets dissolved into the water and he assumes there's at least 300 mg of dxm left but is unsure. What should he do? Does the cold water extraction really get the cpm out?

Yea it seems sketchy.. but at the same time the water extracton sounds legit but idk it would just be wiser and safer to go get the robo gel caps at the store, he was was kind of like hey I just found out I can trip from these pills and I think I filtered out most of the bad shit hahaha i told him it seemed sketchy so i found this forum to get some feedback. thanks for the quick responses though

there's definitely gonna be people that tried larger doses for their first time and it turned out okay.  you're lucky that you aren't one of the 1in20 people that are a poor metabolizer though.  those 42 robogels would've hit you like they were 200 robogels.


1 in 20 is common enough that its not worth the risk going above 100mg for your first time.  four hours after that first 100mg dose you can take more, once you see how the 100mg hits you, so its not even like you're really wasting all that much time doing it...

Glad you had fun, but that's a bit too much to be encouraging other people to take to start with. Especially given how many find it unpleasant, and the number of potential dangerous combos involved.

Hearing this I feel pretty dumb now for taking 20 gels for my first time, but I suppose nothing *too* bad could have happened. I'm very new to this drug and all drugs, so I wasn't sure what to expect even after scanning this forum and spending hours on Erowid. All in all though, I found it quite an enjoyable experience. I think because of my low body weight even around 300mg sent me to the upper second plateau, and I was feeling somewhat dissociated from myself. I've done the same amount two times more since then and both times were rather similar to the first, except the last time I felt compelled to walk around and do a bit more. I found it really fun to interact with the world around me at this level :D 


I'm not quite sure if it's normal to experience Lilliputian delusions at this level.. but I sure did. Not to the extremes that I have heard some people describe, such as shrinking down to the size of an atom or anything, but instead I felt my body simultaneously become larger and yet closer to the ground. As I rotated my hands in front of my face they seemed to be highly magnified, like I could see much more detail than I normally could. Have other people experienced the same thing at this level?

I've been reading the first big & dandy the past couple days when I have time and I'm just over halfway through. I was trying to see if anybody had mentioned blocking Olney's lesions which I find interesting, though based on the fact that DXM causes mental decline in only some people I'm inclined to believe that it's caused by "complex partial seizures" (I think I read that was a possibility in the dxm faq but I'm not certain). Anyway I saw on Wikipedia that it can be blocked by anticholinergics, GABAa agonists, 5ht psychs, benzos and alpha2 adrenergics... does anybody have experience with this? I'm thinking of using kava for GABAergic neuroprotetion from the lesions just as a hopeful precaution.


It's been a while since I've done DXM, over a year now. I just got 2700mg in gelcaps in the mail and I've been thinking about how to experiment with it. The highest doses I've trashed before were 600mg in gels and around 1.2 in polistirex (separate doses, both low third plateau as I weighed around 110lb but had a tolerance). So here's kind of a list of what I'm planning on trying. 


Weight 135lb


900mg + grapefruit juice - this is right on the border of a 4th plateau so I'd expect some full dissociation in meditation and hopefully strong CEVs and possible ego loss. I think I might lack the enzyme that converts dxo and dxm to inactives since I usually have a long ass afterglow, 3 days before I felt normal after the 600mg so I doubt the gfj will do anything but I'm gonna try anyway. I'll also throw some DMAE and/or kava into the mix, dmae for recall and lucidity improvement and kava to mellow it and possible neuroprotectice.


I also heard that dph can increase the CEVs but I fear that even 25-50mg could make me fall asleep especially since I'll be tripping at night, eyes shut and listening music. I thought caffeine could keep me awake but also could counteract the dph and cause some cardiovascular strain. 


100-300mg + DMAA + caffeine - dmaa and caffeine are a decent stimulant to me in combination but I'm thinking a low dose of dxm would kick it up and be more like partway between a cup of coffee and a real drug. 


15-60mg daily - I haven't heard much about it, but some anecdotal reports and since studies on ketamine might suggest that microdosing dxm daily could help depression and anxiety, and improve creativity and give vivid dreams. For some reason I think it'd work well on me and I just feel really compelled to try. 


I won't be taking my first dose until Friday so I'll read more of the first big and dandy and maybe finish that and this one and see if anybody has comments on my plans, and then I'll come back with a trip report or something.

Olney's lesions likely don't occur in humans (according to some research that was done after Willaim White wrote his DXM FAQ)


caffeine and DXM don't mix well in my experience.  25-50mg of DPH should be fine with a third plateau dose.... the DXM should keep you awake.

I've tried dxm three times, all alone. It was kind of enjoyable. I think dxm is more of a "do it with friends" kind of drug. When I'm alone on dxm I just feel alienated, and stupid. Stumbling around and lost in my mind.with friends it would be funny to be like that. But alone its like.. why did I do this to myself? Haha  I think the most enjoyable thing to do when taking dxm alone is to lay down and meditate. It feels nice. That's just my opinion though

I'm on 8mg buprenorphine (subutex) a day for about 2 months now and wana try this drug again. I haven't done dxm in about 2 years. Will I be safe to dose about only 100mg of delsym? It is the dxm polystrex kind I dont really mind it. It's the only dxm closest to pure in my medicine cabinet anyways lol.

as far as i know, that should be a safe combination.  however, buprenorphine is broken down by the same liver enzymes that break down DXM.... producing the same effect as combining DXM with grapefruit.  so you are right in starting with a low dose of DXM.  100mg should be sufficiently low.... could maybe even go as high as 150mg.  you might discover that those doses are even too low, but from a safety standpoint don't start any higher than that for your first time with the combo.

Do you guys consider DXM as good dissociative than ketamine and MXE? I only have one experience with DXM 600mg and it wasn't too deep. Should I dose higher?  I like MXE much more. Why do u guys use DXM, is it because lack of ket/mxe or do you just really like it? I'm surprised that DXM is that popular honestly. Is it because it is so easy to get and extract from cough syrups?

Well, now that I have access to MXE, I do less DXM than I would otherwise. DXM still has a place in my heart, but if I had to pick one and only one dissociative for the rest of my days it would be MXE. 

Still want to try 600mg DXM and .150mg Al-Lad, used to love it with acid back in the day. 

Easy to get is what drew me to it in the first place though, that's for sure.

having tried DXM, MXE, Ketamine, 4-MeO-PCP, and 3-MeO-PCP, i do still enjoy DXM.  DXM is indeed a bit dirtier feeling than the other ones, but it also seems to do a lot more than the other ones.  i think because DXM is more of a receptor whore.... it hits a lot more than just the NMDA receptor.  the other ones are more of a well-target silver bullet, but DXM is more of a brick that smacks you upside the head.  to each their own, every once in awhile i do like to have a brick smacked upside my head.  i definitely see how other people might not enjoy it as much, though..... and if DXM wasn't the first one of the bunch i tried, then IDK if i would still enjoy it as much.


could definitely just be nostalgia factor, or the fact that i started using DXM before i had a dissociative tolerance.  those high dose holes i get with DXM though.... incomparable to the holes i've gotten on the other ones.  such wonky mindfuck.

Beautifully said :D


DXM is just so unique. I find it's effects somewhat visionary. DXM has taken me to some beautiful places and I hold it in the highest regard for some of the experiences it has given me.

Yeah bupe + dxm made quitting heroin a lot easier for me, makes the bupe almost feel like a full agonist opioid. I never had any trouble with the combo but they do potientate each other.

I recently got back into DXM.

I was tripping using coricidin (don't/didn't/won't care about warnings against doing so, yes I know I am going to die a horrible death from CPM), but I want to try a pure dxm product.


edit (forgot to add); today I picked up some robitussin gel caps

I am just wondering, is there any type of time-release on these?  Many people have said they take much longer to take effect. 

and, do these cause any real nausea?  Taking dxm in coricidin doesn't cause any significant nausea.  I tried a dxm-only syrup (chugged) once and it made me extremely sick, and ruined the entire trip.

best bet for DXM-only stuff IMO are the Robitussin gel caps.  not quite as much of a bang for your dollar, but its way more pleasant than chugging cool cherry death syrup.

Actually I have those, I meant to mention it.  I was asking if the gel caps cause any nausea or prolonged release.

ah, i see 


they do take like an hour longer to kick in.  if you don't drink enough fluids with them they can cause nausea, but i find the nausea isn't as bad if i drink a good amount of water with them.  (like three bottles)  also, the nausea isn't as bad (and the trip is better) if you space the dose out a small bit.... i like to take 5 gels every 5 minutes.  its easier on your belly that way, plus it seems to create a better DXM/DXO ratio (if you know what that is... William White's DXM FAQ goes into a good amount of detail on DXO)


taking a single Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) tablet will help with the nausea too.  the recommended dose is usually 2 tablets, but two makes me sleepy and clouds the trip.... 1 works fine.


how much DXM are you going to take?

Hey guys,


I've had a recent interest in disociatives, but being that I have no access to Ket or MXE, I'm opting for DXM; however, in the past I had one experience where I was sick, but I still wanted to party. So I was on pseudo-ephedrine, a bit of pot, and a single beer (my body was rejecting the beer) and had taken two daytime gels, and four hours later two nighttime gels (not pure dxm, I was taking it solely because I was sick).


I remember four hours after I went to bed, I abruptly awoke, feeling very disconnected from my body. I went to go pee and my shadows looked very distant and foreign to me. I looked in the mirror and my eyes were unusually dilated for me. I was unable to recognize myself in the mirror, I looked freaky and alien to myself. When I laid down my limbs seemed to be far away from me, and when I moved them it seemed like it wasn't me moving them. I was very sick still though, and very tired too, so despite a great deal of fear I passed right back out.


That experience, which I am unsure if it actually happened (I can still remember it, unlike most dreams, so maybe it was real) left me disconnected and almost... I don't know, I felt strange for a week after. It was frightening, but not in an AHHHHH I'm scared kinda way, but rather "WTF just happened!?" kinda way. Yet I took very little DXM, and I had only one beer. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this, and also if it means I'm a person who digests DXM weird.


I still want to try DXM in a real dose soon. But I have some questions:

  -Should I go sober from coffee a week prior?

  -Should I go sober from booze for a week or two prior?

  -Should I watch anything I eat? Normally i get a lotta fiber and poop alot, so I'm not too worried.

  -Should I cease smoking pot or tobacco prior? Would pot be fun or bad with DXM? (I know that pot made me queasy last time I   mixed it with hydrocodone, but it usually mixes great with mushies and LSD)

  -Should I try and ensure I had adequate sleep the day of the experience? I'm kinda an insomniac most of the time.


I plan to dose very lightly to test how it effects me. I have a bottle of 20 robogels just sitting in my closet waiting for the right time, but I wana be prepared.


By the way, I'm ~130lbs give or take, at 6'1".

This is a terrible, unsafe combination, no wonder you hated it. Use a DXM only product, herb goes well with it, I think alcohol does but most people disagree with me, if you want something stimulative stick with a lil' caffeine. 25mg diphenhydramine (or related antiemetics) can help prevent vertigo.


Take no more than 100mg this time around, if that's all you took this time, you might be a poor metabolizer (if so, DXM will be crazy strong and could last for days if you take a medium-large dose). If this dosage causes significant effects, then you are, though it may well be the combination of substances you consumed last time led to your experience.

That's what it's supposed to be like, if you don't like it you might not care for the drug. Or maybe knowing this will prevent the fear.

No; no; grapefruit will potentiate DXM; heck no, herb ameliorates the nausea and makes things more awesome, tobacco may feel stronger than normal; the DXM will cause insomnia so it's best if you go into it well rested.

Well, I realize now it was a terrible combo, but at the time everything but the beer/pot was ingested with the intention of alleviating my ills. It's not like I get off on pseudo lol. It was a small amount of DXM in the gells, likely 60mg total if that over a period of a few hours. I was thinking maybe the alcohol had something to do with potentiating it, maybe it was the other actives in the gells or the pseudo. Although, I do recall now that when doctors would ask my mom what drugs I was allergic too, she'd tell them Robitussin DM -_- or at least I think she did.


Edit: My mom just confirmed to me, I am apparently allergic. Is that medical terms for a poor metabolizer? Also, she only assumes this because of something that happened before I was old enough to recall things, so it was likely the syrup if that makes a difference. And she's paranoid, thought I was allergic to ants my whole life, had an epipen and all. Turns out ants are no problem for me.


I think what made it so scary that last time though was because I literally had no expectations of it happening, and I was sick as a dog. I just woke up right into it, like waking up into a dream. There were no scary things just a feeling of "Woah, I feel like I'm in another reality, how did this happen??! Ahhh!"

You'll definitely feel it but like thenightwatch said once you build up a heavy tolerance it can take months or years to go away so I'd give it a few weeks longer so that you're not increasing your tolerance, especially if you already have one and are indulging in 700-800mg usually.


Dissociatives have really long lasting tolerances, I remember it took around 6 months for my Ketamine tolerance to drop and it wasn't even that high in the first place. DXM and other dissociatives are similar.

Ughh, I can't stand D'slyme.  I have a hunch that it causes more DXM to convert to DXO, which I find far from recreational.  In fact, despite what the bottle may claim, least for a buzz, IME, the polisterex is at best 1/2 the potency of HBr.


Something I noticed recently is that Snus seems to alter the fx of dex.  More euphoric, more stony/less stim, more lucid, less visual, yet somehow more inebriating (increase in slurring and fucked gait).  I know, set/setting, but it been consistent, and I am quite experienced with da D (several hundred trips, my drug o choice).  Anybody else get this, or am I just odd?  The change short-lived, can't accurately give a timeframe given DXM's temporal fx, but maybe 15min after spitting out pouch.


Also, erysince I been studying Eastern Spirituality, when I dose, I'm forced to do some sort of freeform yoga (not complaining, rather Enlightening, and my body aches stay gone for weeks).  Ain't always been this way, maybe past year, though I dexxed for over a decade now.

It like I can literally "feel" the Kundalini, as "strings", in my Subtle Body as well.  Only time I can effectively raise it, though I do combine the DXM with meditation, binaural beats, and Pranayama.  Normally, I'm a skeptic, but when I dissociate, I'm instantly coverted into some type of Buddhist or something.  I can't resist, not that I'd want to.  Again, only since I've been reading up on such, so I'm sure it set-related.  Y'all feel me, or am I just another lunatic?

yeah nicotine definitely alters the experience.  DXM does have some effects on nicotinic receptors.  here is one example: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10869398](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10869398) though i don't think the effect described in this paper is the exact reason why nicotine can intensify the experience.

What's weird is that I'm a smoker, pack or so a day.  Never noticed any interactions, whether with ciggs, huge Phillies, or even pipe tobacco...only with Snus.  I knew bout Dex hitting nicotinic receptors, but why is there no interactions with smoked tobacco?  With the pouches, I even tried using multples at a time, but 1 or 5, same fx.

K is far and away my favorite drug i enjoy it much more than lsd or mushrooms at this point. i find it very odd so many people say to "eat better drugs than DXM" no tryptamine or phen i have eaten gets me half as close to K wonderland so i just cannot take those comments seriously. saying that; i have never done DXM. is it likely i would get something beautiful out of it even at this point? gotta say i am really intrigued and have read through most of these pages but still would like some insight if anybody is a similar case to me ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

DXM shares some similarities with other dissociatives like the ones you mentioned, but it is not nearly as enjoyable, in my opinion.  DXM seems to have more negative effects like heavy body load, itching, nausea/upset stomach, etc. I don't experience any of those effects besides the body load with the dissociatives I've tried (Nitrous, K, MXE, 3-MeO-PCP, and 4-MeO-PCP), but even then, the positive effects from those drugs far outweigh the negative effects. It's different for everyone though, some people *really* like DXM, whereas personally I could go without it for the rest of my life and not miss it too much.


Don't get me wrong, I used DXM dozens of times before trying any other dissociatives, and I have had some incredible experiences, but I wouldn't necessarily go into it expecting it to be the same as K or MXE. It's also worth mentioning that there is a cross-tolerance between all NMDA receptor antagonists, so if you currently have a high tolerance, you may want to postpone trying DXM for a few weeks while your tolerance goes down.

May or may not get some dxm soon. Recently got access to nitrous. Although nitrous is and will be fun by itself, it is short lived. Any experienced users think this combination may be worth while, to keep the experience rolling in a second plateau for example and blasting off with nitrous through out the experience?

Ok so i'm Dexing tomorrow rain, hail, shine, or depressed as fuck.


"Zyrtec," contains: Cetirizine hydrochloride 10mg per pill. Works effectively against Dextromethorphan's awful histamine reaction (for me.)


Picked up "**Telfast** NON DROWSY" contains: 180mg Fexofenadine Hydrochloride per pill. Anyone have experience with this? Is it a suitable anti-histamine effective against the histamine reaction? 

I cannot stand histamine reactions after abusing codeine in embarrassingly high doses, before i knew the effectiveness of anti-histamines.

DXM is contraindicated with certain non-drowsy antihistamines.  a google search brought up this thread at drugs-forum.com, which i clicked for shits and giggles.... but then realize its actually one of the few well-written and cited posts i've ever seen over there.  [https://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=33767](https://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=33767)


as far as its effectiveness rather than its safety, though, idk.

Thanks for the response and link. Also: [https://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=130320](https://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=130320) 

I only took 200mg to test my reaction and after 45 minutes received what i'd describe as a "head rush"? Scared me a little but i'm chilled out now. I'd probably go for a more commonly used anti-histamine next time.

Tonight, I intend to take my first DXM trip. I have two bottles of Robitussin gelcaps. Both contain 20 caps at 15mg. Unfortunately, I'm unable to weigh myself but I tend to weight between 180 to 190 pounds, roughly. Should I take one bottle for the first plateau or is my math all wrong?

One bottle will be a low second plateau trip at your weight.  However, for your first time taking DXM you should take no more than 100mg.  About 5% of people have a liver enzyme deficiency that causes them to metabolize DXM differently.  As a result, small amounts of DXM affect these people very strongly.  5% is a decent chance that you will have that deficiency -- think of 20 people you know.  Odds are at least one of them will react to DXM extremely strongly. 


If after three hours or so 100mg doesn't effect you much then it is safe to take more.  Probably another 200mgish on top of that would be reasonable for your first time. 


Happy journeys, be safe.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). DXM can be pretty enlightening if approached with the right attitude.

So...i have a long history with dxm, been doing it fairly regularly since I was 16 (10 years or so)... Used to be able to drink bottles of robitussin without even flinching and never had any sort of gastrointestinal issues. But now the last several attempts I've made have been complete disasters. I thought it was just the menthol at first getting to me, but after repeated attempts and multiple strategies I know its not just that. I have the same problem with gelcaps, with extractions, even with fucking delsym. Idk what the deal is.

I have heard of people getting a "psychological" aversion to the taste/smells of syrups and the taste of DXM in general. It has been said these people will even get nauseous at the very sight of the bottle, let alone the smell...that would suck.

I reckon I drank around 500 bottles before I got to the point that the smell made me sick. Same thing with the cough gels. I don't take DXM much anymore, but I extract it and cap it up when I do and it still gives me a sick feeling for a few minutes. Weed takes care of that though.

Hey.  Couple questions.  I'm trying to surf the top of the first plateau wave, I prefer 'cleaner' dissociation like our heavenly Father MXE or Mother Mary K for higher levels of dissociation.


So with that said, how long does some standard DXM hbr as the only active ingredient in robo syrup take to kick in on an empty stomach, probably drank about 1/2, not quite a 1/2 though, somehwere around 100mg of dxm, of the bottle chased with some gulps of a Heineken Light brew.  Had a couple glasses of wine beforehand.  Like I said I plan on keeping the dxm dose low, same for the alcohol.


Am I going to be feeling dandy soon?  (I hate the effects of the higher level plateaus and I have ingested high amounts of dxm many times back in the day.)  


Would a gram of fungus help things out?

i find that it takes longer to kick in on a totally empty stomach.  you don't want to be too full, but eating a single slice of buttered toast or something similarly light seems to speed thigns up.


a single gram of fungus might double as a trip booster and as a light meal.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)  might be a waste of fungus, but if you have some you don't mind potentially wasting then yeah.

I had 2 small slices of cheese pizza, I suppose it has more protein than bread alone and possibly some cool vitamins in the sauce.


Decided a gram of cannabis would be more appropriate.  Something delightful is taking hold of me, and it sure as hell is not the poison that is alcohol.  Thank you Robo Jesus please save me from alcohol and stimulants, O how I have sinned so much lately, save me!

 Ya I have a cold too, that is great advice.  Who knows, that entire bottle of tussin may not be safe in the garbage where it now sits.  These effects carry a lingering entheogenic feel unlike the abusiveness of speed or alcohol, perhaps the cannabis will synergise nicely with dxm?

Highest I ever dosed was around 900mg (10 mg / kg), enhanced by cannabis. I think I traveled a bit on that one. I was listening to certain songs during the peak of that trip, and to this day I get mild flashbacks when I hear those songs. Rushes of euphoria and memories of being 'somewhere else' I can't quite put my finger on - somewhere that gave me a deeply spiritual feeling.

I posted this on reddit, my story about how taking a second plateau dose of DXM for the first (and second) time gave me a profound psychedelic experience similar to Ayahuasca (only without the mindfuck visuals) and helped me get over all my demons.  As in, I no longer need therapy.  It's a bit long but read it if you're interested...and I'm also wondering if anyone has any input...


~~~


For the first time in my life, I'm OK with who I am and my role in the universe. Normally you read about these kinds of experiences with drugs like Ayahuasca or DMT, but I decided to try DXM for the first time a week and a half ago at a music festival. I didn't know much about it, just that it COULD have similar effects to ecstasy, but that was just on the advice of a friend. But I was pleasantly surprised. But moreso than that, it had lasting effects afterward - I felt something change in me. All of last week, emotions kept coming up unexpectedly every day (especially when I smoked weed) as I tried to process what I was feeling. I realized I was beginning to make sense of my life.


Then, last Friday night, I took another bottle (4oz), which is supposed to give me a "2nd plateau" trip according to that dosage calculator. I essentially "went back into" the trip from last weekend. I felt bursts of profound euphoria which transitioned into clarity and introspection as I started figuring shit out in my life. I started thinking about one particular thing in my past that had haunted me forever, and after analyzing it more closely and zeroing in on one important detail, I was instantly able to see that as evidence of why I'm not a bad person. As soon as I said those words aloud to myself and believed them for the first time, I suddenly gasped and collapsed to the ground. I had been hit by a profound sense relief, euphoria, and forgiveness toward myself and my family. I started crying tears of joy as I forgave myself for everything, and I realized I could be ok with who I am.


After that, I completely redefined my purpose and goals in life. I had been so stuck and confused about what to do with my future for a long time, and now I know exactly what I want to do with the rest of my life. And I'll finally be able to start writing again, which I had also been afraid to do for the longest time even though it's my creative outlet of choice. I rediscovered it during my trip.


I was worried this would go away once the drug wore off and I would go back to being depressed and dissatisfied with life, but it didn't. It's been 3 days now and I have absolutely no withdrawal; I continue to feel great about who I am every time I reflect on what I learned from my experience, which is easy to do - while I was tripping, I wrote everything down in a note to always come back to called "Transcendental Forgiveness." And I keep writing more and more every day, which helps makes me feel complete.


My emotions from the trip come back a little every time I smoke weed, but I have no desire to take DXM again in the near future...maybe for the next music festival.


Is this a common thing? Has DXM done this for other people - given them deep spiritual healing in the vein of a powerful psychedelic trip?


**TL;DR:** Got over all my demons, redefined my purpose in life, started writing again, no withdrawal. Has this happened to anyone else?

In my experience DXM is as much spiritual as classic psychedelics (maby it has something to do with sigma receptor activation, DMT activates it also) . My favorite is 3rd plateau ( low/medium). Best setting is bed tripping at night ,no lights , psybient ,ambient , drone music.


Sadly after getting insights and revelations I've continued to abuse it and it reversed to the place i have been before (maby even further back). I've developed huge tolerance also. At the begining of my journey with dex i used to take more or less 900 mg (I'm a huge guy) for good hole than after about 80 trips i had to take 1600 mg to even touch low 3rd plateau. I stoped taking after overdose on 100 mg 4-aco-dmt and 900 mg dxm for about 3 years. Now i do it once a year about 450 mg . I think tolerance has reversed but i want to save it for a special occasion to jump into hole. 


You shouldnt do it more than once a month to keep side effects and tolerance at bay. There is a good guide for dxm on dmt nexus forum


On the other hand MXE is not spiritual for me at all. Too much stimualtion makes it feel like its speed combined with ketamine. And i couldnt hole on mxe at all even on good one that was active in 10 mg range.

it's really good to read stories like that and I can relate to many things, but you should realize that the afterglow you are experiencing right now probably won't last forever; this is actually not a bad thing, but for you the opportunity to integrate the experience into your daily life. just be prepared for the demons to show themselves again; at least now you know who they are and how to deal with them!

This is where the true value of psychedelics lies.


They show You states that your brain possibly can achieve. Thats a light of hope for those living theyr whole life in depression and anxiety thinking that those states are permanent and nothing can change. It can steer them in direction of self improvement they couldnt even imagine to exist. And maby in 10 years and some more "steering" they can move closer to it and live life with less suffering. 


It doesnt matter that the "afterglow" fades away after some time. Some of it stays with You forever and it builds up if you integrate it properly and reinforce it with some non religious spiritual practice.

I'd have to say that Delsym is the ultimate Dissasosiative. And I say this having done PCP, PCE, MXE, MXM, Ketamine, 3-MeO-PCP and tons of others. DXM is THE greatest disasosiative ever made. Delsym's Enhanced Formulation makes it even better.

Hey guys! I'm sorry if a question of this nature has already been addressed, but I have a question.


Does anyone here have any experience in dosing DXM with LSD? I'm looking to try this combination very soon and have very little data and/or reports involving such a combination.

DXM combine very nicely with LSD and LSZ.

Ah! I plan on combining 300mg of DXM with 5 hits of good LSD (100+ug a hit). Which should I take first? I've seen many people say that taking the Dex first will somewhat ruin the acid. This I think is due to the completely opposing nature's of these drugs.

I would take then at the same time. I've done up to a gram of DXM Poli combined with 1mg of SS-LSz.

Has anyone had MXE (or k or pcp etc)  use ruin their DXM magic?  


I remember a few years ago I did DXM for the first times.  354 mg had me tripping balls.  Then a friend introduced me to mxe which we used (normal use nothing too heavy) for a like a year during which time I never tried dxm again.


Well I tried 400 mg of dxm the other day expecting a trip and it barely did anything at all except make me feel really upbeat.  Did I develop permatolerance to it?  I'm thinking more would do the trick but it sucks that  ican't have such a strong experience from only 350mg anymore.

^ could just be due to cross tolerance.  its a lot easier to build a tolerance with MXE than with DXM (assuming you're taking cough medicine and not pure DXM powder).

I had a pretty awesome experience on 150 mg DXM last night (I don't weigh much, so it's strong enough for me). I was listening to electronic music with my eyes closed, and for lack of a better way to put it, all of a sudden I felt the presence of God. I felt a strong sense of purpose, and that everything would work out for the best. It made me so euphoric it almost moved me to tears.


I smoked some cannabis during the trip, but for some reason the DXM seemed to almost completely counteract the pot. I smoked a pretty monstrous quantity of pot for someone with no tolerance, but in the end it just left my body feeling stoned, but my mind almost no different than on DXM alone.

i'm not aware of deutero-DXO being consumed by a human ever.  probably should act just like DXO.  LSDreamer is right that what you linked is going to be absurdly expensive -- in case you're not familiar with what that "d3" means after the compound name, it means that it is a version of DXO with three "heavy" hydrogens instead of regular hydrogens (hydrogens that have a neutron and a proton instead of just a proton).  such compounds are always absurdly expensive.


and BTW your post is about to get edited to remove that source link.  source linking isn't allowed on Bluelight at all.  it is against the rules to post any links or give any advice about where to buy drugs.


also, using the acronym "SWIM" is against the rules here.  perhaps a moderator could explain why better than i can.


but that's alright, you're new.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  welcome to Bluelight.

Deuterated drugs are metabolised very differently as the larger deuterium atom is not able to fit enzymes like hydrogen can. You should not take that compound even if you can afford it.


Additionally please note that we do not allow the discussion of sources here, no matter the drug or the country.

Does anyone know if CVS or Walgreens sells Delsym without carding? I'm know someone who is under 18 that I want to help out with getting dissososiatives. I usually just give him some of my pure DXM, but he wants to try polistyrex. I guess I could just buy him it...

you have to be a bit more careful with combinations with DXM, and "heroic" sized doses of DXM feel a lot more toxic than "heroic" sized doses of MXE... but when used at reasonable doses and with caution about combos i'd say its just as safe as most other dissociatives.  definitely safer than MXP or DPH.

those are the most commonly used acronyms for methoxphenidine and diphenidine.  both have definitely been made and even have threads here in PD.


they are dumb acronyms tho, MXP because so many people think it must be the propyl analogue of MXE, and DPH since so many people assume it means "diphenhydramine."  so i understand your confusion.

he presents lots of information about how DXM is toxic **when used chronically** or **when used at high doses**, and uses that as his reason for never even using DXM in a responsible manner?  in addition, he seems to have a misunderstanding of some of the concepts he is presenting -- particularly the bit about acidosis sounds like he spent 20 minutes reading the wikipedia article and now considers himself an expert.


this bit really bugs me:

> This analogy comes from deductive reasoning, based SOLEY on the nature of the drug's pharmacological profile at so-called 'recreational' doses. I do not have actual proof that a 21 year-old has a 50 year-old man's kidneys &/or liver, but one does not necessarily need proof to support a claim that hepatotoxic substances cause aging of the liver; nor that kidney-toxins will induce renal changes.These are typical sequelae of people who suffer the type of insults which occur in the setting of recreational-dose DXM.

that thread doesn't turn into legitimate harm reduction until it gets to the bits about drug combinations / enzyme inhibition / complications from the other active and inactive ingredients in cough medicine preparations.


i wish he fleshed out the "ADDICTION" section more, because that is where i believe the true dangers of DXM lay.  and most people don't get hooked on it like i have.


if that guy thinks that DXM is legitimately not safe enough to take at any frequency or any dose, then i'm really interested about what drugs he DOES think are safe.

Don't use those acronyms. If you do, you are contributing to misinformation and bullshit. It will take a while to fix this, considering that some vendors even list products as MXP.

The acronyms are used by all vendors and every person on the internet; except for you. In additon, there is no misinformation associated with them. They are simply stupid and irrational acronyms. As much as you wish them to mean what you logically deduced, they do not. Since every person on the internet (except for you) understands what they mean, there is no confusion (except for yours).

I've only taken DXM once, and I drank two bottles back to back, totaling to 710 mg. Given my heavy K use and lately, MXE use, I barely got a buzz, except when I smoked weed, it seemed to kick it up some. A little background, I need about 180 mg of Ketamine IM'd to hole, and even in my holes, I never lay still, I flop around. Also, even on extremely heavy binges, I don't get nauseous anymore, so my tolerance is very high. If I'm going to insufflate it, I need about 450 mg snorted of quality, self-dried ketamine, to hole. Also, with MXE, I need about 100 mg or so to really start getting a strong high going. I can actually function very well on moderate doses of no more than around 70 mg, sometimes better than sober.


Anyway, would an extra 355 mg be too much, for a total of 1,065 mg? I don't want to overdo it due to the horror stories, and I don't want to be too high and not enjoy it; but I do love dissociatives!


Just for the record, it's pure DXM HBr.

spacing out your DXM dose produces a more intense trip.  when i hear of it not hitting people they usually say they chugged all their cough medicine at once.  i like to space my doses out, about 75mg every 5 minutes until i hit the dose i want to achieve.  this is a trick i learned from a friend, the theory is that it produces a more ideal DXM/DXO ratio when you let your liver process a little bit at a time.  i'm not convinced that it works for that reason, but it does definitely work.

yeah you'll still feel full effects.  DXM tolerance takes awhile to build.  be careful, though, because once you build the tolerance, it takes a very, very long time for the tolerance to go away.


once-a-week dosing is enough to build tolerance, btw.  so while you're fine this weekend, if you end up taking it every weekend you will end up building tolerance.

^^Also, that combo feels bad on the heart, that's what made me quit it for good. I got what felt like minor heart palpatations on the pair together. I sometimes get into taking too much dxm(not at once, but like over multiple days), which I justify with the old "I gotta have something its better than booze or opis or bzd's", which it is all that, but I wish there weren't so many side effects.


 Also, Ive been relgated to dxm w/guifanesin tablets out of neccesity, and while I can stand the guaf and not vomit as long as I dont push it too much in one dose, I miss the shit outta robo cough gels. I had a big supply of those I got wholesale for cheal, def. easier on me without the G.


 Sometimes wish I could get mxe or ket, but then again, the factors that limit my dose on dxm kinda keep me from going overboard. Dxm just makes me feel so alive! Music(listening or playing) is so fucking amazing in it and Im just a nicer damn person. I also love how you can ponder things from such a different point of view I never see when not on it. Sure, you can get a tad delusional at times, but that's not always a bad thing! 


Anyways, sorry for the fuckin novel, I really wanna get some tablets from the store right now, but my fiance wants me doing nothing but weed, and Im also trying to get healthier psychologically and physically. But damn that d isomer methorphan keeps callin my fuckin name!!

If you're lucky I would say roughly 6-8 hours of tripping and you should have an afterglow the next day.

Hey guys I was wanting to know if anyone could help shed some light here. I have had many excursions with DXM and ive only halucinated 2 times once on my 5th trip with syrup in which my painting was a monster swimming on my wall and everything was strobing, and the other time was when I fell asleep I had a VERY bizzare dream in which I was sitting on a couch on some drug tripping balls shrinking and growing and halucinating the creature from Dead by Daylight that the characters get sacraficed to. I woke up and realized I was tripping balls. Most of my trips are about 600mgs and I have done 1200mgs before that trip just made me think I was going to die but still no halucinations. Can anyone offer advice in why i dont get visual effects like everyone else at much lower doses?


 Last night I took 40 gel caps with 15mgs in each over a 30 min period. I hadnt eaten a single thing all day btw. soon after I was getting disoriented (its been at least 2 months since my last trip) I had a very bad feeling and about 20 mins later I was puking it all out. My cognitive abilities were fastly deteriorating. My other friend who took 300mgs was fine and just slightly loopy. I immediately realized i had robo itch on my head so i itched some then decided to ignore it. And the rest of the night i listened to dubstep and layed on the floor at one point i puked on the floor and cleaned it up mainly just water and bread cuz i was munching on bread during the trip. When i layed down i felt like i was on spinning disks or on a rollercoaster, or driving down a very hill laden highway. But again no halucinations just far things were blurry so i couldnt read the clock well.

DXM doesn't have much more than distortions for open eyed visuals. Like most dissociatives the real fun is behind closed eyes in a dark room.

Well on my 1200mg trip i was in a dark room. With only a small night lamp that changed colors and I wasnt experiencing these crazy seeing aliens or anything I was conscious that I had taken a drug and that everything would be over in the morning but I get feelings but i dont get cev either. I usually pop in headphones smoke a joint and like melt into the universe where i feel connected and my body feels amazing and loved and sometimes I become the music but its just mental and bodily not visual. And on occasion like last night I felt like i made a horrible decision and have a rough beginning wondering wtf am I doing this AGAIN.

After consuming 450mg on a 7 hour flight a few evenings ago, I was messing around with flight attendants in the galley at the rear of the plane for quite a while. The one I was speaking with the most said that I could go in there and chill with them, because she needed me to keep her awake as she was very tired. When it kicked in, I was pretty fucked. 


One of them ended up giving me three bottles of red wine and four little vodkas to drink on board or take with me. We were discussing the need for a disco ball to be installed, so that we could dance and rave on board. 


I'm pretty sure most of the flight attendants were on drugs as their eyes were beaming and they were all in hysterics. They were wearing funny little hats due the dress code of the airline I was flying with. 


While I was sitting in my seat, staring out the window and tripping out with my headphones in, listening to 60s and 70s rock, made the experience even better. 


DXM is a fun drug, in my opinion ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Does weed intensify  the trip  that much, I'm trying  to remember  my most intense trip I took way to much, but it was about 1800 mg then right after  I smoked some weed then the next day I smoked some hash and weed mixed together. I know I was real high  for almost 24 hours since  than I've never  gone close to that but I'm just wondering  if the hallucinations  were from the dxm or from the combination ?

Weed and dissociatives potentiate each other like crazy, yes. Probably the most out of anything I've ever combined weed with.

I've gotten visuals and hallucinations from DXM alone. your hallucinations were probably more because of the Dxm, but combining it with weed will intensify all the effects of dxm including the visuals...

I love DXM, but every time I take 450mg+ (which is most of my trips) I feel like I've lost my mind and it won't ever come back but I still enjoy my trip, anyone else do this? Just took 790mg about 30min ago so I'll probably be tripping balls soon. 


Also it seems like I'm more sensitive to DXM than others. I'm a fairly big guy, 5'10 200lbs (not really fat believe it or not). When I was new to dxm I could get to first plat with around only 75mg. 480mg puts me on low to medium 3rd plat and my highest ever dose of 960mg deffinately got me to 4th. On 4th I had an amazing experience that honestly reminded me of some of the reports I'd read about DMT. I didn't want an experience as intense as 4th plat tonight but I wanted more than the same old 480mg trip so I took 790mg, this'll be my first time trying anything between those two so wish me luck.

Its a nice high that lasts a long time, like 8 hours or so, and beause it lasts so long you dont feel the need to it again right away. Its better to space out when you take it because you have to take a higher dosage each time. There isnt really any huge long term effects for just dxm in my experience, just stay away from CCC and take pure dxm.

Just had a damn fine third platue trip, too bad it ended up with me at the ER with a tube through my dick. 


Seriosly like 5-6hours after the peak i still couldnt go to the bathroom. 

So now im typing this shit still high on that robo powder. 


Probably the last time i took dxm.

Im now stuck with tube and bag in my dick for a few days. 


Be careful with this drug,  people die from not be able to pee.


When i called the hospital they told me to get there asap. 

They even wanted to send a ambulance. 


After reading about this now afterwards i see that its quite common. 

I Wonder how many people died from dxm this way? 


The weird part is that i did 1,6g last saturday,  this time i only did 930mg.


Could it be that i still had dxm in my system and this just put me over some threshold. 


I also did close to 80whippets during the trip.

The weird thing i that ive only done dxm like 5 times ever.

And the first 3 times was over 3years ago.


Never abused any dissio really,  ive done it semi regular at times but nothing extreme except a few 2-3day semi binges. 


Too bad since i enjoy dxm more then most drugs. 

But now i wont dare touch it,  i wonder if there is any pharma drug that can reliably make you pee yourself??

sucks BN, at high dosages of DXM I would get that too. But I'd always pee eventually, even that one time I OD'd. Used to be pee shy in public places. Same thing would happen. I learned a trick. Start doing multiplication tables in your head while trying to pee. Chose a random numbers like 132 * 7 and start solving. Seemed to help on DXM too.

Hi i was planning on taking around 400-500mg of dxm soon and i am thinking of getting some nitrous to go along with the trip as they are both dissociatives. I do nitrous quite often but have not done dxm in several months and have not taken a dose this high in a very long time. Was just wondering what the mix of these two drugs is like and if it is safe?

I'm not sure what it's subjectively like,  but it's physically safe for sure.  I'm guessing the nitrous will be massively potentiated.

Heard about someone who revised Agent Lemon to not involve any citric acid at all. The naphtha mixture was simply left to evaporate, leaving freebase DXM. Anyone can confirm/deny?

Not sure, but freebase DXM is going to have bioavailability issues, not sure less effective product is worth the greater ease.

What is it about this harmless-looking red syrup that continues to fascinate us? I had a few good 1st-2nd plateau experiences many many years ago, then I met its dark side around 2005. I haven't used it since, but I've been left with a bit of HPPD/PTSD to this day; Sometimes I dream that I'm on it and it feels as real as any bad trip. Other times I smoke a little too much weed and have flashbacks. Strange stuff.

Im not sure if this is in the right subthread or not but 

What do you think about storage of dxm hbr powder?

I dont use it as much as i used to and figured i should store it proper.


I put it in a mylar bag, with all the air pushed out then vac sealed. Then into another mylar bag.


Is this ok at room temp in a kinda damp basement or should I add desiccant and seal again?

It's likely fine, TOC. As far as I know it's a pretty stable molecule.


dreamflyer, I personally hold DXM as my second or third favorite dissociative. I still will take pills occasionally. Though I've been tempted to buy wholesale from a supplier on a certain Asian sourcing site.
