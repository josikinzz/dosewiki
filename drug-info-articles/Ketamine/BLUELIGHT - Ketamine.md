^ Yes but it kinda depends what you want it for.


I mean if you wanted to rave on small bumps of K all night and not k-trip but just have a higher music appeciation, and a bit of wonky in your dance, 20mg mxe is better for it than K.

I think that completely depends on the person and not just on what you're looking to achieve. I think I enjoy MXE and Ketamine equally. Given the choice of either right now I'd pick Ketamine just because I haven't had it in quite some time, but given the choice of only one for the rest of my life, I'd pick MXE simply because it feels like it is a much more flexible drug - as I can enjoy it as a stimulant, an "opiate-like" light dissociation, or a full blown "hole" ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

How important are the visual effects of Ketamine? I don't really want to take it just dissociate but if I get to see incredible CEVs on a normal (read non hole dose) then I may try it.

Ketamine isn't really a very visual drug, at least not for me. Probably the most notable thing I've seen after railing it was a view of myself sitting on a couch from somewhere outside the universe.

^You won't see much CEVs from a non-hole dose of ketamine. There are great visual distortions of your environment from sub-hole doses and from the pre and post hole state. But the closed-eye visuals don't develop until you either reach a k-hole, or you've been redosing heavily for many hours (if you can call them closed-eye visuals, because during the hole you often can't tell whether your eyes are closed or open). 


If you do the continuous redose thing, the experience goes to a whole new level, and closed eye visuals become very intense and colourful, and very strange things begin to happen with regard to apparent 'superpowers' (apparent telepathy, translocation, dimentional shifting, shifting consciousness between bodies etc.)

300mg of k proved too much.. Drying your ketamine out can make it hit you a lot harder / differently IF it was damp beforehand i sure learned that....


Spannered... Haha.

IWith low doses extendedly, would one be able to maintain themselves while time traveling / dimension shifting?

I mean, MXE lets me function, if a bit mechanically..

**Ketamine lozenger**


Friend just started with a new pain clinic here in California and he's decided to try this friend on ketamine lozenges 100 mg. He gets 30 at a time, Friend is already on 20 mg oxynorm 4 x a day plus 100 mcg fentanyl suck on half a patch a day. 


Can you have any fun with ketamine, he's never used it before, once He broke his arm and came out of surgery they had the plaster on too tight and woke up in agony, I think they gave him a ketamine injection into his drip, it sent him blind but not pitch black just out of focus enough He said he could see his hand in front of his face, also when He was being talked too people sounded far away plus He couldn't see them He only assume they where close because they rocked his bed. plus the whole time he thought he was being pushed back to his room but he was actually stationary the entire time.


It felt like no other drug hes had cept maybe the closest thing it felt like was long lasting NOS feeling.


So back to the ketamine lozenges. Hes got 30 at 100 mg each never had it before and would like to bump some if anyone knows a good method or safe 


He was told people rarely get started on 100 usually 10mg was told, so He get them in a few hours hes  looking forward to some pain free few days atleast

Well nitrous is a dissociative, and so is ketamine. They are of course, similar.


100mg seems kinda ridiculous as a first dose...


Ketamine is one of my favourite substances.

Ketamine's awesome. But ketamine is a dissociative, and dissociative questions belong in Psychedelic Drugs.

100 mg for an oral dose seems good, nasal is usually around 20 mg? I know for me a bump is like 100 mg, to get any worthwhile oral effects i need to take like 350mg+.


Also it is pretty harmful on the stomach, make sure to drink lots of water if our going to be going on binges. Don't learn the hard way, K-pains are not fun.

**Ketamine at a rave?**


Anyone have experience with doing Ketamine at a rave. I made a thread asking for alternatives to MDMA at raves (not meaning things that are similar to MDMA, just something I can do at a rave when I'm not doing MDMA because I only do it once a month) and Ketamine was one of the suggestions.


I've never tried ket before, I know with heavy doses it's a strong disassociative but what's it like doing 'bumps' of it at a rave and how big/small do these bumps need to be if i want to stay relatively lucid and not k-hole everywhere. Also im not aware of safety precautions with doing ket at a rave but im sure there will be a thread with information on that somewhere.

erowid is saying about 15-30mg bumps, im pretty small so will probably try 20mg bumps but that will be hard to measure out at a rave.

what about redosing? can you stay nice and high for about 6-8 hours if you redose regularly?

no but you can quite easily stay confused, occasionally blissful and nicely dissociated for that long, redosing hourly. You might call that "high" I call it wonky.


If you do accidentally do too much then youll loose an hour in which youll act pretty stupid wandering/falling around. Quite easy to get kicked out. Think village idiot/drunk crossed with zombie behaviour .

 Depends on the type of clubs you go to, there are *some* which turn a blind eye to people k holing on the dancefloor.

small regular doses and ill be fine. take too much and expect to end up floored for awhile, but it wears off nicely. just make sure its ket and not cut MXE or something, that'll be a disaster

Hey chesh,


I rave on k sometimes, i like to wait 40 days between my 100mg dose of mdma now,


So if i get invited out twice in that 40 days i just do k on the day im not doing md on ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just remember dont drink with it, and also dont take loads in one go, 3 key bumps at a time MAX then you wont be too fucked then,

It takes ~5-10 minutes to kick in (I usually notice effects by 7 minutes the latest) and about an hour to wear off fully. I just use a small crevice on my hand to take bumps out of - only holds probably 30mg at the most, works very well. Arch the left hand back and look for a divit behind your thumb.

haha pjkt2501 that's a really neat idea, when i bend my thumb back there's a little bit just above the tendon where i could snort a bit of K from if that's what you mean. i've got scales so i can meaure out how much that holds and how much a 'key' is and see which way is the best to do little bumps at a rave. i'll do one bump, leave it for 10 minutes and see how i am then do another half or quarter of a bump if i need more (which i probably won't, im a lightweight).


what does a small amount of k make socialising like?

Funky :D at best haha. If you do enough, your lips are gonna have a bit of trouble makin' the sounds you want. However, you're more likely to stay below that dose and just act a bit confused. I'll usually do 4-5 bumps off the back of my hand throughout a 2-4 hour event. Usually one to get a feel, a second quickly after to get deeper, wait for it to come off, then two more slightly larger ones to keep me for the rest of the night, and to allow enough time to "cool down" before having to depart from wherever I am, and not be too cocked to function properly.

Have a blast! It's always easy to add a little more, just give yourself about 10min between bumps to see where you're at. Being properly fuzzed at a show / fest is very enjoyable - however I'm also not the type to dive into a k-hole (I skirt the edges nicely, and that usually happens more while on LSD as well).

my favourite things about raves are music and socialising with people in the smoking area or just making new friends. so hopefully ketamine provides me with a pleasant feeling, while allowing me to dance to music and make frieeeends

Yeah its great for clubbing and meeting people and in small amounts a bit of a stimulant and can make you chat loads. Larger amounts will have you frowning as you attempt to chat then get stuck on your words, pretty fun either way :D

Recently found out the local drug dealer where all the "K" floating around in my area is actually just a greedy fuck who's passing off MXE as K.. Really disappointed and upset that I won't be able to experience K in the foreseeable future. I wonder if this is becoming common with its popularity?

Just read thru 34 pages of k talk haha, had my opinion changed completely and a lot of heresay facts squashed from when i was younger, now very much cant waitt o get hold of some k! 2 questions:


1. can one k hole more than once in a session, ie if i have a gram, will i get a second k hole during the course of the night (im aiming to hole, so will be doing a small test line to get a judge on where i satnd with it, then followed by another if the first doesnt hole me straight away) so assuming i get a hole after my first line or so, does the tolerance squash the chance of hitting another hole, or is say 750mg (which i assume i would have left at least) enought to hole me again? 


2. anyone care to try explain what they see/do in a k hole and what actually happens, is it more a physical world in which you enter, like a lucid dream per se, where you are in control (of course i dont expect to be in control straight off the bat, but understand with time this could be achieved?) or, well i dunno what else, just looking for an explanmation of sorts,,, maybe upon reentering reality, could you draw what you saw, ie are they tangible visions within your own mind! 


eitherway, im excited to enter ketaland! all things going well should have some in my posssesion by end of the month ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Of the few times i've tried. k is good. It's very interesting experience. 

in low dose purposes and as well as semi k / k whole. 


The thing I don't like about it is the nausea. Similar to alcohol, like that feeling you get when you need to lay down from feeling sick. It's not as bad though, but still very annoying. the nausea also gets worse if I do small bumbs 20ish mg and try to keep a buzz going long >6 hours.   This could of been due to prior mdma usage though, about 250mg 24h / 48h prior & I may of been just tired.


Who knows.

The only time I ever tried K was pretty amazing. No hole doses, I just got up and felt like I was hover-walking. I just felt like I could walk to Mars, and the ground seemed not to be...apparent. It was there but it wasn't an impedance.


Such is the nature of disassociatives I guess ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

i misbehaved a fair bit on the K this past 6 days or so lol.

Need to give it a little break now , detox time.


Lol,

What does anyone in here know about Recooking ketamine crystals? (Plate on top of boiling water pot)

I personally find:


1. Its absorbed better than crushed crystals

2. The drip isnt as disgusting

3. you lose about 10-15% of your ketamine in weight

4. Its snorted easier and dont get all stuck, it turns into a really nice fine fluffy dry powder

I have tried to get K every since I started experimenting with harder drugs then weed etc. I still havent been able to find some to this day were I live but hopefully one day. I have however tried MXE a few times and liked it although i did m-hole at the cinema on my 3rd time using mxe so that kinda made me stear clear of it for a bit. Anyway, i was wondering, could anyone compare mxe and ketamine for me so I know what the differences will be if I ever get my hands on some k?

You can heat it up to dry it out, or leave it out in the open to evaporate. It was most probably wet when you bought it because it wasn't cooked* thoroughly enough. I have watched people 'cook up' batches of ketamine, and many times it is done in a hurry by dealers who just want to knock it out as quickly as possible in the next half-hour. If it was done with care, it wouldn't be moist like that.


(read: evaporated on the hob from a water-based solution.)

I'm having some trouble finding advice on the proper doses for a cocaine-ketamine combo.


 I've got 100mg of ketamine that I dried myself straight from a Ketaset bottle. My cocaine is probably around 60% pure. 


I am thinking 50mg of ketamine but I am unsure how much cocaine to pair with this. Any advice?

I wish I could be more help. When I used to do this combo, it was in the days before I was using scales to measure out RCs, and I would just rack up lines with the cocaine/ketamine mix, at maybe a 1:1 ratio. Sometimes it was insufflated separately, but in that case the ketamine usually predominated the dose, and the cocaine was for extra kicks and so it was a "small line".


The cocaine won't potentiate the ketamine's effects in to overdose territory, it will just alter the nature of the experience. So you are safe taking an average dose of ketamine for you + an average sized dose of cocaine, maybe slightly less.


I know this is pretty useless to you in terms of dose, but that is how my then friends and I used to take it. I hope you enjoy the combo, they do synergize quite nicely.

Thanks, that's pretty much what I needed to hear. I am going to try 20mg Ketamine and about 30-40mg of the cocaine. After that point I will just bump them in a one to one ratio until I get to where I think I should be.


I was tempted to save the ketamine for combination with MDMA, but I've heard the cocaine combo is a bit more unique and special, certainly the durations match up nicely.


Thanks again for your input!

If you haven't tried ketamine and MDMA I think you should try that one first ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


I would imagine ketamine and coke to be a pretty weird combo, though I've never tried coke (nor do I plan to) so I'm not speaking from experience on that side of the coin... But ketamine+MDMA (or MDA if you REALLY want things to be awesome) is exceptionally good. Take your normal dose of MDMA and once you peak, enjoy k until the comedown and even after! Reduces any shitty comedown from the MDMA. Never tried high doses or IM/IV administration of k when doing this though, as I imagine it'd be near impossible to properly hole while also being stimulated, though again I can't speak from experience about that specifically.

I think a kittyflip would be superior but I still think that coke plus a smaller dose of K would be insanely awesome as long as you have enough coke to keep it going. Even if you don't, the durations aren't far off and K is great for stimulant comedowns anyway so not much harm there.

I wanted to save the MDMA for a candy flip, but now I'm thinking it might be fun to candy flip and work the K into the mix at the tail end of the experience.

It's not a case of one combo being better than the other. They are two quite different experiences. 


The MDMA + Ketamine combo is more trippy and OOB. It's like being semi-holed on ketamine whilst being very lucid and observing your actions from above. You can maintain motor skills on this combo. However, I find that memory retrieveal is still almost as poor as when on ketamine alone.


The Cocaine + Ketamine combo is a very euphoric high. Still quite dissociative but with a very "on the nose" euphoria. You can be a lot more present, with the ability to see straight and even hold a limited conversation. It's possible to get quite far out and even hole with repeated doses, however you probably won't go out of body. You may find cannabis to go well with this combo.


Qualitiatively the experieces of these combos differ significantly. The MDMA combo is more stupefying and entheogenic, whereas the cocaine combo is more "bang in your face" and down to Earth fun. They are both worth trying.

Thats what I would do! Someone somewhere knows how much I enjoy K+MDMA, in fact the next time I have any K around i'll definitely make sure to work some kitty flipping into some experience! IM'ing K+MDMA+DPT was out of this world euphoric+astounding the last time......to say the least! Either way have fun!

Candyflipping and doing k is really one of the greatest combos imo. Really euphoric and visual while still being quite lucid. Great to do at a show, and then once getting home busting out even larger doses of k and then hitting the DMT pipe.![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I remember someone one here calling LSD+MDMA+K "the holy trinity" and I think that's fairly relevant, although most of the time I would prefer MDA over MDMA, but that's not to downplay MDMA... It's perhaps a bit better to take MDMA to add stimulation and socialization but MDA makes it a bit more introspective, in addition to adding it's own flavor to the visuals. Ether way, for a really good social psychedelic experience, and then doing more k and smoking DMT allows for really good end-of-trip reflection (in addition to making the DMT much more immersive!)

I need some advice from experienced k users please.

I tried the ket I acquired two times and I have not really been happy with the effects. 


First I used 4x25mg bumps over the course of one hour. 

After that time I was kind of wasted but it was not psychedelic in any way. certainly no hole, hard to walk, strong body high and distorted perception etc. I stopped after snorting 100mg total because I grew weary of the effects and didnt feel like I was achieving anything worthwhile. 


Next try (some days later) I injected 100mg in my deltoid. After a few minutes I noticed strong effects, sat down... and was gone. The next thing I remember is that I was left with some single point that I somehow needed to expand into the universe. Everything was collapsed into it and I was thinking about how to get the universe to work again. It was like fixing a computer or something, very analytical. When it booted again my perception of the room came back. I managed to look at my mobile for the time (that was very hard to do) and noticed it was T+25 minutes.

I was very high for another hour or so, slight nausea. Then I fell asleep and awoke around T+2:30 all sweaty and with the effects mostly gone. 


So my first question: was the second dose too high and I forgot the hole experience?  Or can it be that all that happens in a hole is you having to fix the damn universe computer? Should I try to IM a smaller dose? 


My second question is about harm reduction:

I hated insufflating (horrible drip, crumbs in my nose) and IM seemed so much more effective (first time ever I used a syringe cant believe how easy and painfree it is)

Is it considered unsafe to IM blackmarket powder ket dissolved in water (everything but the powder completely sterile)?  Can I cook the dissolved powder to sterilize it without destroying the ket? Will using bacteriostatic water for injection make it safe?

lol "holey spirit" love that one for sure. 

finally tried K one night not long ago but didn't get to hole. 

Maybe next time. 

Felt good like MXE does but more tranquilized and harder to move and wobbly. 

I noticed my head was wobling around a bit more and harder to hold up. 

Can't wait for my first K hole but the stuff isn't flowing around here like it does in UK. 

first time I ever seen it was just recently.


I think I hoofed like 35mg up the nose at once. Felt good I liked it. Relative to MXE somewhat.

It kinda tasted like I thought it would taste for some reason, which was odd. 

Seemed familiar.


makes me wonder if some of the MXE I got from UK had an real K in it lol.

Just a follow up, I actually wasn't a fan of K & coke. I tried 20mg and even a 50mg bump of the K multiple times with cocaine. I preferred the coke high on its own. The ketamine dominated the experience for me and I didn't feel any body buzz or euphoria. I only felt anesthetized & dissociated, albeit with a more active mind. Maybe I should have dosed the K higher? I was looking for some kind of synergy to the euphoria that just wasn't present for me, although a close friend of mine absolutely loved the combo.

Haha I though I was being all original and creative calling it that hah damn


Toghether at the same time I dont know how else to describe it as just not too good of a feeling, they distract from the main points that make them both great, but they're great one after the other, K is perfect for the coke comedown and just sliding into a hole and blasting away the comedown, while coke after k increases the superman feeling

I IMed K last night for the first time. Hadn't had K in months. It was very expansive and puddle-y, but today my brain seems vacant. I feel like K fucks with my attention and short-term memory. I feel like it is a powerful tool for exploration, but I do not know how to use it. 


I'm gonna stick with Salvia.

**Ketamine - Nervous!**


I'm a regular IV heroin and meth smoker (sometimes IV, not in awhile tho) 


I also have been taking some xanax the last couple days. Just half a bar, no where NEAR black out or fucked up state. Just to relax and make the H stronger so I can use less.


I came across some special K. And honestly I'm scared to use it. I booked a hotel by myself so my grandparents wouldnt walk in and I could be uninterrupted.


When I did acid I freaked out and hated I was stuck in the "trip" I also took 4 tabs my first time...like I took 16g of shrooms my first time,..(all or nothing! actually shrooms was accident partially)


Anyways, is ketamine more mellow than acid and shrooms? I know those are psychs and K is a dissociative ive just heard they CAN be similar.


I'm worried ill do it and freak out and do something stupid. Or does this not happen? I'm planning on just taking key bumps or maybe even half that and just wait 15-20mins in between til I like where I am at.


So do I have anything to worry about or am I just being paranoid?


(in light of harm reduction, 1mg xanax as taken 5hrs ago (normally take 2mg to get fucked up) -- did a shot of dope about 5hrs ago too. So the only interaction should be the meth. Is that bad or good?


I also have not eaten or even drank anything in like 6 hrs (other than some sips of water)


**EDIT: **Decided not to take it..read its bad to mix with benzos. And it greatly depends on mindset as far as the "trip" goes and ive been insanely depressed and overall in a shitty mood..think im gonna wait haha,

Glad you decided not to do it, sounds like it just was not a good time for you to try it.


I used to smoke crystal meth and currently have been doing IV heroin. So looks like we have similar tastes maybe? And I HATE K. I've tried it quite a few times also to give it a chance and I've varied to the doses and everything. Same result: I hate it.


No, it's not like acid or shrooms. The duration is pretty short, half an hour to an hour. It's kind of like being drunk. Except you feel like a total weirdo and you're completely out of touch with yourself and your surroundings. The more you do the more shit gets weird. If you're really curious just do a point by yourself and you should be fine. The times I had bad trips it was because other people were around and I felt self-conscious. 


I don't see any reason why you would freak out. I've had bad times back when I used to use hallucinogens but I've never flipped out or lost it. You just have to realize that you are in control of yourself. Just make sure your body is clean of all other substances when experimenting with K.

I don't see why ketamine and benzos would be a dangerous combination, ketamine isn't a CNS depressant. I've taken etizolam with methoxetamine many times without incident.


EDIT: By that I mean that I take etizolam once the MXE peak has passed to kill the residual stimulation and help me sleep. Taking them together is pointless as you just sleep through the MXE trip.

KEtamine is awonderful and magical drug. its eye opening and spiritual. Only makes you feel weird if you arent comfortable with yourself. ITs pretty simple. Enjoy yourself..enjoy the high the drug creates. I think being arround people you dont like, or feel ok with would make the high awkward yea..so remove them from the situation ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I love that drug. its just impossible to get where i live lol, no one ever has it.

Ketamine is used to treat bipolar disorder & depression.


It's an awesome, soft, fun drug. 

Enjoy yourself. You feel like you travel through time itself and become reborn again, completely cleansing your mind.


EDIT: And I also recommend watching 'real' stuff on youtube whilst under the influence. 

Stuff like base jumping & not stuff with special effects.

Ketamine is very polarizing - some love it and some hate it. If you're into dissociatives (DXM, MXE) you'll love it. If you don't like the "headspace" of dissociatives you will have a bad time with K.


It's not anywhere near as long lasting as acid or mushrooms, and lacks the same "paranoia" that they have. It's a totally different headpace and a much different experience - ketamine and the "classical" hallucinogens produce their effects by mostly different routes.


At higher doses it is possible to get really confused and have a bad trip, or just forget large portions of it. Benzos and other sedatives like alcohol will accentuate this (unless you're BZD dependant). K and a benzo is a regularly used combination for IV sedation.


At lower doses it is indeed much like being (very) drunk, but quite clear headed. The best method to titrate is probably small, 25-50mg key bumps every 10 minutes until you get where you want to be. Try taking about... 80-100mg in total and you'll be quite nice ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

The problem with Ketamine in my experience is the margin for error is too small, and the effects too unpredictable.

Weird. 


I always found it extremely easy to dose correctly and to not lose control. 


I find even cannabis to be more of a head-fuck. 


Ketamine simply doesn't possess the ability to cause paranoia and play with one's mnid. 


It's so easy to remember that you've taken a drug and to just go with the flow. 

Unlike acid, which is another ballgame entirely. 


OP, if you start small (70mgs). Leave things for an hour and just work your way up from there. 

You'll love its antidepressant properties.

After taking ketamine many times i have not had a single bad experience ,apart from feeling anxious when combining it with cannabis and being sick once from having too much while already very drunk and stoned. It makes me feel detached from worries, not in a state where I might end up dwelling on them and has never caused hallucinations or the "thought loops" that can make weed unpleasant for me sometimes. I have also found it easy to dose correctly (assuming its all I'm taking lol). I've never gone into a k-hole though so all i can comment is some people have told me they loved it, others they hated it.

I meant polarizing as in most people have a love/hate relationship with it, not as in it induces bipolar disorder.

I plan on doing K in the near future, how much is too much in a day. What is the ld-50? Would it be safe to go through 250mg in a day, I've heard of it doing weird stuff to your bladder that's why I ask? Sorry for jacking the thread.

Yes, you can even go through more than that if you  want to.

Bladder/kidney problems are only a worry in heavy/long-term abuse, so long as you stay far away from addictsville, and only visit the drug on occasion, there's no worry.

The only problem with K (for me) is that my brain always thinks it'll be awesome to do it when I get drunk. Before I get drunk, I think, "No K tonight, can't handle the hangover," and then I get drunk and inevitably it's, "Hey, taking some K right now would be an ***awesome*** idea!"  Worst hangovers I've ever had have been from combining k and alcohol, even at low doses of each. Dehydration sickness. It's usually a good time for an hour or two, but nothing useful comes of it, and I usually have almost no memory of the experience. 


That's the reason K is best in combo with a serotonergic psychedelic, I can retain the experience much better. One of my most profound and euphoric tripping moments came on a combo of mushrooms and ketamine, while peaking on both, listening to Israel Kamakawiwoʻole's "Somewhere over the Rainbow," and I remember it very much more vividly than anything I've ever done on K alone. It also can lower paranoia while allowing really deep trips because you can take a lower dose of the psychedelic and then "dip" deeper into the rabbit hole with the K, while knowing that if the effects are overwhelming they'll be stabilized within the hour. Really interesting audio distortions from that combination.

I love ketamine. The only issues I have with it so far is the quick tolerance build-up and that slim margin between "recreational party drug" and "not quite k-hole/your hands and arms feel tranquilized/you trance out every 2 seconds"


Accidentally did that at a rave one time. Took a bump, thought I was good to take another one a bit later but it apparently wasn't quite time yet. Spent the next 30 minutes aimlessly wandering the festival grounds while my limbs felt all numb and floaty. It was not at all unpleasant, just not sought after when I had friends I was supposed to be tagging along with. They lost me several times during that half hour lol.

I had a brief fling with K lasting for a few months some years ago.  My first experience with it was in a flat full or strangers after a rave while mashed on loads of E's (I usually did 5 in 5 hours) and speed base.  After a while, some of them started talking about getting some K and as I had never tried it, I handed over some cash to a guy, I'll call Matt then he and most of the people disappeared to score leaving me with the flat owner and a few fairly young people.  Ages went by and I became convinced that they were all sat in some flat doing all my K but when they finally did get back, it turned out that there had been so many people there they didn't even get it out which was a relief.  


Anyway, Matt  racked up some fat lines and it all gets a bit hazy after that.  I think people around me were trying to communicate with me but I'm not sure if they had much luck.  I vaguely remember saying to a woman sat opposite me "Hey you've really got to try this, it's really good" to which she replied "but I'm only 15" which was pretty fucked up as she was only a year older than my "little girl" was at the time though I was barely able to comprehend it.  The same thing happened another couple of times because I kept forgetting it had happened.  I remember I kept looking at the clock at intervals but the time didn't change.  My sense of time was shot away.  After a few hours everyone piled out leaving me with the flat owner and Matt.


While I was sat pinned to the chair, the other two were up and about and pretty active.  At one point I remember staring at Matt's boots and they started to grow bigger while Matt grew smaller till it was just a huge pair of boots with a little man wearing them which looked really funny.  Matt left after a while and I wasn't capable of making it to the front door so I stayed till about nine AM when I got kicked out.  Some more shit happened but I won't bore you with it.  Walking was really difficult as my legs kept giving way but I slowly stumbled home.  Crossing the main road in high season was pretty scary.


TL;DR  


I holed one other time after that though I was mixing it with hash which made me feel pretty ill and didn't enjoy it one bit. I most enjoyed smoking it (I know it's really bad for you're lungs) because it was the only way I could control the dosage well enough as I really didn't enjoy it once I started to lose control and the duration was really short which suited me just fine.  Sprinkling a bit in a spliff with some hash was really nice too.  I tried raving on it once (combined with loads of speed) with small doses wrapped in tissue and bombed at regular intervals and had a brilliant time.  I crashed a small beach gathering on K after bumping into someone with some to sell around that time and made a total arse of myself.  It still makes me cringe thinking about it.  I recently picked up the pin and as K IV should have a similar duration to smoking, combined with my digi scales, it should allow me to enjoy it with complete control so I will probably try it that way one day when the time seems right.

EDIT - One effect of K which I never hear mentioned but would probably of interest to prospective users is how K removes your ability to see in 3D.  Your field of vision becomes a 2D image so everything merges together.  Objects in the foreground merge with things in the background so you can't tell where one object ends and another one starts creating some interesting hallucinations.

Not sure what it's like with MDMA involved; but my favorite drug combination ever was LSD + Ketamine + DMT + nitrous oxide; just ketamine with DMT is nice too.. Not sure what MDMA would add to such an experience as I have no experience with that but DMT does tend to sort of overpower the other drugs (except the nitrous, and ketamine does leave an influence to the DMT trip).


Ketamine is pretty much the drug I did most, naerly daily for the past year and total experience is over three and a half years; I'm kind of addicted (although right now I dó only use in the weekends) to it, even days I'm not on it I nearly constantly think about it... I've had some of the best experiences on it, boosts to creativity, wonderful k-holes, it's so serene.. my only true addiction. I accepted that though; I wouldn't want a life without it, but I have to keep the usage down or it wíll eventually cost me my bladder, not to mention commonly happening k-cramps if I use daily (tolerance goes up a lot faster then it goes down, although it dóes go down).


I'm going to stop posting about ketamine now, it makes me want it too much and it's only whensday ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

It's probably best to wait a few hours after you use ketamine. K and alcohol will potentiate each other and you are liable to get a lot more wasted than you "normally" would with ketamine in your system.


Depending on the dose of K you do and the timing, you may find it best to reduce consumption of alcohol. OTOH, If you wait for ~3 hours after doing K (or ~1 hour for very small doses) most of the effects will have work off and you won't have to worry.

as long as you keep the doses of ketamine low and wait an hour or two after you'll be fine. Drink slowly to make sure you don't get too drunk. Personally I find that having a couple drinks and a tiny bump of ketamine is perfect for a night out. They potentiate eachother quite nicely. But there have definitely been times where I was dumb and did too much of both... theres a very fine line you can cross.

Read the label.


Normally ketamine comes as either 50 or 100mg/ml solutions. The label on the bottle will say how strong it is.

there are rumours of ketamine being cut with ephedrine (see e.g. [this thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/604130-Seperating-Ephedrine-from-Ketamine). is there any sense in them? what makes ephedrine a convenient choice as a cutting agent for ketamine? is it perhaps a byproduct of some synthesis? or maybe for some chemical reasons beyond my understanding ketamine plus ephedrine forms nice crystals...?

Ketamine is my favourite drug without a doubt. I just wish the quality wasn't so up and down these days and it didn't destroy your bladder.

Certain people noticed this when obtaining Ketamine from southern asian regions. It has been going on for years. Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, whatever. It has been cut for years like this.


You will notice it by a slightly different taste, although honestly not too different compared to plain Ketamine. But if you have a tolerance and do a lot of Ketamine you will notice high BP and other effects of stimulant abuse.


At the time I was doing an amazing amount of Ketamine and most of it was this pseudoephedrine cut stuff and after a year or more of that I can tell you I was in rather poor health. Finally somebody got it examined and revealed the truth.


Why? Who the hell knows... maybe it makes it slightly cheaper? Although even if it cost 30-40% more for pure Ketamine I doubt anyone would have questioned the price..


I don't f*ck with illegal drugs anymore, as a side note.

well, increasing the margin range is obviously the main reason to cut drugs, but what makes ephedrine a favourable cutting agent for ketamine? why not use something even more cheap instead, like sugar or table salt?

^ Why aren't all drugs cut with sugar/table salt? 


People use a variety of different cuts for a whole lot of different reasons. Generally I'd expect if it's cut with pseudoephedrine the person cutting it thought that somehow having some stimulant effects might make it more desirable - possibly targeting people who use it in the club/rave scene. Bad idea nonetheless, but in general cutting drugs is a bad idea and as such it doesn't surprise me in the least.

They cut it with epsom salt and glutamate, but those are not bitter.

So the ephedrine cut may be a part of the cut to make it tast a little more like real stuff.

Hey Guys, i finally aquired a wee bit of K. Since i really do love dissociatives, my first one was MXE, i'm totally thrilled to try it out. Thing is, about two weeks ago i sniffed approx. 250mgs without much of an effect, well at least much of an effect like the one i was looking for. I'm doing MXE on an irregular basis, i.e. with pauses from 2-6 (or more) weeks in between but it seems like i've a bit of a tolerance. 


I should add i can still get high with relatively low doses of MXE (10mgs), so my tolerance isn't that high so i'm a bit surprised 250mgs intranasally hadn't done the job.


What about plugging this one? Is this an viable option and what dose is suggested if the above one wasn't sufficient. Tbh i don't wanna sniff more than 250mgs, that was ugly enough.

What's the appearance like? The black market is rife with shit K or tiletamine these days. I don't think the problem was the ROA. Snorting will definitely work if it's proper crystal. A 250mg line with some decent K will definitely make you experience either a near-death experience and/or an out-of-body one. Reality will tear itself in half and you might think the world is coming to an end. I don't know much about mxe-k cross tolerance, but I still think you dosed enough to experience what I described, if it had been legit neigh.

It's totally white, fine powder. As soon as the (reliable) recommendation goes, it should be very nice. Perhaps i've ingested it wrong? I hadn't dosed up, i more or less sniffed all at once, which was not very nice in such a short timespan.

tried this for the first time the other day, during the trip a friend asked what the craziest psychedelic experience i've ever had was, and I responded vaporizing 25i. Shortly after starting to describe to him what it was like, a general feeling of intensity that reminded me of the one that occurs following 25i vaporization crept up through the core of my being and within a minute or two it was like I was tripping balls, with OEV's wayy different than anything i've gotten from dissociatives before. They still weren't like 25i visuals but they shared similar qualities. It freaked me out a little but not enough to make the experience bad. twas a really fun night overall ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Btw, a few days ago i tested the K again, this time via plugged ROA, and it was extremely potent this time. Seems like intranasal ROA just isn't my thing and at least for me, not very effective. 250mgs via plugged administration send me directly into a hole-like state, totally disconnected from the real world.

Nice side-by-side comparison of the two isomers from reddit:

> An S isomer trip is sedated and dreamy. Lounging around on the couch listening to Ravi Shankar with eyes closed is just perfect. CEVs are pronounced, seemingly taking me on a journey through an inner universe. A feeling of being in and at one with my body is pronounced. Higher dosing brings everything together so that I can't tell where I end and other things begin. It's meditative, comforting, and peaceful. It's also the psychic/mind reading isomer.Thoughts, words, sounds and lights combine to form a new language that is understood. OEVs can be outstanding. A living room can become the deck of a ship out at sea, or a stage with actors on it. It still maintains its overall form as a room though. Connections to external things are few. The world exists inside of me and I inside of it. Nothing to worry about. A pleasant come down ensues.

I'm outside the normal flow of time and space now. My body is an object to be guided by my mind, which seems to reside elsewhere, at high doses everywhere.There is a great machine at work. I am both moving it as it moves me. It is external, yet I can feel it inside of me. Then I go for a ride. I'm in a series of passages, moving rapidly horizontally, then vertically. I'm communicating with the others that are there. I'm moving through the machine. The me I usually know is just one aspect of a transdimensional being. I can see the higher dimensional me at the controls, each frame of time flipping by. These are physical spaces. Extreme disorientation, complete depersonalization and derealization are pretty standard. Sometimes the great loopback happens. Everything is predetermined and has played out to this point. A life or death decision must be made. Was it the right choice? Coming back from a trip like that is always tough.

ColtDan, Do you still take Valium with your dissociatives? I tried 10 mg diazepam with a threshold dose of MXE last weekend and the peaceful, contented feeling seemed to be noticeably magnified.

I'm pretty annoyed that the scum got hold of ketamine... by that I mean the coke/phet dealers who think its OK to give someone something they did not ask for mixed in with their drugs, its simply immoral and unprofessional. 


Adulterating things like K just doesn't make sense when you consider the market, K heads are really one of the better groups of people to be supplying, they dont tend to be violent or nasty (such as stim heads), it just seems like it would make the dealer more money in the long run to just keep supplying high quality product rather than crushing up whatever they have laying around into it, I kind of think of it as stealing someones experience as if 100mg is not actually K it takes away a potential K hole! 

nasty nasty shit this drugs market eh! 


The thing thats substituted for adulterating round here is selling 0.7-8g as a full one, I prefer it to be honest because then you know whats going into your snout!


Peace

thought i'd throw this here as I wrote it, and it seems like the place to put it 

--


dosed 1 medium-sized bump, estimated around 40mg. 


T+0:15 notice solid body load, heavy front of face, droopy weight under eyes. slow but lucid thought-flow. 


T+0:35 dosed a small line, estimated around 60mg. 


T+0:50 feel similar effects (about as high on ketamine as i've felt) as when i did about twice as much of other k as i have now (this is new k to me, and i suspect it is much better than what I've done before). heavy body, very swimmy floaty thoughts. friendly and warm feeling. heavy body, lightness of thought.


T+1:25 dosed another small line, estimated 50-60mg. comes up fast, and the cumulative strength on top of what i've already dosed is apparent. closed eye visuals are present now, taking form primarily around retinal after images, but then revealing more detailed synaesthetic forms, all vibrating and pulsing. if i stay present with them these visuals become relatively immersive; i can see a light fluid orange web floating in black space, then morphing into soft undulating blue/green 3d-grid-work, the shapes and movement changing as i move my head in relation to light sources. some slight open eye distortions are present, shape in general is very imposing.


T+1:40 on the verge of drippy-body 4-meo-pcp territory; the edges of my body feel like soft energy that might be able to dissolve into whatever they press against. Music and sound are very immersive, i feel like i'm floating inside of the sounds which completely envelope me from all sides. this is a synaesthetically almost physical sensation of cradling.


T+2:30 very close to baseline. effects dissipated quietly and softly, no harsh drop of energy. very smooth transition. i'm sure i could sleep but it's not required, i'm cruising nicely into sobriety.


hugs to all

Does anyone have any advice in regards to being unable to recall k-hole experiences? My first couple trips to the hole (all IM'd) were simply magical, but now all I do is pass out and wake up with my mind completely blank. I know ketamine tolerance builds quickly, but I've only used it ~20 times (with a week minimum between trips and without significantly increasing the dosage). It's really disappointing, I love the afterglow it gives me for the days afterward but I don't feel like continuing to use k for that reason alone. People have suggested using stimulants but I tried adderall a couple times and that just gave me insomnia.


I've read that there have been studies where people with poor dream recall simply do not remember anything about a high dose ketamine experience, I don't remember a lot of my dreams with could explain why this happens.


thanks for any help :D

**ketamine is addictive**


I started off with intranasal ketamine, prescribed. I wanted to try ketamine for severe, recurrent depression. I quickly graduated to multiple IM daily doses. It accelerated over the course of two months. I only went through about 4 grams but I exercised very poor judgement in regards to poly drug abuse  i took two lunestas, 6 beers, 80 mg IM, and a bowl of kief. I blacked out, threw up, and tried to get into my hot tub. Bad idea I couldn't. I was too uncoordinated. I really fear what would have happened if I had gotten in. Ketamine is a strange drug but it really is compelling.

Agreed, I first came in to contact with Ketamine around 1992 but it was relatively rare on the party scene and didn't really get at all popular.


It wasn't until the later 90's that a wave of the stuff swept across the UK rave scene, it wasn't long before people were calling it techno smack, it was obvious people were using it as they were all laying on the floor holed on the stuff, that brought people looking to rob those incapable of knowing what was happening and in my view spelt the end for that era of youth culture.


The general view was that it was fairly benign and 'safe' but people soon started to run into problems with using lots of it all the time, aside from the consequences to someone's life using a drug like that day in day out, people started to suffer cramps and bladder issues.


It seems that the drip from snorting the stuff can damage you bladder badly in some cases requiring surgery.


In small and occasional use it seems a relatively 'safe' substance but habitual use and physical damage seem to be relatively common place IME.


That said I enjoy it once in a while in the safety of my home and it may have benefits for helping depression .

Ketamine can be very addictive.

I've had my worst addictions to ketamine

This year alone I went through at least two ounces of the shit up my nose, that number might even be higher

Not a bad definition of it lol.


I used to be addicted to opiates/benzos but quit over a year ago and kind of started to use dissociatives instead as I thought it would be alot easier to handle without the physical addiction part. Well, it worked for a month or two untill I started using every week for a couple of more months and then every other day. After that I started noticing I was feeling kind of "off" mentally so I now I have a break. It seems like addiction can creep up on you just as easily without the need for horrible withdrawals.

I know of many people that got into daily use at increasing amounts, IME it has no place in the party / rave scene but I do enjoy the odd excursion at home.


It's an odd one in that where I was people had no expectations of addiction issues and the bladder issues had never been seen as the stuff is normally used IM.


I don't find it that compelling at all one or 2 small doses and I'm done but for some it seems very compelling and damaging although it seems to have lost some populairy now, many prefer MXE.

I had periods of Ketamine use where I used more than I was comfortable with. It was a very convenient drug to use, only lasting about an hour, so I would use it to occupy boredom. Watching individuals around me who were falling deeper into compulsive use and suffering K-Pains made me rethink my own use and ultimately I decided against having a supply of it in my possession. The availability of the drug at the time made it even more enticing, but ultimately a large bust in Canada occurred causing the price to skyrocket, which further deterred my use.

I will still use it a couple times a year, or every other year, when I desire that warm place inside of the outer reaches of my mind. I always use it on my own, in darkness, with some psychedelic trance such as Shpongle playing in order to achieve complete dissociation. It's definitely a valuable compound and should be treated with great respect. Being zonked all day on the stuff did not suit me as it did others, as it seems some people are capable of being slightly productive while on it, I assume due to massive tolerance.

well my first experience with this quirky chem was back in 01-02, this first time i had only tried a point 0.1/g split into 2 lines one for each nostril, the effects to follow were very interesting and i quite liked how it throw my perception of the world around me completely off(as in looking st8 ahead on level ground looked as if i was going down a mountain) this was all fun and good...

since that time i have only had the stuff 2-3times ..the last being from a friend who owed me some cash threw me a gram of this and a 1/2g of meth...this time around tho i have uped my game from sniffer to injector,,,i proceed to inject the k..now at this point only a week prior my scale broke..so i was left to eye ball...

im guessing it had to be 100mg or so..and i IV this dose pull out my rig and with it still in hand i am transported into the hole, into darkness...

Well i had a hell of a trip i guess u would say..now during this entire 1/2hour i was unable to see i remember all black..but i was talking to my friend who ws with me(And who by this time was completely freaking as he had never witnessed anyone on k let allone in the hole) but i remebr asking him if he could see the pink zebras too..now this i kinda a hazy blury memory..but for what i gather i was unble to see the entier time yet my subconscious was seeing alot of things? as matt told me afterwords that i was describing all kinds of weird things..


I will deff run sum more experiments in the future..when i have a working scale and such..defiantly will lower the dose next time tho lol

I had the most blissful ketamine experience today, I had gotten off from working the night shift and wanted to take a psychedelic but didn't really have the energy...I decided instead, to research a sample of some mt-45, a novel opioid/piperazine kind of research chemical. I weighed 45mg of mt45, capped it and swallowed on empty stomach and normal habitual cannabis consumption. I am completely naive of opioid tolerance.


T:0030 I notice myself scratching my head and realize I am comfortable in my fav leather chair.

T:0130 seems equivalent to taking 10mg hydrocodone, with maybe some tramadol like agonist/antagonist feelings

T:0200 I get bored with the opiate lazies and realize I'm tired from working the night shift, but not really sleepy...I remember I have some racemic ketamine hcl and I shovel myself up 75mg for an IM injection...lower than my normal khole dose because I am alone, and I expect it to be potentiated by the mt 45.

T:0230 I clean my house and light candles before I administer ketamine. I pull up the "what music would you all recommend for different PDs" thread and sync up the bluetooth headphones.

T:0245 Bliss. Hues of pink and orange. **This minimalist music has a way of easing the ketamine experience, taking away any kind of anxiety or fear. My mind is completely free to wander. I feel like I am floating in the clouds.** I think I may have found my sweet spot for dosage. Right on the edge of a K-Hole. I can close my eyes and be traveling at the speed of light, have an idea, and then open my eyes back up to scribble down notes. I see the Law of Karma as it plays out at the moment of death, how a lifetime of Karma will flash before your eyes at the moment of death, determining your fate of reincarnation. **I am the sleek blue paint on a supersonic fighterjet** (subconscious imagery from playing Battlefield 4 that day Im sure). Most of all I am comfortable. Nausea comes as usual if I move around too much on ketamine.

T:0330 I seamlessly doze off to sleep, and have the most blissful dreams although I don't remember them.


Remarks: +++ I nailed the dosages for both compounds. I was too tired for a proper psychedelic, so I chose a lazy psychedelic instead and it was perfect. Don't think im gonna be repeating this frequently because of past problems with opiate habituation, but I must say this was one of the best experiences ive had. Unique...comfortable after a long night of work. IM is really the only way to go for ketamine, I will try to find this range, right before the K-Hoe again where I can be lucid and transcendental in the same sitting. Amazing

Ketamine is one strange drug. Yesterday I felt nauseous and dysphoric on it. I felt anesthetized and could barely function. My thoughts were circling around all the negative things in my life. 


Today I've snorted a few 30-40 mg lines and I've taken ~300 mg Lyrica and it's just beautiful. Full of energy, happy, uplifting, euphoric. Life feels absolutely wonderful.


While benzos seem to diminish the K experience, pregabalin does not. It almost gives the experience a boost. WOW!

What are the main differences between ketamine and mxe and K-hole and M-hole?


btw ketamine is possibly going to get approved as antidepressant (esketamine)

I find ketamine to be much more "cold" and anesthesiologic than MXE, which seems much more recreational and "psychedelic" for myself. MXE tends to be more visual and intimate while ketamine REALLY distorts perceptions and takes you away from yourself.

Ketamine i feel is one of those drugs that gets better with addiction. Like alcohol or marijuana. No offence to anyone out here, who loves the stuff. But as a person who spends the better part of his life mostly sober, except for mad tokes of cbd wax for pain after a car accident. I just cannot find the joy or the mystery that so many have found within the realm of ketamine. I think it's because i have listened to the machine elves a bit too much about it being a piece of zombie material which truthfully and honestly it is. 

It is by far one of the most amnesiac-tic derpy, psychosis mimicking fanciful flights of  weirdness i've ever experienced and i'll never touch it again. I know people who swear by the stuff. But its definitely not for me, there is something that seems, fake about it.


I have had a couple awesome experiences, where one i was lying in a translucent omni effervescent field. I was actually lying in a field at that time. All eyes closed. 

On 120mg of mdma, and about 155 mg of ketamine, an assured hole for a person who rarely uses it. 

Under a tree, The tree i believe decided to share something with me, as i watched the entire life span of that tree grow up until it was the size that it was today.

But then the tree showed me how it's branches were an extended outcropping of a series of neurons which was in relation to my synaptic path ways. 

The tree and i shared all of our emotions that day. It was a fine day. 


I also woke up with my bicycle having been stolen. Which was a righteous crime. But whatever. Ketamine is not my bowl of clam chowder.

I find Ketamine to be more soft, gentle and warm but also more anaesthetizing. MXE is more speedy and stimulating, especially in high doses. Ketamine is very sedating in high doses, and does impare my motoric skills quite a bit. I really don't feel like moving around much on K.


K also has a rapit onset (I snort it), just a few minutes, while MXE takes 30-45 insufflated. Also K has a much shorter duration, I'm back to baseline a few hours after the last dose. MXE keeps me awake for many many hours. Sleep is impossible for a quite long period after taking MXE. I also got issues with my blood pressure when I used a lot of MXE. The difference isn't huge but I still prefer K nowadays.

Interesting, I find MXE to be more cold, but then again dissociatives effect us all differently (probably more so than many other drugs). The thing I do like more about MXE is that music sounds awesome on it, while on K music sometimes becomes s-l-o-o-w and sounds plain retarded and warped. I don't really mind the anaesthesia on K, as I don't like moving around on either of them. At least not out of my flat.


Strangely I don't find either of them to be visual almost at all, not before entering the M/K-hole, which can be visual, but nowhere near as visual as "classical" (5-HT2A) psychedelics.

Me too.  I prefer Ket anyday.  Especially if it's the S-Isomer type and not the Indian racemic type.

Ketamine can be very visual when you do it on combo with MDMA... such a blissful combo.  MXE + MDMA made me feel like my heart was gonna explode.

I haven't properly holed since like 6 months ago, but my tolerance seems to have gone up. 60mg in my nostril really doesnt do what it used to. Is this because its the indian racemic type? My first and craziest hole was on 250mg in my nose, and idk if i'll ever have nearly as crazy or awesome of an experience on this stuff no matter what the dosage.

I have the Indian racemic too and it doesn't get me to the same place as the S-isomer I had back in summer. I do get a decent buzz from it but definitely no K-holing. A dose that should be enough for K-Holing only gets me extremely sedated and anaesthetized, completely unable to move or talk, but still no K-Hole...


I don't know why but the S-isomer wasn't as sedating, it didn't impair my motor skills as much and definitely didn't make my speech as extremely slurry as the batch I have now.

I might get my hands on some K soon. It`s not a very common drug around here, so it would be my first time (i think).

 I say "i think" because once I snorted some white stuff in a festival (Universo Paralello 2006), and it basically made me not able to understand what was going on around me. The motions of the outer world were so weird! Like the frame rate was a bit slower in a way I couldn`t really figure what was going on around me. I only got fast flashes of reality, so it was hard to see the whole picture: reality as something continuous and meaningful as such. Really hard to describe, specially 8 years after. Walking and dancing was funny too, like I couldn't really fell my weight, which made me uncoordinated.


Back to the subject... So now I may have some K soon, and this time I will know what it is for sure. IF it comes to me, it will probably come in vials (vet store).

I normally read the whole thread when I am about to try something, but now I might not have too much time, so could someone give me some basics on it?

- ROA: between oral or insufflation. Which one would be the best for a first try? Maybe combine both? 

- Dosage

- Would it be fun to use in small groups (6/7 people)? I mean, would we be able to communicate?

- Are there any very important warnings about this one? do not mix with alcohol? with SSRIs?

- To aim for a hole in the first time is aiming too high?


Appreciate it!

^ That is A FUCKING LOT. I wasn't even getting around that level in a single line when I had quite the tolerance, if you need that much you've either been doing ketamine for years and developed a massive tolerance or are getting "ketamine" that is of absolutely shit quality.


A single 30mg bump should have you very high the first time, although it only last a short time so you'll probably end up doing more than one. One 100mg line would have you WRECKED, though. I would not attempt to "K hole" until you have some experience. Low dose experiences are very euphoric, pushing the dose will only lead to confusion and lack of coordination. Start small, work your way up.... as with everything.

Used to do MXE once a week, not done ket often. but ive had some "fairly decent stuff" or so ive been told by people into ket and know about it, that have tried the stuff i got, every time i've done it its required between 150-200mg to hole. mild wonks are nice as well


Most of the ket around the UK is shite, apparently. or none existant

and you truly think someone should try to "hole" on their first time? Considering it is pretty much the highest level of intoxication as you can get with a dissociative, I would not recommend it. 


Low doses are extremely fun, especially in the company of others. High does leave you staring at a wall for a hour or two, not exactly the best way of dosing IMO

most people need much more than 100mg even without tolerance to reach a hole, but that still does not mean you should not start low and reaching a hole with staggered dosing is quite possible so one could even start with 10mg and add every 10-20mins an ever so slightly larger dose

Fancy seeing you around these parts Dan! I thought you had been getting the good K lately? You were making me all jealous! Funny though, the UK seemed awash in dirt cheap stellar K a few years ago, now it's gone to crap and the price high! The US isn't like it was ten years ago but supply and quality remain consistent in the right circles.....circles I tend to avoid nowadays however. I used to go on ketacations to Mexico and India for years, but from what I've heard they aren't the OTC meccas they once were.....on to the next third world country for the ketamine krusades!

I'm working down Brighton way for work and was wondering if anyone's had any of the stuff that's going around down there as I've heard it's quite popular? There's a major dryout where I'm from so I'm hoping to find some quite easily as I am hankering haha.

I've never done K, and I'll probably never get the chance but I've always wanted to try it.


I'm just curious whether or not it would be safe to take with Prozac and Klonopin, particularly Prozac, because I keep getting different answers.


I thought I'd heard someone on here say that Ketamine probably wouldn't seriously interact with either, but another poster said while small doses of K might not, that larger ones might cause serotonin syndrome.


Just wondering if it's safe to go back to hoping that someday I can try it, or if I should entirely throw that fantasy out the window.


Thanks

I believe the prozac and ketamine combination is a safe one. The two act on different receptors in the brain mostly, and don't seem to result in adverse effects. I say mostly because ketamine does have documented serotonergic effects which may contribute to its anti-depressant effects, but still appears safe to use with prozac according to several accounts. Here are some threads you can look at:

^^^^^


Thanks,


Looks like most people think that Ketamine doesn't interact badly with SSRIs unless it's perhaps used in very large doses repeatedly.


Good to know.


So I'm assuming that it doesn't interact badly with Klonopin or benzos?


Afterall, it's not a CNS depressant right?

Benzos will have a dulling effect on the ketamine experience, and I would suggest avoiding them if you're aiming for an immersive experience. They're mixed together in medicine to prevent the dissociative effects and to increase sedation in patients, so you'll get pretty mangled I'd imagine. 

Here's the subthread for that combination: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/430683-Combo-Subthread-Ketamine-amp-Benzodiazepines](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/430683-Combo-Subthread-Ketamine-amp-Benzodiazepines)

It's common clinical practice to combine ketamine with a benzo to diminish the "emergence symptoms", so it's definitely not dangerous.

However, in one of those threads that the poster above you linked one of the mods or former mods said that when under doctor supervision it's fine but that he knew of someone who died from respiratory depression by combining benzos and ketamine and not knowing what they were doing.


Strange though, because every other poster in those threads seems to agree with you that it's a safe combo and that shouldn't happen.


It's the only occurence of it's kind mentioned in those threads or that I've heard of, so maybe it's a highly unusual reaction but I don't know.


Anything that stimulates breathing would seem like even if it's improperly used it wouldn't cause CNS depression.

Am I the only one finding it difficult to hole on S+? I get high as a kite on this stuff but I'm just...too functional. I've always holed on racemic, but S+ just isn't the same. It's psychedelic (even more so than racemic in some aspects) and beautiful, but the sedating/sluggish and more "messy" aspect of racemic is lacking.


Edit: I did in fact hole on this isomer. But it took many tries....


Edi2: Is there seriously this little talk about ketamine (vs MXE)? This thread is years old...It seems MXE is much more popular?

I hate ketamine. Been in a K-hole twice. One time I puked; the other time I just wanted to die. My head was spinning and I felt so dirty and disoriented.


That said; I do love the 'M-hole'. It's such a warm and comfortable feeling.

To me, MXE is like an improved version of ketamine. Overall I'd say it feels more 'sophisticated'.

It has a warmth about it that K doesn't. It doesn't knock me on my ass like K does. I'd say it's probably even trippier than K.

^^ Were you laying down with your eyes closed?  If you take hole-level doses of dissociatives and try to remain up it's extremely unpleasant.  Totally different with eyes closed laying down.


I also like MXE more than K, for sure.  I agree it's trippier too.  Just a better drug IMO, but everyone's different.  Aspects of MXE remind me strongly of K but it's quite different too.  Much warmer, more mentally active, MUCH more social and euphoric.  Less anesthetic too.

From what ive experienced, S ket is just and warm and friendly as MXE. I love them both. R ket feels cold, not overly keen. plus it lingers. this info may be incorrect, i dunno if its just R or just S or mixed or what but i notice the different between the two

Do people selling K on the black market usually know which isomer it is? I've been wanting to try K for the past few years, and now I might actually know someone in my hometown who could hook me up, but I'd be keen on trying the two different isomers, or a racemic mix, because I love the shit outa MXE and ^ColtDan is expressing the s-isomer is warm and friendly similar to mexxy.

I reckon if it had been discovered decades ago, they'd be using MXE now in clinical settings.

I do find it to be a very powerful anesthetic, which is mostly why I like it so much. It takes care of excruciating pain that even opioids won't touch.

I've been thinking about trying Ketamine for a while as I've done MDMA and a fair few psychedelics, I'm very interested in consciousness and it feels like dissociative can offer a completely different kind of experience which sounds interesting to me.


How good is ketamine for clubbing/concerts, in low doses maybe? I've been wanting something new to do on the occasional night so I don't end up drinking alcohol frequently, and so I'm less tempted to take MDMA (I rarely do it but the temptation is irritating). I'm not really interested in anything harder like coke and psychs make me go too inward, and weed just doesn't agree with me anymore so it seems like the only option left to try.


Also, what's up with the UK drought? My friends are now telling me it's over, but on the darknet there's no UK sellers with any Ketamine, those that used to sell it say they still cannot get it, which leads me to think most of the street sellers must be getting quite bad product, as normally the darknet has like 10x more choice than the street.

I tried this, and thoroughly enjoyed. However, if it were my first 10 times or so to use I don't think I would've been able to handle it. Multiple times I would break a brief amnesia loop and have no fuckin clue where I was for about a minute or so, so having atleast one buddy with you is nice.

Also, avoid the mosh or any congested area. Dissociatives aren't as fun when you're stumbling into someone every breath.

Yes, definitely, it's much harder to have a bad trip on ketamine than on LSD (although some people still seem to have them if you take a look at the erowid "bad trips" ketamine experience vault, but I personally never had one on ketamine or MXE).

more pleasurable is definitely subjective. I think of ketamine as euphoric but nowhere near as euphoric as the onset of LSD. I also find ketamine a bit nauseating and have thrown up once or twice because of it, which is not a very pleasurable experience.


s-ketamine is pretty righteous though lol

Be aware that the effects of k are highly dose dependent. From feeling kinda drunk and not at all psychedelic to being in a place where reality, time, your identity breaks down completely.


You may want to build to the weird and wonky effects by doing smaller lines repeatedly, say every 20 minutes, though it's fairly common to lose your sense of time and of how much you've done, so maybe rack them out first and have a clock or something.


I don't find K that visual in a patterns and colours way, K is more cognitive, but visuals on a screen can be good. The weird animated, reality bending type is fun. The videos to Slot Hum or ElkCloner by the band Sculpture had me thinking they must have been made on K. If you watch a movie you get get total immersion.


If you keep doing lines enough to hole you won't care where you are or what music is around or know whether your eyes are open or shut, as you'll be shut down to the outside world. Just make sure you are safe (no candles, cigarettes, any other danger you won't be able to deal with or even aware of)

How long before tolerance goes down? I did like 250 mg ketamine and only got sedated you know a little high. Then i did 100 mg of mxe and it just made me stimulated like hell. I dont know why the tolerance got so high can somebody help me out here?


It was like months since i got any psychadelic effect out of dissocitives. I dont use it on a regular basis.

Dissociative tolerance is notorious for taking long periods of time to decrease. I've read that for some even an entire year isn't enough for tolerance to reduce completely.

Thanks for the advice, I'm thinking first time I'll keep it relatively sane, then dive in properly once I have a bit of a feel for things. There's no real risks to having three nights of K use in a row right? Not as a frequent thing of course, but just this time.

Hmmm, this is actually the kind of thinking that got me properly addicted to dissos for a few solid years. Hope you won't discover how fast 3 nights become 3 weeks become 3 years... 


K is notoriously addictive, i thought i was pretty damn good at resisting temptations before i met this beast. Monitoring your use on a calendar for example might help in keeping it an occasional treat, rather than have it become a daily burden.

All my K experiences as of late tend to result in a state of panic and confusion / thoughts the world has ended / no epic OBE flying through dimensions, just interesting body sensations coupled with complete detachment from reality - but still relatively conscious enough for it to be a frantic, desperate experience.


Wonder why...to be fair, I can't say I've had any beautiful experiences from K, although Methoxetamine did get me there.


What am i doing wrong....

Thanks for the warning, I'll try and keep it under control. In theory after this week I'll only be dropping K for clubbing, which should naturally keep it limited. It's worked for stims so far, but obviously I can't judge whether I'll hold up with dissos too until I try.

Wow! Thanks for turning me on to this. The idea of Ket exposing the "machine code" of the mind, and how your brain processes sensory input seems to be alluded to in this multimedia art. Is this the future of music?

And again, I wasn't asking for specifics, merely broad generalizations, suggestions where the information I'm after might be found. And no, Google is not your friend when searching for this particular datum. It's easy to find from two, three, ten years ago, but not within the last year or so. If it were simple to find I wouldn't have come here to ask the question.

I get that, it's just policy we don't talk about prices here, either ranges or specifics.  I mean in any case it's going to be a range, you can find different prices in different areas and so forth.

Those animations (and the music) are so ketty. Well I first saw them on K, and I think K can infect art watched/listened while on it and impart a ketamine quality to it even when later watched/heard while straight.

K is so moorish that you can get through all you have without serious self control, particularly as you are high from it so you're not really caring about being sensible.


If you have enough to hole with, take precautions as if you will, even if you don't plan to. K is very safe, but almost all harm comes through accidents while incapable.

Went with 150 mg of K last night, I don't seem to have too many problems with redosing, mainly because K leaves me far too dizzy to actually make it to my stash and have more. My memories of the actual trip are pretty fuzzy, but it's left me feeling remarkably non-depressed today, which is nice. Will be interesting to actually make it out clubbing on a low dose next weekend, together with some speed.

Last night and tonight I've had small amounts of K with 3-FPM for partying/clubbing, seems to be a pretty solid combo for energy, a bit of blurring the edges and feeling straight-up amazing. Good combo IMO.


How big are the risks of bladder damage from K really? Is it a "only if you're doing it every day" type thing or would 1-2 days of use each weekend (a few hours each day, not all day long) be enough for appreciable risk?

The likelyhood of K-bladder (ulcerative cystitis) seems to vary a lot from person to person. Some people are much more susceptible. So I know friends who have done it nearly every day for long periods and been fine, but then there a reports of only at weekend users getting symptoms. Obviously not just frequency of use but also amount used matter. Other factors are thought to come into play too, such as combining with other drugs and alcohol.


Tolerance will be a thing that occurs before bladder issues, so amount used is going to go up and up for the same effects, so your bladder will take more of a beating. My guideline (mostly stuck to) with all drugs is significant tolerance is the sign to take a break.

Noted, I'll make sure to take enough of a break when I start feeling the effects of tolerance and knock any potential issues on the head. Stims definitely seem to be interacting with the K and making me piss more, but touch wood that won't matter all that much long-term. I'll make sure to keep the booze-partying and K-partying separate though.

So here's a weird thing I have encountered. I am CTing from fluoxetine at the moment, haven't had anything from it except occasional headaches and a bit of nausea. However, during this period, I have noticed K is hitting me far harder than it was when I was on a stable dose of fluox. As an example, I just (2 hours ago) had 35-40 mg of ketamine (I wasn't being super careful to get the dose mg accurate) with about 70 mg of 3-FPM, I have done this combo a few times before and IME the 3-FPM does not significantly increase the effects of K. The K completely wrecked me, to the point where I could barely make out my screen. It felt like what 60 mg of K would do to me when I was on a stable fluox dose, if not closer to 100 mg. The last two times I also got some fairly noticable nausea from the combo of stims and K, and it was strongly associated with the time I dosed the K.


Has anyone else found that quitting SSRIs causes "negative" tolerance to ketamine, and does it stay like that afterwards or is it just while the meds are leaving your body? I feel like this is potentially similar to how you are more sensitive to alcohol when going on to SSRIs, but that's just speculation.

Had my first K-hole today - greatest hour of my life. Serious. 


Going into it was heaven, it was so layered. Then the bulk of it, I was dissociated buzzing listening to Lana del Rey (the K kiss of music) moving the atoms of the world and rolling my consciousness into space. Then I did it, I managed to pull it down, I peeled the curtain of reality from its corners and heaved myself over it at a diagonal, my mind slid out the top of body and I lifted it over the threshold, it was so crisp, fresh, cool to the skin and it was darker than the darkest black, beyond black. I held myself there and reached about 3/4 completely out of my body and then slumped back into it. I know what the afterlife feels like now. I cannot wait to get back to the innerverse. I can see myself running with K for a while.......

I did a gram of ketamine over a three day span and I have a question...or two for those in the know.

I use kratom every day instead of opioids and noticed that I had some mild WD symptoms upon coming down from the ketamine...same effects as if I didn't dose my kratom soon enough, runny nose and eyes, yawns and mild RLS.

My question is this: Could /does ketamine/MXE have ANY effect on opioid receptors in any way so as to give me RLS or any other mild WD symptoms? I mentioned MXE because it did the same thing to me, but not as much.

Has anyone experienced RLS on the comedown from ket that they believed that the K was the culprit?

Ketamine no as far as I know. You could check out norketamines Ki's at mu receptors but I'm fairly positive the actual effects of it are negligible though. I'm sure it's the same with MXE metabolites otherwise it would cause opiate WD and many people myself included binged for weeks at a time on it. I doubt it has any antagonist effects either(that's what would cause actual WD symptoms as agonist simply add to the effect...), and I've done a lot of opioids IM with MXE. I wasn't addicted at all though but still if MXE competed or canceled the effects it would've been noticeable but the only thing I noticed was extreme syngerism and nodding hard as fuck...

OK, thanks. It was the RLS that was most noticeable and I was hoping there was an explanation besides no explanation. 

The jumpy legs would have to be far worse to keep me from doing Ket though.

It might be, now that I think about it, that I just neglected my dose of kratom to the point of RLS...yes, Kratom. I have had lsd do it for that very reason, I get caught up in the trip and don't notice until my nose is running and I'm yawning almost as much as I do coming up on shrooms...I rarely eat them anymore because of what I call "lethargis profundus"...excuse me, I digress.

Thanks for the info though Help?!?!.

Yeah defintely makes sense. It's certainly happened to me with other drugs that I mean to do while dissociated or tripping. I'll forget all about them until way later than I meant too... Kratom also is way less linear than other opiates or opioids. Given the variations of alkaloids and such, I imagine it's harder than say having Oxy and being able to say, "Okay I dosed 100mgs 9 hours ago, I've got maybe another 12ish hours before a decent amounts out of my system and WDs will begin to manifest soon after...".

I have just recently started "getting into" Ketamine and have found it  to be much more "user friendly" than , say, DMT, but much of the space  seems similar as does the...message? 

Anyway, I started reading about  K/weed combos and discovered that weed greatly enhances the K and since  I take edible cannabis on a daily basis I haven't experienced K w/out  it. So, am I missing something by using the weed, or will the trip be  the same, but with less color.

I tend to stay under for 2+ hours on a  200mg IM dose of K an hour or two after eating a gram of decarbed  trim...heavy on the kief.

During  my stay I am able to go pretty much where I want and am generally free  to navigate on my own...I am allowed to roam.... I am actually seeing  similar/same things on the journeys, like landmarks...they were there  before me and they'll be there when I come back...like going through a  huge house with millions of doors and having a key to most of them.

This  is, for me, very new and interesting. Even high dose IM'd DMT is no  more profound and not nearly so user friendly as K, IMO/E.

I know, I am rambling...just on the first couple of hours of after-effects ATM.

I  guess what I want to know is: is it the weed that is making the K this  good? Or is this pretty much standard K territory?  And, if the weed is a  catalyst, would there be any reason to try the Ketamine w/out the weed?

Opinions?

 for me, dissos without weed lacks something. I can't hole without adding weed to the dissos. I supose if you IM your ket in high doses, ketamine itself will bring you to the hole, but snorting low-medium doses feels like I need to add some beers and weed

I love ketamine, but purely as a recreational drug. It's psychedelic cocaine/alcohol - don't take any messages from it too seriously. Psychedelics teach or help you realize a lot more.

Oh yeah...heroin didn't cause me any trouble. Not even fentanyl did. But ketamine is a whole different game. Then again I've always hated alcohol/cocaine and loved psys

I did some ketamine last night.. my friend got it.. he showed me it and I exclaimed WTF IS THAT??!.. It was BROWN!!! Light brown pebbles. Never seen anything like it before. I  looked into it and apparently when it's brown that means it's "overcooked".. is this a thing? The effects were ketamine for sure..

Expectedly a waste, as ketamine isn't absorbed very well through gastrointestinal membranes.

There has to be a reason WHY Ketamine's rectal dose is so high. I really fear introducing needles into my life, but insulfating ketmaine is getting old.


Taken from this thread


[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/368797-Why-does-Ketamine-not-work-well-rectally?](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/368797-Why-does-Ketamine-not-work-well-rectally?)


one poster posted this


"If I remember right pH has an impact on rectal absorption, and ketamine is pretty strongly acidic, but I am not sure if that has much of a bearing on anything."


another posted this


"Assuming for now that lipid solubility is not an issue... would dissolving ketamine in a basic soln. (say, water + baking soda) increase its absorption rate? Or does that not matter, since the ketamine itself remains acidic, and is left behind while the water is absorbed"


any thoughts?

Be careful though, don't actually freebase the K, so no more base than was mentioned. Also not sure if principally bicarb is the way to go as choice for a base. Probably not too big quantities of carbon dioxide gas are liberated and you can wait it out, so maybe don't hurry the method if you don't want to burp out of your ass. On the other hand, bicarb is good as it buffers.

Thanks much. I knew I remembered reading that somewhere on this site!


When nuke says "mass equivalant of sodium bicarb" that just means an amount that appears to be the same as the K I am mixing with, not neccesarily weight, correct? So basically weigh K dose, add same visual amount of bicarb, dissolve in water, plug? 


What would you suggest using if not sodium bicarbonate?


I will be giving this a shot next time I have some K, something like 3 grams have up and dissappeared these past few weeks ;-(

"Mass is determined only by the amount of matter contained in an object. Any two masses exert a mutual attractive force on each other. The amount of that force is weight. "

Okay so i put 175mg ket and 150mg baking soda (sodium bicarb) in a 5ml glass vial. Added 2ml water. Shook vigoursly to bo avail. Touched tgd vial with a butane torch for a few seconds, kinda looked like sodium bubbled. This may have been a fuckup.


Added 2ml more water and shook forever. Still magor seperation and when I try and draw in a syring much is left in vial.


Any advice?


Seems bicarb is not soluble in acetone much. I may evaporate water and wash remainder with acetone. Can anyone tell me what I did wrong?

I'm getting a gram of K tomorrow night. This is the one drug I've been searching years for. I definitely want to experience the hole but I don't want to overwhelm myself. Im experienced enough with psychedelics. I've done shrooms a handful of times and acid maybe 20 times. Broken through on DMT several times, once while on acid. 2C-I a dozen times... Also done mid-dose DXM a couple times and nitrous a hundred times. Anyway would you guys recommend a first timer to test the water first or just jump in with 150mg or so? I've got 300mg of some beautiful clean sass that I'm saving for a candy flip. Anyone have any experience mixing LSD+MDA+K or just MDA+K? I'm super excited to try this one. I have a trippy drippy Bassnectar playlist ready to go. Peace. %)

Ive done K and both of those.


Do you have a disso tokerance? Is your K heavy cut? If no to both, 150mg shoukd have you hoked by itself. 


I think less would hoke, especialky with MDA'S sometimes speedy, mongy, wtf is goin on aspect. Id take a few 20mg bumps during the comeup to get a feel for it, and have two 100mg lines out for when you want to hole. Do 50mg at a time every 5-10minutes. Be careful on getting distracted, then sometimes no matter how much you do thd hole is gone and you just get dissoed the fuck out and start losing memory.


Also, are you looking on a one off, are are you trying to use most of the g? Hole dose of K on comeup or LSD or MDA (depends on ROA. anything but oral will be quicker) could leave you out of the holr (still a good bit of wobble time remaing). You will most likely want to keep repeating the K experience in some fashion for the duration of your trip. (Especially of alone, I am hopeing you dont wanna combo this at a party).


If you just want one K hole save it for when the psychedelics main effects have worn off. It will bring them back, you will surf the universe, come down. Do fuck all until you can figure out how to find your weed or beer, have one, pass out.


I reccomend doing all the K if you can get more, if not 500mg, few bumps, two holes. Fuck yeah.

I must have been K'ed out because sodium bicarb being insoluble in acetone doesnt help since K is insoluble as well.


I have evaporated the water off, and confirmed for myself bicarb is soluble in proplene glycol. Hopefully K is as well. Will be adding 2mg or so PG to my K/bicarb mixture and try plugging with some MET probably tonight.


I think I will be iming my next batch. I holed off my first 175mg line, but the next day I did like 500mg and was just fucked up. I was also listening to some fast punk rock/hardcore that had me room moshing and reliving times I saw the band live. Might have beeb my fuck up. Haha

Very successful first experiences with this drug. That gram certainly didn't last very long but I got what I wanted out of it lol. How is it not common knowledge that this is the best drug ever? I mean there wasn't one thing I felt was lacking from K. Super trippy, euphoric, a new experience. I managed to successfully hole a couple times and wow. Such a comforting, beautiful space of prisms and color. I will hopefully be getting more this weekend. If so, I still have the acid and MDA to combine it with. The sass is unbelievably clean & pure. The L I have not tried yet, but my source said it's some of the best he's ever had. I want to combine all three hopefully. Fucking love Ketamine. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Hey does anyone know of any interactions between ketamine and harmaline? Would've preferred to add 3-MeO-PCE to my rc-huasca in the woods but that's a no-go, but then I remembered that ketamine is really really good and never heard of any SSRI action. Wouldn't be going for a hole but ketamine feels really divine so it fits in.

I was wondering if something I recently received had any recreational potential or potential as an adjunct painkiller  (never tried K so I hope so). It's a compound made from ketamine and gel, no lidocaine or any of the other usual ingredients you'd find in a compound like this. It's a 250gram tube of gel that's 10% ketamine (so 25grams of ketamine hcl!!!!) It's still in Rx paper form right now because I'm looking for a pharmacy that can prepare it for me + I don't want to spend the money before I know it's worth a shit. To be honest I'm also skeptical of its analgesic properties (what it was prescribed for) when used topically I don't think it has the stuff in the gel that makes transdermal absorption possible, so I don't understand how it'd work. But for a doc to prescribe a large amount of a schedule III drug they must have a good reason.


Before I start trying to do the math necessary to calculate a dose, I wanted to see if it was even possible to use. So is it (it's just inactive gel nothing else)? If the gel's a problem can I possibly do an extraction? Is the gel safe to consume (more specifically orally or sublingually)? I definitely want to use it for recreational porpuses a few times because I've never tried it and love hallucinogens, but I truly am in horrible pain that my pain medicine (Subutex, the only pain med my dr isn't too afraid to give for chronic pain) is no longer able to control at times. So since I can't take a different opioid (how lucky for me ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)) when the pain gets unbearable, I thought using a sub/disassociative dose of oral ketamine adjunct to the buprenorphine might boost the effects enough to provide sufficient analgesia. I know that in most cases when ketamine is used along with opioids; they use short acting opioids but there are exceptions. I realize that the increased analgesia would likely also mean increased respiratory depression, but considering I take such a low dose (a maximum of 2mg 3x a day, but usually only take 3.5mg or 4mg)  it was recently increased from 2mg 2x daily to 2mg 3x daily. I should be safe as long as I don't take too much K and skip my benzos and muscle relaxers. If I want to use a large recreational amount I'll try to avoid taking anything for as long as possible which due to my level of pain probably won't be very long but I'll try to wait as long as I can. I've took DXM with everything I'm on several times and was fine.


Oh I almost forgot it's HCL. Idk if that matters at all but I thought I should mention it just in case.


If the gel isn't a problem my plan was to calculate the dosage (for this method probably a similar dose to snorting) and put the gel under my tongue and let the K absorb sublingually. But after reading reports of people trying it (with success most of the time) and then regretting it due to the taste I came up with an alternate plan to take it orally, (this'll also probably be my method for using the adjunct doses for pain) if possible using capsules to hold the gel so I wouldn't taste it. I thought sublingual and oral would be best because I definitely don't want to inject any of the gel into a muscle much less my bloodstream, even if I could get the gel in a dry powdery form that could be snorted I wouldn't won't to try it because I assume the powder would turn into gel again when exposed to moisture and clog my sinuses, and I don't want to use it rectally because it just sounds unpleasant, but if it the absolute last resort I probably would. 


Even though it's probably a pipe dream for me to get to experience the wonders of ketamine (because if the gel isn't usable which it probably isn't I won't have any other sources. Not asking for any just stating a fact) I still want to know what it's like. I know it's a dissociative like DXM (I compare it to DXM rather than the many others because I've done DXM many times and know it) but I heard the highs are different. I'm familiar with ego death which I know K is notorious for causing, it happened to me several times on DXM and once on nothing but strong weed I smoked too much of with no tolerance. I also experienced the DXM equivalent of a K-hole, it's hard to explain, like floating through space and time but it's so much you don't remember it all then you get spit out dazed and confused. So anyway you know I'm sort experienced in these kinda trips not to mention the ones on dph and datura (not fun, but I kept it together fairly well). I love hallucinogens (not datura or dph) they're the most fun imo (opiates are still my DOC) but they also teach you a lot. So my questions about ketamine are...


-Should I start a little low to get used to the drug. Or should I try for the K-hole my first time

-Could it make me become violent, like PCP supposedly does?  

-If I have any when I try it (been out for a week or so ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ) should I smoke weed during the trip to make it stronger like DXM?


Thats pretty much everything I really hope someone can help.

It's a compound made from ketamine and gel, no lidocaine or any of the other usual ingredients you'd find in a compound like this. It's a 250gram tube of gel that's 10% ketamine (so 25grams of ketamine hcl!!!!) It's still in Rx paper form right now because I'm looking for a pharmacy that can prepare it for me + I don't want to spend the money before I know it's worth a shit. To be honest I'm also skeptical of its analgesic properties (what it was prescribed for) when used topically I don't think it has the stuff in the gel that makes transdermal absorption possible, so I don't understand how it'd work. But for a doc to prescribe a large amount of a schedule III drug they must have a good reason.

If You are planning to K hole, I recommend working Your way up to it.


I doubt You will get violent , depending on what kind of person You are.


I dont think You will have enough time to even smoke weed if You do enough.

Alright thanks for the reply. Working my way up probably is a good idea. If the stuff I'm getting is usable I'll have plenty to try before I go for it, try to get used to the feeling without building a tolerance. I'm not a violent person (except when I'm defending myself of people I care about) so I should be fine, just paranoid about anything remotely similar to PCP because the (most likely not even true) horror stories. 


Do you think it'll be usable if it's in gel?

Well, I guess it depends of what the gel is? (what the hell!). If it´s edible, then you have 25gr of edible ket. For someone with no tolerance is a lot of ket. And if the gel is non edible, seems like extracting it could be quite a work, probably impossible.


So is there a way for you to know what are the exact compounds of the gel?

All I know is ketamine hcl is the only active ingredient. I won't know what the base (inactive stuff) is made of. If it turns out it's unsafe to consume i hope its something that can be extracted in some way

If the gel IS edible, then you can use it orally.  Orally, ketamine requires a higher dose, but also lasts longer.  I've heard some say they like the effects better that way, and I've heard some say they like it less.  I've never tried it personally.  Either way, if it's edible I'd work your way up.  Ketamine and DXM are both dissociatives but they're also quite different.  I find ketamine very serene, and very dissociating.

I was only able to get a sample tube so far. The formula is...


Ketamine hydrochloride USP: 6,900mg 

Pluronic F127 : 60ml 

distilled water: 6ml

lecithin-isopropyl palmitate: 13ml 


Anyone have any idea  if that stuff would be safe orally? Or if not rectally *cringe*? 


UPDATE: I know it's not the most responsible thing to do, considering I haven't finished my research on the unknown chemicals but I can't resist. I'm going to get a pea sized amount and hold it under my tongue being careful to not swallow any saliva. I'll let everyone know if it works or not.


UPDATE 2: After like 10 more seconds of thought I realized how dumb that'd be and decided just to go on a DXM trip instead lol

I didn't post this as an update because my other post had 2 or maybe more + it's a different day hopefully nobody gets pissed


After doing research I found that lecithin is safe to consume but I don't think isopropyl palmitate is. I was afraid that this damn ingredient would ruin it but after some more reading I found out isopropyl palmitate is insoluble in water....but Ketamine (obviously) is! The other ingredient Pluronic F127 is another name for  Poloxamer 407, which is commonly found in mouthwash and toothpaste among other things. I'm going to put 1.5ml of gel in a container add water stir let it sit like 10mins then pour through a coffee filter or something similar. Then hold the ketamine water solution in my mouth and let it absorb sublingually (that should be safe considering the questionable ingredient is used in toothpaste and mouthwash) 


Is their a certain amount of time I should wait to try it since I did DXM last night?

As is Fluoride, Titanium Dioxide, and other incredibly disagreeable substances to human biological systems. Don't believe something is safe just because it's in a consumer product. Most lotions and suncreens have large amount of endocrine system disrupting substances in them, and can in fact cause illness with chronic use.


This is not a statement on the safety of said substance, I've done no research on Poloxamer 407/Pluronic F127.

I actually looked into the P 407 more (after I used it once) and I don't understand the science but it said it was almost completely non soluble in water because of a chain of lipids prevented it. So I've used it several times without any issue after putting in water then filtering. The filter captures a layer of some type of slime.


Absolutely love the ketamine tho. Did a couple high doses didn't quite get to the k hole unfortunately. 


UPDATE: I just thought of another possible way of consuming it and would like to know if any of you think it would work. After being extracted and left in water could I put the water containing it into an empty nose spray container? I ask because using it nasally would save me quite a bit, because using it orally requires so much more than it would nasally. Plus it's be extremely convenient.

after having sampled and/ or daily-habit style abused numerous dissociative drugs, something about ketamine calls upon my soul; been awhile, but i long for my victoria lily to send its fragrant putrid molecules to my olfactory organs once more, signalling the time for a night upon which it encloses its strange and cozy petals around my body. 


anyone else consider the k-hole an ultimate sweet-spot, no matter what other loves come and go?

No action on ket lately or what? I was finally able to procure some high quality racemic K. It’s been so long since I’ve used it and last time it was in liquid form so I would usually resort to IM or IV. I’ve been having a hard time getting to that perfect spot intranasally. I’m not a fan of snorting large amounts of powders but at least it’s pretty smooth. I’m going to try 75mg bumps every 20-30 min and see what happens.


Well last night was a success. I don’t think I holed out or anything but after 200mg or so I attained a pleasant state full of insightful contemplation.

IMO ket is a bit of oldie and surpassed molecule. It´s expensive, super short acting and bladder damaging. You can pretty much get better effects profile in the new coming dissos and get one better taylored to your taste.


It has a notable place in history but it´s logical that is losing popularity respect the new ones

I’m in the US and have been having a hard time finding a solid RC Dissociative source, but I discovered a relatively cheap line on powdered K so thats where I’ve been at these days. I’m super bummed to find out that the bladder damage can be that extensive.


Can ketamine be used to alleviate rebound anxiety induced by benzos or anxiety in general?

They use it in a clinical setting treating various conditions of the mind. So it could Be possible. Doubt it would Be anything K-Hole inducing though.

That was my line of thinking. My gabaergic use has slightly escalated. I’ve been pretty good at keeping my benzo use to once a week or so but I just got some somas and devoured quite a few of them. As of now I’m feeling quite agitated and achy. I’m going to go ahead and try a modest line of ket and see where it goes.


About 120mg in and it definitely helped alleviate the symptoms of rebound anxiety. There’s this sense of peace.


Not a fan of the constant drip. Wish I had ampules to IM.

No way. I've used a lot of RC dissociatives, starting with MXE, and K will never be surpassed so long as it's anti-depressant action is unmatched. Not even MXE had the anti-depressant action of K, for me, despite my overall greater enjoyment of MXE at medium and high doses.

Would there be any negative interactions between soma and ket? I wanna drop some al-lad and throw some ket and soma in post peak.


Also, when would be the best time to ingest ketamine whilst tripping on psychs?  I’m thinking after it starts to taper down.

I usually do the ketamine while peaking. Never on AL-LAD, but ALD-52 and LSD. Same with Somas. No weird interactions, though the Soma dulls the ketamine experience some. If you're going for the hole, I'd wait with the Somas and drop straight after the ket peaks.

It's a truly amazing substance! Very versatile aswell. I think it's equally nice to take a bit less and go to concert for example, or just a party somewhere, as it is to sit drooling in the couch at home in pure ecstasy.

Like peanut butter and jelly. Dissociatives go great with MDMA. Highly recommended!

I notice quite a few vendors now sell ‘party packs’ with ketamine and MDMA together. SO it must be a popular combo.

Party packs? Shit, sign me up. Yeah I’ve always heard that they go well together, but I haven’t tried that combo yet. Tomorrow I’m gonna take a little al-lad with some ket and go to the San Francisco museum of modern art. Should be interesting or disturbing.


Well I ended up having a mystical day though I felt like I needed more ketamine while on al-lad to achieve the desired effect. Perhaps it’s my tolerance.


I’m not sure if this i true, but I’ve heard that ketamine may reduce tolerance to amphetamines. Is there any viability to this theory?

Yep this is true.  Disso tolerance forms slowly but then it takes a very long time to dissipate and never really does all the way.  They're best left for occasional use.  I've been using them for many years but never often and I still basically don't have any real tolerance built up.

Well it’s been roughly 3 months since I’ve used ketamine. My last few encounters were met with disappointment as my tolerance had increased exponentially. I currently have 7 grams sitting in my PO box and I plan to pick it up in a couple days. I guess I’ll find out if my Ketamine tolerance  has sufficiently decreased.


I’ve been tempted to resort to IM or IV administration. I don’t particularly enjoy snorting large quantities of powder as it tends to induce nausea. Also, I believe ketamine is at its best when used in this manner. I just can’t quite get to that place by insufflation. I’m fairly confident this powdered K of mine is of high quality, but if it doesn’t come in a pharmaceutical grade ampule I should probably stick to the nasal route.

Son of a bitch! Customs nabbed 5 grams of my ketamine. At least 2 grams made it through.


Has anyone used ket whilst coming down from adderall? I’m thinking it should help alleviate some of the symptoms.

Well, three months since I’ve done Ket and tolerance is still very present. Insufflated 200mg over the course of an hour and I didn’t get much from it. I just really don’t like snorting K. It has a tendency to make me nauseous and disoriented in an unpleasant way. IM and IV feels way cleaner. I’m thinking of picking up some points to IV since I really don’t want to IM powder K.

I'm over using ketamine. The past few experiences have been really negative. There can be a dark sinister edge to ketamine and it can be nasty. Every time I use it now I get this cold feeling and it makes me feel very alone. Such a shame, Dissociatives use to be my favorite class of drugs. Maybe if I got the chance to IM itd be different, but I'm not introducing powdered street ket into my muscles. Wish MXE was still around.

 respectfully 100% disagree. Yes there are a lot of great analogs (which are way more widely available than k, which is why there isn’t as much k activity imo), but that being said k is simply put a classic. So versatile for mixing (mdma, psychs, alcohol). Not as potent as things like dmxe, sure, but they both have their time and place and flavor.

It has a tendency to make me nauseous and disoriented in an unpleasant way. IM and IV feels way cleaner. I’m thinking of picking up some points to IV since I really don’t want to IM powder K.

You hit it too often to start and now have a permantolerance. I personally like to have some drinks before using and it potentiates nicely, it’s not the deathly combo people make it out to be, but definitely exercise caution, or else you’ll be puking.

I still think I like MXE more overall. Better duration and effects IMO, but to each his own. I don't enjoy how much ket I need to keep snorting to get the desired effect. Has a tendency to make me queasy. IM and IV is vastly superior, almost makes it a different drug.


Yeah I don't know what it is, but everytime I do it I have an unpleasant experience. Dark thoughts become amplified and manifests into an all encompassing feeling. For example, I kept thinking about death and mortality and how ill be reduced to a state of nothingness. I felt cold, alone, and afraid.


It's odd because ket used to give me this warm feeling as I floated peacefully throughout  the ether. It's disappointing I can't attain that place anymore.

Recently every time I hole on any sort of disso, my gf says I start freaking out and acting erratic, yelling out stuff or looking absolutely terrified on the outside, yet what I’m experiencing on the inside is totally different, if anyone has heard of this I’d love to know more because from what I read everyone else’s experience is the exact opposite

it might not have been a FULL hole... and it isnt strictly on ketamine either, its happened on dck, 2fdck, ketamine, 3-ho-pcp and 3-ho-pce, and now last night it was on mxpr and dmxe,


and now that I really think about it, Ive actually had people tell me the same thing in the past, and I just thought they were lying.


its super strange and Im just wondering if anyone else has ever heard of anything like this...


one time a few months ago she took video and I was thrashing around on the ground, mumbling- with my glasses and hat missing.


I know for a fact she isnt lying. Could this be because Im on suboxone and gabapentin? or is it possibly a brain chemistry thing?


thanks in advance guys ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Hmm, I don't know.  So you're deep in enough that you're not aware of your external behavior?  Dissociatives are weird drugs.  Salvia is about the strongest dissociative (albeit through an entirely different mechanism, kappa-opioid receptor agonism instead of NMDA antagonism), and people very commonly react with panic and fear, yelling stuff, freaking out, etc.  I think maybe you should consider dosing lower.  


Are your experiences frightening?  Or do they feel completely different from the way you're externally acting?

I mean a "hole" is a pretty subjective term, I think it's a lot more likely the term is just being used loosely, than it is that his girlfriend is gaslighting him, lol.

[@Choerogan](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/496810/) yeah ive seen people on k acting like that, including myself on camera. Especially after a good dose of IV ket. 

And like you, i (and all of them) have always been unaware/come round thinking i just sat and vegged out calmly.

Its almost like a seizure sometimes, and ive had and witnessed real seizures from it too. Can be quite disturbing, could compare it to being possessed tbh. 


It seems to be a little bit batch (more like what RC disso its cut with) dependant, some batches causing it every time, some causing it sometimes and some batches never causing it. Weird. 


[@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) [@TripSitterNZ](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/521610/)  yeah i think the term hole is loosely thrown around. I wouldn't call any of my experiences holes specifically because i wasnt physically incapacitated but my mind was definitely disconnected from my body, complete blackout/memory loss. This had also happened to me on MXE, MXP and Diphenidine. 


I wish i could source real pharma vials of ket because even when ive had my crystal tested at 99.8% 'purity' i still don't know if it's the same as the real deal. I got a feeling it wouldn't happen with the real pharma stuff...but i could be wrong ![🤷‍♂️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f937-2642.png)

I doubt pharma K would be any different... when they use ketamine for anesthesia, they use a much higher dose than the recreational dose (though not as high as the dose you use, jhjhsdi ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)), which, for people without tolerance, will completely incapacitate them, and they won't remember a thing about it.  But when you haven't had enough to completely go out, you can still possibly move.  When you're going for a recreational "hole" dose of ketamine, you're not taking a fully anesthetic dose, if you did, you wouldn't be able to remember it at all.

intresting. When im in the k-hole its like im totally paralzyed but if its been a massive amount of ket i.e 400 mg and i come out of the k hole then i might act fucking insane as i adjust back to time and space and the reality of been stuck in a human body.

This is normal for ketamine. If you take an unnecessarily large dose you can blackout and do strange things like yell the same thing over and over. Also can cause you to clench your hands very tightly and shake, looking in complete fear but have no recollection either total amnesia or else the feeling of a very strong hole. If the person becomes mobile they might also trash the room or TV if something is playing but I've only saw this happen a few times.


Be careful as doing this is enough to draw attention from anyone nearby if someone isn't there to calm you out of it. It's how a lot of habitual users get caught using as they go for a k-hole at 2-3am and scream the place down then remember nothing the next morning. Also users injecting too large a dose accidentally in bathroom stalls or in public then blacking out screaming and police arriving. To someone not aware of this effect it can be a frightening experience to witness.

Are you a long time user???


Ive vitnessed and experienced similar issues.

Its usually only if ive done ket for a few days in a row and my doses get bigger.

Then i get to a point that if i Hole i walk around and do crazy shit.

During the years ive smashed windows, ran half naked outside and recently i smashed a desc.


All of these things i have zero or little memory off also, ive just woken upp in weird spots confused.


I try to not so ket at all now, but if i do i make sure i dont do it more then 3days and less then 1g per Day.

Its when i do more i go crazy.

Wouldn't a proper anaesthetic dose be needed to ensure no weird fugue/mania actions?


Probably most common to be sitting/lying during the hole tho

This is completely false. There are dissos out there (Mxipr, for instance) where you are mobile during a hole and can vocalize as well, which is why if you are going deep on dissos like Mxipr, I definitely recommend a trip sitter.

Do the bladder issues associated with Ketamine use come from the impurities/adulterants of street-ketamine, or as a natural side-effect of frequent ketamine itself?


In other words, would a person using only pharmaceutical ketamine still develop the same renal issues?

I’ve been doing ketamine infusion boosters  every few months, but it was a pain to ask someone to bring me to the infusion center so I just recently got prescribed ketamine in oral dissolving tablets to take for at home treatment. Anyone have any experience? I’m excited as it’s way more convenient than finding a ride to and from the infusion center

Dissolve the tablet in water in a shot glass with 200mg baking soda + 200mg chitosan oligosaccharide and then drink the entire thing. The baking soda + chitosan oligosaccharide also improves bioavailability for sublingual tablets or boofing, for reference.

The MXE "hole" was to me way more immersive and complete than what ketamine offers (which is saying a lot, ketamine is still one of my top five drugs). I miss it. 

With the catch-all laws in my country and some of the worlds most thorough customs combing through our international mail I've been unable to try other RCs though so I can't comment on any of those.

Well ended up getting some “MXE” from a supoosesed reputable source and it was complete shit. Lots of money down the drain. I’m going to try to find some racemic K. Wish me luck. In the mean time I’ve been using 3-ho-pcp and absolutely love it.

Trying to do it like 2-3 days apart doesn't work.

Tolerance. You only get body numbing and some minor effects, needing bigger and bigger dosages.

The body-stretching/sliding effect. The visual effects. The journeys.

To get those back, it needs at least a 2-week break, it seems.


I don't know how Lilly did this regularly...

If you try to use Ketamine to go into those astral realms, it seems like you still need the tolerance break to do so, attempting it daily just makes it much less visual, though still its possible, if you sort of push it along, but not like with 0 tolerance where you can just IM 60mg and be gone!

Had my first k-hole a few weeks ago.

It was awesome and very strange. One of the hardest drug experiences to put into words.


I was in a place of total synesthesia, spoken words were written visually, I could see music.

Then I was in a tapir world. I felt like a tapir.


My body started to talk with my trip partner automatically, without me intending to speak.

We shared our k hole that way, were on a boat together & visited sicily.


Went into the hole like 3 times, inhaling N2O balloons to get deeper / kick start the ket after snorting a huge line.


It felt completely positive, warm & interesting.


My trip partner massaged my back while I inhaled a N2O baloon once & I could feel my body spreading meters in width, I could feel her hands a meter left of my actual location.

Lily probably had vials avaiable to him, being a scientist and all that.

Doing K IM helps alot with tolerance although its probably even alot more addictive. 


My tolerance is basicly stable becauce i only do IM and just take breaks once i feel the tolerance taking over.


This way ive been able to keep my dosage about the same for +5years.

My sources are good friends and i usually just pick up 0,5-1g at a time unless ive planned a multiday binge which doesnt happen very often.

Tis' the thread for me ![🌞](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f31e.png) 


I find buprenorphine  is inhibiting the "leaving the body" part of ketamine, and it makes me frustrated.

I'm on kratom & avoid taking it too close before the ket.

I haven't really notice a strong reduction of the out of body experiences, but it does make me feel kinda weird (in a bad way) when the kratom is still active while I snort ket.

A strange body feeling that makes me a little anxious sometimes.


I take a smaller dose in the morning when I plan on taking ket in the evening & only take another dose when I'm approaching soberness again & want to sleep (instead of 3-4 kratom doses daily).


Ket is pretty good at blocking opioid WDs, so maybe you can wait like 12h after your Bupre dose?

Ah okay. Yeah I get that wierd feeling to, especially if I'm really feeling the ket (which is hard to do for some reason, a high protein high fat meal helps a lot to feel it more but it isnt really worth it since its not enjoyable for me)

And I also find the ket works better the longer I've been on it, as if it replaces the bupe to an exctent.

But the thing is another kind of ket got me blasted out to space in a good way so I think it depends on which kind it is.

 Hmm I should probably just lay it off until I'm off the bupe, from reading my own words

Used sparingly I would say it seems I’m in a better headspace the day after and up to three days afterwards.   Some say it can last weeks and months ,  haven’t noticed this myself but hope I’m wrong. There’s so much with life going on that can bring ups and downs esp if f we don’t control our feelings and something’s just sent going to be pleasant all the time.   Some struggle is good to keep us humble.   Too much health issues at once isn’t fun.  Well none are really.  Infections from iming sucks . Tooth infections do as well.   Thankfully gods got me.


Calves aren’t too sore to inject this with bac water or saline solution.  Massage them after injecting. bac water is better .  Really once a month max for a high dose for you.  125 mgs was a lot last time and remember thinking would not want any more.  Sub q 50, then I’m 75.   Rotating injection sites is important.   Again, as many say ketamine is relatively safe using responsibility, or to a powerful drug and must be respected.


Ketamine seems to be more dose dependent than any drug possibly that I’ve tried, recreationally.  a 235 lbsr needs more than a 160 lber on ketamine.   On mdma, sub 4 Typts this doesn’t seem to be the case as much or even at all.

Do you really do subcutaneous injection with ketamine [@Innerpeace](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/268867/)  ? I thought it was only possible to IM or it won't absorb properly?

    Sub q is a higher percent absorbed than snorted.  Takes longer to absorb in fat than muscle, yet is active faster than you may imagine.

Had a few friends over for a party the other day, and I don't know how but somehow the ketamine started working as it should and it still does. It feels a little magic in that way. Still going to take a break in the coming days, since I don't want to ruin my nose, stomach and bladder.

Does anybody else also feel like it works when it's *supposed* to work?

Hard reduction tip:

Drink green tea 1-2 hours before a large ketamine dose to neutralise the corrosive properties of it in the bladder. It doesn't help 100% but it is definitely better to drink it then not to, I find a significant decrease in bladder/urine problems if I drink 2 cups before starting to take ket.

Read this info in a medicinal ketamine group on reddit.

Always had an aversion to needles but am curious about IM. Sounds like a much easier way to get in a hole then shorting and seems pretty hard to fuck up. Only reservation would be the quality of the ketamine itself and whether that could create an infection risk. Never had access to vials.

Yeah, if you don't have access to vials of sterile pharma ket I wouldnt risk it. 


I will admit though that IM is the best way to take ket. Even better than IV IMO. If you only have access to dubious ket and wanna try it anyway make sure to get micron filter wheels and filter your ket solution before IM'ing it. Only the 0.2 um filters will effectively get rid of bacteria.

I found it doesn't hit much harder than snorting. I expected it to be like way stronger. I only IM because the snorting seems really bad for my nose. You will have to heat it to get it into solution. I rarely do it because i dont like to take the whole dose at once, i like doing little bumps to get where i want to be. I dont want to do a bunch of little injections.

 I thought IM would end my nasal use but it didn't. I pretty much stopped after i ran out of sterile cups and micron filters, i still have some needles (bought on amazon). Its weird because i associate ket with the drip taste and its weird to have the high but not the taste. The positive though i thought i would feel more junkie than I did, its not much different than injecting vitamins. It never became a problem, for me, YMMV

Hi, hère is my two cents.


I recently got some ketamine after a few years without encounter it.


If before I didn't take the precaution to weigh it, I'm doing it now. I was at first surprised by the weak physical effects, feeling like I can move whenever I want (50-60mg snorted). But man, I was clearly high and feel it in my field of view and my thoughts. The effects were clearly different from what I remember from the ket I was used to (rave ket).


After checking with my source, I saw it was advertised as s-isomer. Clearly, I read about it but never encounter a real difference between ketamine. But now I can tell there is!


Long message for not so much haha but I wanted to share my encounter with s-ket and put a little reminder that it could be disappointing at first!


To be clear, I didn't test it. But as I didn't knew (remember) it was advertised as s-isomer I found it interesting to share it here


Cheers
