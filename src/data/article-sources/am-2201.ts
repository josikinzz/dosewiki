## Subjective Experience

Like spice, the brand name Black Mamba was eventually to be misappropriated to
become a generic name for all sorts of materials infused with a strong cannabinoid or
combinations of strong cannabinoids. Originally, however, it appeared in a green and
black glossy packet, infused with just AM-2201.

It was a monster.

In 2014 I posted the following on an Internet forum, as a response to a member who
had articulated his own terrible story with the same compound:

\`\`\`
I had a very similar experience with this chemical, which I bought as an
incense blend from a head shop. I tested it twice, optimistically and foolishly
assuming that the first bad hit was a fluke.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I felt the sort of anxiety that is possible via certain cannabis strains; but
multiplied by a factor of 100. It was almost overwhelming: acute fear and
intense paranoia are good words to describe it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
After this second lesson, I flushed the rest of the bag. I still struggle to explain
how it took two trips to the abyss to do this.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The other cannabinoid that freaked me out was 5F-AKB48, which was also
smoked courtesy of a head-shop procured blend. After the nightmare with that
one, that was it: no more synthetic cannabinoids, ever.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The sheer terror I endured with these two is hard to articulate, and I didn't
even consume them in vast quantities.
\`\`\`
On each occasion, the intensity of the dread eventually subsided, and the experience
plateaued into a more regular cannabinoid-type state. Each had been a +++ on the
Shulgin scale and an absolutely horrendous ride.

I shudder to think about what may have occurred had all this unfolded in a public
place, rather than in the sanctuary of my home.

Note that I have in fact held true to my forum comment above: I have not sampled an
artificial cannabinoid since that particular day.

\`\`\`
This was one of the cannabinoids which was central to the surge of addiction
amongst the homeless in British cities circa 2017

AM-2201 (1-(5-fluoropentyl)-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole) is a recreational designer drug that acts as a potent but nonselective full agonist for the cannabinoid receptor. It is part of the AM series of cannabinoids discovered by Alexandros Makriyannis at Northeastern University.

## Hazards

Convulsions have been reported including at doses as low as 10 mg.

## Pharmacology

AM-2201 is a full agonist for cannabinoid receptors. Affinities are: with a Ki of 1.0 nM at CB1 and 2.6 nM at CB2. The 4-methyl functional analog MAM-2201 probably has similar affinities. AM-2201 has an EC50 of 38 nM for human CB1 receptors, and 58 nM for human CB2 receptors. AM-2201 produces bradycardia and hypothermia in rats at doses of 0.3–3 mg/kg, comparable to the potency of JWH-018 in rats, suggesting potent cannabinoid-like activity.

### Pharmacokinetics

AM-2201 metabolism differs only slightly from that of JWH-018. AM-2201 N-dealkylation produces fluoropentane instead of pentane (or plain alkanes in general).

## Detection

A forensic standard of AM-2201 is available, and the compound has been posted on the Forendex website of potential drugs of abuse.

## Legal status

In the United States, AM-2201 is a Schedule I controlled substance.
