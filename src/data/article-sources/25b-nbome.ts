**25B-NBOMe can be fatal at heavy doses.^[1] It is strongly discouraged to take large amounts of this substance or to snort it. **

*25B-NBOMe* or *2C-B-NBOMe* is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as 2C-B.

It has nearly no history of human use prior to 2010 when it first became popular due its ease of purchase from online research chemical vendors.

25B-NBOMe has efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) where it acts as a potent partial agonist. It was discovered in 2003 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin, it differs from 2C-B structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group as shown in the image above. This change in structure results in roughly a sixteen fold increase in potency when compared to 2C-B, allowing even the most extreme of dosages to fit in liquid form onto tabs and blotter paper (which people often mistake for LSD).

There are, however, methods of differentiating between LSD and adulterants like 25B-NBOMe with and without test kits.

For example, one of the key differences between 25B-NBOMe and LSD is that this substance is only active when taken through a sublingual or insufflated route. This means that in order to get the full effects, 25B-NBOMe blotter paper must be lightly chewed on within the mouth for 10 - 20 minutes and never immediately swallowed.

Insufflation, however, is not recommended due to the amount of people who have suffered through dangerous and often fatal overdoses due to this route of administration.

The 25B-NBOMe experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 25B-NBOMe can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Sublingual numbing** - assuming the substance has been taken sublingually, the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after sublingual absorption is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very obvious feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed. This is the key difference when it comes to determining whether your blotter paper contains LSD or one of the NBOMe series.
- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high itself can be described as a generally mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of euphoria that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **Decreased bodily weight** - in terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **Stimulation** - in terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 25B-NBOMe is usually considered to be energetic and stimulating, but it can be considered less stimulating when compared to 25I-NBOMe. For most people, this substance induces a unique type of physical stimulation which can be described as feeling extremely energetic but in a way which does not force the tripper to move unless they genuinely choose to do so. For others however, the stimulation can be quite uncontrollable, occasionally resulting in bodily shakes and a grinding of the teeth comparable to that of MDMA and traditional stimulants such as amphetamine, but this is manifested much less consistently when compared to 25I-NBOMe
- **Vasoconstriction** - it is worth noting that an undetermined percentage of people who experiment with this drug will experience negative physical side effects, such as a temporary difficulty in urinating and vasoconstriction. This is defined as the narrowing of the blood vessels resulting from contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels and is triggered through the way in which 25B-NBOMe’s target receptor (5-HT2A) modulates both vasoconstriction and vasodilation among its many other functions.
- **Nausea** - as the tripper begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this has either happened or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as psilocin, LSD, 2C-E and 2C-I, this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 25B-NBOMe is described by many as remarkably light and underwhelming in comparison to the classical psychedelics. It is not uncommon for people to report feeling that their thought stream has maintained general normality in its specific style throughout low to moderate dosages. At high dosages however, mild to overwhelming cognitive alterations become present.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **Introspection** - this component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - the entactogenic effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other entactogens (such as MDMA, 2C-B and AMT)
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

25B-NBOMe presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colour**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

The visual distortions and alterations which are experienced are detailed below:

- **Drifting** (*Melting, Flowing, Breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip is often described as similar in appearance to that of LSD. They can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp around the edges and mostly rounded across their corners. In comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics they can be described as significantly more intricate than the visual geometry found within 2C-I and most of the 2C-x family in general as well as completely on par with LSD, Psilocin and DMT at appropriately high dosages.

In terms of their behaviour, 25B-NBOMe’s geometry leads onto Level 7A visual geometry with Level 7B remaining so far unconfirmed within this substance. They also seem to consistently build up in visual intensity when the tripper stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the tripper has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.

*Hallucinatory states*

25B-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. However, level 4 hallucinatory breakthroughs are reported but very uncommon and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin, 2C-E and DMT.

These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - this particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 25B-NBOMe are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

25B-NBOMe is a very new substance and little is known about its pharmacological or behavioural risks. The LD50 is not known. Some deaths have been attributed to 25B-NBOMe overdose caused by improper handling and uneducated use of this substance. Its recent widespread use suggests that death is primarily caused from overdoses and not from ordinary doses, particularly from insufflation.

The fact that 25B-NBOMe is active in the microgram range is likely a contributing factor since this makes measuring doses significantly more difficult.

In terms of its addictive potential, 25B-NBOMe has not been studied formally but due to its immediate tolerance build up which lasts up to 2 - 3 weeks after the experience, it is essentially impossible to use this substance compulsively.

**Legal issues:**

- **UK:** 25B-NBOMe is under a temporary class drug order, lasting one year from 10th June 2013.
- **Sweden:** 25b-NBOMe is classed as schedule I.
- **USA:** On Nov 15, 2013, the DEA added 25B-NBOMe to Schedule I using their emergency scheduling powers, making it “temporarily” in Schedule I for 2 years.

**Conclusion:**

As for the substance itself, 25B-NBOMe  and the NBOMe series as a whole are an extremely interesting set of psychedelics but do not quite compare in terms of hallucinatory and cognitive depth if you have access to classical psychedelics such as genuine LSD, DMT and psilocin.

It is strongly discouraged to take large amounts of this substance or to [insufflate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Insufflation) (snort) it. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25B-NBOMe#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**25B-NBOMe** (also known as **Cimbi-36** , **NBOMe-2C-B** and **2C-B-NBOMe** ) is novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is a member of the 25x-NBOMe series, a recently discovered group of potent psychedelic compounds derived from the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family. The name 25B-NBOMe, which is short-hand for 2C-B-NBOMe, indicates it is a derivative of the phenethylamine psychedelic 2C-B.

25B-NBOMe was discovered in 2004 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin. It acts as a potent partial agonist for the 5-HT 2A receptor. It has been used in clinical trials with an evaluation dose for safety consideration to humans of only 1 microgram. Such a dose was determined to be only 1/300th the dose expected to be hallucinogenic to humans and that recreational use would greatly exceed doses determined to be safe to humans. This substance had no history of human use before being sold online as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) in 2010. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . Anecdotal reports suggest 25B-NBOMe to be an active [hallucinogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) at a dose of as little as 250–500 µg, making it a similar potency to other phenethylamine derived [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) such as [Bromo-DragonFLY](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bromo-DragonFLY) . It is worth noting that compounds of the [NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) class are not [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oral) active and should therefore be taken [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) by placing them into one's mouth and allowing it to absorb over a period of 15-30 minutes.

Extremely little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 25B-NBOMe in humans. Numerous members of the [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) series have been associated with hospitalizations and deaths. Along with its highly sensitive dose-response and unpredictable effects, many reports also suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely. Therefore it is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

25B-NBOMe or 2C-B-NBOMe is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . 25B-NBOMe is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a bromine atom attached to carbon R 4 . It differs from [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group. 25B-NBOMe shares this 2-methoxybenzyl substitution with other chemicals of the NBOMe family. This NBOMe addition contains a methoxy ether CH 3 O- bound to a benzene ring at R 2 .

The compound has a density of 1.3 (±0.1) g/cm^3.

## Pharmacology

25B-NBOMe has efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) where it acts as a potent [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 25B-NBOMe is usually considered to be energetic and stimulating, but it can be considered less stimulating when compared to [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) . For most people, this substance induces a unique type of physical stimulation which can be described as feeling extremely energetic but in a way which does not force the person to move unless they genuinely choose to do so. For others, however, the stimulation can be quite uncontrollable, occasionally resulting in bodily shakes and a grinding of the teeth comparable to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and traditional stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , but this is manifested much less consistently when compared to that of [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe)
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - Assuming the substance has been taken sublingually, the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after [sublingual](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Sublingual) absorption is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very obvious feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed. This is a key difference when it comes to determining whether one's blotter paper contains [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or one of the NBOMe series.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" itself can be described as a generally mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of euphoria that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - In terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - As the user begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this has either happened or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip is often described as similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . They can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp around the edges and mostly rounded across their corners. In comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics they can be described as significantly more intricate than the visual geometry found within [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) and most of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family in general as well as completely on par with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) at appropriately high dosages.
 
In terms of their behaviour, 25B-NBOMe’s geometry leads onto [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry with [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) remaining so far unconfirmed within this substance. They also seem to consistently build up in visual intensity when the user stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the user has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) These are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Empathy, love and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love_and_sociability_enhancement)** - The [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) (such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [AMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AMT) ). They are, however, the most prominent [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects found within the [NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NBOMe) series.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone and is introspection dominant.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 25B-NBOMe](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_25BNBOMe.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

25B-NBOMe is a relatively new substance, and little is known about its pharmacological risks or its interaction with other substances. The lethal dosage has not yet been determined. One case has been reported on where 25B-NBOMe was identified as the cause of death for a 17-year-old boy.

It is advised that due to 25B-NBOMe's extreme potency it should not be insufflated as this method of administration is potentially fatal at heavy dosages.

25B-NBOMe has been used in clinical trials with an evaluation dose for safety consideration to humans of only 1 microgram; Such a dose is 300× lower than the dose expected to be hallucinogenic to humans and it is expected that recreational use would greatly exceed doses determined to be safe to humans.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

25B-NBOMe is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 25B-NBOMe is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 1 week for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 25B-NBOMe presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 25B-NBOMe all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Due to the very high potency and seemingly unpredictable effects the margin between a normal and an overdose of NBOMe compounds is extremely small when compared to many other substances. The exact toxic dose is unclear since it seems to depend a lot on personal physiology, rather than predominantly dose. However, various anecdotal reports suggest that dangerous side effects begin to appear when exceeding 1000 μg and it possibly becoming lethal for the more sensitive people at roughly 2000 μg. Reports of other people surviving much higher doses, sometimes even without any major side effects have been documented as well.

There is also the uncertainty of dosage on blotter paper since it is rather difficult to lay such an exact dosage. Insufflating, vaporizing or drinking tinctures of this substance is highly discouraged because of this and has been tied to many documented deaths . One study found that 25I‐NBOMe and 25C‐NBOMe blotter papers contained 'hotspots' with higher quantities of the drug, implying an inherent risk of overdosing.

The overdose effects of NBOMes are typically a dangerously high [heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) and significant [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) also accompanied by [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) , aggressive behavior, [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) or pain, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) and often [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) . The risks in an overdose include anything from organ failure to cardiac arrest and death [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . There are also multiple reports of people lethally injuring themselves or falling to death . [Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help with the psychological effects during an overdose although medical attention should always be called in even a possible overdose of 25I-NBOMe.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .* Due to the highly unpredictable nature of the NBOMe series, it is generally advised to avoid mixing them with other psychoactive substances.

- **2C-T-X** - The 2C-T-X phenethylamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **5-MeO-xxt** - The 5-MeO tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **aMT**
- **Caffeine** - Caffeine can bring out the natural stimulation from psychedelic drugs to make it uncomfortable. High doses can cause anxiety which is hard to handle while tripping.
- **Cannabis** - Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of psychedelics. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **Cocaine** - Cocaine and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **DOx**
- **DXM**
- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** [- Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably.
- **MDMA**
- **MXE** - As an NMDA antagonist, MXE potentiates NBOMes which can be unpleasantly intense.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and NBOMes have also shown a tendency to cause severe seizures

25B-NBOMe, also known as NBOMe-2C-B and Cimbi-36, is a psychedelic drug of the 25-NB (NBOMe) family derived from 2C-B. It acts as a potent full agonist for the 5HT2A receptor. Duration of effects lasts about 3 to 10 hours, although the parent compound is rapidly cleared from the blood when used in the radiolabeled form in tracer doses. Recently, Custodio et al. (2019) evaluated the potential involvement of dysregulated dopaminergic system, neuroadaptation, and brain wave changes which may contribute to the rewarding and reinforcing properties of 25B-NBOMe in rodents.
The carbon-11 labeled version of this compound ([11C]Cimbi-36) was synthesized and validated as a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography (PET) in Copenhagen. As a 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET radioligand, [11C]Cimbi-36 was hypothesized to provide a more functional marker of these receptors. Also, [11C]Cimbi-36 is investigated as a potential marker of serotonin release and thus could serve as an indicator of serotonin levels in vivo. [11C]Cimbi-36 is now undergoing clinical trials as a PET-ligand in humans.
25B-NBOMe was first described in the scientific literature by Ralf Heim and colleagues at the Free University of Berlin by 1999.

## Use and effects

The dose range of 25B-NBOMe has been given as 0.05 to 0.7 mg sublingually, with a typical dose estimate of 0.4 mg.

### Pharmacodynamics

25B-NBOMe is a selective serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist. It showed roughly the same affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors in one study (Ki = 0.5–1.7 nM). However, in another study, it showed 12- to 20-fold selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (Ki = 0.5 nM) over the serotonin 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors (Ki = 10 and 6.2 nM, respectively). The drug is highly selective for the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors over a variety of other serotonin receptors, as well as over various other monoamine receptors and over the monoamine transporters (>200-fold selectivity). However, 25B-NBOMe is a low-potency partial agonist of the rat and mouse trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) but is inactive at the human TAAR1.
25B-NBOMe has been found to increase levels of glutamate, serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine in the frontal cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens in rats. Other serotonergic psychedelics like LSD and DOI have also been found to increase glutamate levels in the frontal cortex in rodents, and this effect can be blocked by the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist volinanserin (MDL-100,907). 25B-NBOMe shows an inverted U-shaped dose–response curve in terms of neurotransmitter elevations in multiple brain areas. This may be due to an inhibitory effect of serotonin 5-HT2C receptors at higher doses. 25B-NBOMe produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents, and this effect shows an inverted U-shaped dose–response curve similarly to its influences on neurotransmitter levels. The head twitches and hallucinogenic effects of 25B-NBOMe may be due to increased cortical glutamate release secondary to serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation. The effects of 25B-NBOMe on levels of other neurotransmitters, such as accumbal dopamine concentrations, may also be mediated by activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and glutamate elevation. It has been suggested that the serotonin elevations with 25B-NBOMe may be involved in its production of serotonin syndrome in humans.
Unlike many other serotonergic psychedelics, 25B-NBOMe has been found to produce reinforcing effects in rodents, including conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration, and hence may have misuse potential. Accordingly, 25B-NBOMe robustly increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens in rodents similarly to but a lesser extent than methamphetamine, and its reinforcing effects could be blocked by the dopamine receptor antagonists SCH-23390 and haloperidol. Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation is known to increase dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway. However, the reinforcing effects of 25B-NBOMe were not blocked by the selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin. Similarly to 25B-NBOMe, 25N-NBOMe has also shown reinforcing effects in rodents. More research is needed to elucidate how 25B-NBOMe and other NBOMe drugs produce reinforcing effects in animals.
25B-NBOMe has been found to decrease locomotor activity in rodents.
