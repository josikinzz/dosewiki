**Dosage (oral)**
*Threshold* : 3 - 5 mg
*Light* : 10 - 20 mg
*Common* : 15 - 30 mg
*Strong* : 10 - 50 mg
*Heavy* : 25 - 60mg

In terms of its chemistry, 2C-T-7 is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups attached to carbons R2 and R5as well as a sulfide chain attached to carbon R4.

In terms of its pharmacology, 2C-T-7 has efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. This is a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines. Along side of this, as the 2,5-desmethoxy derivative of 2C-T-7 has been shown to be a moderate monoamine oxidase A inhibitor, this substance may likewise have MAOI effects.

2C-T-7 is a highly dose sensitive psychedelic known for its strong visuals and intense body load. Many reports also indicate that the effects of this chemical may be overly intense for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics. The experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-T-7 can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of 2C-T-7 is intense but, in comparison to 2C-E or 2C-B, it can be considered mild though is still capable of becoming very powerful and highly physically euphoric. It is similar yet distinct from the body high experienced on 2C-E, 2C-B, and LSD. The sensation itself can be described as intense and will manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper 2C-T-7 is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of other phenethylamines such as 2C-B, 2C-E and 2C-P.
- **Increased bodily control** - Although this component is capable of manifesting itself in a distinct and noticeable fashion for most users it does not generally seem to be as apparent or intense as the same component found within LSD and 2C-B.
- **Enhancement of touch**
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is commonly reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Loss of temperature regulation**

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 2C-T-7 is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Introspection**
- **Outrospection**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Thought loops**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

2C-T-7 presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colour**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

2C-T-7 presents a full and complete array of possible visual distortions which generally includes:

- **Drifting **(*Melting, Flowing, Breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and extremely realistic in style but with a subtle digital/cartoonish form.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT or Ayahuasca than that of LSD, 2C-B or 2C-I. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel with slightly more mystical and shamanic undertones to them in comparison to other phenethylamines. At higher dosages they are equally likely to result in states of Level 7A visual geometry and Level 7B. There seems to be visual geometry that is extremely similar to 2C-E and 2C-P and can be described as equal in intensity or complexity and equal in proportion to the accompanying cognitive and physical effects.

*Hallucinatory states*

2C-T-7 produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, 2C-T-7 is very high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

*Auditory effects*

The auditory effects of 2C-T-7 are more common in their occurrence than many more commonly used psychedelics and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 2C-T-7 use does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2C-T-7 is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 2C-T-7 within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

2C-T-7 does not seem to be physically addictive and many users experience a self regulating quality. There seems to be a tolerance build up when used consecutively multiple days in a row which requires one to double their dosage each time to achieve the same effects.

There is no current data for the LD50 of 2C-T-7, but it is thought to be high. Erowid does however have some annecdotal information on fatal dosages occurring at 35mg+ of insufflated dosages.

If 2C-T-7 does have MAOI effects, this could indicate that 2C-T-7 is more likely to induce serotonin syndrome, especially at high dosages, than other serotonergic hallucinogens. This may make it dangerous to combine with certain substances such as MDMA, AMT, Ayahuasca or any substance which releases neurotransmitters such as serotonin or those with similar pharmocological effects.

**Legal issues:**

- 2C-T-7 is scheduled in Germany.
- In Australia, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 are covered by the country’s analogue drug laws.
- 2C-T-7 is unscheduled in Canada.
- The Netherlands was the first country in the world to ban 2C-T-7, after being sold in smartshops for a short period. After 2C-T-2 was first banned, 2C-T-7 quickly appeared on the market, but was soon banned as well. 2C-T-7 is a list I drug of the Opium Law.
- Schedule I in Sweden. 2C-T-7 was first classified as “health hazard” under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of April 1, 1999 under SFS 1999:58 that made it illegal to sell or possess.
- In 1999, Alexander Shulgin was sent a copy of a letter from the British Home Office to several of its administrative associates that in effect placed all compounds listed in PiHKAL into Class A.
- On September 20, 2002, 2C-T-7 was classified as a Schedule I substance in the United States by an emergency ruling by the DEA. On March 18, 2004, the DEA published a Final Rule in the Federal Register permanently placing 2C-T-7 in Schedule I.

**Conclusion:**

2C-T-7 shows incredible depth on both an insightful and a recreational level with a full spectrum of deep psychedelic effects. It is completely worthy of its position within the magical half dozen and an extremely versatile compound. I would recommend this experience to anybody willing to try it in a safe and sensible manner.

DESCRIPTION #
 
[2C-T-7 Images](https://erowid.org/2ct7_images.shtml)
 
2C-T-7 is a psychedelic phenethylamine developed by Alexander Shulgin around 1980. The effects of 2C-T-7 share some general similarities with LSD & 2CB, with its length of action more like that of LSD. While most of the chemicals in its class are not known to cause acute physical dangers, 2C-T-7's safety profile for wide use is not well known nor researched. As with all new chemicals, it is difficult to be certain what the variety of reactions to the substance will be and the reports of use so far have a lot of conflicting and confusing elements, including duration, physical stimulation, dosage, etc. 
 
[ [Main 2C-T-7 Vault](https://erowid.org/2ct7.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/2ct7_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of 2C-T-7 is between 10 - 50 mg. It is generally found in powder form although it is also produced and sold in pill format, most recently at 7 mg per tablet. Insufflated doses are considerably lower. Users should be extremely careful with dosages as 2C-T-7 can cause unexpected delirium and dissociation at high doses.
 
Price #
 
Rare, but sometimes sold at parties for 5-20\$ per dose, available from exotic chemical suppliers for 375-450\$ per gram, about the same from underground suppliers. (August 2000)
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/2ct7_law.shtml) #
 
2C-T-7 is was placed in Schedule I by emergency order of the DEA on September 20, 2002. This makes it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the United States without a DEA license. Although Sweden controls 2C-T-7, we are not aware of any other countries that specifically list it as illegal to possess or sell.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/2ct7_chemistry.shtml) #
 
2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propylthiophenethylamine (2C-T-7) is a synthetic chemical in the phenethylamine class. It is related structurally to 2C-B and Mescaline.

[History](https://erowid.org/2ct7_timeline.php) #
 
2C-T-7's chemistry was first published in Alexander Shulgin's book *PiHKAL* in 1991. It was produced underground in college labs and by small commercial research labs until the late 1990's when it began being produced and sold commercially around the world.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
2C-T-7; T7; Beautiful.
 
The Experience:
 
Tripping.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/2ct7_effects.shtml) #
 
2C-T-7's effects are unique but classically psychedelic, with some general similarities to LSD & 2C-B. 2C-T-7's effects can include psychedelic visuals (patterning, light sensitivity, color enhancement, etc), mood lift, empathogenesis, anxiety or calmness, emotional volatility, increased sociability, associative / psychedelic ideation, etc. Some users have report unexpected and disconcerting dissociation at high doses. Relatively prominent visuals are common with 2C-T-7 and at higher doses the visuals can overwhelm the visual field creating a 'psychedelic soup'.
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, 2C-T-7 generally takes 1-2.5 hours to take effect. On a full stomach, onset can be considerably slower than normal.
 
Duration #
 
2C-T-7's primary effects can last as long as 10-12 hours, with after effects for another 4-6 hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
The most common problems reported by 2C-T-7 users appear to be nausea, vomiting, unpleasant dissociation, and overwhelming visuals at high doses. As with most psychedelics, there is also the possibility of anxiety or panic attacks. In a few higher dose cases, severe dissociation has been reported where the user experienced loss of memory, mental confusion, and extreme inability to deal with real-world situations while fully physically functional. Some reports include the user becoming unusually enraged and violent. This can lead to potentially dangerous situations if an individual is left unsupervised. Heavy dissociation and vomiting can be a life-threatening combination. At least 3 [deaths](https://erowid.org/2ct7_death1.shtml) have been reported (April 2001).
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not take 2C-T-7 if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorix or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 2C-T-7 and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking 2C-T-7. Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar closely as there have been some reports of problems. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 2C-T-7 as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
2C-T-7 is neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 2C-T-7 use. Using 2C-T-7 two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.
 
Long Term Health Problems #
 
Long Term Health Problems Summary Needed.
 
Risk of Death #
 
There have been 3 deaths which have been tied directly to 2C-T-7. The exact mechanism of death is not yet known, but it is beginning to appear that some direct pharmacological effect may be responsible (rather than an indirect effect such as aspirating vomit). There have been no formal evaluations of the Toxicity of 2C-T-7 that we're aware of.

DESCRIPTION #
 
2C-T-7 Overdoses & Delirium #
 A handful of reports of 2C-T-7 overdoses (non life threatening) have come through in the last 4 months and it is extremely important to realize that 2C-T-7 is a powerful psychedelic with a dose-response profile that makes it very easy to take ***way*** too much. Some users have recently reported either taking themselves to the hospital or being taken to the emergency room from 2C-T-7 alone. Users who have taken as little as 10 mg orally have reported being overwhelmed with anxiety and discomfort, while some users who have snorted 15 mg or taken 30 mg or more orally report being completely overwhelmed by the intensity of the experience. These users report becoming frightened for their health, completely dissociated (forgetting who they are, where they are, that they've ingested a chemical), experiencing intense and frightening body pains (stomach & muscle cramps), becoming unable to see because of the intensity of the visuals, becoming beligerent, etc. This is especially worrisome with 2C-T-7 because the effects last so long and high dose users often wander around and get themselves in trouble in public by being completely incapable of taking care of themselves. 
 
 Many users of 2C-T-7 are most familiar with the effects of [ecstasy](https://erowid.org/../mdma/) and it's important to realize that 2C-T-7 is very unlike ecstasy and can often lead to difficult, intense, and overwhelmingly confusing experiences which are much safer and more useful when taken in a safe, private context with a sitter or therapist. This is not ecstasy. Be extremely careful with this chemical, measure it very carefully, and **do not eyeball** doses. 
 
 
 
Notes on Snorting 2C-T-7 (Not Recommended) #
 There's been quite a bit of discussion about snorting 2C-T-7 partially because of the [reported deaths](https://erowid.org/2ct7_death1.shtml) in combination with some of the dramatic and severe overdose reactions people have had. In Erowid's Fall 2000 2C-T-7 survey, conducted by Murple, one surprising result was that people reported that they snorted 2C-T-7 in order to reduce side effects, but actually ended up experiencing greater side effects, on average, than people who ingested it orally (see [Murple's writeup](https://erowid.org/article1/survey.shtml#Side) ). 
 
 Using the pure powdered 2C-T-7 causes most users intense discomfort and is very likely to be bad for the sinuses. As with other snortables, this will lead to more serious problems if used chronicly. Unlike Cocaine or Ketamine, 2C-T-7 causes intense burning pain which lasts 5-15 minutes before it begins to fade, leaves an unpleasant drip that permeates the experience, and can lead to sinus and throat infections in some people. This is similar to the experiences reported when other 2C- compounds are snorted. Most users contacted by Erowid said they would not repeat snorting 2C-T-7 because of the increased side effects and accidental overdoses.

2C-T-7 Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
2C-T-7 is a phenethylamine somewhat similar in effects to 2C-B. It is generally available as powder, though it has in the past been available in tablet form. Some people appear to be significantly more sensitive to 2C-T-7 than others. Be careful with starting doses if you don't know your sensitivity. It is generally taken orally. 
 
 There are some reports of 2C-T-7 taking an unusually long time to come on, even when insufflated. Most reports, however, indicate that effects begin within a few minutes and ramp up to the peak for up to an hour or so. 
 
 Please read the 2C-T-7 **[Overdose Warning](https://erowid.org/2ct7_effects.shtml#Overdose)** . Dosages this small must be measured very very carefully. 
 
 Warning : There have been several [reports of deaths](https://erowid.org/2ct7_death1.shtml) from 2C-T-7, and many reports of severe dissociation and vomiting (a dangerous combination) after both oral and insufflated use.

---
 
 
Insufflated / Nasal
 Insufflating 2C-T-7 has lead to at least [2 deaths](https://erowid.org/2ct7_death1.shtml) and seems to lead to [increased body load and negative effects in many people](https://erowid.org/chemicals/2ct7/article1/conclusion.shtml#snorting) . Because dosage between users varies so wildly, it is dangerous for first time users to snort more than a few milligrams because people have had dissociated, overwhelming experiences on as little as [6 mg insufflated](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?S1=54&DoseMethodID=2&Intensity=4) . It is imperative that dosed be measured using a milligram scale for accuracy.

**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**2C-T-7**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I
- CLASSIFICATION: Hallucinogen
- SCH. DATE: Sep 20, 2002
 
2C-T-7 is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license. 
 
 On July 18th, 2002, the DEA announced its intent to emergency schedule 2C-T-7. On September 20, after two months, they issued their final order to temporarily place 2C-T-7 in Schedule I. The temporary scheduling lasted 18 months and on March 18, 2004 2C-T-7 was placed formally into Schedule I. See the DEA's [notice of intent to schedule](https://erowid.org/2ct7_law1.shtml) and their [final order to emergency schedule](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2002_register&docid=02-23877-filed) for more details.

## SYNTHESIS
A mixture of 14.4 g POCl3 and 13.4 g N-methylformanilide was heated for 10 min on the steam bath. To this claret-colored solution was added 8.9 g of 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl n-propyl sulfide, and the mixture heated an additional 25 min on the steam bath. This was then added to 800 mL of well-stirred warm H2O (pre-heated to 55 Â°C) and the stirring continued until the oily phase had completely solidified (about 15 minutes). The resulting brown sugar-like solids were removed by filtration, and washed with additional H2O. After sucking as dry as possible, they were dissolved in an equal weight of boiling MeOH which, after cooling in an ice-bath, deposited pale ivory colored crystals. After filtration, modest washing with cold MeOH, and air drying to constant weight, there was obtained 8.3 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n-propylthio)benzaldehyde with a mp of 73â76 Â°C. Recrystallization from 2.5 volumes of MeOH provided a white analytical sample with mp 76â77 Â°C. The NMR spectrum in CDCl3 was textbook perfect, with the two aromatic protons showing singlet signals at 6.81 and 7.27 ppm, giving assurance that the assigned location of the introduced aldehyde group was correct.

To a solution of 4.0 g 2,5-dimethoxy-(n-propylthio)benzaldehyde in 20 g of nitromethane there was added 0.23 g of anhydrous ammonium acetate, and the mixture was heated on the steam bath for 1 h. The clear orange solution was decanted from some insoluble material and the excess nitromethane removed under vacuum. The orange-yellow crystalline material that remained was crystallized from 70 mL boiling IPA which, on slow cooling, deposited 2,5-dimethoxy-Î²-nitro-4-n-propylthiostyrene as orange crystals. After their removal by filtration and air-drying to constant weight, they weighed 3.6 g, and had a mp of 120â121 Â°C. Anal. (C13H17NO4S) C,H.

A solution of LAH (132 mL of a 1 M solution in THF) was cooled, under He, to 0 Â°C with an external ice bath. With good stirring there was added 3.5 mL 100% H2SO4 dropwise, to minimize charring. This was followed by the addition of 8.4 g 2,5-dimethoxy-Î²-nitro-4-n-propylthiostyrene in 50 mL anhydrous THF. There was an immediate loss of color. After a few min further stirring, the temperature was brought up to a gentle reflux on the steam bath, then all was cooled again to 0 Â°C. The excess hydride was destroyed by the cautious addition of IPA (21 mL required) followed by sufficent 5% NaOH to give a white granular character to the oxides, and to assure that the reaction mixture was basic (15 mL was used). The reaction mixture was filtered and the filter cake washed first with THF and then with IPA. The filtrate and washes were combined and stripped of solvent under vacuum providing about 6 g of a pale amber oil. Without any further purification, this was distilled at 140â150 Â°C at 0.25 mm/Hg to give 4.8 g of product as a clear white oil. This was dissolved in 25 mL IPA, and neutralized with concentrated HCl forming immediate crystals of the hydrochloride salt in the alcohol solvent. An equal volume of anhydrous Et2O was added, and after complete grinding and mixing, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propylthiophenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-T-7) was removed by filtration, Et2O washed, and air dried to constant weight. The resulting spectacular white crystals weighed 5.2 g.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 20 mg) âI lay down with music, and become engrossed with being as still as possible. I feel that if I can be totally, completely still, I will hear the inner voice of the universe. As I do this, the music becomes incredibly beautiful. I see the extraordinary importance of simply listening, listening to everything, to people and to nature, with wide open receptivity. Something very, very special happens at the still point, so I keep working on it. When I become totally still, a huge burst of energy is released. And it explodes so that it takes enormous effort to quiet it all down in order to be still again. Great fun.â

(with 25 mg) âThis was a marvelous and strange evening. This 2C-T-7 is good and friendly and wonderful as I remember it. I think it is going to take the place of 2C-T-2 in my heart. It is a truly good material. I got involved with a documentary on television. It was about certain people of Bolivia, people living in the high mountains and about a small village whichâperhaps alone among all the places in the countryâmaintains the old Inca ways, the old traditions, the old language. Which is, I gather, against the law in Bolivia. It showed a yearly meeting of shamans and it was quite clear that hallucinogens played a major part in this meeting. The shaman faces, male and female, were startling in their intensity and earthy depth. The Virgin Mary is worshipped as another version of the ancient Pacha Mama, the Earth Mother. Wonderful dark, vivid look at places and people who are not usually to be seen or even known about.â

(with 30 mg) âThe visuals have an adaptable character to them. I can use them to recreate any hallucinogenic substance I have known and loved. With open eyes, I can go easily into LSD flowing visuals, or into the warm earth world of Peyote, or I can stop them altogether. With closed eyes, there are Escher-like graphics with a lot of chiaroscuro, geometric patterns with oppositional play of sculptured light and dark values. Green light.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
One Tweetio related to 2C-T-7 has been made and evaluated. This is the 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-T-7, 2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-n-propylthiophenethylamine, or 2CT7-2ETO. The benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-(n-propylthio)benzaldehyde had a melting point of 69â71 Â°C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 106â106.5 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 187â189 Â°C. At the 20 milligram level, the effects were felt quickly, and the eyes-closed visuals were modest but real. It was very short-lived, with baseline recovery at about the fifth hour. The next day there was an uncomfortable headache which seemed on an intuitive level to be an after-effect of the compound.

The unusual properties of a number of N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamines suggested the possibility of something like a similar set of N-methyl-N-isopropylphenethylamines. Why not try one from 2C-T-7? The thought was, maybe N-methylate this compound, then put on an isopropyl group with reductive alkylation, using acetone as the carbon source and sodium cyanoborohydride. Towards this end, the free base of 2C-T-7 (from one gram of the hydrochloride) was refluxed for 2 h in 1.3 g butyl formate, and on removing the solvent/reactant the residue spontaneously crystallized. This formamide (0.7 g) was reduced with lithium hydride in cold THF to provide 2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propyl-N-methylphenethylamine, METHYL-2C-T-7, which distilled at 150â170 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg. A very small amount of the hydrochloride salt was obtained (65 milligrams) and it had a brown color. Too small an amount of an impure product; the entire project was dropped.

**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-propylthiophenethylamine** (also known as **2C-T-7** , **Blue Mystic** , and **Beautiful** , among others) is a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

2C-T-7 was first synthesized by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) and documented in his book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). It is a member of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which were derived from the systematic modification of the [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) molecule.

In contrast to other members of the 2C-x family, 2C-T-7 has gained a reputation of being an unpredictable, dose-sensitive psychedelic capable of producing strong visual effects and an intense [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) , which can manifest as a dangerous delirium in extreme cases. Many reports indicate that the physical effects are too severe for inexperienced users or those with pre-existing medical conditions.

This particular compound is part of the so-called "magical half-dozen" which refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which -- with the exception of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) -- he designed, synthesized and tested on himself. They can be found within the first book of PiHKAL, and are as follows: [Mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and 2C-T-7 .

## Chemistry

2C-T-7, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylthiophenethylamine, is a [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain.

2C-T-7 belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines, which contain methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 of the benzene ring. 2C-T-7 is also substituted at R 4 with a propyl thioether group.

2C-T-7 is analogous to 2C-T-2; the two differ by the length of the alkane chain in their thioether functional group.

## Pharmacology

2C-T-7's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects have been shown to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

With serious adverse effects seen on overdoses of this compound (potentially [Serotonin Syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_Syndrome) ) and as the 2,5-desmethoxy derivative of 2C-T-7 has been shown to be a moderate monoamine oxidase A inhibitor and many of the amphetamine-analogs of the [2C-T-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-x) series are highly selective MAO-A inhibitors (with [ALEPH-7](/w/index.php?title=ALEPH-7&action=edit&redlink=1) being one of the most potent) , this substance is widely thought to also have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 2C-T-7 is generally considered to be energetic and stimulating in a fashion is comparable to that of other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) . However, at certain doses and contexts, it may produce periods of notable [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-T-7 is intense, but in comparison to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , it can be considered mild though is still capable of becoming very powerful and highly physically euphoric. It is similar yet distinct from the "body high" experienced on [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , and [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as intense and will manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Although this component is capable of manifesting itself in a distinct and noticeable fashion, for most users it does not generally seem to be as apparent or intense as the same component found within [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) .

- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and extremely realistic in style but with a subtle digital/cartoonish form.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocetin) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. It gives off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel with slightly more mystical and shamanic undertones in comparison to other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . At higher dosages, they are equally likely to result in states of [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry or [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) . There seems to be a visual geometry that is extremely similar to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) and can be described as equal in intensity or complexity and equal in proportion to the accompanying cognitive and physical effects.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
2C-T-7 produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) family. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 2C-T-7 is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. 
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 2C-T-7](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CT7.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

As of August 2007, there have been at least three reported deaths associated with the use of 2C-T-7. These incidents occurred with insufflated doses of 30 mg or more , or in combination with stimulants such as MDMA, [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . There have also been a number of reports describing concerning physical side effects and hospitalizations, typically following insufflation.

It is strongly discouraged to administer 2C-T-7 non-orally because this can cause vomiting, numerous negative side effects, or death at high doses. In Erowid's Fall 2000 2C-T-7 survey, it was reported that the [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) of 2C-T-7 resulted in more negative side effects than oral administration. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

2C-T-7 is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-T-7 is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-T-7 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-T-7 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

If 2C-T-7 does have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects as commonly speculated, this could indicate that 2C-T-7 is more likely to induce [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or general [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) overload (especially at high dosages) than other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) . This may make it dangerous to combine it with other [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and certain substances which releases neurotransmitters such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) or [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . These substances include but are not limited to:

  "wikipedia": `# 2C-T-7
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-T-7*

2C-T-7, also known as 4-propylthio-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine or as Blue Mystic or 7th Heaven, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is taken orally.
2C-T-7 was first described in the scientific literature by Myron Stolaroff in 1990. It was developed by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues and was described in greater detail by them in 1991, including in Shulgin's book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists 2C-T-7's dose range as 10 to 30 mg orally and its duration as 8 to 15 hours. It produces psychedelic effects. In PiHKAL, Shulgin records that the hallucinations it produces are unique, and that the chemical may cause muscle tension and an altered vocal quality. Shulgin rated it as one of the "magical half-dozen" most important psychedelic phenethylamines, together with mescaline, 2C-B, and 2C-T-2.

## Interactions

2C-T-7 is metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C-T-7. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity.

## Toxicity and deaths

There have been at least three reported deaths related to 2C-T-7 use as of August 2007, mainly at insufflated (snorted) doses of 30 mg or more. In the fall of 2000, a young healthy male died following insufflation of an excessive amount of 2C-T-7. Two additional deaths reported in April 2001 have been linked to 2C-T-7. These two deaths were reported by the DEA as being the result of the co-abuse of 2C-T-7 with MDMA.
In January 2002, Rolling Stone published an article about 2C-T-7 entitled "The New (legal) Killer Drug". Although the article suggested that the drug was legal, the legal status of 2C-T-7 was ambiguous at the time due to the United States' Federal Analogue Act. A detailed response on the website disinfo.com challenged the accuracy of much of the reporting in the aforementioned Rolling Stone article. 2C-T-7 has since been officially made illegal and declared a schedule 1 substance in the United States.
The Partnership for a Drug-Free America reported in 2006 that 2C-T-7 can be lethal even in small doses; however, they provide no source for their claim and of the three known deaths (as of August 2007) of 2C-T-7 intoxicated individuals, all involved either uncommonly large insufflated doses or the concomitant ingestion of other stimulants such as ephedrine and/or MDMA.
All of the three aforementioned known deaths of individuals under the influence of 2C-T-7 occurred in those known to be either intoxicated with other stimulants such as ephedrine or MDMA (which are known to be potentially lethal in certain situations or at excessive doses) or after the individual insufflated an amount of 2C-T-7 much greater than necessary to induce the full range of effects typically sought after by users of the drug; for example, the reported 35 mg insufflated dose taken by the individual who died in the fall of 2000. This reported dose was characterized as "excessive" by the United States DEA.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-T-7 is a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist, among other interactions. The mechanism that produces the psychedelic effects of 2C-T-7 is most likely to result from serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by most currently-known hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines. 2C-T-7 has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to those of 2C-T-2.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-T-7 has been described.

## History

2C-T-7 was first described in the scientific literature by Myron Stolaroff by 1990. It was developed by Alexander Shulgin and Peyton Jacob III. Subsequently, 2C-T-7 was described in greater detail by Shulgin and colleagues in 1991.
Up until Operation Web Tryp and three deaths, two of which involved the use of other drugs in addition to 2C-T-7, and one which involved an excessive insufflated dose, 2C-T-7 was sold commercially in Dutch and Japanese smartshops and online.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

Around the year 2000, 2C-T-7 began to change from an obscure chemical to a drug used at parties and clubs in North America and Europe as it became available through a number of grey-market commercial vendors. This aroused the attention of the authorities, and many countries have since scheduled the chemical.

#### Australia

In Australia, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 are covered by the country's analogue drug laws.

#### Canada

As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-7 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

#### China

As of October 2015 2C-T-7 is a controlled substance in China.

#### Finland

2C-T-7 is scheduled in the "government decree on substances, preparations and plants considered to be narcotic drugs".

#### Germany

2C-T-7 is scheduled in Germany. (BTMG)

#### Netherlands

The Netherlands was the first country in the world to ban 2C-T-7, after being sold in smartshops for a short period. After 2C-T-2 was first banned, 2C-T-7 quickly appeared on the market, but was soon banned as well. 2C-T-7 is a list I drug of the Opium Law.

#### Sweden

Schedule I in Sweden. 2C-T-7 was first classified as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of April 1, 1999, under SFS 1999:58 that made it illegal to sell or possess.

#### United Kingdom

In 1999, Alexander Shulgin was sent a copy of a letter from the British Home Office to several of its administrative associates that in effect placed all compounds listed in PiHKAL into Class A.

#### United States

On September 20, 2002, 2C-T-7 was classified as a Schedule I substance in the United States by an emergency ruling by the DEA. On March 18, 2004, the DEA published a Final Rule in the Federal Register permanently placing 2C-T-7 in Schedule I. (69 FR 12794)
As of April 2024, law enforcement have encountered 2C-T-7 in 16 states, with the highest number of encounters being in Florida. Purchases made over the internet are believed by the DEA to be the most common source by which users of the drug acquire it in the United States, and one laboratory manufacturing the drug was discovered by police in Las Vegas, Nevada.
