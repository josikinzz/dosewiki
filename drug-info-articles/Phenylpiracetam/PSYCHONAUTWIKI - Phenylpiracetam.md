**Phenylpiracetam** (also known as **Phenotropil** and **Carphedon** ) is a central nervous system [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) agent belonging to the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family of drugs. Although it is one of the first derivatives of [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) to be synthesized and documented, research into its properties and efficacy in humans is limited.

Phenylpiracetam is readily available and sold through online vendors as a dietary supplement in the United States. Dosages are commonly reported to be around nearly twelve times those of [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , making it less potent while offering comparable benefit.

Supplementation of phenylpiracetam tends to be in the dosage range of 100 - 300 mg taken over the course of a day, either in two to three evenly spread dosing periods (such as three doses of 100mg or 200mg).

Phenylpiracetam has protected against [scopolamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Datura) -induced amnesia both in rat populations, suggesting it can aid recovery from [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) intoxication and other typically cognitively impaired states by preserving adequate levels of [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) as a primary mechanism.

Many people report that phenylpiracetam effects (especially stimulation) are more pronounced than other racetams. That may be due phenypiracetam's action as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor.

## Chemistry

Phenylpiracetam is based on the [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) molecular skeleton with an additional phenyl group attached to the pyrrolidone nucleus, albeit at a different steric location than the substituted phenyl groups observed on [aniracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Aniracetam) or [nefiracetam](/w/index.php?title=Nefiracetam&action=edit&redlink=1) . Due to the chiral center at the fourth position of the pyrrolidinone ring, it can exist in an S or R-isomer; the clinically used form is the racemic mixture.

## Pharmacology

Phenylpiracetam is thought to increase [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) release within hippocampal cells. As acetycholine is involved in the function of memory, this could potentially account for its reported [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects.

Phenylpiracetam appears to have a series of trials conducted on it showing improvement in cognition in persons with cognitive decline from organic causes, with one study noting a minor improvement in cognition in those with youth epilepsy.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

In comparison to the effects of other nootropics such as [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , this compound can be described as focusing primarily on cognitive focus over that of cognitive stimulation.
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - The stimulation which phenylpiracetam presents in common doses can be considered as primarily subtle, comparable to that of [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , although in heavy doses it can be uncomfortably overstimulating.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This may be a result of the dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This effect is relatively mild compared to other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - This is more prominent at higher doses. It can be promoted by redosing multiple times.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Sensory effects
 
- Although these effects are not universal, certain people may experience sensory enhancements under the influence of this compound. 
- **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- In terms of its cognitive effects, this compound can be described as a stimulating. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Cognitive dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria)** - This effect typically only occurs at extremely high dosages. ### After effects
 
- - **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

Several studies suggest that this substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time although it is worth noting that the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Anecdotal evidence from those within the community who have tried phenylpiracetam suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Lethal dosage

The median lethal dosage ( [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) ) of phenylpiracetam has not been officially published as it has low abuse potential, but is not known to be harmful when exceeding the recommended dosage range.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of phenylpiracetam can be considered as non-addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among users, although this fact has not been corroborated by clinical studies. Tolerance to many of the effects of phenylpiracetam develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Phenylpiracetam may presents cross-tolerance with all [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , meaning that after the consumption of phenylpiracetam certain nootropics such as [aniracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Aniracetam) and [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) may have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Phenylpiracetam, being a member of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family, currently is legally available to buy and sell in most countries, but may still vary by region.

- **United Kingdom** - It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.
