# Hydrocodone
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00956*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic.

### Background

Hydrocodone is a synthetic opioid derivative of codeine.
14
It is commonly used in combination with
acetaminophen
to control moderate to severe pain. Historically, hydrocodone has been used as a cough suppressant although this has largely been replaced by
dextromethorphan
in current cough and cold formulations. Hydrocodone's more potent metabolite,
hydromorphone
has also found wide use as an analgesic and is frequently used in cases of severe pain. The FDA first approved Hydrocodone for use as part of the cough suppressant syrup Hycodan in March of 1943.
17

### Indication

Hydrocodone is indicated for the management of acute pain, sometimes in combination with
acetaminophen
or
ibuprofen
, as well as the symptomatic treatment of the common cold and allergic rhinitis in combination with decongestants, antihistamines, and expectorants.

### Pharmacodynamics

Hydrocodone inhibits pain signaling in both the spinal cord and brain
12
. Its actions in the brain also produce euphoria, respiratory depression, and sedation.

### Mechanism of Action

Mu-type opioid receptor
Agonist
Delta-type opioid receptor
Agonist

### Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of hydrocodone has not been characterized due to lack of an IV formulation. The liquid formulations of hydrocodone have a Tmax of 0.83-1.33 h.
3
,
5
The extended release tablet formulations have a Tmax of 14-16 h.
Label
The Cmax remains dose proportional over the range of 2.5-10 mg in liquid formulations and 20-120 mg in extended release formulations.
3
,
5
,
Label
Administration with food increases Cmax by about 27% while Tmax and AUC remain the same.
6
Administration with 40% ethanol has been observed to increase Cmax 2-fold with an approximate 20% increase in AUC with no change in Tmax. 20% alcohol produces no significant effect.

### Metabolism

Hydrocodone undergoes oxidative O-demethylation to form
hydromorphone
, a more potent active metabolite.
8
Though hydromorphone is active it is not present in sufficient quantities to contribute significantly to hydrocodone's therapeutic effects.
1
Both hydrocodone and hydromorphone form 6-α- and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites through 6-ketoreduction. The hydroxy metabolites and hydromorphone can form glucuronide conjugates. Hydrocodone also undergoes oxidative N-demthylation to norhydrocodone. O-demethylation is primarily catalyzed by CYP2D6 while N-demethylation is primarily CYP3A4.

### Toxicity

Overdosage with hydrocodone presents as opioid intoxication including respiratory depression, somnolence, coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death.
15
In case of oversdosage the foremost priority is the maintenance of a patent and protected airway with the provision of assisted ventilation if necessary. Supportive measures such as IV fluids, supplemental oxygen, and vasopressors may be used to manage circulatory shock.
15
Advanced life support may be necessary in the case of cardiac arrest or arrhythmias. Opioid antagonists such as
naloxone
may be used to reverse the respiratory and circulatory effects of hydrocodone. Emergency monitoring is still required after naloxone administration as the opioid effects may reappear. Additionally, if used in an opioid tolerant patient, naloxone may produce opioid withdrawal symptoms.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
1,2-Benzodiazepine may increase the central nervous system depressant (CNS depressant) activities of Hydrocodone.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Hydrocodone can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Hydrocodone can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Hydrocodone can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.
Acebutolol
The metabolism of Hydrocodone can be decreased when combined with Acebutolol.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Profound CNS depression, including sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may occur.
Take with or without food. Cmax and AUC are not altered by food in a clinically significant way.

### Mechanism of action

Hydrocodone binds to the mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the highest affinity followed by the delta opioid receptors (DOR).
13
Hydrocodone's agonist effect at the MOR is considered to contribute the most to its analgesic effects. Both MOR and DOR are Gi/o coupled and and produces its signal through activation of inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels, inhibition of voltage gated calcium channel opening, and decreased adenylyl cyclase activity.
14
In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, activation of pre-synaptic MOR on primary afferents the inhibition of calcium channel opening and increased activity of GIRK channels hyperpolarizes the neuron and prevents release of neurotransmitters. Post-synaptic MOR can also prevent activation of neurons by glutamate through the aforementioned mechanisms.
Hydrocodone can also produce several actions in the brain similarly to other opioids. 
Activation of MOR in the periaquaductal gray (PAG) inhibits the GABAergic tone on medulo-spinal neurons.
14
,
12
This allows these neurons, which project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, to suppress pain signalling in secondary afferents by activating inhibitory interneurons. MOR can also inhibit GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, removing the inhibitory tone on dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens and contributing to the activation of the brain's reward and addiction pathway. The inhibitory action or MOR likely contributes to respiratory depression, sedation, and suppression of the cough reflex.
Activation of DOR may contribute to analgesia through the above mechanisms but has not been well studied.

### Volume of distribution

The apparent volume of distribution ranges widely in published literature. The official FDA labeling reports a value of 402 L.
Label
Pharmacokinetic studies report values from 210-714 L with higher values associated with higher doses or single dose studies and lower values associated with lower doses and multiple dose studies.
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
Hydrocodone has been observed in human breast milk at levels equivalent to 1.6% of the maternal dosage.
11
Only 12 of the 30 women studied had detectable concentrations of hydromorphone at mean levels of 0.3 mcg/kg/day.

### Protein binding

Hydrocodone is 36% bound to plasma proteins.
Label

### Route of elimination

Most hydrocodone appears to be eliminated via a non-renal route as renal clearance is substantially lower than total apparent clearance.
Label
Hepatic metabolism may account for a portion of this, however the slight increase in serum concentration and AUC seen in hepatic impairment indicates a different primary route of elimination.

### Clearance

Official FDA labeling reports an apparent clearance of 83 L/h.
Label
Pharmacokinetic studies report values ranging from 24.5-58.8 L/h largely dependent on CYP2D6 metabolizer status.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Hydroxylates PUFA specifically at the omega-1 position (PubMed:18577768). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA (PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Responsible for the metabolism of a number of therapeutic agents such as the anticonvulsant drug S-mephenytoin, omeprazole, proguanil, certain barbiturates, diazepam, propranolol, citalopram and imipramine. Hydroxylates fenbendazole at the 4' position (PubMed:23959307)
