## Overview

### Background

Adrafinil is a mild central nervous system stimulating drug typically employed to relieve excessive sleepiness and inattention in geriatric patients. It is also been used off-label to prevent fatigue or falling asleep for extended periods of time. Adrafinil does not currently have FDA approval and is thus unregulated in the United States. It was marketed in France and elsewhere in Europe under the trade name Olmifon until September 2011 when France's FDA equivalent reassessed the drug and withdrew marketing permission. Adrafinil is metabolized to
modafinil
.

### Indication

Used to relieve excessive sleepiness and inattention in elderly patients.

### Pharmacodynamics

Adrafinil is a prodrug; it is primarily metabolized in vivo to modafinil, resulting in nearly identical pharmacological effects. Unlike modafinil, the active metabolite must accumulate before the drug is able to act. Oral adrafinil without food usually begins to act within 45 minutes to 1 hour.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Acebutolol
The therapeutic efficacy of Adrafinil can be decreased when used in combination with Acebutolol.
Aceclofenac
The risk or severity of hypertension can be increased when Aceclofenac is combined with Adrafinil.

**Adrafinil Side Effects and Contraindications** 
 Collected & Translated by Erowid (October 31, 2001) 
 Based on information from [BIAM](http://www2.biam2.org/www/Sub1545.html) (french) 
---
 
 Adrafinil (and its close cousin [Modafinil](https://erowid.org/../modafinil/modafinil.shtml) ) have side effects and contraindications similar to other stimulants. Some of Adrafinil's side-effects can include: 
 
- Overstimulation - transitory, discontinue administration
- Confusion - transitory, discontinue administration
- Aggression - transitory, discontinue administration
- Intestinal discomfort / pain
- Skin Infections
- Mania, especially in people with predisposition, bipolar disorder
- Lack of Anticholinergic effects in rats (Rambert FA, J Pharmacol 1986)
 
 Contraindications 
 
 
- Epilepsy
- Liver Disease / Dysfunction
- Sever Renal Disorders
- Professional Athelets (disallowed by rules)
 
 Not considered teratogenic in animals (has not been shown to cause damage to developing fetuses). 
 
 The originating document on the french pharmaceutical database does not have any references. We believe that most of the side effects listed are based at least partially on the side effects which have been more thoroughly documented for Adrafinil's close relative Modafinil. As of October 31, 2001 PubMed db had only 14 journal references on the search term "adrafinil". Pubmed had over 150 references on the search term "modafinil". None of the Adrafinil papers appeared to document clearly the side effects profile in humans. We aren't really sure where the BIAM got their data.

**Adrafinil** (also known as **Olmifon** ) is a prodrug for [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) - a wakefulness-promoting agent (eugeroic) with [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects. Adrafinil is metabolized in the liver to produce modafinil. Both are stimulants with no amphetamine-like effects. Safety information on adrafinil is lacking because modafinil is often used instead, for treatment of narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. Long-term supplementation of adrafinil is not advised, since adrafinil is metabolized into modafinil in the liver, and may stress the liver through elevated liver enzymes with prolonged use.

## Chemistry

Adrafinil is very structurally similar to its close chemical cousin and bioactive metabolite, modafinil. The only structural difference is that terminal amide hydroxyl group of adrafinil ((diphenylmethyl)sulﬁnyl-2 acetohydroxamic acid) is lacking in modafinil (diphenylmethyl)sulﬁnyl-2 acetamide).

## Pharmacology

The mechanism of adrafinil appears to rely on postsynaptic α-adrenergic activity since an increase in locomotion caused by adrafinil is blocked by prazosin (α1 antagonist), yohimbine (α2 antagonist), or phenoxybenzamine (mixed α-antagonist). These increases through adrenergic neurotransmission are thought to be responsible for adrafinil's energetic properties.

Orally ingested adrafinil may undergo one of two metabolic results. The main metabolite is the active modafinil, which is itself metabolized to inactive modafinilic acid and modafinil sulfone. Adrafinil, however, can also be metabolized directly to inactive modafinilic acid without conversion to modafinil. This may account for its lower potency.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

The long-term safety and effectiveness of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) (adrafinil's active component) as a drug of regular usage have not been determined. Anecdotal reports from people who have tried modafinil within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

Adrafinil is more harmful than [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) due to slight hepatotoxicity, as adrafinil must be processed by the liver. Stomach pain, skin irritation, anxiety, and elevated liver enzymes may occur with prolonged use and have been associated with Adrafinil, specifically.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of adrafinil can be considered as not addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among most users. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Tolerance to many of the effects of adrafinil develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Adrafinil may present a cross-tolerance with all [benzhydryl](/w/index.php?title=Benzhydryl&action=edit&redlink=1) [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , meaning that after the consumption of adrafinil, all related eugeroic compounds such as [armodafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Armodafinil) and [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) will display a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Unlike [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , adrafinil is legal to sell and possess without a prescription in most countries. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Adrafinil, sold under the brand name Olmifon, is a wakefulness-promoting medication that was formerly used in France to improve alertness, attention, wakefulness, and mood, particularly in the elderly. It was also used off-label by individuals who wished to avoid fatigue, such as night workers or others who needed to stay awake and alert for long periods of time. Additionally, the medication has been used non-medically as a novel vigilance-promoting agent.
Adrafinil is a prodrug; it is primarily metabolized in vivo to modafinil, resulting in very similar pharmacological effects. Unlike modafinil, however, it takes time for the metabolite to accumulate to active levels in the bloodstream. Effects usually are apparent within 45–60 minutes when taken orally on an empty stomach.
Adrafinil was marketed in France until September 2011 when it was voluntarily discontinued due to an unfavorable risk–benefit ratio.

## Medical uses

Adrafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent and was used to promote alertness, attention, wakefulness, and mood. It was particularly used in the elderly.

### Available forms

Adrafinil was available in the form of 300 mg oral tablets.

## Side effects

There is a case report of two patients that adrafinil may increase interest in sex.
A case report of adrafinil-induced orofacial dyskinesia exists. Reports of this side effect also exist for modafinil.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Because α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists were found to block effects of adrafinil and modafinil in animals, "most investigators assume[d] that adrafinil and modafinil both serve as α1-adrenergic receptor agonists." However, adrafinil and modafinil have not been found to bind to the α1-adrenergic receptor and they lack peripheral sympathomimetic side effects associated with activation of this receptor; hence, the evidence in support of this hypothesis is weak, and other mechanisms are probable. Modafinil was subsequently screened at a variety of targets in 2009 and was found to act as a weak, atypical blocker of the dopamine transporter (and hence as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor), and this action may explain some or all of its pharmacological effects. Relative to adrafinil, modafinil possesses greater specificity in its action, lacking or having a reduced incidence of many of the common side effects of the former (including stomach pain, skin irritation, anxiety, and elevated liver enzymes with prolonged use).

### Pharmacokinetics

In addition to modafinil, adrafinil also produces modafinil acid (CRL-40467) and modafinil sulfone (CRL-41056) as metabolites, which form from metabolic modification of modafinil.

## Chemistry

Adrafinil is the N-hydroxylated analogue of modafinil and is also known as N-hydroxymodafinil.
Analogues of adrafinil include modafinil, armodafinil, CRL-40,940, CRL-40,941, and fluorenol, among others.

## History

Adrafinil was discovered in 1974 by two chemists working for the French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Lafon who were screening compounds in search of analgesics. Pharmacological studies of adrafinil instead revealed psychostimulant-like effects such as hyperactivity and wakefulness in animals. The substance was first tested in humans, specifically for the treatment of narcolepsy, in 1977–1978. Introduced by Lafon (now Cephalon), it reached the market in France in 1984, and for the treatment of narcolepsy in 1985.
In 1976, two years after the discovery of adrafinil, its active metabolite  modafinil was discovered. Modafinil appeared to be more potent than adrafinil in animal studies, and was selected for further clinical development, with both adrafinil and modafinil eventually reaching the market. Modafinil was first approved in France in 1994, and then in the United States in 1998. Lafon was acquired by Cephalon in 2001. As of September 2011, Cephalon has discontinued Olmifon, its adrafinil product, while modafinil continues to be marketed.

## Society and culture

### Names

Adrafinil is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. It is also known by its brand name Olmifon and its developmental code name CRL-40028.

### Regulation

#### Athletic doping

Adrafinil and its active metabolite modafinil were added to the list of substances prohibited for athletic competition according to World Anti-Doping Agency in 2004.

#### Additive in United States dietary supplements

Adrafinil is sometimes included as an ingredient in misbranded or adulterated dietary supplements. One company had attempted to get a New Dietary Ingredient pre-market notification approved for adrafinil in 2017, but the Food and Drug Administration rejected it:

“For the reasons discussed above, the information in [this pre-market] notification is incomplete and does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that ‘Adrafinil’...will reasonably be expected to be safe. Therefore, [such] product may be adulterated under 21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(B)...Introduction of such a product into interstate commerce is prohibited under 21U.S.C.§331(a) and (v)”.
A position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug was indicated in a warning letter by the FDA in 2019:

“Your [particular] products [subject to this warning] [including] Adrafinil…are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are 'new drugs' under section 201(p) of the Act. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA...”
A position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug was also indicated by FDA in a press release regarding a criminal action undertaken in 2019:

“[Defendant in the 2019 enforcement action] falsely represented these drugs as legal to sell in the United States. In fact, these are drugs that were illegally imported into the United States and illegal to sell in the United States because they are not approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration... Some of the illegal drugs [defendant] was selling include the following...Adrafinil...”
FDA indicated a position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug in later criminal action undertaken during 2022: “[The defendants in a 2022 enforcement action] also illegally sold multiple other unapproved and misbranded drugs, including adrafinil crystalline powder...” Most recently in 2023, the FDA fined an Arizona company 2.4 million U.S. dollars for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce:

Between April 2017 and December 2021, [defendant company in 2023 enforcement action] and [its executive] marketed pharmaceutical drugs, including tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams, on [its website] and online platforms...They sold the drugs to customers across the United States. [Company] employees and [the company's executive] also regularly made representations about the company’s drugs through a [online] forum dedicated to [defendant company's products] products.  As part of the plea, [the defendant] has agreed to forfeit \$2.4 million. [The defendant] has also agreed to forfeit all tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams seized by the FDA and Customs and Border Protection.
FDA has not approved drugs containing tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams for use in the United States. Racetam drugs include piracetam, aniracetam, and coluracetam, and phenylpiracetam."
Certain products, formulated with adrafinil in them, have been listed as subject to a May 2023 import alert by Food and Drug Administration because they are considered as containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient.
Adrafinil containing products, purporting to be dietary supplements, are not allowed for use by military service members. This is because the Department of Defense considers adrafinil an unapproved drug.

#### New Zealand

In 2005 a Medical Classification Committee in New Zealand recommended to MEDSAFE NZ that adrafinil be classified as a prescription medicine due to risks of it being used as a party drug.  At that time adrafinil was not scheduled in New Zealand.

## Research

In a clinical trial with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine and placebo as comparators, adrafinil showed efficacy in the treatment of depression. In contrast to clomipramine however, adrafinil was well-tolerated, and showed greater improvement in psychomotor retardation in comparison. The authors concluded that further investigation of the potential antidepressant effects of adrafinil were warranted.
