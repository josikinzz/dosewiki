## SYNTHESIS
To a stirred suspension of 0.50 g LAH in 10 mL anhydrous THF, stirred, under nitrogen and at room temperature, there was added a solution of 0.66 g 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N,N-dipropylglyoxylamide in 10 mL anhydrous THF. This was added dropwise at a rate that maintained the reaction at reflux. When the addition was complete, the reflux was maintained for an additional 15 min and then the reaction was cooled to 40 Â°C. The excess hydride and the product complex was destroyed by the addition of 1 mL EtOAc followed by 3 mL H2O. The solids were removed by filtration, the filter cake washed with THF, the filtrate and washings pooled, and the solvents removed under vacuum. The residue was distilled at the KugelRohr and the distillate recrystallized from EtOAc/hexane. Thus there was obtained 0.27 g (51%) of 4-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyltryptamine (4-HO-DPT) with a mp 96â97 Â°C. Anal: C,H,N.

**4-HO-DPT** (also known as **4-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyltryptamine** and sometimes referred to as **Procin** ) is a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Alexander Shulgin first synthesized 4-HO-DPT and documented it in his book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ( *Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved* ). It is the 4-hydroxyl analog of [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) .

Today it is either used recreationally or as an [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) compound and is typically acquired through the use of online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors. Due to the difficulty of its synthesis, it remains relatively uncommon even for a substituted tryptamine and has very little history of human usage.

## Chemistry

4-HO-DPT, or 4-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-DPT is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxyl functional group OH−. It also contains two propyl chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone ( [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) ).

4-HO-DPT is a 4-hydroxy analog of [4-AcO-DPT](/w/index.php?title=4-AcO-DPT&action=edit&redlink=1) and the N-substituted dipropyl homolog of [psilocin (4-HO-DMT)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) .

## Pharmacology

Like with most [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) tryptamines, 4-HO-DPT is thought to act principally as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The psychedelic effects are believed to come from 4-HO-DPT's binding efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

In comparison to other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) such as [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) and [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) , it is extremely similar in terms of its visual, cognitive and physical effects although it feels somewhat less natural and slightly more synthetic. It is also worth noting that it lacks the extremely uncomfortable physical side effects which are present within its close structural relative [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) . This allows it to feel far more similar to that of a generic or classical substituted tryptamine such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-HO-DPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-HO-DPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried 4-HO-DPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-HO-DPT is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with regular consumption. Like with most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , it is most often thought to be self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-HO-DPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-HO-DPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-HO-DPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-HO-DPT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

Due to its relative obscurity, 4-HO-DPT is unscheduled in most countries.

- **Germany** : 4-HO-DPT is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of 4-HO-DPT are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Sweden** : 4-HO-DPT is classified as a "dangerous substance" , which means it requires a special permit to buy or sell. It is, however, not yet classified as a drug.
- **Switzerland** : 4-HO-DPT is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United Kingdom** : 4-HO-DPT is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : 4-HO-DPT is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) (which is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act). As such, the sale for human consumption or could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-HO-DPT*

4-HO-DPT, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyltryptamine or as deprocin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families related to psilocin (4-HO-DMT). It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It produces psychedelic-like effects in animals. The drug is closely structurally related to other psychedelic tryptamines such as dipropyltryptamine (DPT), 5-MeO-DPT, and psilocin (4-HO-DMT), among others.
4-HO-DPT was first described in the scientific literature by David Repke and colleagues in 1977. It was encountered as a novel designer drug in 2012. A presumed prodrug, 4-AcO-DPT, is also known, and has likewise been encountered as a designer drug.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, the dose and duration of 4-HO-DPT are unknown. At a dose of 20 mg orally, there were possibly threshold effects and nothing more. Per Shulgin, there were not enough observations to know what dose would result in activity or what the effects would be. However, the occurrence of threshold effects at a dose of 20 mg was suggestive that "something is nearby".
Subsequently, 4-HO-DPT and its presumed prodrug 4-AcO-DPT have been encountered as novel designer drugs, substantiating the notion that more significant effects do indeed occur with 4-HO-DPT at sufficiently high doses. Based on user reports, 4-HO-DPT has an onset of 15 to 45 minutes, a duration of 5 to 8 hours, and produces hallucinogenic effects including psychedelic visuals among others.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-HO-DPT acts as a high-efficacy partial agonist to full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It has more than two orders of magnitude greater potency as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors than as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Hence, it shows considerable selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor.
Compared to psilocin (4-HO-DMT), 4-HO-DPT has about the same potency and efficacy as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist, has about the same potency but is much more efficacious as a serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonist (EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy = 39% vs. 94%, respectively), and has about the same efficacy but approximately 10-fold lower potency as a serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonist.
4-HO-DPT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. Its potency for inducing the head-twitch response in mice is about 4- or 5-fold lower than that of psilocin.

### Pharmacokinetics

The metabolism of 4-HO-DPT has not been studied.

## Chemistry

4-HO-DPT, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine derivative related to psilocin (4-HO-DMT).

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 4-HO-DPT has been described. It is said to be difficult to make.

### Crystal structure

In 2019, Chadeayne and colleagues solved the crystal structure of the fumarate salt of 4-HO-DPT. The authors describe the structure as follows: "The asymmetric unit contains one 4-HO-DPT cation, protonated at the dipropylamine N atom. There are also two independent water molecules, and half of a fumarate ion present."

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-HO-DPT include dipropyltryptamine (DPT), 5-MeO-DPT, psilocin (4-HO-DMT), 4-HO-DET, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-EPT, 4-HO-PiPT, and 5-HO-DPT, among others. 4-AcO-DPT is a presumed prodrug of 4-HO-DPT.

## History

4-HO-DPT was first described in the scientific literature by David Repke and colleagues in 1977. Subsequently, it was described in further detail by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2012.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Germany

4-HO-DPT is controlled in Germany under the Neue-psychoaktive-Stoffe-Gesetz (NpSG; New Psychoactive Substances Act) as of July 2019.

#### Sweden

4-HO-DPT is classified as a "dangerous substance" Sweden, which means that it cannot be legally bought or sold without a special permit, though it is still not yet an illegal drug.

#### Switzerland

4-HO-DPT is a controlled substance in Switzerland as of 2020.

#### United Kingdom

4-HO-DPT is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom, as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.

#### United States

4-HO-DPT is not an explicitly controlled substance in the United States. However, the drug is a close analogue of psilocin (4-HO-DMT), which is a Schedule I controlled substance in this country, and hence sale for intended human consumption could be illegal under the Federal Analogue Act.
