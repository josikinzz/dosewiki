(The below quoted posts were recovered from an accidentally deleted one-page EPT thread that came before this one:


A vendor has been sending out samples sof this rare tryptamine and I ran find next to nothing on it. I brought this question here because I respect the insight this community holds on issues like this. What do you guys think of this substitution? Interesting none the less. The reports have been fairly positive. The same vedor also say they will be realeasing 1A-DMT and I have heard absolutely nothing about that one as well. What do you guys think of these obscure tryptamines?

The DOx family seems to have some things making tjier way more public soon again like DOET and DOPR but those durations seem wild and I don't have time for that often these days. I do wish there were more good PEA's that were coming out as well though, too.

Well, I am excited to see it around! That 1A-DMT should be interesting too, particularly in terms of seeing how the research chemical scene reacts to a sudden surge of essentially technically legal, easily obtainable DMT....

> And yeah, personally, the 4-substitutions are the reason I keep coming back.  I am interested in trying base DMT analogues for the experience and sake of understanding more about the interrelationships between these molecules, but in my experience so far adding on that 4-HO or 4-AcO substitution consistently has increased the hallucinogenic, psychological, and emotional effects, duration, and potency and decreased the nausea and physical disorientation of each base that I have tried both types of (DMT, MiPT, DiPT, and DALT), so I rarely ever find myself desiring the base more than the 4-substitution. MiPT is the only exception some days at the moment, and it's mostly because I find it a lot more unique compared to 4-HO-MiPT than DMT, DiPT, and DALT are to their counterparts.

They both were also the longest lasting of any of the 4-substitutions for me.

Hopefully one day I will be able to find out for sure!

There are still a good number of creations of Dr. Shulgin's that I would love to try, and a few minor things that have received human trials and are using reasonable substitutions (2C-TFE comes to mind), but anything like these new derivatives hitting the market I'll probably always be too terrified to try, and they don't really seem to be particularly worthwhile from the reports anyway.

Personally, one I would be very excited to see in that regard would be 1A-DET. I would be so happy if that one ever made the rounds!

I've rationed my budget towards other tryptamines instead for the last couple of years, but I really do hope to have a go with it while it's still available. That and 5-MeO-MET I've been thinking lately might have the potential to really be things I would love, so I don't want to miss my chance with either! And good luck with your goals as well.

There are a staggering array of possible phenethylamine psychedelics that have yet to be made available or explored or even synthesized, and likely whole areas we haven't even come across yet. I can't imagine that no one will ever move away from the NBOMe/NBOH/etc grouping again, that seems highly unlikely.

> The 1A-trypt stuff isn't really on-topic but it's interesting. I actually thought of that pretty soon after 1P-LSD was announced and the obvious ALD comparisons came with it. What I wondered then, and still do now is how 1A- or 1P-DMT type trypts should be administered? With the lysergamides the 1-acyl itself is not active according to Nichols, it's doubtful they are for the tryptamines - or at least with effective potency. So, if you smoke or inject 1-acyl-DMT, does the 1-acyl fall off quickly enough for there to be a psychedelic flash before it's gobbled by MAO? Is MAO breakdown inhibited by the 1-acyl? If you must take it orally, will it be active without MAOI?

Thus far only samples have been released but they said a larger synth is in most likely in production due the favorable response in the few reports. I hope more people who have sampled it post reports somewhere soon.

At that dose snorted, it actually reminded me a lot of of maybe 30 mg DMT smoked. Just a little longer come up and duration. It didn't have that shaky stimulating feeling like DPT though, but it was more like DPT than DMT in the sense, that weren't that feeling of some kind of alien presence. It was very smooth and more potent than I'd expected. Definitely something I'll be taking again. Higher doses would definitely have to be taken at home, and I'm sure walking could become very difficult. I don't doubt this one has the power to detach you from your body.

I searched the psychedelic drug index and found 4-HO-EPT, but not plain EPT. Now it has recently surfaced on the grey market. Any experiences yet?

Weird, there was definitely a B&D EPT thread but it seems to have been deleted. EPT has been around for a few years and there are some trip reports. I tried it a few times and thought it wasn't that great compared to the other simple tryptamines.

Can you report a little bit more, please? Especially on dosage, form of administration and duration. Which other (simple) tryptmines you would compare it to?

The dosage and duration are similar to the other tryptamines. I think I tried it in the 15-25 mg range, snorted and vaporized in an oil burner. I've also tried DMT, MET, MPT, MiPT, MALT, DPT, and DiPT. They all share similarities but I think I would compare it most to MALT, because they both have more of a cloudy stoned mental state than a typical psychedelic headspace.


I was never able to really enjoy EPT. It was anxiogenic and I couldn't relax, and I felt uncomfortable physically. Some people who have written trip reports about it found it worthwhile though. I did like some of the visuals I saw. I got some cool color shifting, which really reminded me of LSD.

I find it interesting that you compare DiPT to other Tryptamines - IMHO it's very different because the effects are almost entirely auditory.

That's funny, I thought Shulgin was just exaggerating when he said the effects were  mostly auditory, but I guess some people really do experience it that  way. For me it's a full-on psychedelic that happens to be unusually auditory. I actually consider it to be more other-worldly than the other ones besides DMT and DPT.

I have exactly one experience with DiPT at the moment, and for me, it was almoste completely auditory - in the first part of the trip. When I later on smoked Cannabis, it completely changed and grew up to a full-on psychedelic experience with open-eye visuals etc., but of course including the auditory effects. When thinking of it, I should make more experineces with that compound, this one experience happened over 10 years ago.

Odd, that there's no Big and Dandy EPT thread I didn't delete any links from the Index so I'm guessing we never had one.  I'll make this one the one.


I haven't tried it, but Kaleida posted a great report on it:  [(EPT 50mg) - First Time - Total Clarity](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/834045-(EPT-50-mg)-First-Time-Total-Clarity)

I was pretty sure that there had been a big and dandy for it, but I isn't turn up anything with Internet Archive / Wayback Machine.


I need to spend some more time with EPT to really suss it out. I find 4-AcO-EPT to be stimulating and anxiogenic, but not EPT (at least not when vaporized.) It seems like a strange, ego-dislocating space. It's very delicate and friendly, with subtle and ephemeral visuals. I found it to be slightly deeper than MET (although I haven't pushed the dosage with MET.) I get a great low from it, but I find the space weird. It's not earthy and orgamic like the DMT subs - it feels alien, and the perspective it gives me didn't seem to reflect reality. In that sense, it's vaguely reminiscent of dissociatives in that I can't trust the insights. Unlike dissociatives, the insights seem to be positive and life-affirming even if they may be false. It may be a liar, but for me it has been a benevolent liar.


I like it better than MET (a little bit) and it's much more rich than DiPT and MiPT. It's nowhere near the intensity and majesty of DMT, nor the power and sickness of DPT. Strangely, despite my dislike of DPT, that's the one I feel like it has the closest kinship with.

I found an archive of the original EPT thread, but unfortunately it's from back when it was only one page long.


https://web.archive.org/web/20160909151035/http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/785510-The-Small-amp-Handy-N-N-ethylpropyltryptamine-(EPT)-Thread? s = c73bcb76df82f968bb2ac0bd4def8689


Delete the spaces. I had to put them in there because it wasn't letting me post the full url.

I thought so too.  It wasn't in the Index at all so I guess that's probably why.  It was just one page so we must have just missed it.

The thread had grown to 3 or 4 pages long after that archived version was made, but I don't think too much important information was lost. IIRC there were only a few people who had tried EPT who posted in it, and most of them posted about their experiences in the Trip Reports forum.

I went and tagged our grand total of 2 EPT reports in the Trip Reports section.  Gave me an idea to add a link to all the tagged reports of substances in the first posts of their Big and Dandies.  This link will always update as more reports and tagged.


[EPT reports](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/search.php?do=process&query=substancecode_ept%20AND%20substancecode_tryptamines%20NOT%20_exclude_&forumchoice[]=40&forumchoice[]=167)

I found most of the effects of EPT to have some kind of ceiling - going from 80mg to 120mg (plugged) seemed to only increase memory issues and confusion without increasing the intensity of visuals, feeling, etc.

Is this a worthwhile chemical to experiment with? I have only tried DMT and MiPT as far as base tryptamines go. Having heard it described as stoning and anxiogenic kind of put me off of the idea of acquiring it but another trip report on reddit painted a completely different picture of it. Mentioning some of the stimulation and uncomfortableness of DPT but a mostly positive type of experience. I guess I am just wondering if anyone else had experimented with it enough times to form a more definitive picture of the experience as a whole (psychedelics are obviously highly variable) but it would still help a bit for me.

So my vendor just released EPT. Is this a worthwhile chem? I love tryptamines, besides 4-Aco-DMT/truffels/paddos. DPT is in my top 5 list. How is the intensity and which RoA? I can't be asked to freebase and vape. Will this be able to yield a ++++ like DPT does?

I really liked EPT when I dosed it rectally a few years ago. My first experience (which I think is on erowid) was really awesome. Recently I tried vaping it twice and didn't have a great time. It made me feel overstimulated, anxious and like I couldn't focus on anything. I would avoid vaping it; go with ROAs that have a more gradual onset and keep the dose low to avoid anxiety.

I vaped EPT a few times and it was similar to what you describe. This makes me want to get more and try a different method of ingestion.

I love EPT, but by the sound of it you might not. You gotta adjust your expectations. For me, EPT is the only psychedelic that I would have no reservations sharing with people with zero experience. It's so gentle and non-threatening as to be barely psychedelic at all. If DPT is a bottle of vodka, this is a 3.2% beer, a pleasant afternoon refreshment.

How does it compare to 4-HO-EPT?

It's much, much lighter. I have only had 4-HO-EPT once, vaporized. I'm a little more familiar with 4-AcO-EPT. 4-AcO-EPT has about 100x as much headspace, but is more stimulating and anxiogenic. N, N-EPT is more erotic, warm, and emotional. They're both a little falsely warm and comfortable in the way of opioids. I like N, N-EPT more, but I always find myself wishing it were actually a full, rich psychedelic.
