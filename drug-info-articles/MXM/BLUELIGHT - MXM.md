(RS)2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)cyclohexanone


Or 3-MeO-2'-OxO-PCM, while MXE is 3-MeO-2'-Oxo-PCE.


Seems to slowly become available. Makes sense, with the EU ban on MXE.

Mod note: Please be aware that this has been sold as E-MXE or E-methoxetamine.

I have been very keen to see the SAR of that compound for a long time, given how shit NENK was and how good normal ketamine is regarded to be.


Appalling name though, I don't think one could have picked a worse one. 


I'd suggest


N-Methyl-Nor-Methoxetamine (NMNM) 

Methoxmetamine (MXM)

M-MXE

Methoxmetamine (MXM) sounds best, I think.

exactly what I would've named it


So this is *Methoxyketamine* with the methoxy just moved from the 2 to 3 position...  Would guess this to be more potent (at least if the methoxy on the 3 position carries the same kind of changes as with PCP/PCE/PCPr)


I'd be interested to see the non-ketone version of this, purely because of the relationship 3-meo-PCE had to MXE (potency-wise)

A better name is something like 3-methoxy-deschloro-ketamine. MDK? Or N-methyl-nor-methoxetamine.


Expect this to be a less potent analog of MXE, probably less selective for pure dissociation and more "sparkly" and magical like ketamine. Maybe. It's hard to tell because so many people don't like methoxyketamine as much as MXE.

Just received some 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCM (MXM, I'm not gonna call it e-MXE 'cos that's a ridicules name!). I tried a small dose a few minutes ago of 20mg (my usual MXE dose) insufflated, just to be safe. I realise it'll be a lot less potent but I don't want to tempt fate. I'll wait 30-40 minutes before my next dose and update on effects as time goes by, however I can't reach hole territory right now but I'll go for it tonight.


12:00 - 30 minutes later just insufflated another 10mg. No effects as of yet.


4:37 - Ok, I've been redosing 10mg amounts every half an hour since I started but about an hour ago with only threshold effects, I started doing 20mg increments. I must have done nearly 150mg now and feel very light MXE type effects. It should be known however that my NMDA tolerance is very high and usually kick off a K binge with 200-300mg to get medium-ish effects from it (probably around 500-600mg S-Ket to hole (I don't do racemic)). Also when I do MXE I use low doses so that's why my usual MXE dose is so small in comparison.


I think the duration of this is shorter than MXE, maybe 2-3 hours which is why I've not been getting significant effects. I have to be sober to meet someone in about 20 minutes though so after that I'll step it up to 50mg lines and report back.


Did, maybe, a 40mg line earlier and didn't feel much. I think I'll do a 100mg line tomorrow morning to see if it'll do anything but for tonight I'm out. Just did 30mg MXE, had a spliff and some benzos so no more testing can be done.


Tomorrow I'm gonna hole.


Also I'm not jamming 100mg of this shit up my ass or have it swilling round my mouth. The only ROA will be snorting and if all else fails, a possible bomb.

Come on people! Someone try another ROA besides insufflation! At least try it orally, the use nasal as a boost. I'd like to see someone give plugging it a go as well or even IM, though I know most aren't down with that.

Ok. Round Two:


Snorted about 50mg this morning - nothing.


Just measured out 100mg which I've put into a gelcap, which I'll do now. I'm about to eat though so I hope it doesn't play into it's absorption too much. I'll update later.


Shit. I think I'm coming up!! Mild MXE-ish feelings but a little more blunt than MXE like 4-MeO-PCP. I did a 50mg line after my meal too so 100mg oral + 50mg insufflated.


Ok, I was wrong, this is really euphoric. Opioid content must be through the roof here! I'm sitting with my girlfriend talking about pretty intimate things. I feel so serene and blissful. It's unlike MXE which is a bit more chaotic. This is just peaceful and quiet. Kind of like a weed high but less of a 'fucked up' feeling. It's really gorgeous at the moment.


100mg oral is **my** dose. So for other people it could be around 50-75mg but certainly insufflated is ineffective. Goddamn this is nice.


Just to note I dropped at 12:45 and it started coming up after I'd finished eating so maybe 45 minutes later at 1:30. Plateuing now at 2:21.


Actually I might try adding some Chitosan to it later to see if it aids insufflation in any way.


2:36 - Just gave my girlfriend a 100mg gelcap (she has a similar tolerance) so we'll have third party notes too.


3:45 - I've now completely come down, so I dropped another 150mg. My girlfriend however, experienced no effects from the 100mg but it was dropped on a full stomach. She also had some MXE this morning (30mg) so it could have offset the effects. I've told her to wait another 20 minutes before taking anything else. She feels a slight stimulant effect from it but that could be placebo or effects from caffeine or the MXE. I'll update later to see what's happened with the next 150mg gelcap and my girlfriend's experience from it.


4:25 - Here I am again in this godlike euphoria. I suspect that it's mostly opioidergic but I'm not nodding like I would with opioids, so I suspect some DRI properties too and of course NMDA antagonism to some degree. This is a real winner, just such a pity about the potency and duration. I have no idea why my girlfriend didn't experience it but it could be explained by her abuse of MDxx's which has been quite a lot recently. This would point to HT1a agonism instead and serotonergic euphoria instead. I really don't have enough info at the moment to confirm it's pharmacology though. All I know is it's fucking nice.

God I was so eager for this report!

What kind of euphoria was this? Like a MD euphoria? So is there a comedown when the effects wear off?

The duration really seemed very short by your description... Too bad! 

What about tolerance? How good were the effects of the second (150mg) dose, compared to the first one?

Sorry for the interrogatory :D

Yes!!!! Thanks brother blueberries for trying oral! How godly it sounds orally makes me think it might be pretty rusty and exquisite IM or plugged. It's really to bad about the duration though... I could live with the lower potenecy if it's through the roof price wise but that duration is fairly weak even if it has God tier euphoria. Hopefully that won't lead to super compulsive dosing! I would stay away from guessing the pharmacology, at least with opioid activity, we all know how that went with MXE, and that stupid rumor is still believed by some today!

There was no comedown whatsoever, but it is short, perhaps an hour and a half but it's so good. It honestly feels like a mixture of serotonergic euphoria (like that of 5-HT1a agonism) and opioid euphoria. Basically dreamy and relaxing but still quite lucid. I could talk and walk, everything but just felt really nicely high. The effects of the second were similar to the first but in total the doses were technically the same. I've just dropped another cap of what I think to be around 200-250mg and I hope to see it's heavy effects now.

I'm wondering if it has a hole or not. Sounds like it could be pretty cool if it does. Looking forward to see what higher a doses bring!

The dopaminergic effects are most likely direct dopamine receptor agonism and not DRI.

I feel like maybe this stuff should be called 3-MeO-Ketamine/3-MeO-Ket for short, it's not the most correct of names, but given that we use 2-MeO-Ketamine as the name for 2-MeO-Deschloro-Ketamine, and that this is essentially 3-MeO-Deschloro-Ketamine, it would be the most logical name to help people understand what it is. Far more so than E-Methoxetamine.


The second best option would be "Methoxmetamine", at least somewhat gives a better representation of the structure.


Alternatively N-Methyl-Nor-MXE or NMNM for short (Daily Mail reporters reading this, don't go calling it nom-nom in response to this for fuck sake. :D)


Edit: You all beat me to the names. I kind of want to stick them all in the title for clarity's sake but I'm not sure which ones to use, or whether to just go with all of them and have a ridiculously long title - I don't think we should let the thread be called "E-Methoxetamine" without at least adding one of the other names since it's a god awful name for the stuff.

There's something else that has come up. It's pretty scary but I'm not 100% on it yet.


My girlfriend has a huge speed tolerance. As in she can do a gram of paste in one line and that's just the start of her binge. So I started to think, what if it's a dopamine releaser? It would explain all the euphoria, relaxation, everything. It would also explain why she got no effects from it.


So far no selective dopamine releasers have cropped up on the market. It's quite a stretch from PCP analogues' DRI properties but I'm just hoping to god it's dopamine agonism. If what I think is correct then we could have an epidemic on our hands. I'm also redosing this shit like mad. It's just so good, which confirms my thoughts further.


If it is then MXM needs to be shut down NOW. It would be 10x worse than heroin addiction. At least there's neuroprotection but still. 


This is a **BIG** fucking problem.


EDIT: **MODS MOVE THIS TO ADD OR NPD, WHATEVER IT IS NOW!!**

^ Pretty much all the dissociatives out other than Ketamine are SRIs (Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) and that's usually what produces the "opiate like euphoria" that some of them have.


Some examples:

- 3-MeO-PCP

- 4-MeO-PCP

- Methoxetamine (MXE)

- DXM


Some are also dopamine reuptake inhibitors, like PCP, and likely 3-MeO-PCP too.


Stimulant dissociatives are not a new thing, the only non-stimulant dissociatives I can think of off the top of my head are Nitrous Oxide and Ketamine ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Also none of those have any opioid activity, aside from DXM (although DXO, DXM's main metabolite doesn't really have any), despite how many times people have made comments about MXE and 3-MeO-PCP feeling "opiate like". There's no reason this would be any different, since structurally it's smack bang in the middle between Ketamine and Methoxetamine.


If anything I'd say rather than certain dissociatives being opiate like, it's more like low doses of dissociatives are anti-depressant like. Anti-depressants also generally being SRIs, like most dissociatives. Opiates have a similar anti-depressant quality to them, though it's not due to serotonergic activity, feels a tad different, and is easy enough to tell apart once you've been using opiates for years on end in my experience.


The fact your girlfriend got little adds even more to the likelihood that this is an SRI like MXE etc, since you mentioned she had abused MDMA, and MDMA abuse leads to down-regulation of the serotonin transporters, along with serotonergic neurotoxicity and lasting damage.

I actually think the whole magic of MXE and now this is mostly related to serotonin. There are some empathogens selective for serotonin which can also feel very relaxing and opioid-like. With that 3-methoxy group on the aromatic ring they're both likely to bind to SERT and some study done on a few PCP analogues showed that MXE and 3-MeO-PCP both had an appreciable affinity towards SERT. 5-HT1A receptors could be involved as well, but presynaptic 1A receptors are autoreceptors, so they'd stop serotonin release upon activation by serotonin, so perhaps MXE and MXM are also 5-HT1A agonists themselves. 5-HT1A agonists also inhibit glutamate release. There is a lot of contradictory research on arylcyclohexanamines. Some go as far as mu/kappa agonism and activity at D2 and 5-HT2A receptors, which actually makes sense to me, arylcyclohexanamine backbone looks versatile, so with the right substitution one could further manipulate the ratios of affinities at different targets. It seems like this is what happened here (most probably accidentally though...), a secondary methyl amine is less efficient for NMDA antagonism, so the ratio of serotonergic effects vs. NMDA antagonistic effects could increase.


BTW, I vote for MXM, 3-methoxy-deschloroketamine is just too long and abbreviations like 2-MK or 3-MK are vague at best.

I bet that DXO has a higher affinity to opioid receptors than DXM does, it's just that DXO isn't really well researched. Still it must be a low affinity compared to its affinity at NMDA receptors, which could be very similar to ketamine actually.

Does anyone know when MXM is supposed to be widely available? I can't find it anywhere now, I'm not really familiar with today's RCs market though.

I hope to god you're right.


I'm banking on the 5HT1a agonism theory. I really, really, hope it is just that. I was whirring things over in my mind last night and it really scared me. *Please, please, * dont let this be a releaser. It's a big stretch I know. A really big stretch but my mind was in pieces last night. 


Fuck, we really need to get some clinical evaluations on this because what I was thinking would cripple the world.


EDIT: Thanks adder, you've saved my mind. I got into a deep hole last night (not ACH hole) worrying about if this was getting to the retail stage!

They are definitely not direct 5-ht1a agonists, but indirect 5-ht1a activation via serotonin release is a definite possibility.

I see MXM being the most reasonable name for it for the 'short' name (ala MXE). 


I don't see a reason to not give the 'longer' name something along the lines of Methoxymetamine or Methoxymethylamine to still sound reminiscent of methoxetamine but not similar enough. 


They both give the structure some explanatory name and keep the trend fairly well with naming (although I would say having a naming trend for ketamine and MXE and the lot is a bit of a stretch at this point).


Methoxmethamine is one I do not like the ring of but I wouldn't be unhappy hearing Methoxmethylamine. 


My votes are for Methoxymetamine or Methoxymethylamine and to a lesser extent Methoxmethylamine. Methoxmethylamine gives it a very similar ring to methoxetamine which could be seen as typos so that is why I suggest either Methoxymetamine or Methoxymethylamine.

I think it's very important to avoid confusion.


So "Methoxymethylamine" would be the best one out of your list (for the long version, the short one being of course "MXM").

Unfortunately methoxymethylamine, methylamine as well as methamine are names connected to other substances. Methylamine is not a short version of a fuller correct formula name (like methoxetamine is in a way, or say amphetamine), but an existing unrelated chemical. (Methox)methamine was going to be my suggestion for a slightly shortened version for it but methamine is unfortunately already a synonym of the also unrelated chemical hexamine. Metamine is the name for some angina medication but I guess methoxymetamine is close enough to methoxetamine to be called a derivative of the name, which is fitting since it is an analogue. The Y in methoxymetamine also gives it better flow.

So I guess if you must use full names, just stick to methoxymetamine and don't be a moron to leave out both the Y and the M! Or be a daredevil and call it methoxmetamine.

Ideally people just ought to call it **MXM**.


In the index it is just listed as MXM now, I'd say just call it that (people - at least users - don't tend to call PCP by its full name do they?). Not sure if avoiding the issue is typically a smart strategy but it seems to me like for now it's superior over us coming up with new alternative names.


(Indeed I don't want to keep including e-Methoxetamine in the title, but for the time being it seems fair if people are buying it under that ridiculous name. It better be a maddeningly electronic feeling this drug gives you.)

This is pretty exciting. Sounds like not redosing this one is going to be a little tricky given the disappointingly short duration and marked elation MXM provides...


Speaking of SAR, I would not think that serotonin reuptake inhibition is responsible for this compound's euphoric potential. AFAIK typical SSRI do not produce improvement in mood short term, rather it is downregulation of serotonin transporters due to chronic SSRI exposure that really is responsible for their antidepressant action. Serotonin reuptake enhancers, on the other hand (like tienaptine), exert their euphoric potential immediately upon administration and do not require prolonged administration to alleviate depression. My guess is that DRI could produce the euphoric feeling; this explains why tolerance to speed would prevent MXM from working, and also why it is so short-acting.


Pretty interesting that it appears to be inactive nasally. Perhaps it is MXM's first-pass metabolite that hits the receptors?

Unfortunately that logic doesn't apply in the same way for the intense actions of recreational drugs. Serotonin reuptake inhibition is an important part of the action of cocaine.

In case anybody missed it, [here's another report](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/734930-%28E-MXE-MXM-3-MeO-2-OxO-PCM%29First-Trials-Not-as-expected) on "MXM" from TR.


> That night, feeling a bit lethargic, but well-rested, I decided to do 53mg at 9:18pm, and then another 50mg at 10:15pm, to see if a rested brain would improve my ability to capture the capacities of MXM. It definitely finalized in my mind that MXM is not a drug I care to waste brain cells on. It gave me the same sedated, disassociated feeling, but this time with a noticeable amount of manic qualities. All still teetering on threshold-level, none of those feelings got me excited about the drug I was doing.
> 
> I really don’t want to dismiss this research chemical as a flop, especially with the high standards I was holding it to, but that’s all I got from it so far. I’m going to have to wait and hear about other people’s experience, but unless the batch I got was a weak one, I’m going to have to categorize MXM with the likes of drugs that simply can’t hold their own.

I'm still intrigued. It seems like there's greater variance in how users appraise new dissociatives early on (plus Adder noted that the benzo use reported by the OP in this report could have a strong negative effect). In any case I'm interested to know the non-tolerant dosage.  As far as ROAs: given how closely related to MXE it is chemically, I'd guess potency goes IV>IM>/=rectal>sublingual>oral>nasal.  I'd try plugging it.

Tolerance on MXM rises fast as fuck. I'm unable to get to the same place I was at before (and I've tried multiple times). I'm now filling size 2 gelcaps (instead of size 3) and getting only mild euphoria. You need to use this stuff sparingly unlike MXE, which is unfortunate since the high is so good. I've given 50mg to two other people so far. One found it amazing (no tolerance to anything) the other I haven't heard back from but the second has a high speed tolerance just to make sure it's not a releaser. He's on coke, speed and weed at the moment so he's just not replying. Once I get confirmation I'd be able to tell easier.


I've just done a size 1 gelcap to see if I can get to where I was before but I doubt it. Multiple redose days is not the way forward however much you may want to.

It's likely a NMDA antagonist and SRI, without any inhibition or release of dopamine or norepinephrine, not sure where you got that idea from ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

"most likely"?

Methoxetamine was not found to be a dopamine agonist.

They didn't check for the functional high-affinity state of the dopamine receptor.

So we don't know wether or not MXE is a dopamine agonist.


PCP, ketamine and even MK-801 are ALL dopamine agonists, so it's of course rather likely that MXE and MXM are dopamine agonists too.

Oh, don't worry I have a scale but once a dose goes beyond 100mg, then I can eyeball like magic (same with < 1mg). I'm filling gelcaps to the max because tolerance rises ultra fast. I haven't used it since this morning and won't for another few days as this could be indicative of HT agonism. Still waiting on the report from the other guy's experience though. I'm doubtful now that it's a dopamine releaser but this is the last test to confirm.

I didn't make any wild assumptions.


I just pointed out that ALL NMDA antagonists that have been tested against D2high (e.g. PCP, ketamine, MK-801) were ALL shown to be partial agonists.


It's VERY difficult to seperate NMDA antagonism from D2high, even MK-801 (once the definition of NMDA selectivity) binds to D2high.


Neither MXM nor MXE have been tested against D2high, but it's certainly not a WILD assumption to think that MXE and MXM are also gonna be D2high agonists.

Who said you did? It's just pointless to play guessing games when you know your making possible connections that could be there but at the same time might not. Then less knowledgeable users take this as fact and spread it like wild fire. At that point were back aay the fact that some people still think MXE has relevant affinity for mu receptors.

I don't think it's an assumption to point out that the NMDA channel site and the dopamine D2high site are pretty much inseparable.

Yes. There's a blanket ban on [arylcyclohexylamines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine#List_of_arylcyclohexylamines) in the UK.

Report from an anonymous contributor:


> I recently received a gram of this substance from a US vendor. The material has not had it's identity confirmed via third party testing as far as I know and, shame on me, I did not perform any reagent tests (do as I say, Bluelight, not as I do: buy a test kit, check your drugs. If you have money for drugs, you have money for a test kit). Needless to say, I can not definitively confirm that I have received the chemical advertised, but subjective effects are distinctive enough that I feel fairly confident in asserting that the material was not MXE.

General dissociative tolerance is moderate; however, my personal awareness of altered states of consciousness seems to be somewhat greater than the typical drug user.

It is hard to say from the one trial at this level, but with eyes closed I sensed rather than saw geometric patterns and shapes which somehow still seemed more concrete compared to the ethereal visions produced by MXE. However, this aspect of the experience requires further investigation.

The duration of this experience was roughly similar to what I would expect with similar doses and ROA of MXE with a slightly shortened peak, but the mixed ROAs make measuring the peak somewhat difficult and the ratio of doses needs a little tweaking (maybe 3:2 plugged : oral). I find a similar dosing regimen ideal with MXE for producing a prolonged hole-like peak.

I don't really have enough experience with ketamine to draw any comparisons there, but if I had to grossly over-simplify this thing I would say that the effects lie somewhere between MXE and DXM, with a duration roughly equivalent to MXE. I would haphazardly guess that MXM is about 80% as potent as MXE. If anyone has any questions I'll do my best to answer them.

I'll be getting some in a couple weeks and will report my findings. Not expecting a Ketamine/MXE replacement, just a different disso to try. Look forward to new reports as it seems while still legal in EU, those vendors have now moved on. I honestly got bored of MXE so I look forward to trying this.

AFAIK typical SSRI do not produce improvement in mood short term, rather it is downregulation of serotonin transporters due to chronic SSRI exposure that really is responsible for their antidepressant action. Serotonin reuptake enhancers, on the other hand (like tienaptine), exert their euphoric potential immediately upon administration and do not require prolonged administration to alleviate depression. My guess is that DARI could produce the euphoric feeling; this explains why tolerance to speed would prevent MXM from working, and also why it is so short-acting.

You're sort of on the right lines, SSRI's down-regulate 5ht1a receptors which is responsible for their supposed potential in treating some cases of anxiety, where too much 5ht1a activity could be to blame. However serotonin itself is a mood elevator, pure SSRIs and SSRAs do exert immediate anti-depressant effects, and down-regulation of your serotonin receptors has an opposite effect, one of increased depression. That's why long term SSRI use leaves users with a long recovery period to get back to themselves.


That said SRIs and SRAs aren't exactly "euphoric", they're more "comfy", "relaxing", "sedating" and "social-bond-inducing" - dopamine as you suggested is responsible for the majority of the euphoria from what we currently know anyway in the case of most drugs, dopamine is where the push and rush tend to come from.


That said there are certain drugs that only act indirectly upon dopamine function or not on it at all that are still incredibly euphoric and so one should not automatically assume that euphoria == DRI. The only studies so far out for Methoxetamine showed it only to have SRI action, and no DARI action, and yet it is quite the euphoric one - it's possible things were missed or errors were made in the studies but again there's Ketamine which isn't a DRI to any notable extent which I find more euphoric than any other dissociative.


Plain NMDA antagonism can be pretty damn euphoric. Escapism and exploring entirely new realms is something the human mind likes - we like novelty. That said I believe all NMDA antagonists I know of have some affinity for D2 receptors which could also produce some of the euphoria.


Being a DARI also would not impact duration, there are DARIs that last for 16-24 hours, and DARIs that last for 30 minutes, unless you mean as a result of this speed tolerance, but I doubt this would be a factor, PCP and its analogues have notable dopaminergic activity and do not seem to show cross-tolerance with stimulants.


Honestly my guess for the "speed preventing MXM working" theory would simply be the substances both being in the system at once. Stimulants and dissociatives taken together have a counter-active effect, while they will not completely 100% eliminate a large dissociative dose from your system, they can take a pretty big whack at it. That's why substances like PCP and 3-MeO-PCP have horror stories attached to them, because they're stimulants and dissociatives rolled into one - and so even at high doses there's not quite enough sedation or dissociation to knock you down to the floor, but just enough adjoined to plenty of mania to have you wanting to run around the streets naked shouting about the elves you just met. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

So reports seem to suggest that this one is mildly sedating. Do we know what exactly is responsible for the stimulating properties of MXE and 3-meo-pcp? Is it the SRI properties? That seems to be the major difference between ketamine and mxe pharmacologically and ketamine is not at all stimulating whereas mxe and 3-meo-pcp can be quite stimulating. Perhaps them MXM doesn't have any interaction with serotonin? I don't know anything about SAR so this isn't at all an educated guess. With regards to dopamine I recall reading somewhere that dopamine antagonists did not stop self administration of MK-801 in rats so the contribution of dopamine agonism to the euphoric effects of NMDA antagonists is questionable. I suspect that the euphoria felt from dissociatives depends highly on the individual, just like some people don't find benzos to be euphoric whereas those with anxiety disorders can find them quite euphoric. It's certainly true that many people hate the feeling of dissociation.

Less potent is probably a good thing for a mass market dissociative RC.


I'm looking forward to trying this, but it sounds a bit disappointing as an MXE replacement, especially as the cost per gram is roughly the same.

I've got an order for this coming. 

Can anyone give me their thoughts on IM? This should be effective like with Ketamine i'm guessing.


Is there anything particularly dangerous possibly left over from the synth which would discourage IM?

I will only IM after allergy test and with micron filter ofcourse.


Edit: I just read the report on the second page. I think i will go with rectal instead even though i like the needle the added risks with an unknown compound seem very unnecessary.

I'm on the fence. The source I used to get MXE from only has MXM now. I can source MXE from another source, but can't decide what to do with the ban looming and all. I have a high MXE tolerance so I'm kinda worried MXM which is priced the same would be a waste of cash.


So yea, I'm waiting for more reports and my MXE sources to dry up before I use the replacement. The euphoria people speak of intrigues me quite a bit along with sedation. I love downers. I dunno, I may order some MXM today.

I would say that MXM is definitely less euphoric than MXE. I wouldn't really call it sedating but it is definitely more "couch-locky" than MXE. It is a bit more uncomfortable than the MXE experience. As an MXE replacement it falls short, but as a ketamine replacement it is probably closer to the mark than MXE is/was; however, the effects are still probably more akin to those produced by MXE than by ketamine, at least in terms of duration and intensity. A sublingual dose of 100mg yesterday had me floored similar to probably 60-80mg of MXE.

Well I do like Ketamine a lot, so perhaps this is worth trying. So it's not a double dose? More like 50% more than an MXE dose?

I would say there is the possibility of some nausea, a sort of pressure in the front of the head that may leave you with a headache, coordination is affected more strongly, and a greater likelihood of feeling out of sorts and a little uneasy. Generally a bit darker, probably with a greater propensity for psychotic thoughts than with MXE. Then again I've been overdoing it with the MXE lately so take that all with a grain of salt.


I've said before that I have very little experience with ketamine so I can't make a lot of comparisons there, but to me the high is somewhat reminiscent of DXM. YMMV.


I wouldn't jump in to a double dose of what you'd normally take with MXE. Maybe double a threshold dose, but as someone who still gets effects from as little as 20mg of MXE I wouldn't go much higher than that for a first trial with MXM (after reagent and allergy tests of course ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ).

I don't mean to emphasize the negative, I just think it's important to be aware of. I do think that MXM will prove to be a worthwhile dissociative in its own right, I've just been kind of reckless lately and haven't really run the sort of controlled trials that would allow me to pinpoint it's value.

I feel like I'm scaring you all away from it and that's not my intention. I don't claim to be an expert on MXM. I've tried it maybe five times, most of those in conjunction with MXE or another drug. Someone else chime in or nobody else is going to order it and it's going to disappear.

Not at all, we're all different. Even if it does have it's similarities i think the main advantage would be MXM's duration vs DXM's with less side effects. What's your route of administration if you don't mind me asking?

I just have to say, I love how it seems every new Big & Dandy (for new substances) always starts with at least a page of arguments about semantics.


Can't wait to try this out, the diphenidine derivatives did NOT sound appealing. I'm still waiting for a reliable Ketamine replacement. MXE was spectacular but it lacked the magic and the stimulation was too great.


A reduced potency and duration, while being a negative, may actually be a good thing for dissociative users. Decreased consumption and less likelihood of enduring manic episodes.

Or increased consumtion due to higher dosage and most particular lowered duration, ie, more redoses.  I guess we'll see.  It doesn't sound that appealing to me.  MXE is my favorite dissociative, unlike you I find it to be utterly magical, much moreso than ketamine.  And stimulating in a non-stimulating way.  It makes me not tired but also relaxed.

Given how poorly this was originally named and that the correct name has caught on I think the semantics on the first page were incredibly productive. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Okay so here we are, the answers to all the burning questions I'm sure many of you have about this new substance. I'm not going to go into massively descriptive detail about my trip detailing every development at every 10 minutes because in all honesty it really wasn't that different from any of the other fantastic dissociative experiences that I, or I'm sure many of you have had before. So I just want to give you all the most important, and most relevant details.


With that out of the way let me break it down for you all. First things first:


1) No this is not a replacement for Ketamine.

2) No this is not a replacement for MXE.

3) Yes MXM is FAR AND BEYOND, much better than the latest string of joke dissociative RC's that we've been subjected to. I'm looking at you Diphenidine/Methoxphenidine...!

4) This is a substance that is finally good enough to stand up in it's own light. And be counted along side other great dissociatives. MXM is absolutely worth it's salt, and not to be overlooked.


Next I'm sure you'll want to know how similar MXM is to Ketamine and MXE. And the short answer to that question is that it is far closer to Ketamine than it is to MXE.

MXM is basically everything I imagined and hoped NEK was going to be, but unfortunately wasn't.


For anyone hoping that MXM is going to be like MXE, well it just isn't. So you can all seriously put that question to bed. But with that said, on my first dose of 50mg, at around the 20 minute mark I might have argued that it shared some similar traits to MXE. But after spending the entire day on this substance yesterday I can reveal that when MXM is in full swing it's really nothing like MXE at all.  


So onto the summary of effects. MXM is very visual once it gets going, and anyone who's tried, or liked K will be right at home on MXM. At times things were distorted, and shifted around as I changed perspective. But nothing in the realms of the peculiar cubism and distortion that you might experience on a heavy dose of MXE. At no point while I was on MXM did I ever feel uneasy, or unsettled. There were no feelings of nausea, no feelings of panic or distress, and to my relief there were no feelings of head pressure or other anomalies as previously mentioned. 


MXM never felt "alien" or "cold". If anything I would describe the experience as completely euphoric, and almost blissful at times. My thoughts were not fragmented or hectic at any point, and they didn't become dark or disturbing. Much like K, MXM can really switch off your senses, and I found myself dancing around the edge of the "hole", drifting in and out. It was really magical. The hole is really great with MXM.


After my first "taster" at 50mg I instantly wanted to find out what MXM really had to offer. And I found that for me MXM really began to shine at around 200mg via IM. However for the record I seriously abused MXE for 2 years straight, with all the hallmark trips to A&E and psychotic episodes that you can attribute to heavily abusing a substance like MXE. Also Ketamine is by far my favourite drug, and I've done just as much of that over the years. So you will really need to play it safe, and test the water like I did to find out what is right for you. As you always should with any new substance.


MXM's effects set in very quickly, in 10 minutes you'll notice all the trademark signs of dissociation, and within 30 minutes you should be firmly locked in, at least with IM anyway. Again much like Ketamine, peak effects last for around 1.5-2 hours, with effects dwindling from there until you are almost completely baseline again by 4 hours. Personally this suits me fine, your mileage may vary. I was able to spend the entire day in dissociated bliss, redosing every 3-4 hours with no ill effects, and even managed a nice little break in between for a chat to my Mum.


I don't know how pure my MXM is because frankly I've no means in which to test it. But the appearance is very floury, with it being of the nature where it can stick to the side of the bag. With a tendancy to clump together a bit. But not in a damp, gross way. Just very floury. MXM dissolves easily into water with only minor heat applied, I'd like to think that this is a good sign regarding it's purity. Something that has been really pissing me off about MXP lately is that it just won't dissolve for shit, and even when it does it fucking clogs up my barrel and heads because it precipitates back into crystals in moments and makes the entire process a pain in the arse.


One last thing to note is that I've only been doing MXP once a weekend for the last few months, as I'm trying to be much smarter and disciplined with my drug use. I've not had anything like stimulants, weed or psychedelics in my system that might have otherwise tainted the experience.


So anyway if you were on the fence about this one, and you have a trustworthy source, and you have a thing for dissociatives like I do then go nuts. Because MXM is seriously great fun.

If any of you have any other questions that I didn't think to answer then fire away and I'll do my best to answer them

Thanks for that, I'm really intrigued tho I almost wish I wasn't... after long affairs with K and MXE.


Are you sure the MXP wasn't just always that hard to dissolve? It looks like a less water-soluble molecule to me than MXM.

@Solipsis Yeah that's pretty much what I was getting at. Although some times MXP will dissolve easier than other times. But after getting MXM it really reminded me how easy things used to be!


I decided to try and push MXM's boundary's a bit, in order to try and fully understand the substance. And it seems to me that the 'less travelled' dissociative user will definitely come a cropper if they try and push their luck with this substance. At high doseage MXM is very intense. So heed my words kids, give this one your **respect.**

I have tried this insufflated a couple of times, And it feels totally as one would expect. It's half way between ketamine and mxe, in my opinion. It reminds me a lot of both, while still being unique. Personally I actually prefer this to mxe so far, because it' s got that ketamine feel and wierdness, and twist on reality that I really like. Also, this gives me less nausea than mxe, and the bodyload is lighter. I am sure a lot of people are still going to prefer mxe though.


It's for sure less potent, and the duration is slightly shorter, than mxe. But much longer than ketamine. While being less potent than mxe, it's still plenty active. So don't go underestimate it.


Actually, my doses have been the same as with mxe. 25-35 mg snorted get's me to were I wan't to be. 


Funny. Insufflated it tastes totally like ketamine.


I agree it's like what NENK should have been. And I think it will get very popular when mxe is gone.

I'll have to give this a try sometime then, it sounds pretty nice from your description. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I like MXE more than I like ketamine, but I like ketamine too.  Something in between could be really nice.

Would those of you who have had this one share more detail about the potency and timelines for the different routes of administration that you've tried? (Including come-up, plateau duration, come down)


I like to snort K, but I take MXE sublingually because snorting is no faster and that way it spares my nose the irritation. Wondering what the best options for MXM might be. (Side note: does anyone eat their MXE? I remember reading at one point that eating it is slower and significantly less potent than sublingual or nasal so I didn't really mess with it)

I always eat it, except when I've eaten recently. In this case, sublingual. I've tried sublingual only twice and didn't notice a significant increase in potency compared to oral. Maybe the duration was shorter sublingually. I would need more experiments in order to draw conclusions.

I find oral MXE to be the best ROA by far (I have tried oral, sublingual, nasal, rectal and smoked).  It's more potent by weight for me (and all my friends) oral than any other method.  SUblingual is pretty similar but I just like how it hits me better with oral.  I find it to contain the most magic, the best headspace/most psychedelic, and best feeling when taken orally... it reaches the peak by 45 minutes.  I need more to reach the same level when I snort it.  Rectal is much more potent and is good for holing, but it's much more anesthetic and isn't a good ROA for using it when socializing (which is my favorite way to use MXE), as it's too intense.


I hardly ever use any ROA other than oral, because it's just superior.  I have read of a few people having it take forever to come up, but for me and all my friends, it comes up very quick (I feel alerts in 5 minutes and definitely effects start at 10-15 minutes, even if I have eaten recently) and is preferred.  Seems to be the most economical too because it lasts a maximum amount of time and doesn't require more per dose than other ROAs.

First off, a little background. I'm a K-fiend, and I need about 400+ mg of K to hole via insufflation, but with MXE, my optimal dose is 60 mg insufflated. I'm not a big fan of MXE, but I do it anyway once in a blue moon.


I just received my order from a very reputable vendor, and the substance I have is extremely fluffy and sticky, it reminds me of 5-MAPB. Does this sound right to you guys? Also, I can normally fill up a dime bag with 1 g of MXE no problem, 1 g of K no problem, 1 g of MDMA no problem. However, I was only able to fill up a dime bag with about 800 mg of this stuff.


Anyway, I first did a 5 mg allergy test, and I was ready. Shortly thereafter, I did a 40 mg line, and 20 minutes later I did a 60 mg line, and I barely felt anything at all...just slight euphoria and possible stimulation. Maybe 30 minutes later, all effects (placebo or not) were gone an I felt sober. To me, it almost felt like 5-MAPB actually, but sniffing it didn't burn at all. But the drip tastes horrible, and cold! Very chemically-tasting. My nostril is very stuffed now.


Anyway, I'm actually a little worried that what I received isn't MXM, but instead some MDMA analogue. Is everybody's MXM very fluffy and sticky? Also, 100 mg of MXM looks like a lot more than 100 mg of MXE.


Lastly, I'm about to head out, but when I get back, I'm gonna try 100 mg oral.


One more thing...when you guys say you do this substance sublingually, how the hell do you do it? Do you just place 100 mg of the powder under your tongue and let it sit? If so, for how long? The two times I tried MXE sublingually, it was very uncomfortable, because my saliva was building up at an extreme rate, to the point where I really just wanted to swallow it because it was getting very close to just dripping out of my mouth between my closed lips lol. So in other words, any tips on doing this sublingually?


Thanks!

It doesn't sound at all, like what I've got. Mine is pure white, and not sticky or fluffy. The taste insufflated, is a lot like the taste ketamine can have some times, if you know what I mean.

Does the vendor also stock 2-MeO-ketamine? What you write, totally echo my experience with that shit.

Best to take 1-2mg and wait a few hours just make sure you didn't get something else and to check for idiosyncratic reactions, then the dosage *should* be similar to ketamine, but as it's a new chem, best to start low and work up. Without tolerance I would probably take 25-35mg my first time. YMMV.

I would strongly suggest that you stick below 50mg of this substance **without** tolerance. And I would echo that 25-35mg is probably a good starting point. It will wipe the floor with you if you aren't careful.

Drug tests designed for ketamine **may** show (false) positive for MXM, although it's possible the color is slightly changed. I wouldn't bother with normal tests like Marquis which doesn't work at all. It would be Morris reagent you want.

Ketamine can make you fail a drug test for PCP. Also unless you're in the USA drug tests are extremely uncommon.

How's tolerance development with this one? Seems to be a BITCH of a tolerance with MXE that happens faster than anything I've ever seen.

To the people too lazy to read the thread, let me summarize, 25-35 mg is a good starting dose for people WITHOUT tolerance. Expect longer duration than ketamine, but shorter than MXE. Tolerance is probably the same as with MXE, but I don't know about that yet. I never took more than 2-3 lines in an evening, which has been completely satisfying to me. 


I think people with a strong MXE tolerance, will find MXM somewhat lacking, but we will see about that. It for sure doesn't have the same "oooomph", which is actually what I like about it.

Seriously? You have tested positive for PCP after using MXE? 

I'm 99% sure that's not true (3-meo-pcp on the other hand will show up as PCP). I am drug tested every month with a 9 panel that includes PCP and have never tested hot even after doing MXE for many days straight before the test. This has happened at least half a dozen times, so I don't know what the difference is.

My PCP levels were off the charts high, freaked the doctor out....but I still had MXE in the system ......like I had been doing it just hours before the test....and it was a blood test, so maybe a UA doesn't test positive for it?

Well I ploughed through 3 grams of MXM in just under a week, and that's with a full time 9-5 job, and generous dosages. I didn't find my tolerance increase from my continued daily usage, but my previous MXE tolerance definitely plays a part in my MXM experience. I'd imagine that if I'd never abused MXE for 2 years that MXM would be the most magical thing since sliced magical bread.


Anyway I have 5 more grams on the way so once I get through those I'll let you know how tolerance fairs ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Seeing reports that methoxmetamine is more like ketamine than MXE is really exciting. 

Does anyone know if it shares similar anesthetic and immersive properties with ketamine? It has been a few years since my mind has drifted down a hole, and I would really like to return some day.

The anaesthetic properties aren't quite as strong as those of ketamine but they are still definitely there. I definitely get robo legs when trying to walk around on MXM. You'll have no problems tumbling down the rabbit hole with MXM.

Awesome! I could never quite achieve the falling down into endlessness and fully-immersive type of experience with MXE (maybe I never pushed it far enough) but that's what I loved most from ketamine. I'm really glad to hear this, thanks for the reply!

im ultra exited about this haha and was about to make order some but then some doubt arose that the vendor i had in mind is carrying the i think also mentioned here sticky and not ket smelling MXM. 

Has anyone seen more then one "type" of mxm? i don't see many places offering it yet. just one as a matter of fact

Yes, I was in the hospital and showed positive for PCP. They called it a false positive since I denied PCP use. Happened a second time I was in there too. It shows up in urine and blood.

That really shouldn't be surprising. DXM will cause a positive for PCP as well if you do too much.

To update on my earlier post (I was the one saying maybe I didn't receive MXM,) I did. I ended up trying a 400 mg line, whoa was that too much. I ended up holing, or almost holing at least. It was very uncomfortable, not enjoyable unlike a wonderful K-hole. Afterwards, I was very nauseous. I find this stuff best when mixed with MXE and weed, it gives you a great body high! My doses are 250 mg snorted, and about 50 mg of MXE snorted, then smoke a little bit of weed and off I go!

Titrated up to 30 mg in 5 mg doses (snorted) over ~45 min and ended up feeling really nice. Very little dissociation, but just feeling very relaxed and maybe even a bit euphoric. Reminded me more of an opiate than of ketamine actually.

The effects were mostly gone after an hour and I then redosed with 30 mg. This brought a bit of dissociation similar to low dose ketamine, but didn't seem to bring as much "feel good" as the initial 30 mg.


I plan on going straight to 50 mg next time.


I wonder how safe MXM would be to combine with MDMA or methylone, as I really enjoy small bumps of ketamine with those.

Those who have had both MXE and MXM...if you could still source MXE would you stick with MXE until you can't? I want to try MXM but feel my MXE tolerance would get in the way, plus I'd like to keep getting it while I can. Just curious if those who have had both could say which they prefer.

400mg sounds like a lot. What's your tolerance like? I wouldn't advise such doses to anyone new to this stuff, start with low doses like 10-20mg and work up slowly to find your ideal dose. Partly because this is new and we don't really have any firm dosages set in place due to how much the tolerance of those who've tried it and reported back will vary, but also due to the fact that the isomers may vary between vendors (with the S-isomer presumably being stronger like with MXE and Ketamine, I'd assume).


Someone else has reported nice effects from 30mg so 400mg sounds crazy. Sounds like dosage is maybe similar to MXE or a tad higher, but not *that* much higher.

I doubt that they have taken the effort to separate the isomers. With ketamine it was already a meaningful process, and it was taken advantage of... but for MXE it sounded quite rare and I image with MXM it is the same.


Changed the thread title so that less people looking for the MXE thread may accidentally come here, and additionally to echo something a few people have said about this substance: it's not an MXE replacement or duplicate even if it is being marketed to fill the MXE gap in the market. It's apparently reminiscent of K but it is quite likely it should not be treated exactly like that either.

Best is to approach it as something unique in itself, needing a particular way to handle, with particular qualities and dangers.


Always be careful taking novel compounds, but if you do try it, help contribute to fitting that puzzle. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Sampled some of this recently! I have experience with MXE and 3-meo-pcp. I enjoy MXE the most.  I have had a 2 week long +++ on very good quality MXE so I deeply respect these compounds and have become familiar with the subtleties between different arylcyclohexylamines.


As for MXM : So far... I am impressed. The dosing is higher than I expected . Not very visual unless I close my eyes. Then it gets beautiful. 


It does feel similar to ketamine,as in it feels LESS serotogenic that MXE , and void of any of the speedy dopamine push. The same clean vibes, more internal visuals, less of that confusing MXE fun. No very trippyness, and I found it very relaxing, but that could be other things I ingested .


As for dosing.... please don't use me as a baseline or as a guide as to what YOU should dose . I think I may have had some confounding factors which allowed me to dose higher - I took bacopa today and strong opiates....


I was IV'ing around 80mgs. Its nice. No rush though. The visuals I am getting are funny, the white background of this forum had pink slow moving landscape-creture. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


I'll report more as the research continues;will post mecke, marquis and madelin reageant test pictures tomorrow

I'm completely retracting my previous post. Whatever happened - It had to do with me and not the drug. 


The MXM that I have doesn't dissolve into solution without heat, but with a little bit of heat - it's just fine. I stirred the fuck out of it and it wouldn't stop looking like milky water until I added heat, then it was 100% clear, left no bullshit in the spoon - it does seem very clean and fine to inject. I've done 2 shots tonight and it worked out just fine. I was even paranoid and careful about it and let the solution completely cool before I injected it, and it stayed a clear solution, didn't gel up or get all weird on me at all. I don't know what happened last time honestly...........I don't think it was the MXM that did anything, I think I fucked up the shot or some weird shit. I wasn't using my normal points - and I think that was 99% of the problem.


I was using a 1cc 30G Long - when I normally roll with 1cc 31G Shorts. I did 2 shots tonight to give this compound a real go around. I have a huge dissociative tolerance so I started at 100mgs. It's definitely a happy medium between Ketamine and MXE. It's a very gentle compound. I could have gone to sleep if I wanted to............Then about 1.5 hours later I decided to go a little further and see what's up - I IV'd 150mgs, it had a bit of a punch to it for me. I definitely had a K-Tarded moment trying to put all of my gear away, it made me laugh out loud - so I definitely was definitely feeling it. People who are not tolerant to Dissociatives - this will more than likely be a nice intro into what the Disco's are all about. I would imagine that someone less tolerant than myself would get some cool closed eye visuals and possibly some cool open eyed visuals or distortion.


For me, so far it's been more of just a feel good, depression reliever than anything psychedelic. I haven't 'noticed too much wonkiness or super interesting music appreciation like I get with MXE. The one downfall of this compound - to me personally - is the texture of it. The fluffiness reminds me of MPA almost, it has a clumpy, floury, type texture to it. 50mgs of MXE compared to 50mgs MXM - The MXM looks like 2-3 times as much. I used to enjoy both bumps and IV'ing MXE - I don't even think I could sniff 100mgs MXM. If it were equally potent as MXE - The fluffy texture wouldn't matter as much, because you would only need 25-50mg bumps and that would be doable, even with the fluff - but for me - I will never sniff MXM. It would take a STUPID quantity to get me even buzzed, and I wouldn't want to sniff that much of this compound. It's not a very enjoyable line to do, and it has way more of that Ketamine sting to it than the smoothness of MXE. I did try a few 40-50mg test bumps before I went to the Points. It does taste like Ketamine a lot though - which is cool with me - it just lacks the menthol cool of K.


If people are having good results taking MXM orally - I would stick with that if you don't IM or IV - and I DO NOT recommend ever giving that a try. Using Needles can be more addictive than the drugs you put in them to some extent. Anyways, I'm getting off topic. This compound is way less speedy than MXE - it's very chill and laid back. It may be Psychedelic or Cubistic for some people - that all depends on tolerance though. I would imagine for a novice - a good starting point would be 25-50mgs orally or nasally. The dose curve doesn't seem to be too steep. Tolerance does build quickly though. Duration is about 2-3 hours. Maybe longer Oral. I personally don't like taking drugs orally - I'm too impatient.


Where MXE makes me feel on point and on top of my game, ready to go find an adventure to get into - MXM makes me feel like if I smoked Dissociative Weed if that makes sense. For me - It's quite lazy, I don't really know what to do with myself. I tried to watch a movie and couldn't pay attention. I tried to listen to music and almost fell asleep laying down in the dark with headphones on and eyes closed. It's an interesting molecule - I think a lot of people will like it quite a fucking bit. It's a very balanced version of both Ketamine and MXE.


My only complaint - it's a little weak for me, but at the same time, it's still fun and enjoyable. MXE is the get shit fucking done, go to work and function disco - MXM is the fucking chill and kick it with the homies and laugh at some dumb shit disco. It reminds of some good nuggets and a few benzos, with some trippiness. I'll always like MXE more - but MXM is definitely it's own thing - and it's pretty cool. 


I hope this adds some insight. I think this is what a lot of people were hoping MXE or NEK were going to be. Ketamine is still way weirder and trippier. MXE is speedier and more visual and weird and just fucking space cadet status, MXM is their laid back little nephew. He just fucking kicks it all day and feels good.


The one thought I had as an ex-opiate abuser, current opiate maintenance user is - this stuff may really help make withdrawals bearable, because it is quite warm and fuzzy. 


Quick Question.............Has anyone who IV's ever had what I mentioned happened? The barrel just filled up with blood super quick, all the way to the top when I registered and clogged. At the bottom of the barrel, between 0-15 units, the blood was super dark, and there was just like a little mini sized clump of gel textured, clotted blood. It was really weird. I've never had this happen with 31G Shorts, but sometimes, when I use a 30G Long or Short, this has happened to me a couple of other times. I know it's off topic - but it kind of trips me out. The other times it happened were with speed - never dissociatives. Any thoughts IV users?

> I put around 90mgs in a spoon, gave it a few stirs, it dissolved pretty well without any heat, but there was a little left at the bottom, so I bumped it with a lighter for a second - nice clean, clear solution. I tie off, put the point in, loosened the tie, pulled back to register the blood - this is where everything starts getting really weird....It registers and very quickly fills my point from 45-50 units to 90 units - I try and press the plunger because I'm in the vein - No go. The plunger wouldn't drop. I take the point out of my arm - try and squirt it out into my spoon first - still No Go, it clogged my syringe enough that it wouldn't even go out the end of the needle. I have a whole G of MXM - so I decide to just take the plunger out, and dump the solution out into a triple layered paper towel to inspect the solution. It was a pain in the ass trying to get it to come out - and near the the beginning of the barrel, between 0-15 units or so, the blood was quite dark and thick looking. No I did not hit an Artery - I've only had that happen once and I KNOW what that shooting pain is like. So I tap out the barrel and finally get the last thick, dark units to come out. There was a little dark, gel textured looking ball which was what had clogged up the point. I don't know what the fuck it was - but it seemed like the MXM gelled up in the syringe. That is the only conclusion that I can come up with.

I don't want to scare anyone, this is just my experience...it was just very bizarre and not something that generally happens. Maybe the heat did something to it and if you just wait for it to dissolve, it's all good - but something just didn't seem right. It seemed to dissolve very quick and easy, mostly - and then it just got all weird. It was completely non injectable. Take this statement as you will. Just be careful out there...

I've done about 5 grams of MXM via IM every time and I've yet to experience anything like you describe. It always dissolves very easily with a little heat applied and stays completely dissolved.

The only time I've had barrels/heads clog is from poxy Methoxphenidine and shit quality/cut Ketamine, but so far none of my MXM has behaved in this manner.


I'm thinking perhaps there were contaminents present that you may not of been aware of? Does your MXM appear similar to that of the picture that I posted a few posts back? 


I'm no expert when it comes to IV'ing but one thing that springs to mind is if your head was clogged by the MXM, how did the blood manage to register in the barrel? Or do you think perhaps the blood coming into contact with the MXM through the head made it congeal on contact? Have you managed to successfully IV the MXM before or was this your first attempt?

Oh wow. MXM and weed are friends. Doesn't have that push that MXE gives, resulting in a very calm  clear haze.


A feeling of fresh magic!


My first romp with it has left me perfectly whelmed. Hints of mxe and ketamine both, as others have mentioned. Ha, basically exactly what I was expecting. Thanks everyone who contributed before me, in agreement this one is a keeper to have in the family.

Partly because this is new and we don't really have any firm dosages set in place due to how much the tolerance of those who've tried it and reported back will vary, but also due to the fact that the isomers may vary between vendors (with the S-isomer presumably being stronger like with MXE and Ketamine, I'd assume).

I need about 350mg+ to K-hole on vial-dried ketamine, insufflated.


My typical MXE dose is between 50-60mg.


On MXM, I need a minimum of at least 200mg insufflated in order to even feel anything, but once I mix it with MXE, it feels great. Top it off with weed, and it feels like a dissociative MDMA lol.


I hate snorting MXM, I love snorting K. Maybe the stuff I have isn't MXM? I dunno, but it definitely is a dissociative. I wish I could discuss sources here, because I'm curious as to why my MXM is different than what everybody else is talking about. Maybe I can take this to PM with someone? Anybody care to help me out here?

Getting to know the subtleties and intricacies of this one, of which there are many. Experience with other arylcyclos comes in handy when testing the waters. It is soft spoken magic. Sophisticated?

I did go the IV route, I had to peak behind the curtain, after testing nasal (didn't like)and oral (better).

I actually got a full on ringer on one shot. Brought me back!


I like how it is cooler than MXE, but not as cold as ketamine. A nice 'temperature'!

Hello everyone. Tried it last night. Previous photo looks like mine too. As for effects I felt it is the sweet spot between ketamine and mxe.


I did 30 + 20 + 20 + 30 in 1 hour. 

Let's say 100mg = 40mg mxe 

As potency regarding effects I can say that. But my question is, whould it make a difference if I do 50 + 50 or directly 100mg? I'll be happy if someone enlighten me in this.


Because of the comments going around lately about a certain vendor  I was a little bit scared to not feel anything, but it didn't end like that. But for a lightweight like myself, the dose didn't seem ok either.

I just thought I would chime in that I did about 400mg's of this last night, 100mg's sublingual, 300 nasal, had about 5 beers and I definitely felt like it was half way between k and mxe. I have a huge k tolerance but no mxe tolerance and I was jacked for 4 hours. 


Here is the downside, I went to sleep last night at about 4 am and woke up today at about 3 pm with insane heart palpitations, I had a new e-cig mod in the mail so I ran to my mailbox cause it's freezing out and I felt like I was going to pass out when I got back, and my head was pounding. I imagine my blood pressure was through the roof and I'm pretty athletic. I have since eaten 3 bananas and now I'm good. Don't know what that's all about. I think I'll just stick to k.

The tolerance between the different arylcyclohexlamines does not cross over completely. After doing 800mg MXM over two days I got more wonked than I expected when I switched to MXE yesterday after a week tolerance break.

I did oral. As far as I read, oral definitely > nasal. It was same for me in mxe too.

I can't get into details as I couldn't go where I want. But somehow I felt it was warmer than mxe.

Hold that thought ^


I think it would be good if people using this right now could help by giving their opinion on dosage ranges.


Is MXM 1.5 or 2 or 2.5 times less potent than MXE ?

With 2.5 we may end up with basically the potency of ketamine. However it is quite possible that the dose-response curve is different or that MXM reacts differently using different ROAs by comparison.


The following is the tentative dosage 'guideline' if you will for **MXE** from Erowid:


*Insufflated:*


Threshold	5 - 20 mg

Light	      10 - 50 mg

Common	20 - 60 mg

Strong	25 - 100+ mg


*Oral*:


Threshold	8 - 20 mg

Light	      10 - 30 mg

Common   40 - 60 mg

Strong    50 - 100+ mg


The following is the dosage suggestion range for **ketamine** from Erowid:


*Insufflated:*


Threshold	10 - 15 mg

Light	        15 - 30 mg

Common	30 - 75 mg

Strong	60 - 125 mg

The K Hole	100 - 250 mg


*Oral:*


Threshold	40 - 50 mg

Light	        50 - 100 mg

Common	75 - 300 mg

Strong	200 - 450 mg

The K Hole	500 + mg


How does that sound applied to MXM? If you think it's very far off, please also let us know if you have very low or very high body weight, and if you have strong dissociative tolerance (and haven't really tried MXE for a while). In other words: it would be good to know if there are other explanations, and it would be excellent to hear from people with relatively low or no tolerance to any of these.

Do NOT take these dosages as information or an answer to anything - this is a question!

I just took a 1mg allergy test. I am going to hold off taking a real dose for the time being. I don't feel like being a guinea pig until I hear some more experiences.

Please please please please please please **don't** treat this like Ketamine. It's just as potent as MXE. Even if it might not "seem" like it for us veterans. For newbs and light-causual users, MXM will chew you up and spit you out if you dose stupid.

So does this chemical cause tolerance way quicker than MXE or 3-MeO-PCP? Friend of mine tried MXM, had an awesome night with apparently zero negative effects and 100% fun, but the next day, only very little or no results with the same doses or higher. I used my bit of MXM combined with 3-MeO-PCP in, well, a fragile state of mind so I can't really comment on this, but it did seem like MXM had very little effect on me on any day (cross tolerance may be an issue with me.. duh).

I would be extremely surprised if that was the case. there is no reason whatsoever to suggest it would cause tolerance any differently to methoxetamine.

I beg to differ sir ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) First of all I'm far from a veteran, I've never even gone beyond 80mg in MXE. And on 80mg, I was in a fucking different reality. As I told before it can even be less than half of the potency of MXE. 


Or,


Vendor is selling weak products which I hardly believe as they are famous of their products quality.

Same potency wouldn't make sense, theoretically that goes against dissociative (arylcyclohexylamine) SAR... and it is no coincidence that MXE came first and that it has an ethyl, it was very consciously chosen because around N-ethyl and a little bit N-propyl length these compounds apparently have optimal potency / duration. Methyl is apparently metabolized a little too (or 'more') easily and quickly.


Anyway not to be a dick about it, reported experiences with this are really appreciated. Shame but for the time being I cannot participate.

And trying to match dosage range trendlines from K or MXE does not mean that it should be suggested MXM needs to be treated just the same as other dissociatives we know.


I'll try logging links to trip reports with MXM in the OP of this thread.

After some careful consideration I'm having second thoughts about posting what I consider to be safe or reasonably safe doses for those who have yet to try MXM. Although the likelihood is small, I just can't deal with being held responsible for bad experiences and the like should anyone encounter them.


Having said that I definitely feel that some guidelines need to be established, I'm just not sure I'm exactly comfortable with people "taking my word for it". And it would seem that what I would deem a "small" dose, others may not at all.

So the best I can do for you guys really is to just offer my opinion, rather than straight up "advice".


I'd say that in my experience, MXM really is no less potent than MXE. I'd say it's just as "potent", but perhaps it's perceivable effects may not seem quite as "intense" as MXE's. <-- This point I cannot stress enough.

 Unless of course you are silly with dosing, and then things will become well, very intense.


I think if you want to stick to any sort of "guidelines" then just treat MXM as if it were as potent as MXE. And refer to the dosages listed above from Erowid. It's better to be safe than sorry.


Honestly I feel like MXM is very potent but in a less tangible sense, it's really quite difficult to put in to words.


The difficulty with putting things out there like "MXM is potentially half as potent as MXE" will lead people to think that they just need to double their usual dose of MXE, when doing MXM. And seriously, this is not the mentality that should be surrounding this substance.


One thing that I didn't mention in my previous trip report or comments is that MXM really comes alive when my eyes are closed!

Nobody should dive in with a certain dose assumed to be effective as a full dose. I know plenty of people do this, but the responsibility of taking the risk involved with that is always for the user who makes executive decisions about that. Especially when a drug is relatively new or uncommon, it is wise to start with an allergy dose which is only a fraction of what is considered a full dose... IMO more than to avoid allergic reactions, which honestly almost never happen as far as I know, that is more about avoiding cases of mistaken identity and interactions with other drugs or medications in one's system. You might call that allergy related, fine by me.

After that you slowly work your way up to what is said to be a dose appropriate for the intensity level you are looking for. Although you learn to gauge your own reactions to a drug / batch each time, that does not make dosage range indications redundant. We still hold that in the back of our minds and this helps us make gross mistakes of whole orders of magnitudes, and like I suggested already: some people are really not as careful as they ought to be.


Reporting our findings honestly contributes, but it is not meant as prescription so that people don't have to think about it anymore (like picking up medications from the pharmacy).


Fine if you don't want to play along boida, but let's not spread misinformation just because you want to be overcautious for other people. Misinformation will sooner or later lead to confusion problems and even incidents, so please don't. I would prefer that people keep posting their own experiences, and everyone who wants to experiment with a novel drug like MXM should start low and work their way up - NOT use what someone else posted as a prescription leaflet. Always remember that there are different batches possible of different purity, or different substances even. So no one piece of information must be assumed as fact, but many pieces of information together can be used to piece together trends, tendencies, propensities.... it is merely provisional data that for the time being best describes how people on average react to the product being described.


Having a rough picture is a lot more practical to go on, even if you are going slow. Otherwise these people are forced to reinvent the wheel every single time. If everyone applied completely responsible titration methods and had infinite time and patience, that would be absolutely fine, but we must be realistic about the fact that this is not true.


This type of stuff is IMO the basics of approaching this.

It took 100mg's of this sublingual to feel anything, I then proceeded to do 3 100mg lines over the course of 3 hours and I started teetering on edge of a hole if anyone can relate to that. 


If I did that with k I would most certainly have holed. For what it's worth.

Perd, I don't understand how you can say, that you barely could feel 100 mg. One dose of 100 mg of the stuff I have, would blow me away.


I have a very light tolerance to arylcyclohexylamines, if any at all. I do know ketamine and MXE very well, but I never developed any tolerance, because I never abused them or used them on consecutive days, except at festivals. I weigh about 70 kg.


To me, a line of 25-35 mg yield an effect somewere in between light and the low end of common. Looking at Solipsis charts from Erowid, that would make it about as potent as ketamine. But here is my problem, it's not ketamine, it's a totally different Drug. Duration is different, the dose/response curve for sure will be different. And it could never be passed off as ketamine, in my opinion, eventhough they have similarities. Oral bioavailability is also most likely going to be different than ketamine, but I haven't tried it oral yet though.


In the beginning I was trying to guesstimate the potency compared to MXE, and I thought it was maybe 2/3 the potency, then I thought, wait, maybe it's more like 1/2. The thing is, it's pointless to try to compare the potency in quarters or percentages, because as I already said; it's a different drug. Similar, yes, but also different. I think this comparing potency has to stop, because it's too difficult to gauge. We need to make a totally new dosage chart for MXM over time. 


30 mg for sure is a good light starting dose, insufflatted, for anyone without tolerance. It comes on pretty quick, so it's really easy to top up with more. Even though that dose wasn't as strong as a similar dose of MXE, I was still satisfied and didn't need to take more right away. So in the end, my doses actually came out same as with MXE. But not fucking me up more than I still was able to go out shopping.


What we can say, is that it is certainly less potent and has a shorter duration than MXE, but not by how much. In my humble opinion it's pointless to talk about.


I'm with Boida, in that its potency shouldn't be underestimated, because the effects are more subtle than MXE, but it surely has the power to be just as wonky. In the doses I've taken, it surely doesn't have the same sledgehammer in your face effects MXE can have, but it can still twist your world. Some hard core MXE freaks are going to be dissapointed with this one, but it deserves respect, both for being a beautiful chem, as well as surely having the ability to tear a first timers reality a new asshole. It's not NENK or 2-MeO-ketamine, for sure.


Solipsis. It doesn't seem that ketamine share the same SAR as the other arylcyclohexylamines we know, because if it did, NENK would have been a winner. There's an interesting piece of information in that fact.

Thank you, this was really all I was trying to convey. I didn't intend to spread mis-information about the substance for the sake of hand holding. I've tried my best from the start to provide as much informative information about MXM as I can. But honestly. This is one of those things that you just have to try for yourself because of it's unique, yet ironically similar effects.

I agree and I think it is due to the chloro sub. Everyone says that my 'chloroxetamine' (methoxetamine with methoxy swapped with chloro) would be stupid yet they are quick to jump on ketamine with other halo subs and the like. I don't want to go on too much of a ramble but methoxy switched to acetoxy on methoxetamine may hold promise, it is so annoying that aryls get little attention compared to other compounds. Why aren't we looking into methoxy-methylethamine? Someone pull up some other aryls from the past and you will see so many other ideas that haven't been explored.


Can we just start making these things yet? I wan't an isopropyl on the nitrogen to see what happens.

Ok so i finally got ahold of this baby!

Im in europe so i got it from within the region from a big site. (Is this ok to mention?)

It looks just like the picture here.


Anyway i am very experinced with dissios but have low tolerance since i dont binge or take them that often.

I started off with about 50mg in a gelcap and the  went out shopping.

after about 1hour i felt some slight wonkiness and synastethia happening.

Also i ran into 4people i know which rarely happens unless im high on dissios. (Very cool huh)


Anyway when i got home i plugged about 50mg more followed by another 50 when the first plugging started to come on.

I wanted to really get a good feel for the chem since it felt very clean but strong.


I smoked some hash and layed on the couch just floating for a good hour zonked out.

No hole but this was very nice indeed.

Very K like but with a touch of mxe warmness.


The biggest pro with this chem is how clean it feels, i prefer Ketamine over all other dissios since it leaves my body quickly and doesnt linger on for days.

Well this felt similar, because when i sobered up i felt sober, barely any residual wonkyness or stimulation.


Also this stuff is quite soft around the edges, the 3/4-meo- pcp stuff is rough as hell and will shred you head off in higher doses.

This stuff feels like cotton candy or something.


Tonight i will try to hole and report back tomorow.

But so far i am very impressed.

Hovever i can understand if people with tolerance think its bunk material, cause its quite subtle at lower doses and alot milder than other similar chems.

So I've been experimenting with MXM over the last week.


As an MXE alternative I'm disappointed, but as a Ketamine alternative it's not bad. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I did ~400 mg last night spaced out over three doses orally. I holed. A different feeling than MXE or ketamine for sure. It did the trick though. Not a feeling I'd want to experience in public- prolly end up in detox... It was a good time though. As a side note regarding dosage- I did a lot of MXE and K in the past and have quite a tolerance to arylcyclohexylamines.

Yesterday I started with 60mg directly. To be honest I fell a sleep before effects come I guess. I don't really understand this substance. Normally I am really sensitive, I thought maybe I started low last time, but again this time 60mg did nothing. So I've decided, for me dose-wise it is nearly 3/1 MXE.

I've found it entirely lacking in stimulation, and seeing how medically these are used to knock people out, it may not be too uncommon. My girlfriend fell asleep shortly after trying MXM the first time, whereas MXE usually keeps her awake, well past normal sleeping time.

The MXM that is going around is NOT pure. An acetone wash left of 250 mgs...cleans up to 125! Washed product was much purer, better, more fun. This is the filtrate. The steps I followed were thus  :


1.Add acetone to product

2.Filter through coffee filter 

3. Save product in filter. 

4. Enjoy !


Anyone else notice tan Mxm when added to water? Once processed, the extracted product is way, way better. Pure white. 


Please report back with results.


I would imagine it is completely soluble in acetone, yes? Someone with a little more chem experience can extrapolate it from the structure a little better than I can...


Used klean-strip (virgin solvent) for the record.

Any water content will dissolve the MXM.

The discussion sparked off about potency still seems to help, I have already agreed with you multiple times that it is not the *same* as what we are trying to compare it to but rest assured people are still trying to make comparisons to K and MXE everywhere in this thread. And despite your disagreement Fagott, you are still providing helpful information. I never wanted you to come up with a simple equation for the potency and certainly not for the qualitative differences... but you are already helping to nuance it, still by using comparisons in the process.

My point is, if you don't use any frame of reference to describe something, it will be pretty useless.


lenses, you can try doing solubility test on what should be the purified MXM, if you keep losing part of it then something is wrong with your procedure.

TLC chromatography could also be an option.

And yes use desiccant to dry the acetone and maybe cool it before use.

A last crude way is to see what the potency is of the filtrate and filtrant.

Thanks Solipsis. I really *was* trying my best to be helpfull ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Maybe when you've tried it, you'll understand better were I'm coming from. People can talk about 1/3, 1/2's etc all day, without anybody being the wiser. Dose, tolerance, level of effects, that's going to be helpfull information. But I don't think we are really disagreeing about that.


I don't understand if it's me you are talking to, when you say: " I already agreed with you multiple times that......etc". Maybe you confuse me with Boida? Because the two of us haven't discussed potency before in this thread, to my knowledge. And the only intention I had was to convey my opinion in regards to MXM: that potency is really difficult to gauge in comparison to MXE. Other people might not think it is, and will be able to pinpoint it at 43,5 percent the potency of MXE, fine with me. What ever, who cares.......


I have a hard time believing the MXM I have is impure, because it's really snow white. Not that that is a guarantee of anything, but still..... Lenses, is you MXM from a U.S vendor? Mine is from a eastern european one. Seems to be more than one batch going around maybe?

There's only one batch of MXM going around that I know of. It was made in a rather significant amount and spread around as a test to see how people take to it.


Now who cuts it inbetween is an entirely different matter and not for discussion on this forum.


What happens when a new chemical is introduced is it is special ordered in a large amount (we don't need to get specific) and then dispersed among the major sub vendors who disperse it to their customers and so on. What happens in the chain is a predictable thing that happens with all drugs but if you want to discuss that, there are two easily found forums for such things. Bluelight is not that place. We are here for harm reduction and information sharing purposes.

The solvent was not virgin... I doubt they are cutting it . Possibly an imurity. I DID notice it being much more potent. It is from our overseas friends.

For what it's worth, I had the two previous batches of MXE from the same vendor as my MXM analyzed via GCMS and they were both "analytically pure". 


But impurities do happen, and it's highly unlikely large synths would just be thrown away so would probably make it down the distribution chain. 


I doubt I'll get a chance to analyze this small order of MXM, but will try to do so when I get another shipment and share any relevant results.

Alright, first trial with this lady.  I have a moderate Disso tolerance, a marked sensitivity to all medicines, and a gift of reverence for all potential allies.  


Took MXE last night, so I didn't expect much from it, but MXM is NICE.  Real Nice.  "Dissociative Marshmallow" is a perfect way to describe her, as some have said.  Very easy on the body/mind.  I have much experience with MXE, no direct experience with Ketamine, and moderate experience with 3-meo-PCP.  K seems like the DMT (visionary) of the disso world.  MXE has coca-like (MDMA-like) vibes with a healthy addition of shroomery, some PCP mania, and wonky confusion to boot.  MXM is exactly what I would picture as a sweet, gentle sister to MXE.


MXM has no mania in moderate amounts (we're talkin' ++ level).  If MXE were the "shrooms" of the disso-world, MXM would be the MDMA of said realm.  The "PCP-side" of MXE seems to be completely absent in her, along with the psychedelic edge.  The disso-space is clearly felt, but dopamine clarity, warm euphoria, and compassion seem to define this ally.  


3-meo-PCP, compared to MXE, is a clearer, less wonky, but more manic replacement.  It's all good, until you hit that point where the mania drives you bonkers, taking you down further the rabbit-hole than MXE could ever dream.  Not recommended, in my opinion, for deep journeys.  MXE is like a razor's edge between MDMA-warmth and clinical observation.  It's rough, yet forgiving; harsh, though comforting.  MXM takes MXE's backbone, and replaces harsh introspection for feel-good euphoria.  


Like MDMA, MXM is very kind, very considerate, and won't rub your face in your shadow-side, or make you think of things you don't want to.  Again, I'm talking ++ level, here. 


After an allergy-test, I took 15 mg MXM, orally, to start, and then 45 minutes later took 20 mgs.  45 minutes later i took another 20 mgs.  I would compare the overall feel to 25 mg's of MXE for me, personally; which is enough to fully "stone" me, without bringing me to "hole" territory.  The outward, talk-to-yourself, speaking-in-tongues, sensory-romp phase.  


Redosing works nothing like MXE.  You can't chase MXM with as much success as MXE.  I would personally start higher next time, and move on from there, not bothering with "chasing it".  I personally like to drink medium doses of Coca Powder after disso's, to clarify and organize the lofty, ungrounded perceptions that sometimes linger after a deep trip.  I always wait until my heart rate calms down, and with MXM, I feel safe to combine stimulants more readily than MXE.  She's a lot less stimulating and more sedate; reminds me of Coca tea, really.  Clear, warm, grounded, lovely.  


Start slow, as always, but once you're sure you have the right medicine, don't be *too* afraid.  She doesn't bite like MXE, in moderation.

I don't think it will keep working well if you consume 5g a week. It might get you through the acute phase of drug withdrawal, but if the tolerance curve is like MXE, if you don't change your ways you will be back on junk,benzos once the MXM honeymoon ends.

Just be careful about using a new substance during withdrawals from anything, particularly withdrawals from benzos - we all know seizure threshold is lowered significantly during benzo withdrawal and that those seizures can cause some real damage or in rarer cases fatalities, so throwing a substance into the mix that may also lower seizure threshold could be a very real recipe for disaster..


Particularly given that MXE itself appears to have some SERT affinity (presumably as a reuptake inhibitor), this would lend weight to the idea that MXE would reduce the seizure threshold somewhat, and MXM, while a different substance, is close enough we can assume there could be a similar risk. Then on top of that you have to throw in the complete unknown vector that comes with what differences this has over MXE and other such substances, and you're left with more reason that this should probably not even remotely be considered during such withdrawals.


I'm assuming it was withdrawals you were referring to anyway based on your post - either way, be careful please, just the fact you went through 5g of it already suggests some extra caution should be thrown in, excess is a problem in itself but everyone here (myself included in the past) seems to forget that these are entirely new things and so we don't even know what's in store if we overdo it just a little.

Do you mean 3-Methoxy swapped for a 3-Chloro, or 3-Methoxy swapped for a 2-Chloro as in Ketamine?


Because the latter is NENK/N-Ethyl-Nor-Ketamine, and has already been done. The former would probably have dramatic potency issues based on the limited research I've discussed with people who've actually gone in and worked with halogen substitutions outside of the 2 and 4 positions, unless my memories fail me. Either way even with my limited grasp of SAR I can't see a 3-Chloro group doing any good, at best I could see a weaker N-Ethyl-Nor-K, at worst something requiring even higher dosages than that.

MXM. 


This drug is best taken sublingually, i cant be sure of the purity of my sample but my sweet spot was about 100mg. I would recommend starting around 25mg. I would highly advise against snorting this product, it burns and seems to be very wasteful. 


Taken under the tongue, it can be felt within minutes, usually before it fully dissolves you'll feel a disso blanket wrap you up and it just gets better and better. I get a vibration sensation in my body as it comes on, almost like an opiate high/dmt/mephedrone/mdma comeup vibe. This is definitely dangerous territory for heroin addict refugees. I could see people getting out of control with this stuff and using it daily. 


The euphoria is beyond imaginable, MDMA will never again ever be a consideration for me at all because MXM has completely replaced that role entirely  for me. (I'd say a perfect replacement if it werent for the sexual aspects) 


It definitely isn't an MXE replacement, however, and you won't get introspection, psychedelia, or crazy fucked up dissociation. You'll get the most incredible euphoric-blanket of dissociative-bliss imaginable, and quite a bit of clever wit added into the mix. Visual acuity seems to sharpen quite a bit as well, more similar to tryptamine compounds than traditional dissociatives. User also appears to gain a very apparent increase in cosmic knowledge. 


MXM is quite possibly the most euphoric substance i've ever happened across.

6 people tried this on friday. We started the day with al-lad at around 2:00pm, then after we came down and were enjoying the afterglow we decided to eat some MXM.

3 people took 20mg

3 people took 30mg, me included.

All doses were parachuted.


We all agreed that the effects were very, very weak, if any! And no, none of us have disso tolerance, long or short term. 

I dont know what could have happened. Our bellies were kinda full and that could have delayed the effects, but I dont think it would make it weaker. 

Also, maybe the fact that we dosed al-lad on the same day (150ug)  and had already came down could have contributed to the lack, although it doesnt make much sense, since each drug acts on completely different receptors, I guess...


I will try 50mg next time, probably this week and probably sublingually.


^crashing: have you compared the effects oral vs sub?

What is the comparison on duration, potency, etc?

Yes ive tried oral, snorting and sublingual. Hoenstly the drug really ONLY worked when dissolved sublingually and not swallowed. Snorting and oral were both incredibly weak, unlike MXE. Sublingually, we could feel effects nearly instantaneously. Comeup was noted by a heat flushing feeling followed by a steady vibration throughout the limbs, peaked at about 1 hour after that and leveled off for 2-3 hours before dropping off sharply with a slight comedown characterized by a moderately heavy heart beat for ~30 mins. Redosing worked at varying time stages throughout a 24 hour time frame, and no tolerance was noted.


Like i said, my sweet spot after a few trial and errors was 100mg sublingually but that might be a bit heavy for some, i tend to appreciate larger disso doses. But i had already ingested quite a bit of the substance before i figured out to dissolve it on my tongue, so i probably had good baseline going before i really got into it. After a few of these larger doses over several hours I was in the most zen like euphoric dissociative state possible. It was the most euphoric high i've ever experienced. 20mg is probably not enough, good starting spot is probably around 50mg but i've heard of people freaking out at 80mg, so it's hard to guess. 


I suspect maybe at even higher doses this stuff could get pretty wild, but i was totally fine at the level i was at. It's definitely a very unique diss. A hole may be possible in higher doses but it just didn't feel like that type of drug to me. Shines quite well at the moderate level.


Edit- Also, Weed mixed with this stuff ok, it can sort of increase the overall madness level but mainly seems to bring the heart beat into higher awareness, and overall didn't really seem to click with MXM and not worth the reduced clarity.

For sublingually, how long do I need to hold it under my tongue? Then spit it?

I was letting it dissolve completely in my mouth, swallowing about 5 mins later.


It definitely had an effect when snorted, but it was short lived and stimmy, and it was sort of like not doing enough MDMA where you feel something but it's not really "it".

Ideally of course, until you can no longer taste it. About 10-15 minutes should suffice though.

I seriously doubt it. I didn't bother with other ROAs and went straight to plugging, which worked nicely. People who are confused about not getting more bang for their buck haven't properly utilized their assholes (or needles, though I hope you'd touch your butt before puncturing your skin if you're on the fence about either). Granted, it's nowhere near as potent as MXE. It's been awhile since I've used ketamine. I think it's stronger than that by weight, but not a lot stronger. The potency is reflected *somewhat* in the price per gram, like with most new designer drugs.

Well yeah and IV better yet right? 


But i mean, it was a couple people redosing all night. So sublingual was best for us i suppose. But yeah im sure plugging may be slightly better, if even. I'm telling you rubbing it all over the mouth and gums, i could feel it before it was fully dissolved every time.


I know, but it's a hassle.


But yeah man, if you're getting really good priced MXE, it could definitely be MXM.

Tastes like Xanax mixed with 2cb and MXE, pretty bad but could be way worse. It also has a mild numbing effect, so by the time its mostly dissolved you can't taste much.

Copied this over from the [MXE thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/745138-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Methoxetamine-MXE-Thread-Part-16-Sweet-16-mind-control-machine?p=12799010&viewfull=1#post12799010) since it's more so related to MXM. I'm not doubting the claim in the post because it sounds plausible, more so interested to know if there is crystalline MXM going around. The MXM I had was very much the opposite of crystals - large, fluffy powder, looked the same as what another user posted [here](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/732888-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Methoxmetamine-MXM-Thread-V1-Note-this-is-not-MXE!?p=12719457&viewfull=1#post12719457). Anyone seen a crystalline batch yet, or is it mostly the fluff?

To be honest it started out crystalline and halfway through the night it turned into a fluffy powder, i shit you not.. Seemed to be severely affected by humidity. It started as a fine crystal i could pour out of the bag, and several hours of opening and closing it and it was sticky like 2cb.

Does anyone who's tried MXM out have any experience with Diphenidine or Methoxphenidine and feel up for making a comparison to their effects? I've never tried MXE (though have done ket a few times) but my most recent and heavily used dissociatives have been the 'phenidines, would be helpful to hear suggestions on how this compares to them ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I plugged a dose last night for the first time (didn't weigh, I used a key to dig some out of of the bag my estimate is 60-80 mg) and I did not like it at all. No euphoria at all, I just felt very dizzy and dissacociated. Nothing like MXE. I almost felt a bit nauseated.

Diphenidine and Methoxphenidine are not even in the same league as MXM. If you liked either of those substances, then MXM is going to be absolutely magical for you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I banged my head against Diphenidine and Methoxphenidine for months trying to squeeze some sort of pleasant experience out of them, as they were literally the only family of dissociatives that I could get my hands on at the time. Which was especially painful as MXE and K used to be almost free-flowing around me, then it all dried up, and the bad times set in. Then MXM came along and saved the day! Don't hesitate friend!

Yeah the phendines have this weird "fuzzy/muddled" background that really pales in comparison to the hexylamines.  Phenidine was just terrible.  total waste of time.  Methoxyphedine was a'ight, if you had nothing else in the galaxy.  MXM isn't very trippy, so don't expect MXE, but it's a nice, nice chemical worth shaking hands with.  I wouldn't call MXM my new mistress or anything though….=)


also, to clarify, i find the phenidine's very very boring.  like can't have a single productive or insightful thought the whole time.  just waste of space.  can't wait for it to end.  methoxyyphenidine at least has a dopamine push so it's a little clearer and more euphoric but still has that BLAH background.  


MXM is just nice nice nice.  I wouldn't call it revelation, like i would MXE.  but she's a worthy addition to the hexylo team.

It's not 'trippy' but serene and calm, but at the same time can give this perpetual tryptaminic visual space if you dig deep, it's pretty neat stuff.

I think I know what you mean there! I didnt explore high doses yet, but I already experienced some changes in my visual space from low doses. No thing to on my face, more of a breathing walls thing.

Last time I took double the dose I took on the first, 60mg, and this time I undoubtedly felt it! Next time I will definitely take 80mg or more, but 60mg was enough to put me in a very relaxed state. At this dose , the dissociation is kind of in the background. What is clearer is just the happy, warm and laid back mood.

It's well known that MXE increases heart rate, how much is dependent on the individual. For me MXE can make me palpitate and my BP jumps from ~110/70 to ~140/80 with high doses. Heart rate typically hovers around the 90 bpm mark, 60bpm is my normal HR.

I personally did notice a very quick ramping of body temperature on the come up and also a pretty pronounced period of increased HR on the comedown, which suggests is does boost BP and HR the whole time, at least for me.

Me either actually, it makes me feel pretty relaxed and chilled out.  I have never found it stimulating other than it keeps me awake and makes me want to move, but just because moving is interesting and pleasurable.

Thanks Crashing ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). 


Have any of you guys actually taken your vitals on MXE? I made sure I wasn't alone in regards to finding MXE to increase BP/HR, I made sure to google "MXE increased heart rate" before posting (although I've heard tachycardia associated with MXE prior)... it's very common, even listed on just about every list of potential MXE side-effects, incuding the few pub-med studies I looked through.

Unsuprising? Cause NMDA antagonists like ketamine are not sedatives like some people assume, and the monoaminergic activity (reuptake inhibition) would mean some sympathomimetic effects which would include elevated BP/HR next to the increased talkativeness and euphoria etc before the mental monoaminergic effects become overshadowed by the NMDA antagonism... and if a high dose is not a standard recipe for an even more elevated BP/HR, you still might expect tachycardia in especially sensitive individuals.. let alone when used in combination.

That could be an explanation - doesn't mean that you will find this is necessarily a very tachycardic drug. But yeah my experiences would kind of support it.

Just to clarify, this is with MXM right? Seems MXE discussion got a bit intertwined on this topic...

25 mg nasal worked for me. Lucky responder I guess. Nice drug. A little less potent maybe to mxe but still nice and not exactly weak. Of course it depends on your tolerance and such how you perceive the effects of mxm.

easiest way i could describe / help:


  -- mxp: takes forever to kick in (45min to 4 hrs), then it's a strange dissociation for an hour or two then onto a manic / wide awake phase for an hour or two

    -- if you dose too high with mxp that dissociation time turns into blackout time (for me that's 300mg+), but then back to the manic phase


  -- mxm: ketamine without the ketamine? i don't have the typical lowered eyelids from sedation but i have the robot-walk of ketamine. i'm not dropping into the hole and losing touch with reality but i still can barely walk. i get the one eye wanting to close, extremeties feel a little numb, my mind is wandering all over the place.  not much body dissociation in total. 100mg oral + 2 X 50mg insufflated boosters (i have a huge ketamine tolerance if that matters)  definitely losing focus through my eyes. i don't experience any of the phantom sounds that seemed to plague me with ketamine. definitely more nodding, almost opiate-like, there's nothing keeping me awake here except for my past experiences with dissociatives and wanting to push on.


none of the mania of mxe / mxp has been present so far. honestly, i'm really enjoying this compound. haven't figured out whether oral or insufflated will work best for me. 


overall: thumbsups. will try again in a few days and see if it has the same effect or not.


am i wasting my time insufflating?

From my experience the effects are significantly less pronounced when I have insufflated MXM, but that might be just because I've grown accustomed to administering via IM

The first paragraph of my post was a comparison of mxp (which I don't like). The rest of the post dealt with my experience with mxm (which I really liked). I do think I'll just go straight for 150 mg swallowed next time. The 50 mg bumps didn't add all that much to the experience. Also, does anyone know if plugging uses roughly the same dosage as oral?

New delivery I received seems stronger than the first.... subbjectively obviously. I've been using the same ROA each time- works pretty well. Make a cup of instant chai and dissolve it in. Can barely taste it and effects usually come on within 45 minutes to an hour.

A few (?) have mentioned that taking this one sublingually results in the quickest come up - within minutes. Can others confirm this? I'm just wondering why someone would choose another ROA if the come up is so much slower...

so plugging is definitely the best method so far. that was 2.5 hours of space walking with only 100 mg. very enjoyable. i'm sure im or iv will be stronger but that's not a route i'm interested in trying yet. i'm very happy with this chemical, everything that mxp and mxe aren't without the super-mindfuck of ketamine. i'll be back.

Taking drugs in powder form sublingually is a pain i the arse... Firstly, MXM doesnt taste very good at all. Also, keeping powder under your tongue while you salivate is quite difficult...

This is not surprising, and why I was so confident about going straight to plugging. With MXE plugging is nearly indistinguishable from IM (a rare virtue, since it eliminates a lot of hassle and risk), so it seems whatever chemical properties these two very similar compounds posses allows for highly efficient absorption intrarectally.  If anybody knows what chemical properties make drugs absorb more efficiently by different ROAs I'd be curious to find out. I think it was Nuke who reported that ketamine's intrarectal potency could be raised to around the level of intranasal if the pH of the delivery solution was raised. If true, such findings could save a lot of peoples' nasal health/congestion.


EDIT: Yes, it was Nuke, at the end of [this thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/368797-Why-does-Ketamine-not-work-well-rectally).

500 mg oral last night. Amazing time. OEV and CEVs for hours. None of the overstimulated feeling I would often get from MXE. Just warm, soft, and trippy.

That's a hefty dose ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) for the sake of HR, what's your tolerance?


I didn't try MXM again since I wrote my first post in this tread. But I Partook again going to a party at a club, the weekend before last, were I had 3 lines of 30 mg. Well, one dose I put on my tongue, because I couldn't be bothered to stand in line for the toilet.


In spite of the duration being pretty short, I was tripping quite a lot when I got home, so it took a while before I could sleep, eventhough I was tired. It's almost like it built up in the body on every extra dose, but I guess MXE is like that too.


MXM might actually be half the potency and duration of MXE, but it's actually much more recreational, in my opinion, and it's just much more agreeable to me, mostly because it seems to almost lack any of MXE's "serotonergic" activity.

Very high tolerance. I have done way too much K and MXE in my life and I feel it causes a permanent cross-tolerance. I don't bother with K anymore because it just ends up being a waste of time and money. That 500 mg dose was split in two- 350 to begin and 150 to boost it up.

Nice. Although this stuff isn't a patch on Ketamine, Methoxetamine or 3-MeO-PCP it actually works (unlike N-ethyl-nor-ketamine) and doesn't cause the frightening memory blackouts and pounding headaches that the non-arylcyclohexylamine alternatives always gave me. So although I'd trade a hundred grams of this stuff for half a gram of MXE, I'm glad I can get dissociated on occasion without going through the horrifying ordeal that (for me) characterised the diphenidine/methoxphenidine experience.

First impressions on MXM:

Compared to MXE I found: Less dissociation and a calmer mental high. Shorter duration and less stimulation. A warmer body buzz and less confusion. 


I enjoyed it, but I couldn't shake the feeling that 'something' was missing. Definitely is lacking the punch of MXE.


Doses were 50 mg oral and insufflated. Several redoses.

The majority of this thread seems to be on the nomenclature of this substance. I am going to refer to it by the label my vendor sent over waters: "Methoxmetamine"


Has anyone tried freebasing this stuff? My ketamine preferred ROA is IM, and with MXE it was insufflation before I discovered freebasing it ([my post about freebase mxe here](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/748352-Freebase-MXE-diphenidine-is-damn-potent-and-an-excellent-antidepressant)). At the moment I am toking slowly on a small unmeasured amount of freebase (knocked off the Hcl using baking soda, will try ammonia and report back over the weekend.)


Thick "velvety" smoke a la MXE and it tastes somewhat like MXE. The headspace is nice and reminiscent of MXE, a substance I'm fond of. The caveat in this bioassay is a tinge of diphenidine tolerance, and the obvious point that the doses I'm toking are not measured. I wait about 2 minutes between each bellow of smoke (exhale) to titrate up as desired.

Completely agree! The diphenidine/methoxphenidine amnesia is disastrous. Diphenidine freebased has proven to me a valuable pick-me-up/anti-depressant or probably just a quick way to reach mania (not necessarily a good thing) but is unpredictable.

A thousand thank yous for this report, sir, for real. Gotta order and try it out myself.


MXE usually did the trick for me most of the time. I came to enjoy it greatly. Tried MXP once and felt great during the onset but sunk into a panic attack without my prescription Xanax. It was hard to tell whether the negative stuff was coming from MXP or Xanax withdrawal, or both. So I kinda left MXP in the dust. MXE, though, I've come across lately, and it's the best MXE I've ever had. But I would still be way more interested in anything that's closer to ketamine.


I tried 2-MeO-ketamine (methoxyketamine, etc.) and found it to be glorious. ..once I finally got all 300mg up my nose (I acquired the tan crystal-y stuff). I watched fireworks during one of the most euphoric out-of-body experiences in my life.


So glad to hear they've finally come up with something at least reasonably close to ketamine!

hey guys, my mxm arrived, and as an avid user of k, mxe and 3meo in the past i was curious to give it a try. and what can i say.. i should actually feel something from 150mg orally, right? i also tried insufflation. bc what i got here seems non active at all. id describe myself as quite experienced as for dissociatives and this is a bit of a let down. and yes, i am aware of crazy tolerance / cross tolerance. vendor has a really good reputation. but yes, they can always receive a somewhat spoiled batch i assume.

any thoughts? is it just me? on a usual turn id do around 15mg 3meo. on a side note, i decided if this is not good i will try to take a longer break from dissociatives in general. they unfortunately help very well with attention deficit disorder, but thats another story.

Welcome to BL!

This drug is showing some variability of effects between users. Lots of people with an experience with dissociatives report good effects with 30mg and strong effects with 60mg. 

I am a beginner with dissociatives, and I felt practically nothing with 30mg, and 60mg gave me only a weak buzz. Nothing close to what 30mg of MXE does to me.... And I am pretty sure I got my MXM from the same polish source as everyone else.

That said, 150mg looks like a pretty big dose, so it is strange that you didnt feel ANYTHING...

exactly my thoughts. i still do blame the batch. i think i have an understanding for my tolerance and this just seems a little odd.

wish there was any place where 3meo was still available :/ it may be cold by times, and missing some of the features that made mxe and k so special to me, but its still

a very strong and effective substance.

(we are most likely talking about the same source. i am going to msg them today).

your mxe is bad.

get a better vendor. 30mg is not strong but not mild at all. even 15mg gives me a good buzz, like 3-4 glass of wine. so if 30mg gives you very little, I would doubt you have good mxe

This is the MXM thread, not the MXE thread. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  The dosage of MXM is higher.

Yeah, just to be clear: I was talking about MXM, and then compared it to MXE. Like I said, while 30mg of MXE is quite a strong dose, IME, 30mg of MXM was almost ineffective.

Gave this a go last night. White/crystaline powder. Kinda powdery crystal and some actual tiny crystals that break up. Did not seem to want to dissolve very well. Took three seperate doses plugged. 


t-0.00 ~12mg (after allergy test). Felt "something", but not much.


t+1:30 or so plugged another 40mg. This stuff has an instant burn to it that subsides pretty quickly. More than anything I can recall plugging recently really. I'm not sure if it's because it's just not dissolved super good or what. Used about 1-1.5ml of water and it was fairly cloudy. Didn't really notice too much actual "particle" floating, but it took a lot of stirring. 


Anyway, sat down to meditate. That much mxe and I would be in the zone for sure. With this, I felt more distracted/speedy or whatnot. I think it was more from a long day of work and impatience doing other task before getting to try the MXM though. Definatly started to notice a disso type state at this point.


t+3:30. Mix up 50mg MXM and ~25mg MXE. Figured I might not get anywhere crazy with just the MXM, but a little MXE would kick it into something for sure. Kinda wish I had just left the MXM alone, because maaaaan that dose did it! This one was a pain to dissolve though. Even after a few minutes stirring (no heat applied) there were still particles and what not floating around. It seemed like the combination of the two just didn't want to mix. Said fuck it and plugged it. Instant burn that subsided after 10 -20 seconds I think.


Lay down in bed, get some music. Definatly starting to feel pretty fucked up, but not like "okay you better get your music set and get ready because it's time to leave this world" like 100mg mxe would. Hit a few balloons of nitrous, and after that it was on. I felt a little bit of the MXE craziness, but it was mostly the MXM. I don't even know how to describe it. At one point it felt more like I was on a tryptamine than a disso. It was more... visiony than MXE. Full on CEV scenes and what not, but less crazy/manic/uncontrolable "I might accidentally stab myself in the face" than MXE as well. Weird. 


I ended up getting out of bed and sitting down to meditate again. Hit a few more balloons of nitrous. Felt like it kept launching me higher and I wasn't fully comming back down.


I dunno, it was weird and I enjoyed it. I think next time I would start with 75mg MXM plugged off the bat and see how it goes. I am definatly interested in obtaining more of this to have around though.


edit: well... source now says "i don't think this is mxm, maybe a weird mxe synth or some fire mxp... very active around 70mg and mxm is 300-500" lolwhut? whatever it is  was a disso and I am prety sure I liked it. I may just delete this post, if it needs to be moved or deleted feel free mods.

After starting small, worked my way up to 60mg sublingual. Maybe I produce too much saliva or something, but contrary to other reports, it didn't kick in immediately. It was a gradual rise to a peak at about 1 hour after dosing.


At this level the body sensations were pleasant, but nothing remarkable. I meditated for 30 minutes which felt good.


I think my next attempt will be to plug the same amount. My hunch is that this one will shine only when combined with weed, so will do that too.

Plugged MXE is much stronger and faster-hitting than oral or sublingual (or even IM in my experience).  It's almost like a different beast, much more anesthetic too.  With weed it becomes very strong indeed.  My one really powerful MXE hole experience was on 40mg oral + 20mg plugged at 45 minutes, and one hit of weed.  Incredibly powerful and psychedelic experience.

Anyway, I've read many reports that sublingual MXM hits immediately, hence my contradictory comment.


And, yea, weed is pretty much a must for me with MXE too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

As a followup to my previous post, tried 70mg sublingual, combined with weed. [Trip report here](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/755232-MXM-70mg-Second-time-Just-time-to-open-up-before-closing-shop). Found it very enjoyable, though brief.


Curious to know what sort of activities people are liking whilst on MXM. As I say in my report, I found watching a movie to be somewhat difficult, but I don't know if that's just because I was already pretty tired.

I agree with others are saying: this is smoother than MXE and has a calmer headspace.

I found that there is little difference between 100-117mg doses and both times I had a great time watchin sci-fi movies.

60mg of ketamine is certainly stronger than that..

Yeah, its pretty easy going, but you wont get a real feel for what dissos have to offer, probably except for larger doses (which i havent tried). I would advise starting low, though.


I promise i will post some reagent tests soon. I commited myself to do that but keep postponing...

Had a lovely time on 100mg sublingual. Was strong enough that when I wanted to do something with my camera (macro work with a reverse-attached manual lense), I had a very hard/slow time indeed; and that was before I smoked any pot.


Actually, in spite of what others have said, even though I was quite high, I didn't really get into it until I finally smoked some pot at the peak. After that... POW. Very good stuff. It actually took me back to some old MXE places and really hit the spot. There are little mini-wormholes here to meditate into, similar to MXE. As for music: I only listened to a single song on it, with headphones (Pavlov's Bell, Aimee Mann), and it was fucking amazing. "Rock and fucking roll," was what I thought at the time.


Only two annoyances:


I find the MXM space to be pretty stoning. I want to just sit and close my eyes. Sometimes that's good, but sometimes not. I wonder how it would go along with some stimulant. Anybody tried yet? If so, what would you recommend?


Also, I find sublingual dosing annoying; I don't like to keep it in my mouth long enough (like 20 minutes to dissolve for me). For those who've done different ROAs, what would be the equivalent dose when plugged?

My reagents are all 1+ year old, so I wasnt sure they would work as they should. However, marquis was the only one kept in the refrigerator, wrapped in foil, and it seems this is the way to go, because it looks like this reagent is the only one still working fine...

So, on the right, some MDMA tested with marquis (to see if the reagent is still good, and it looks like it is!)

On the left, MXM. It gave almost no reaction... As soon as I dropped the reagent, it smoked a bit, but no colour change. Then, after a couple of minutes, this slightly darker spot appeared in the middle of the drop.

As I said, my mecke and mandelin have completely different colours now, so I couldn't use them. Maybe next time I will store them all in the fridge. 


So there ya go:

I did not notice much difference between sublingual and plain oral. Maybe you should try just swallowing the stuff...

Cool, I will try oral at same dose next time and report back. What about onset though? I assume it's faster sublingual or is it similar? Was maybe 75m till peak, after putting it in my mouth.

I cant say exactly what the onset time is because I have never watched the clock too closely, 75-90min seems about right, though!   Maybe sublingually you start feeling the intial effects earlier, but I have the impression that the time for the effects to peak isnt so different.

And considering it is a 100mg amount I doubt it is possible to absorb too much sublingually, because as soon as I put the powder on my mouth I start salivating and most of it is dissolved in saliva and swallowed anyway.

to draw a conclusion. Is MXM worth a try over K or MXE.? Sounds quite enjoyable

MXM is great, though it's not really useful in terms of swimming your mind. I admit I have a tolerance w/ mxe but some of the dosage suggestions given here for mxm seem almost laughable. I'd at least suggest starting at 50mg. I tried it a few weeks back and found it somewhat interesting. Today I did 175mg orally then 250mg orally about 3 hours later.. both were very nice/smooth experiences but I definitely prefer mxe for the galactic excursions it provides. MXM is a dissociative for couch potatoes.

Anyone combine mxm with 4-aco-met? Will be giving this a trial if it seems safe.  My guess would be it is, but don't want to be the first person to try it...

Initially upon reading up on MXM, users seemed to be unimpressed when comparing it to to MXE. I love MXE and already find that headspace to be quite calming and dreamlike. The idea of an even softer dissociative like MXM with a calmer headspace is an idea that I am finding rather intriguing. May just have to add this to my to do list.

Another try of 100mg oral, with weed, was just lovely. At one point I was standing up and I noticed that my limbs felt light; before I knew it my hands started rising up and were floating above my head as if I was some sort of helium balloon. Funny. Later, I wanted to do something that could make a lot of noise, but without waking up my wife: I ended up doing the entire (10 minute?) operation in S L O W .. M O T I ON. If I had been videoed, I imagined it would totally look like a slow-motion effect. It was *very* relaxing. I felt like I was operating on another plane of existence. I wrote tons and went into a micro-hole when I meditated.


I'm don't want to talk sacrilegious shit here, and maybe it's just been the recent MXE batches that are swaying me, but I think I may like this stuff better than MXE. <Prepares to dodge tomatoes.>

Another try last night: **120mg MXM + sativa weed + 10mg Ethylphenidate** (for wakefulness): I ***love ***this stuff. Actually, mostly my feelings during the trip were about how much I love my family and how I would like it to show in my patience with them. I had tons of insights into myself and, even more amazing, was able to write about them lucidly. That's what I love about MXM (and surely the EPH helped): Even when ridiculously high, I'm able to write quite eloquently (mostly spelling correctly too). Any time I get stuck on a thought or a word, I simply close my eyes and enter a micro-MXM-hole and come out the other side refreshed, fulfilled, motivated, and with something to say / write about.


This is the perfect drug for me at this time in my life when I can't really be high for long stretches. I'm sure it's a big downside of MXM for some people, but it's great to be able to go to this super-productive dissociative headspace for 1-2 hours and then be down and go to sleep (with the help of a benzo).


As a side-note: While peaking, my 3 year old son woke up and I had to go to his room to tell him it's bedtime, etc. This could have been pretty bad of course. My love for him was so strong that, instead of feeling like a burden to go to him, it felt like a privileged. He said that he wanted a hug from me, which is weird, because he's never asked that of me before when he's woken up. I felt more love in that moment than perhaps I ever had before. Actually, the most difficult part of dealing with him was the fact that my night vision was horrendous (I think I've noticed this with weed too so maybe that played a role)! I could hardly see at all in his dark room! Luckily I'm pretty good in the dark, but I had to feel my way everywhere.


Anyway, another very positive experience with MXM. Very happy to have this stuff.

So it appears that I'm (not quite, but feel like) the only person on the planet that uses this chemical. Perhaps this is foolhardy. That said, I've been eating about 80mg+weed once every two weeks, and I'm no worse for wear. Once per week is too much, for me anyway (I'm not getting great sleep these days so even one late night per week is tough), but I often want to...


Tonight I've learned a lot about martyrdom.


PS: I love MXM.

So you never dosed it orally? Haha, if so that's kinda disappointing! I was hoping for a comparison from someone who's tried both ways and can say whether it's worthwhile. Either way though, do you feel like your experiences were different from the ones people are posting? Like holing hard with a smaller dose or traveling through the cosmos ethereal godly feeling? Also it would be nice to know what your doses where like, duration, and such. Thanks a bunch and look forward to hearing about it!

I didn't think much of this substance till last week. I decided to experiment more with it and had 3, 75mg lines within the space of 2 hours. I was watching a film called 2001 a space oddesy for the first time. The film was awesome and I was asking myself many questions about our role in the universe. It really had me thinking. Then when "the stargaze" sequence started I thought I was in some sort of trance. It was truly awesome watching that but in all honesty I was really confused and fucked. 


The biggest shock was yet to come, when that space pod appeared in that room and David Bowman was in the spacesuit, I honestly thought aliens were communicating with me and this wasn't a film. I thought strangley about this for a while. That film played with my head. In a way I'll always remember.


I love how dissociative drugs feel. Compared to MXE, I'd give this a 7/10. That's a big score ?


Incidentally, I watched the film again to truly understand it. Loved it that much I bought the books and have only 3001 to read. Reading these books on 75mg of MXM is incredible. You ask so many questions and you mind just goes all ways. 


Highly recommended substance.

Well, to be fair, I think the first time I watched 2001 (I was quite sober and had not yet ever done any drugs), it had those effects on me as well.

Just MXM by itself. I really don't like mixing weed and dissociatives. It really was an experience I'll never forgot. I wasn't expecting it. I underestimated this drug and it nearly, nearly just bit me.

I have a sample of MXE I feel confident is MXE, and a sample of MXE I suspect is MXM. Here, I have done a side by side with fresh Mandelin and Mecke reagents. (They just arrived today from LiquidLabs.)


[https://www.anony.ws/image/DIkx](https://www.anony.ws/image/DIkx)


The mandelin is the one on the left on both, mecke on the right on both. MXE (known) on the left, MXM (suspected?) on the right. The left sample reacted to Mandelin by turning green with orange around the edges. The right sample immediately turned red-orange.

The mecke reagent fizzed with the MXE, and the suspected MXM fizzed a lot more and released a strong smelling vapor that made me regret not doing this under a hood vent. oops. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) It wasn't terrible though.


The samples were measured using a red "10mg" scoop. (Quotes because I mass the samples at about 8mg each.)


Hope this helps! I would love to see someone else with a known MXM sample post the mecke and mandelin reaction. I find it interesting that the suspected MXM seems more consistent with ketamine than MXE.

Just tried some reagent testing. I'm not sure that you can distinguish MXE from MXM using Mecke. Both fizz for me and result in similar colors/smells.


I think my Mandelin test corroborates yours, but even here, I can't be sure. Both start out with a bit of green for me, but MXM quickly loses it and stays orange.


Here's my Mandelin: [https://www.anony.ws/image/DeF7](https://www.anony.ws/image/DeF7)


I think that there can be a bit of variation with these reagents, even for real MXE, so I'm not sure that this is conclusive of anything.

I will experiment more in the near future and report back if it's warranted, but my first impressions:


1. Effects & duration were somewhat similar to MXE vaporized: Main effects only lasting ~30 minutes, with a character different from Oral, but with a euphoric dissociative space and a positive energy (lifted me right out of a bad funk).
2. Dose needed was much smaller than expected. I only vaporized 3 hits (each 30 minutes apart) and each (I would estimate) was 10-15mg. I was surprised I got effects from such small amounts, given its lowish oral potency.
3. As reported by others with MXE, I think this ROA may be a bitch for creating tolerance. That same night, as well as the following night, I had a *very *high tolerance compared to what I was expecting (for consuming the stuff orally). I've done MXM weekly (sometimes two nights in a row) for many weeks without substantial tolerance build up, but all of a sudden: BAM, I'm tolerant. Lame.


One caveat: I had taken 10mg of 3-meo-pcp earlier in the day, so it's possible that the effects were potentiated due to that. Will try on its own soon enough.

I really hope so! I love MXM. For some reason I never tried vaping it though, and after I read your post about it I can't wait to try it.

MXM seems to be getting mixed reviews mostly and is not very potent; deschloroketamine is what China is going into right now as a replacement for MXE.

I'm surprised MXM kinda dropped off the map. There is some real utility for it, not only that but some very broad applicability. I dunno, maybe it is just me, but I took some today and had a blast. An hour into titrating up I dropped 7.5mg of adderall, and whoah, that made everything so much more fun! Maybe MXM isn't as popular as it could be because it really works best in a 'salad', as in an adjunct for something like cannabis, or any sort of stimulant. I mean even a cup of coffee helped to add a little excitability to the experience. I guess the most defining factor for it being less popular is the potency. Deschloroketamine certainly is a better bang for the buck, but to be honest nothing else in the class compares to the 'clear stillness' of MXM, instilling the ability to go easily with the most organic of flows, undisturbed, allowing synchronicity to flourish in a way that feels more 'natural' than any of its familiars.

  Yeah, every chinese lab looks like it's concentrating over 2-OxO-PCM production since the ban. I supose the synthesis should be somewhat easier, or I can't see why they are choosing only this one instead of experimenting with more variety like they're doing pulling out 99999999 shitty stimulants and cannabinoids every fucking month ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I haven´t tried MXM yet exactly for the potency issue. Too much material for the kidneys/bladder to process. Also heavier on the wallet too. It´s a pity, because for the reports sounds totally stellar. A 5-10x potency analog would be spot on

I guess it never took off.  I think it got synthed once and then fell off.  Too bad because I agree, it sounded quite good.  I never got to try it. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I wonder if MXM was hard to synth... therefore making it expensive, especially since it's not very potent?  Seems like the phenidines must have been pretty easy because they were all over.  I heard good things about MXM after a while but a lot of people said it wasn't worth the price.  Probably not enough interest to keep going with it.  Personally I'd have loved to try it.  The PCM version of MXE?  Yeah, sign me up.

Well the afaik only vendor with legit mxm was selling it a bit cheaper than mxe so probably it wasn't expensive to make.


But what rally surprises me is that neither 3-meo-2'oxo-pcpr or 3-ho-2'oxo-pce were never made. Obviously it's impossible to know  just by looking  at the structure but they look to be quite close to mxd.

It just never took off because MXE was popular and more potent. I actually asked a reputable Chinese supplier about MXM a few months back, they said it was too risky being so close to MXE structurally. Assuming it's the same logic as to why we don't see the N-propyl version either. I don't think either should be anymore difficult to produce than MXE though.

Wasn't mxe made in Europe too? Couldn't they have made these analogs?


Also 2fdck is very close to ketamine and that didn't stop the Chinese.

MXM was my favorite drug, and I've tried most of them including all of the dissociative RCs to date. I loved MXE way way way too much, but if offered the choice between the two I'd take MXM in a heartbeat and would pay twice as much for it. 


Fuck the chinese, I guess it's easier to pump out fentanyl analogs designed to kill elephants.

Let me guess, you snorted it and/or took an MXE sized dose. You needed to parachute at least 100mgs at once. It was more expensive than MXE at that dose and had a shorter duration, but was so worth it. I have never since been as comfortable or unconditionally blissful/optimistic. It was more interesting on a cognitive level as well as I could completely and effortlessly control my CEVs, something that I've experienced on nothing else.

I could easily be mistaken, but I believe that the MXM I received in December 2014 originated from eastern Europe. I thought that there was only one synth of the stuff on the market but apparently not. It had such a consistently positive push that I could not imagine it being dysphoric. Even MXE could occasionally be dysphoric in a dark way to me.


Now deschloroket or O-PCE on the otherhand? Their popularity confounds me. They last for so long and are more physically disabling than MXE at lower doses. You essentially need to lie in bed for almost 20 damn hours if you don't want to risk breaking your arm trying to get a glass of water. I tried them extensively and they had none of the charm of most other aryhexylamines besides a vague but uninteresting anti-depressant effect. I somewhat enjoyed binging netflix on the stuff when I had time to kill but IMO they totally suck compared to the magical MXE/MXM/ketamine/2-F ketamine. 


It makes me absolutely bitter that they've been popular for years when MXM was available for like a month.

I have heard the same. That vendor was the only one with legit mxm. Missed it because they ran out just as I was about to order.


Had another batch of what was supposed to be mxm from China. Gc/Ms said it was just very bad mxe.

So I think that looking over the big and dandy threads concerning the various dissos, to have hit the grey area market in the last decade or so, you see that there are a variety of reasons that different people use these substances. For me, for an example, the idea of taking one to go out dancing or socialize is utterly alien. It is not that I haven't used them socially. It is just that it isn't really what they are for, at least in my opinion. For me, it is more about hitting that hard reset on your mind every once in a while, for self exploration and therapeutic reasons. So for me, the listed dosages for 2-oxo seem utterly absurd. The "real" effects require at least 60mg (orally) and only come into their own at about 80-100, which due to cardio push and the experimental nature of the substance, I never surpassed. It would be very interesting to see what the pure s-isomer would do. I found there to be a note of apprehension to the effects, but also that they were profound enough to keep me coming back. Visually, the most frequent CEV's that I got were of flying over these little towns, with steep angular roofs, reminding me very much of an Escher landscape print. The look was a dimly lit, slightly grainy, green/grey appearance. Also, a large dose helped a friend to get past acute opiate withdraws.


I realize that this is a MXM thread. Just also felt like that deserved response for posterity's sake. Here is the MXM part: can anyone sketch out a rough dosage guideline? There is no Psychonautwiki page, there is literally one sentence devoted to it at Wikipedia, and only two reports on Erowid. One of them is polysubstance use. I realize that it isn't commercially available at the moment, but who knows what the future will bring? It would just be nice to have a little more information available.

Dude, 60, 80 or 100mgs of O-PCE would blackout easily even a super tolerant disso user. That dosages are more like a direct fly to the hospital. Maybe you mean MXM dosages?

Hole, yes. Blackout no. Hospital, not even close. Not in my experience anyways. Not what I've observed in other people. I have had access to 4 different sources. One, I had a decent bit to play with. I can't track it down right now, but what made me open to pushing it was seeing a report of a guy slamming over 100mg and reporting a pleasant experience, in the face of my experiences up to the so called "heavy" point seeming like they weren't quite there. I don't know what to say other than when I do this class it is for a hole like experience and that I didn't get what I was after until I pushed it. I definitely mean 2-Oxo, MXE minus the methoxy group or K, minus the chlorine and with an ethyl rather than methyl N-substitution. Just reporting back my own experience. 


I am still very interested in learning more about MXM though.

100mg of O-PCE?  Really?  I can take 7mg and be pretty wonky.  Can't imagine dosing anywhere even approaching that level.  Do you have a bunch of disso tolerance?  For most people even 60mg is WAY too much for O-PCE.

that i dont get. at least for dck. i can socialize with sober people or go shopping when on dck without any problems, there is almost no ataxia comparable to eg mxe when using lower doses.

Yeah, I do mean it. I've taken at least 60mg with a decent amount of 2C-E as well. I'm not trying to make grandiose statements here. Think about DMT. A little is still pretty heavily disorienting without even hinting at what is around the corner via a full blown break through. Also think about mescaline. Would anyone have bothered to find the higher registers of it's dosages if there hadn't been folks in northern Mexico and the Andes taking megadoses of the stuff via cacti for ages? Not that I am suggesting that people utilize wanton disregard and just start recklessly taking oodles of whatever, but some substances do have a longer range of dosages than others. I mean LSD is pretty forgiving in that and so is ketamine, which this is pretty close to structurally.


However, people I think underestimate how much minor variations in structure do matter. 2C-B seems pretty forgiving in terms of taking more than generally advised. 2C-T-7 or 2C-P, not so much. I was at a MAPS conference years ago, where Dr.Nichols was giving a presentation on the 5HT-2 receptor site affinity that could be predicted by 2,5 substitution of phenethylamines. I asked him during and then again after the presentation as to what we could deduct about the toxicity of the various NMDA antagonists going around based on their structure. He dodged the question at 1st but I caught him coming out of the bathroom later and got a more direct answer which was "that toxicity is an unique phenomenon. That it relates to how something binds, it's exact path of metabolism, etc, and that the only method available to us to predict this is the science of systems biology." In other words, it would take being able to create an accurate computer simulation of the workings of the human body to be able to predict. So I am not trying to encourage people to throw all caution to the wind here by assuming that it is equally forgiving in terms of overdose. I have seen too many posts and trip reports that were posted by people engaging in wanton, reckless behavior. However, I have seen these effects manifest in a predictable enough fashion, that I am genuinely a little surprised by the pushback and making them wasn't my reason for registering and posting.  Wanting to know more about MXM was.


As for my tolerance, my body is pretty good at metabolizing most things. With this class though, I feel like the risk of losing the magic and never getting it back is enough to keep me from using too often. So it isn't the same as my tolerance for herb, for an example. When I do K (and I mean vial dried, the stuff I come across anymore often just makes me sad due to low quality), about a quarter gram is my ideal intranasal dose and I do not redose. With MXP, I felt like I was only still learning about it when I ran out, but found 80-100mg quite interesting. Lower doses with mushrooms were also quite excellent. It seemed really adept at facilitating deep, profound emotional catharsis. With DXM, well, it has been a while, but I think that about 700-1200 or so mg was what I liked, with the upper levels being the best part. I used 3-MEO-PCP once but it was at a lower level. The risk of mania in the face of what it presented just wasn't worth it. Other than that my experiences with this class are via N2O and ether, which is pretty atypical.


On a side note, yours are some of the only trip reports, that I find interesting enough to read in full rather than just scan these days. I have been a lurker for years and have always valued your contributions. (Xorkoth)

Wonder if we will ever see this one appear on the market again someday. It sounds so good after reading this thread i feel so cheated that i missed out on this while i was away. MXM and HXE are the only MXE analogs that i havent tried before.  This sounds like one of the better ones from the series, anyone still taking this stuff in once in awhile?

Honestly I'm afraid to say that the profit margin on this stuff is just way too low to be produced again. I got through 10g of the stuff in about 3 days and by the end I was doing 1g IMs of the stuff just to feel anything.


It's a god-like substance but it's just not profitable so when it was around I think they realised that and unfortunately it's just not viable to be reproduced.


So to anyone who did try it, thank your lucky stars you did because without legislation it won't come around again.

I passed on getting some at the time because the initial reviews were very lackluster, but it turns out they just weren't dosing high enough, thinking it would be similar in dosage to MXE.  Since then, I have heard a number of reports of it being incredible, but needing to be dosed very high.  Wish I would have gotten some.  I most certainly would have written  detailed report, and for whatever reason, basically no one wrote reports on it, or really went into much detail about the experience.  Which is a real shame... missed opportunity to document something.

I used MXE to treat my autism spectrum disorder and it did it amazingly, like being morphed from 2 dimensional to 3 dimensional being.  I'd love to have been alerted to MXE's availability to stockpile, but only cruise this site once in a blue moon, so looks like I missed the boat.  So I feel you on the missed opportunity.
