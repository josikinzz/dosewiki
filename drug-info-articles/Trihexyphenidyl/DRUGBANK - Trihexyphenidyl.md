*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00376*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aralkylamines. These are alkylamines in which the alkyl group is substituted at one carbon atom by an aromatic hydrocarbyl group.

### Background

Trihexyphenidyl is a centrally acting muscarinic antagonist used for treatment of parkinsonism and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders.
11
,
12
Its discovery was published in 1949 in a study looking for drugs with antispasmodic activity.
9
Trihexyphenidyl is rarely used in the treatment of parkinsonism, and is not a first line treatment due to significant adverse effects.
15
It has largely been replaced by drugs such as
levodopa
.
15
Trihexyphenidyl was granted FDA approval on 13 May 1949.
10

### Indication

Tihexyphenidyl is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism, an adjuvant in the treatment of parkinsonism with levodopa, and in the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs.
11
,
12

### Pharmacodynamics

Trihexyphenidyl is an antimuscarinic indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism or as a treatment for drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.
11
,
12
It has a long duration of action as it does not need to be given every day.
13
It has a wide therapeutic window, with acute toxicity being non fatal in doses as high as 300 mg.
13
Patients should have their iridocorneal angle examined before and intraocular pressure monitored during therapy.
13
Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of anhidrosis and hyperthermia.

### Mechanism of Action

### Absorption

Trihexyphenidyl is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Trihexyphenidyl reaches a C
max
of 7.2 ng/mL, with a  T
max
of 1.3 hours, and an AUC of 201 ng*h/mL.

,

### Metabolism

Data regarding the metabolism of trihexyphenidyl are not readily available.
1
However, it is likely not heavily metabolized.
1

### Half-life

The mean elimination half life of trihexyphenidyl is 3.2 ± 0.3 hours.
7

### Toxicity

Symptoms of overdose include mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, red face, atonic states of bowels and bladder, and hyperthermia in high doses. Trihexyphenidyl causes agitation, confusion, and hallucinations due to its effects on the central nervous system. Untreated overdose may result in death, especially in children. Respiratory depression and cardiac arrest may be seen as premortal signs.
Patients experiencing an overdose of trihexyphenidyl may experience dry mouth, anhidrosis, mydriasis, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, reduced gastrointestinal motility, urinary hesitancy or retention, rash, hyperthermia, confusion, restlessness, agitation, poor coordination, paranoia, psychosis, delirium, hallucinations, coma, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and death.
1
Patients should be treated with symptomatic and supportive care which may include airway maintenance and the use of
physostigmine
.

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Aclidinium
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Trihexyphenidyl is combined with Aclidinium.
Adenosine
The risk or severity of Tachycardia can be increased when Trihexyphenidyl is combined with Adenosine.
Adrafinil
The risk or severity of Tachycardia can be increased when Trihexyphenidyl is combined with Adrafinil.
Albuterol
The risk or severity of Tachycardia can be increased when Trihexyphenidyl is combined with Salbutamol.
Alfentanil
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Trihexyphenidyl is combined with Alfentanil.

### Food Interactions

Take with or without food. Taking with food may minimize stomach upset. May take before meals to mitigate dry mouth or may take after meals to reduce excess salivation.

### Mechanism of action

Trihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype.
2
In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally.
2
,
3
Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum.
5
Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.

### General Function

Binds water, Ca(2+), Na(+), K(+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin and drugs (Probable). Its main function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood (Probable). Major zinc transporter in plasma, typically binds about 80% of all plasma zinc (PubMed:19021548). Major calcium and magnesium transporter in plasma, binds approximately 45% of circulating calcium and magnesium in plasma (By similarity). Potentially has more than two calcium-binding sites and might additionally bind calcium in a non-specific manner (By similarity). The shared binding site between zinc and calcium at residue Asp-273 suggests a crosstalk between zinc and calcium transport in the blood (By similarity). The rank order of affinity is zinc > calcium > magnesium (By similarity). Binds to the bacterial siderophore enterobactin and inhibits enterobactin-mediated iron uptake of E.coli from ferric transferrin, and may thereby limit the utilization of iron and growth of enteric bacteria such as E.coli (PubMed:6234017). Does not prevent iron uptake by the bacterial siderophore aerobactin (PubMed:6234017)
