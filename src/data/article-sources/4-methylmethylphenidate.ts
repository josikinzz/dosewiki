## Subjective Experience

This was on the market for just a few months in the middle of 2015, having been
released shortly after the UK ban on EPH and other phenidates. However, I found it
to be a little uninspiring and dull, despite a session of fairly hefty redosing.

It provided an EPH-like functional stimulation, with little recreational action. I felt
that something was missing, although I am not sure what.

So disappointing was it that I used it on just the one occasion, and left the rest in its
baggy for over two years. It was eventually binned.

To be fair, others have reported far more positively than this, with a handful even
citing a recreational edge at high doses.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Methylmethylphenidate*

threo-4-Methylmethylphenidate (4-MeTMP) is a stimulant drug related to methylphenidate. It is slightly less potent than methylphenidate and has relatively low efficacy at blocking dopamine reuptake despite its high binding affinity, which led to its investigation as a possible substitute drug for treatment of stimulant abuse. On the other hand, several other simple ring-substituted derivatives of threo-methylphenidate such as the 4-fluoro and 3-chloro compounds are more potent than methylphenidate both in efficacy as dopamine reuptake inhibitors and in animal drug discrimination assays.

## Legality

4-Methylmethylphenidate was banned in the UK as a Temporary Class Drug from June 2015 following its unapproved sale as a designer drug.
In the United States, 4-methylmethylphenidate may be considered illegal if intended for human consumption under the federal analogue act as a structural analog of methylphenidate.
In the United States, on September 22, 2023, the DEA filed a proposed rule for placement of ethylphenidate into Schedule I status, which would include its isomers. 4-Methylmethylphenidate is a positional isomer of ethylphenidate and thus the scheduling of ethylphenidate into Schedule I status would cause 4-methylmethylphenidate to be a Schedule I substance as well.
