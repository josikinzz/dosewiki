## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the gamma carbon atom.

### Background

Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist used as a skeletal muscle relaxant. Although originally designed in 1962 to treat epilepsy, baclofen was not effective in treating this condition but instead was shown to reduce spasticity in selected patients.
8
Baclofen was reintroduced in 1971 as a treatment for spasticity and was later approved by the FDA in 1977.
6
,
8
Baclofen is used to manage severe muscle spasms of cerebral or spinal cord origins, including multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury.
11
Baclofen was investigated for use in alcohol dependence and withdrawal; however, evidence is limited and there is inconsistent evidence to suggest its clinical efficacy in managing alcohol dependence or withdrawal symptoms.

### Indication

Oral baclofen is indicated for the treatment of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis and is particularly useful for the relief of flexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus, and muscular rigidity. It may also be used to treat patients with spinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases. Baclofen should not be used to treat skeletal muscle spasms resulting from rheumatic disorders.
12
Intrathecal baclofen is also indicated for the management of severe spasticity of the cerebral or spinal original in patients 4 years of age and older. It is reserved for patients unresponsive to oral baclofen therapy, or those who experience intolerable central nervous system side effects at effective doses. For use in spasticity due to traumatic brain injury, baclofen should be considered after at least one year of injury.
11

### Pharmacodynamics

Baclofen is an antispasmodic agent that induces muscle relaxation. It reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the pre-synaptic neurons and stimulates inhibitory neuronal signals in the post-synaptic neurons.
6
Oral formulations of baclofen are the most commonly used form of the drug. In one cross-section study, intrathecal baclofen was more effective than oral baclofen in relieving spasticity directly at the level of the spinal cord.
8
Baclofen has CNS depression properties and can cause sedation with tolerance, somnolence, ataxia, and respiratory and cardiovascular depression.
13
Baclofen also mediates some antinociceptive effects and stimulates gastric acid secretion.
15
Baclofen exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities: it inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia and astrocytes, and decreases oxidative stress in rats.

### Absorption

Baclofen has an oral bioavailability of 70% to 85%. Following oral administration, it is rapidly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma concentrations being reached two to three hours after ingestion.
6
Peak effect is observed about four hours after intrathecal administration.
8
The absorption is dose-dependent and increases with higher doses.
6
There is intersubject variation in absorption.
13
Administration of oral baclofen suspension with a high-fat meal resulted in 9% decrease in AUC and 33% decrease in C
max
compared to the fasted state.
13

### Metabolism

Approximately 15% of the oral dose is metabolized in the liver, mainly by deamination.
8
Deamination yields the main metabolite, β-(p-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxybutyric acid, which is pharmacologically inactive.

### Half-life

The half-life is 2-6 hours after oral administration and 1-5 hours following intrathecal administration.
8
The apparent elimination half-life of baclofen oral suspension or granules is about 5.6 hours.
13

### Toxicity

The oral LD
50
in rats is 145 mg/kg.
14
Baclofen withdrawal symptoms typically occur within hours to days following interruption of either oral or intrathecal drug formulations.
8
Abrupt discontinuation of baclofen is not advised.
11
Clinical manifestations of baclofen overdose may include altered mental status, somnolence, seizure, hypothermia, respiratory depression, and coma. Overdose from baclofen oral tablets resulted in vomiting, lightheadedness, drowsiness, muscular hypotonia, accommodation disorders, coma, respiratory depression, and seizures.
6
,
13
Most overdose symptoms are neurological but uncommon cardiovascular effects such as hypertension, bradycardia, and tachycardia may be observed.
9
In case of overdose, symptomatic treatment and gastric decontamination should be initiated. When the patient is alert, gastric emptying should be performed by inducing emesis and then performing lavage while maintaining an adequate airway and respiration. Emesis should not be induced in unconscious patients.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
Baclofen may increase the central nervous system depressant (CNS depressant) activities of 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Baclofen may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Acarbose
The therapeutic efficacy of Acarbose can be decreased when used in combination with Baclofen.
Acebutolol
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Baclofen is combined with Acebutolol.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Baclofen which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with food. Take with food or milk to reduce gastric irritation.

### Mechanism of action

The exact mechanism of action of baclofen is unclear. Baclofen is an agonist at the beta subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors expressed on pre- and post-synaptic neurons.
3
Upon binding to GABA
B
receptors, baclofen causes an influx of potassium into the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane and decreased calcium influx at presynaptic nerve terminals. This results in a decreased rate of action potential threshold being reached by presynaptic neurons and reduced action potential of postsynaptic motor neurons that innervate the muscle spindles. Baclofen thereby inhibits the transmission of both mono- and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal cord, relaxing spasticity.
8
Baclofen may act on some voltage-gated calcium channels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution of baclofen is 0.7 L/kg.
15
As baclofen is mainly water-soluble, it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.
7
Drug concentrations of baclofen in the cerebrospinal fluid are approximately 8.5 times lower than in the plasma.
15

### Protein binding

The protein binding is approximately 30%.
15

### Route of elimination

About 70-80% of baclofen is eliminated in an unchanged form by renal excretion
6
,
8
within 72 hours of administration. About 5% of the dose is excreted via the kidneys as metabolites.
15
There is intersubject variation in elimination.
13

### Clearance

The systemic clearance (CL/F) was 180 mL/min and the renal clearance was 103 mL/min following oral administration.

### Actions

Allosteric modulator

### General Function

Receptor for the C-X-C chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1 that transduces a signal by increasing intracellular calcium ion levels and enhancing MAPK1/MAPK3 activation (PubMed:10452968, PubMed:18799424, PubMed:24912431, PubMed:28978524). Involved in the AKT signaling cascade (PubMed:24912431). Plays a role in regulation of cell migration, e.g. during wound healing (PubMed:28978524). Acts as a receptor for extracellular ubiquitin; leading to enhanced intracellular calcium ions and reduced cellular cAMP levels (PubMed:20228059). Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) et mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:11276205). Involved in hematopoiesis and in cardiac ventricular septum formation. Also plays an essential role in vascularization of the gastrointestinal tract, probably by regulating vascular branching and/or remodeling processes in endothelial cells. Involved in cerebellar development. In the CNS, could mediate hippocampal-neuron survival (By similarity)
