## Effects
Taking dexamphetamine increases the concentration of the nerve messengers dopamine and noradrenaline. When prescribed for ADHD, the substance is supposed to act as a filter for incoming stimuli and alleviate symptoms such as distractibility, attention deficit disorder, disorganisation and impulsivity.
However, due to their stimulating, energising and euphoric properties, dexamphetamine and Adderall® are also used as recreational drugs or to enhance performance

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
When prescribed by a doctor or used as directed, sleep disturbances and irritability can often occur. The most common adverse effects include: Cardiovascular and arrhythmias, rapid pulse, high blood pressure, lack of appetite, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, insomnia, anxiety and/or joint pain.
In overdose, it can cause, among other things, hallucinations, muscle twitching, panic, aggressiveness and/or restlessness.

### Long-term Risks
When used therapeutically, it is assumed that no dependence will develop. When abusing higher doses over a longer period of time, psychological dependence may develop. With abrupt discontinuation, withdrawal symptoms such as lethargy, apathy, depression and paranoia may occur.

## Safer Use
- If possible, do not consume amphetamine-containing substances intravenously. Due to the substances contained in the tablets, embolism (blockage of vessels in the lungs or brain) can occur.
