## Harm Reduction

When on high doses of [benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines), users are likely to black out and potentially hurt themselves through a variety of adventures. If you are using it as a sleep aid, it's recommended to continue doing what you're doing until you begin to feel drowsy, then go to bed.

Some users report Alprazolam (and [benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines) in general) to lead to compulsive redosing, trying to find a “high” which is where a fair amount of the point above comes from. To avoid this keep doses low and be wary of reduced inhibitions while under the influence of Alprazolam.

### Interactions

As with other depressants, Alprazolam should not be combined with any other CNS depressants (such as [Alcohol](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Alcohol)), at the risk of respiratory depression, which can lead to death.
See the [Drug combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations) chart for more information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Alprazolam is absorbed fairly rapidly, with peak plasma levels achieved around the one-two hour mark.

It is primarily metabilised via CYP3A4. Alprazolam is a chemical analogue of triazolam. It is a triazolobenzodiazepine. It binds to the GABA(a) receptor and modulates the function of the GABA receptor. You can learn more about the GABA(a) receptor [here](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/GABA_Receptors_and_Subunits_Info).

The LD50 of Alprazolam in rats is 331-2171mg/kg.

An Australian study (2004) of overdose admissions between 1987 and 2002 found alprazolam, which happens to be the most prescribed [benzodiazepine](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines) in the U.S. by a large margin, to be more toxic than [diazepam](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Diazepam) and other [benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines).
