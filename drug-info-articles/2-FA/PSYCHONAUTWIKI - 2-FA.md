**2-Fluoroamphetamine** (also known as **2-FA** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. It is a structural analog of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and is presumed to possess a similar mechanism of action, promoting the release of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) in the brain.

2-FA is part of a series of amphetamine analogs that first appeared on the online research chemical market in the 2010s. These compounds include [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) , [3-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-FA) , [3-FEA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-FEA) and [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) and are reported to produce a range of [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) effects, many of which have been used as [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) substitutes for classical street [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) and [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Of these, 2-FA is considered to be most [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) -like in its [subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) . It is commonly compared to the d-isomer of amphetamine (dexedrine).

2-FA is commonly taken orally. While capable of being taken via [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) or [vaporization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporized) , this has been reported to be highly unpleasant and noxious compared to its parent compound. Despite some users reporting efficacy as an alternative to prescription stimulants for ADHD, little is known about the potential toxicological effects that accompany its long-term use as a substitute for prescribed stimulants.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2-FA. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

2-FA, or 2-Fluoroamphetamine, is a synthetic molecule of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) family. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α (i.e. amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines). Unlike its close analogue [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) , 2-FA does not contain a methyl group bound to the terminal amine R N of the amphetamine core, which renders it structurally and functionally similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . 2-FA is the 2-position fluorinated analogue of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .

## Pharmacology

Although 2-FA has not been formally studied on the same level as traditional [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) , it is safe to assume that just like other [substituted amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) with substitutions at similar positions (with the notable exception of [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) ), it most likely acts primarily as both a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) . This means it effectively increases the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally clear those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within the brain to extra-endogenous levels, resulting in stimulating, motivating and euphoric effects.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to other substituted amphetamines, 2-FA is reported to be relatively free of side effects such as [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [high blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/High_blood_pressure) , [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) and an uncomfortable [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) ("comedown"). It is considered to be a functional and effective psychoactive substance for performing general productivity tasks in a manner that is similar to [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . However, at higher doses, it reportedly loses its productivity and attention-enhancing effects and begins to take on a recreational character due to the distracting euphoria and overstimulation that can result. However, it is often said that it possesses a "ceiling dose" that purportedly lowers the abuse threshold relative to methamphetamine, although this has yet to be scientifically demonstrated.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2-FA use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2-FA has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 2-FA within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). Others have commented that its d-isomer form is virtually similar to the effects of d- [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and thus far little has been shown to give reason to suspect that its toxicity is radically different (though future evidence to the contrary may prove otherwise).

It is perhaps worth noting that in the field of medicinal chemistry, the fluorine substitution is sometimes seen as desirable in central nervous system pharmaceutical agents, and is a common practice due to the corresponding increase in lipophilicity granted by the substitute.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of 2-FA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among a certain population of users. When dependence or addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 2-FA develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 10 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2-FA presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 2-FA all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect (especially including atypical stimulants one might not expect, like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) due to its reliance on dopamine and norepinephrine to exert its full euphoric effect).

In a analogous way tolerance to amphetamine relates to tolerance on methamphetamine, 2-FA has been observed to have a similar relationship to its more popular relative, [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) .

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the amphetamine chemical class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, dextro [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

## Legal status

2-FA is currently a grey area compound within all parts of the world, meaning its regulation lies in a legal grey area and that it is not known to be specifically illegal ("scheduled") within any country. However, people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with intent to sell or consume.

- **Canada** : 2-FA would be considered Schedule I as it is an analogue of Amphetamine.
- **China** : As of October 2015 2-FA is a controlled substance in China.
- **France** : As of december 2024, 2-FA is not explicitly scheduled. It is thus legal to possess, although in a grey area.
- **Germany** : 2-FA is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **New Zealand** : 2-FA is an amphetamine analogue, so is a Schedule 3 controlled substance in New Zealand.
- **Switzerland** : 2-FA is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **Turkey:** 2-FA is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **The Netherlands:** 2-FA is currently legal, but it is part of a substance group that may be banned soon as part of a recently passed law on New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).
- **United Kingdom** : 2-FA is considered a Class A drug as a result of the amphetamine analog clause of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
- **United States** : 2-FA may be considered to be an analogue of amphetamine under the Federal Analogue Act and thus a Schedule II drug. The Federal Analogue Act, 21 U.S.C. § 813, is a section of the United States Controlled Substances Act, allowing any chemical "substantially similar" to an illegal drug (in Schedule I or II) to be treated as if it were also in Schedule I or II, but only if it is intended for human consumption.
