**1-Propionyl- *d* -lysergic acid diethylamide** (also known as **1P-LSD** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) class. It is structurally related to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and other novel lysergamides like [1cP-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1cP-LSD) , [1B-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1B-LSD) , and [1V-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1V-LSD) . It is thought to produce its effects by stimulating [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain, although the precise mechanism is not known.

1P-LSD has been sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) (also called "designer drug") since 2015, but the original synthesis date of 1P-LSD is unknown. Unlike most [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) , it has no documented record in the research literature before its emergence on the online research chemical market in 2015.

It was marketed as a legal alternative to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) alongside other novel [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) like [ALD-52](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ALD-52) , [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) , and [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) . In 2019, it became part of a group of molecules studied by the French laboratory Caulredaitens. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [geometric visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . User reports indicate that the subjective effects of 1P-LSD are extremely similar to [those of LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD#Subjective_effects) . It is theorized to act as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for LSD.

This hypothesis is supported by the results of a study that demonstrated 1P-LSD is metabolized to LSD in rats. This predicts a near-identical effect profile, likely differing mainly in its rate of absorption and duration. Its classical psychedelic effects and favorable tolerability has led it to become popular among novel substance users who use it interchangeably with LSD.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 1P-LSD. It is presumed to have a similar toxicity and risk profile as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , although there are no formal studies that prove this. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

1P-LSD first appeared on the online research chemical market in January 2015. Although it was likely discovered in an academic setting, it is unknown who first synthesized 1P-LSD, as the substance does not appear in any academic literature pre-dating its arrival on the research chemical market.

Interestingly, the future usage of 1-alkylated lysergamide derivatives as a means to bypass controlled substance laws banning [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) as a precursor was foreseen in a DEA report from 1988:

## Chemistry

1P-LSD is a semisynthetic compound of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) family. It is similar to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and is named for the propionyl group bound to the nitrogen of the polycyclic indole group of LSD. Propionyl consists of the carbonyl chain CH 3 CH 2 CO- bound to an amino group.

1P-LSD is homologous to [ALD-52](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ALD-52) , which holds an acetyl group bound to the nitrogen instead of the propionyl group bound at the same location. The structure of 1P-LSD contains a polycyclic group featuring a bicyclic hexahydro indole bound to a bicyclic quinoline group. At carbon 8 of the quinoline, an N,N-diethyl carboxamide is bound.

## Pharmacology

Based on its structural similarity to LSD, 1P-LSD likely acts as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) at the [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) receptor. The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are thought to primarily come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors distributed throughout the brain.

1P-LSD also likely displays binding activity at a wide range of [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) receptors, such as those for [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) . However, there is currently no experimental data to support these claims.

It has been theorized that 1P-LSD may act as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . While 1P-LSD shows only 38% the potency of LSD in mice, LSD is detected via LC-MS when 1P-LSD is incubated in human serum. Follow-up studies are currently being conducted to compare the affinity and selectivity of LSD and 1P-LSD at 5-HT receptors, and to determine whether 1P-LSD is hydrolyzed to LSD in vivo. Otherwise, it is possible that 1P-LSD possesses intrinsic activity.

Prior to the publishing of the above-cited research, medicinal chemist and psychedelics researcher [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) reportedly commented on the potential 1P-LSD serotonin receptor binding dynamics in private correspondence:

A 2020 study on two human male volunteers found that the levels of 1P-LSD in the serum after administration quickly diminished within the first hour while LSD has been found consistently during the experiment, which further supports the prodrug theory. The study also found that LSD's bioavailability after oral ingestion of 1P-LSD was close to 100%.

## Subjective effects

Anecdotal reports from many users suggest that the subjective effects of 1P-LSD are so similar to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) so as to be virtually indistinguishable from one another. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , 1P-LSD is significantly more stimulating and fast-paced regarding the specific style of its physical and cognitive effects.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 1P-LSD is usually regarded as very energetic and stimulating without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) which are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 1P-LSD can be characterized as proportionally very intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a euphoric, fast-moving, sharp and location-specific tingling sensation. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different, unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most, it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. At moderate to high doses of 1P-LSD, this sensation often approaches its highest level and can become so overwhelming that people may find themselves debilitated with pleasurable sensations. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - It should be noted that this effect is not as reliably induceable as it is with substances like [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , and can just as easily manifest as extreme physical discomfort without any apparent reason.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensations are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most 1P-LSD experiences. If [level 8A geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) is reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person's entire body all at once is consistently present.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This is generally mild in comparison to the stamina enhancement produced by traditional [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect is significantly less pronounced than it is with [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and its related compounds, the four-position [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine#List_of_substituted_tryptamines) .
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes instantly soon after the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - Vasoconstriction may lead to users feeling cold, especially in the extremities.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - The likelihood is largely extrapolated from the seizures that have been reported from the use of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . It is thought to mainly be a risk in those who are genetically predisposed to them, particularly while accompanied by physically taxing conditions such as states of dehydration, fatigue, undernourishment or overheating. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)** - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect is often reported to be brighter but not as varied in its character.
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon-like in its appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Colour tinting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_tinting)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 1P-LSD can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity.
 
In the case of higher-level geometry, this substance is [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) dominant but is also capable of inducing [8B Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) under the right circumstances.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
1P-LSD is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics, specifically tryptamines like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) or [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - This component is a rare effect that typically only occurs at very strong to heavy doses, and not as consistently as with notably visual psychedelics like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) , and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) , and atypical psychedelics like [salvia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salvia) .
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Although 1P-LSD is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) in its vividness and intensity, these effects are incredibly rare and inconsistent in comparison. While traditional psychedelics such as [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and above, 1P-LSD will for most simply go straight into [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, LSD is limited in depth. When they do occur, they can be described in terms of their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in appearance.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect is not as common at low to moderate doses and is less likely to occur when the basic rules of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are taken into account. It should be noted that this inconsistently induced effect is seemingly more likely to manifest when used with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . This combination should be used with extreme caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics, meaning that the user should adequately pace themselves with a fraction of their usual amount. It is commonly reported that psychedelics can to a certain extent counteract some of the perceived mental cloudiness or intoxicating effects of THC causing the user to in turn use more cannabis than is needed which can often lead to an overwhelmingly anxious headspace or a ["bad trip"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) .
- **[Catharsis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Catharsis)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Personal meaning enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_meaning_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This effect is experienced exclusively on low or [threshold](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#Threshold) dosages and feels less forced than it does with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Suggestibility enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This component is, generally speaking less consistent and pronounced than it is with substances like [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . The mental euphoria experienced on LSD is usually simply due to an enhancement of the user’s current psychological and emotional state coupled with its more regularly occurring effect, [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) .
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Ego replacement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_replacement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - This can manifest prominently during a 1P-LSD experience, particularly during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) phase, often resulting in bouts of uncontrollable giggles and laughter that can form a feedback loop if around others who are also under the influence.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**

- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol's central depressant effects can be used to reduce some of the anxiety and tension produced by 1P-LSD. However, alcohol can cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively impact the direction of the trip. Users are advised to pace themselves and drink a portion of their usual amount.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines are highly effective at reducing the intensity of 1P-LSD's effects through the general suppression of brain activity.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis strongly intensifies the sensory and cognitive effects of 1P-LSD. Extreme caution is advised when using this combination as it can significantly increase the chances of a negative psychological reaction like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - 1P-LSD enhances the cognitive, visual and general hallucinatory effects of dissociatives. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) and [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) become more vivid and intense on 1P-LSD. These effects correspond with an increased risk of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - 1P-LSD and MDMA are highly synergistic and mutually enhance each other's physical, cognitive, and visual effects. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is advised to start with markedly lower doses than one would take for each individually. There is some evidence that suggests LSD increases the neurotoxicity of MDMA, which may be relevant to 1P-LSD as well.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, 1P-LSD's physical, cognitive, visual, auditory, and transpersonal effects intensify and synergize strongly. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Combined with psychedelics, stimulants can cause severe *''' [Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , *''' [Panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , *''' [Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , and*''' [Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 1P-LSD use have not been studied. This is because 1P-LSD is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with almost no history of human use.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying 1P-LSD by itself, at low to moderate doses, and using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be conducted to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

Based on its similarity to LSD, 1P-LSD is assumed to be physiologically well-tolerated with a extremely low toxicity relative to dose. There are relatively few physical side effects that have been reported following acute 1P-LSD exposure.

However, as with LSD and psychedelics in general, it is likely that 1P-LSD can act as a trigger for those with underlying mental disorders. Those with a personal or family history of mental illness are generally advised not to use this substance, particularly when outside of a supervised medical setting.

It is strongly recommended that one uses [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Overdose

1P-LSD has no known toxic dose. However, higher doses increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions. These reactions include [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and, more rarely, [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . Medical attention is usually not needed except in the case of severe psychotic episodes or the ingestion of [fake acid](/w/index.php?title=Fake_acid&action=edit&redlink=1) (such as [25i-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25i-NBOMe) or [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) ). Administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help to relieve the acute negative cognitive effects of 1P-LSD.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is assumed that like LSD itself, 1P-LSD is non-addictive with a low abuse potential. There are no literature reports of successful attempts to train animals to self-administer LSD — an animal model predictive of abuse liability — indicating that it does not have the necessary pharmacology to either initiate or maintain dependence. Likewise, there is virtually no withdrawal syndrome when chronic use of LSD is stopped. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is assumed that 1P-LSD shares these properties with LSD.

Tolerance to the effects of 1P-LSD is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 1P-LSD produces cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the use of 1P-LSD they will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

The following substances are listed on the assumption that 1P-LSD possesses a similar if not the same dangerous interactions profile as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , and may include more due to its status as an unstudied [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) .

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 1P-LSD. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

1P-LSD is not scheduled under the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It is considered to exist in a legal grey area in many countries, meaning that while it is not specifically illegal, individuals may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Austria** : 1P-LSD is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD, thus making it illegal to supply for human consumption.
- **Canada** : 1P-LSD is not mentioned in the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* , so it is technically not illegal. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Czech Republic** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance as of January 1, 2014.
- **Denmark** : As of August 25, 2015, 1P-LSD is specifically named on the list of illegal substances.
- **Estonia** : 1P-LSD is an ainete I ( *Schedule I* ) controlled substance as of June 1, 2017.
- **Finland** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance as of November 15, 2018.
- **Germany** : 1P-LSD is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Japan** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance.
- **Latvia** : 1P-LSD is illegal in Latvia. Although it is not officially scheduled, it is controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.
- **Lithuania** : 1P-LSD is illegal in Lithuania and is specifically named on the list of illegal substances since September 21, 2015.
- **Norway** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance as of February 14, 2013.
- **Romania** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance.
- **Singapore** : 1P-LSD is a Class A controlled substance.
- **Sweden** : Following its sale as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) , 1P-LSD was made illegal in Sweden on January 26, 2016.
- **Switzerland** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E. It is illegal as of December 2015.
- **Turkey** : 1P-LSD is illegal in Turkey as of February 2016.
- **United Kingdom** : 1P-LSD is illegal to produce, supply, or import under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26, 2016.
- **United States** : 1P-LSD is unscheduled in the United States of America. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Since 1P-LSD can be considered a prodrug for LSD, its possession and sale may be prosecutable in the United States under the Federal Analogue Act.
- **Italy:** 1P-LSD is a schedule I drug (Tabella 1).
