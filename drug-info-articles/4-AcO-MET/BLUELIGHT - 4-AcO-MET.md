I recently gave a friend of mine some of this compound (the fumurate) and I asked him to write a trip report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  If anyone has any information whatsoever or experiences with this stuff feel as free as a birdy to add to this thread. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Can someone estimate the dosage of this compound needed? It's not in tikhal either I think. 


Ok, people. Discuss! :D

Remember you had the fumurate which could play a significant role in the dosage you took. Maybe a hcl salt of 4-ACO-MET would require less. Or was it more? I'm too high to remember myself right now but I felt this was rather important if we're going to disscus the dose. I wouldn't want for accidents to happen and feel guilty because I could have done something about it. That's just me.


Hey, Gaian Planes. You were right. 4-ACO-DALT is just lovely. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) I'll type up my "trip report" in a bit.

^^ HCL salts require a lower dosage than their corresponding fumarate salts.

I tried 4-aco-met a few days ago, although i'm not sure if it was 4-aco-met, could've been 4-ho-met, since it was very similar. 20mg was rather big dose for this chem, perhaps I had the HCl salt.. It felt like supercharged 4-ho-met, quicker and more intense. ~5mg intravenously was amazing, DMT-like visuals and wonderful euphoria. Shoot, wait 7 seconds -> bliss. I found my new favourite. I should be getting 500mg more soon, can't wait! I'd like to try 4-aco-dmt for comparison.

How close alike are 4-AcO-MET and 4-AcO-DET? Are they both very similar?

How similar are they to 4-HO-MiPT and 4-AcO-DMT?

I'm trying to get an idea of how different all of these chemicals are to one another, because I have access to 4-AcO-MET and 4-AcO-DET but I already have 4-HO-MiPT and I'll have 4-AcO-DMT very soon. 

Are they all very close to the same effects?

I have never tried 4 aco met so i cant know for sure, but im willing to guess that there would be some similarities between the two but they would each still retain a unique quality about them that would make them different.

Again they are similar but there are differences aswell.

IMO 4 aco dmt is closer to 4 aco mipt

and 4 ho mipt is more like 4 ho dmt (or mushrooms)

They all have similarities with each other and mushrooms but are still unique. 

Also the 4 ho tryptamine will be different than its acetate.


The only 4 ho tryptamine that seems to be different than the rest is 4 ho dipt (iprocin).

I have a small quantity of this compound and will be trying it out this upcoming weekend. I'll try to post a trip report because I've seen virtually no information on this substance whatsoever. I'm thinking of trying 20mg? Does that seem like a reasonable estimate? I have a fair bit of tripping experience (acid around 10 times, shrooms twice, 2c-i, 2c-e, DOC, and a few others) and I'm looking for a trip to rival the 2C-I trip I had a few days ago. Any thoughts or other peoples' experiences I could use to help me plan this trip?

Usually when I went looking for some experience to rival another I came out horribly disappointed. Just saying ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Dosed approximately 20mg and was feeling effects within an hour. Definitely a very gentle, easy come up. Things became significantly more colofful and took and a beautiful hue. Outside of this, however, visuals were surprisingly minimal and consisted only of things morphing into multiple layers, simple color changes, etc. The real main point of the trip was the emotional connectedness it put between my girlfriend and I. There are issues that have been plaguing us for our entire relationship, and last night it really seemed like we got rid of most of them, and achieved a much deeper level of personal communication that has carried over so far into today (she texted me that she loved me first thing in the morning today). Overall I would say this is a very interesting substance. 20mg was a bit of a low dose of 4-AcO-MET. This could've been because I had the fumarate or some such, though, I honestly don't know. My recommendations:


12-18mg - light trip with audio/color enhancement, perhaps some gigles, very "cliche" psychedelic, good for a first trip

20-28mg - this is where I think most psychedelics users are going to find a decent sweet spot, but I don't know yet

25-35mg - this could also end up being the sweet spot, depending on how hard you like to trip. more information is needed to even make accurate guesses.


Anyway, sorry there's no trip report, about an hour into the trip my girlfriend and I broke down into a teary-eyed confessional love and understanding fest and I forgot about all else until I was coming down. I assure you, though, this is a very interesting substance. Got minimal visuals from 20mg, but reminded me of low dose acid or shrooms. Definitely a tryptamine.


EDIT: Yes, I did mean 4-Aco-MET and it's been edited.

Another trial of ~22 or so mg tonight. Had 2 20mg caps left took one, then took a little more out of the other. Should I just go ahead and down the other and prepare for a hell of a night or should I stop it know and see where I land?

The first 4 position aco compound I've stumbled across (took 4 ho dipt once but had too much cross tolerance to gauge its effect at the time).  I tried it a couple weeks ago, my first trip in more than a year, but for some reason I wasn't inspired to post about it until now.


That's not to say this stuff is not inspiring.  I must say I like it very much.  Can anyone compare it to 4 aco dmt or 4 aco mipt? (both of which I want to try very much, and may have the opportunity sometime soon).


Ate a sandwich about 1 hour before dosing.  Dose ~25 mg.  I was at a +2 in 30 minutes, +3 by 45 minutes.  Very smooth, with some excitement/perhaps uneasiness on the comeup, but nothing close to anxiety, especially considering I hadn't tripped in so long, and I was by myself.  Very visual.  A good amount of morphing and tryptamine "breathing".  But the CEV's, oh my!  Distinct reptilian-like patterns enveloped me, through which my psyche was projected.  I just sat back in awe, everything was so detailed, and the longer I gazed, the deeper I went.  


When I opened my eyes, a similar pattern of colors danced in a spiral motion on my wall and ceiling, aided by the music I was listening to (Radiohead, which seemed appropriate).


Short-lived, but that is to be expected.  I was almost at baseline within 5 hours, with some minor after effects.  It had a sort of "laid-back intensity" if that makes sense.  Interesting and enjoyable.  Will most definitely explore at higher doses.  


It looks like I will have the opportunity next month to combine it with mushrooms, in a cabin in the secluded north woods.  The plan is to dose ~2 grams, then an as-of-yet undecided quantity of my new friend about an hour later.  I'm sure you will hear back from me ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


edit: I have the fumerate, fyi, which is what seems to be circulating at the moment.  The powder has a subtle tan tint to it.

also body load was non-existent for me.  no nausea or any negative physical symptoms detected.  subtle after-glow the next day.

I didn't find it as short lived as most people claim to, I was still definitely not at baseline at 7hrs, though I did take 30mg.  I really like this chem a lot.  Very Ralph Steadman, IMO.  People's faces looked extremely strange and stretched to odd proportions.  Colors & lights were wild, pot greatly potentiated it, possibly due to the fact I've been smoking next to no pot for about 6 or 7 weeks now.  I'd looked for this thread before and couldn't find it, ended up posting some info on this chem in the 4-HO-MET thread.

right on, I enjoyed it thoroughly at that dose.  Could be my fave tryptamine.  Definitely up there with 4-Aco-DMT.  Will be trying 4-Aco-DET in the near future.  I'm definitely curious as to the difference between the two

30 mg is indeed a wonderful dose.


I was a bit disappointed by the CEV's this time, but not in the overall experience at all.  opened eye visuals more than compensated.  lots of color and breathing.  CEV's definitely present, just not as detailed or enveloping this time around.


had a bit of dank ale (22 oz of Dragon's Milk) so that is affecting me a bit, but still going after 6 + hours.   On set still hit me the same, 30-45 minutes for full affect.  did not eat about 4 hours prior to dose.  strangely appetite seemed almost normal.  snacked on hummus and bread several times throughout trip.


very euphoric, no anxiety, and quite social.  had some company over about 3 1/2 hours into it, very comfortable and fluid, albeit a bit scattered and some difficulty focusing at times.  some fits of giggles, though not uncontrollable (though no giggles in the company of others, just at comments on facebook, music lyrics, and internal dialogue)


listened to a lot of Ween, which seemed fitting for my state of irreverent bliss.  Pure Guava seemed to be the perfect album for my state of being.  


I'm still not sure about taking this further, or if it could have any potential as far as ego dissolution goes.  I feel this is more suited toward recreation.  definitely some erotic overtones as well.


I caught myself saying out loud several times, "I love this stuff!"

wow.


i took 20mg of 4-aco-det and was totally underwhelmed. but when i threw in 20mg of 4-aco-met things changed so rapidly and wonderfully that i dare say tonight was one of the most emotionally rich evenings i have ever had. hints of the power of mdma in certain ways but without feeling dumb and great visuals.  i cant believe how wonderful this substance is and how little information there seems to be. (no entry in thikal unless i totally missed it...i know the ho's are in there BUT are they the same as far as safety and dosage ranges?


so


. what are the safe limits? any info on toxicity, etc. insufilation (sp?) ranges would be good too.


anyone done enough with this to figure out tolerance curves? are they similar to pscilosybin or more like dmt?


thanks!

I believe the acetate ester was mentioned in TiHKAL.  I don't know of any info on toxicity, but generally speaking, 4-aco-trypts are quite safe & non-toxic.  Dunno much about insufflation either, as tryptamines usually smell & taste so bad I avoid that ROA

**4-Acetoxy-MET???**


So there's pretty much zero information about this stuff online (it's not even on Erowid). Has anyone here done it before? Are the doses/effects about the same as 4-Acetoxy-DET? I've got 50mg of it, was planning on starting with 15 and taking 5-10 more if that wasn't enough. I just hate trying things without knowing what I'm getting into.

I love it!  I find that for me this is an amazingly rich substance. Not super visual (for me) but it had some very emapathogenic qualities, and a really nice feel to it. a few people I have talked to feel the same way. I far prefer it over 4-aco-det. Of course I had a bit of a tolerance the few times I have done it (always at 25-30mg) and I am quite sure it could go into more intense territory than I have gone with it. But even still, I think it would retain some of its softness no matter what. this is all conjecture of course but....


i plan on writing a trip report for this one eventually.


There needs to be more info on this. Errowid has no page for it, etc.


unless you are super sensitive, I wouldnt recommend 15mg-if you trust your source.


depending on your tolerance and your disposition, I would go with at least 20mg.(for me i wont go less than 25) i don't feel that this substance is going to bite you. but you know yourself best.


it is rather short as well and for me, when it starts tapering I am always very sad.

oh and one final comment, though this is subjective.....i don't find that throwing more in after the intitial dose makes too much of a difference in intensity. or let me rephrase that....you CAN come up a bit but you don't ever recreate the initial intensity level. it has a very nice physical quality to it in the first hour or more and I find that my initial level is where I am going to stay.


But this is only based on 3 experiences with it. YMMV

Thanks, that's great to hear! Maybe the gf and I will just go ahead and take all of it (25mg each) or take 20 then 5 more later if we feel we need it. How long would you say it takes to feel the full effects? And your 25-30mg doses are oral, correct?


Gotcha, you pretty much answered the questions in the post I just made. We'll just go ahead and take the whole 25. If there's a way to make trip reports on chems that aren't listed on erowid, I definitely will do one ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

25mg is a rather high dose.  10-20mg is more in line.  Every 2mg can cause dramatic increases in potency.

yeah thats why i asked about tolerance and sensitivity. 


of course, compared to say 23mg of 2c-t-2 or 20mg of 2c-e, I would say 20-25mg of 4-aco-met is quite a pleasant ride. ymmv. I dont know how you usually dive into a new RC. if you are the type of person who likes it strong or likes to check it out a bit first.  (and yes i am talking about Oral)


I suppose you dont have a lot of it. so you could have a few lower dose trips or maybe one larger one. check the larger thread on this. I cant remember if anyone has had a "negative" experience with higher doses. also, look into 4-ho-met which many people tell me is comparable in some senses.


the bodyload for me was non-existent btw.... I havent timed how quickly it came up, BUT the come up for me is always intense. Not in a scary way but in that it is very distinct.


"12-18mg - light trip with audio/color enhancement, perhaps some gigles, very "cliche" psychedelic, good for a first trip

20-28mg - this is where I think most psychedelics users are going to find a decent sweet spot, but I don't know yet

25-35mg - this could also end up being the sweet spot, depending on how hard you like to trip. more information is needed to even make accurate guesses."

i have some new comments on this which might be important to some. there is a risk in some people with this of muscle tremors (or charlie horses) which are not fun. though they subside eventually....its possible this was already known about the 4-ho-met or its possible that some of the other 4-aco's do this


another thing i would like to mention is that a lot of people find this very physical...your mind is very connected to the way your body FEELS....which can work in a negative or positive way depending on your state of mind (this COULD be said for many other PD's of course but i think its very marked with this substance) it has a wonderful feel for some but i have known people who did not like it.


btw....based on this disucssion i would like to add a comment about dosage...someone took 18mg and barely felt anything but charlie horses....only after adding 10mg more did they seem to ease into anything enjoyable.


they had no tolerance at all.


how can you tell if you have the fumerate or the salt?and which is more potent again???


the one i have seen is very very fine, almost like a mist of dust

I wanted to take a minute to let everyone know in each of the substance Big and Dandies about the community project of the PD forum which has been being worked on for the past 2 years or so, the Psychedelic Effects Profile survey.  This survey asks you a number of questions, starting with the substance taken, the dose, the method of administration, other substances (non-psychedelic) ingested during the trip, and set and setting, and then it goes on to ask about a variety of specific effects, and you can select whether or not you experienced them and if so, the intensity level of that effect on a 5-point scale.


Thank you for your help with this!  For this to be of any use whatsoever, we need as many responses as we can possibly get, so please take it as many times as you have time for, for as many substances as you have had proper trips on.  We want to gather the full range of effects possible so feel free to take it for positive as well as negative experiences, for earth-shattering and average.  Each time taking the survey is for a single trip on a single substance - no combinations please, as it taints the data for each substance.  In the future I may make another survey for combinations.  The survey takes about 5 minutes to get through so it's not too much of your time.


For further discussion of this project, please see the stickied thread at the top of the forum that starts with "Community Project".  To take the survey, please click on this link: [http://freeonlinesurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=hvw6fx9mmvzz82l599169](http://freeonlinesurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=hvw6fx9mmvzz82l599169)

(I wanted to also add that with the less-common substances such as 4-AcO-MET, it's even more vitally important that anyone who has experience with it please contribute, as there are only so many people in existence that have even tried this.)

So I took some around 10sh am and its 305 and i'm almost baseline a few visual effects still nothing major.  VERY VERY SMOOTH, although for an hour i got these "brain zaps" that i couldn't explain.


This was the first trip I've had in awhile so when I felt the comeup coming on, I went and laid down with my dog and I don't know if I was in and out of sleep and dreaming or what it was but for awhile I kept thinking I was with other people on a beach or something, when it was just me and my pup laying in bed.  I got these huge brain zap type things where like everything in my brain would just click really loud, but before I knew it 2 hours had gone by so I decided to get up and do some lawn work.


Boy was that entertaining cutting the grass and watch it grow right back :O. 


Overall I'm sure I didn't get too heavy of a dose (eyeballed off the end of a steak knife, guessing ~25mg) and it was an awesome experience.   Not much mindfuck at all (although the guy in the Qwest van working while I was enjoying my cig and mowing my lawn gave me some irky vibes), purely visual if you let it be like you really had to open your mind and be like 'SHOW ME SOMETHING' for major visuals, although there were some CEVs (tryptamine-like) most of it was OEV (when willing).


Probably only a ++ trip but a fantastic one, ready for a night of SoCo and beer.

buy a scale man, this one is likely pretty non-toxic, but a $40 scale could potentially keep you from having a bad time or dying.


Also, there's no way to know what 25mg of that looks like... All the 2c's & 4-AcO's have different weights, volumes, etc, so it makes your data completely useless for other BLers

ehh, i figure if there are 40 25mg doses per baggie, i can't be THAT far off, and with tryps the dosages are pretty forgiving, but I do plan on getting one, eventually.


WOWWOWOWOWOOWWW, after yesterday this compound has taken to my second favorite psychedelic, behind acid, and it is very close to taking over that spot.


Started the day by having about 5 beers and dosed at 3Pm so we would be tripping into the night.  My friend and I tripped our NUTS off with the comeup taking around 15 minutes (dosed a knife tip poured into lemonade).  The visuals on this substance are INSANE.  The visuals get super super crazy if you can focus your mind on one are, I had the entire rug underneath my feet moving on my command like an orchestra. 


 We watched the baseball game and redosed a little less than the original dose when we were almost all the way back to baseline around 730 or so (not all the way, but most body stimulation was gone and visuals were very weak)... 

I didn't think the redose would do much but damn, it brought (at least brought me) right back to a +++ experience with visuals once again going NUTS in my field of vision.  It was finally starting to get dark outside (around 9) so we went outside and started playing with firecrackers, sparklers, and shot off a bunch of shells. 

  Took a trip to a park to set off some big boys and we were paranoid cops were just waiting for us to light it.  instantly when we lit it , we both heard someone yell 'POLICE' and what I heard was "xxxxxxxx police, stop right there" and he heard "stop right there i'm calling the police." either way we fucking BOOKED back to his house and shut all the doors and garage and turned off all the lights in paranoia :D. Took us back to the good old days of doing stupid shit and running from the cops ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).  


We then watched Hot Tub Time Machine after 20 minutes of stupid phone ordering with DISH (funny as hell movie while tripping by the way).   I love this substance, can't wait to get my 4-aco-dmt in.


I forgot to mention throughout the day we both drank about 12 beers, maybe 5 or 6 before the trip started, and 6 or 7 after we started tripping.  I also forgot we redosed the redose with about half of the redose split between two (extra 5 or so mg each I would guess) around 10:30 or 11?.  We then watched Golden Eye and it brought us back to the N64 game and we were geeking out about how funny it was that we knew all the missions from the game (although we both had seen the movie before).  Started tripping at around 3, and didn't come completely down until about 2 am or so, maybe even 2:30.  Another 2 hours of a cracked out feeling and I finally got some quality sleep, with INSANE DREAMS.


This substance is pretty visual both open and closed eyed, and does have mind expanding properties, but there was never any real mindfuck.  My quote of the day was when I was laughing super hard with a beer in my hand for some reason I said "I feel like I'm gonna just melt"


Great 4th of July with a great friend.


3pm - first dose sharp, straight knife tip so I would guess around 25 mgs again

7:30 or 8 pm - first redose, comeup in about 10 minutes tripping HARD again

11 or so pm - small, small booster dose.

it depends what you do on it. going to a baseball game and running from cops isn't going to bring out the depth to it. it is just going to be really fun.

There is some depth, but it was obviously blurred by the amount of beer being consumed.  The head space was definitely trippy, and we had some in depth conversations about life, but I do not think it will take you very deep down like mushrooms or acid has for me in the past.


Coming up there is definitely some "body load" -- nothing near like mushrooms, just you feel kind of hot.  It was also 90 and humid so that could have played a factor.  When we redosed we didn't feel as hot, but the temp had gone down a bit so I'm not sure if it was just the drug or the drug+the temp or just the temp that did it.


If anyone wants to see what I consider a "knife tip" dose just let me know I'll shoot a pic.

My buddy acquired some of this 4-aco-met and wants me to be his lab rat.  I am kinda sketchy on it but he says we need to try it sooner than later because it degrades somewhat quickly.  Hoping that I can dig up some better info on it here on BL because I sure can't find anything on Erowid.


Sounds pretty good though from the TR's here (although I can certainly live without any police encounters)

4 co MET is the most visual/other effects substance i ever tried.

More visual than 4 aco DMT and fare less mystic or mind disturbing.

I haven't found it to be overly visual in the open eye arena, but CEV's have been amazing, especially when combine with cannabis and a small bit (10 mg) of oxycodone (btw I normally don't even like oxy, but for some reason I tried this combo and the euphoria is flooring).  


Open eye visuals do take on a unique quality, I can pick out the distinct geometric patterns that emerge along the edges of objects pretty clearly.  I'm pretty sure I could distinguish the visuals of this material from most anything else.


PS: Xorkoth I've added my contribution to your survey on this substance, referencing my first experience not combined with anything, for what it's worth.

i had some minor tremor on the comeup, and i took 28mg.  They didn't last very long.  In fact I was at a show some friends of mine were playing and I was looking for a good spot to do some video when they started, and I was thinking "shit, i want to get this song on video but i've got the damn tryptamine shakes" but as soon as i found a good spot my hands quit shaking, my legs still had tremor for a few more minutes, but not the duration of the song, and the video turned out quite well :D

I tried 20mg of 4-aco-met the other day. Really fun drug. Lasted about 3 hours. I'd describe its effects as a cross between mushrooms and caffein - thoughts were really racing. This is unlike my experience with 4-aco-dmt which was a bit more harsh (on the stomach and psyche) and was more of a trippy distorted high (visually and mentally). It played on my thoughts and emotions in a sort of confused and disorganized way whereas 4-aco-met was just stimulating and fun.

Well I would say find the dosage line were the confusion begins and use a dosage which is kinda high but not confusing. Then combine it with a good sativa strain or JWH-250. Don't overdo the Cannabinoids as you don't feel high or trippy anymore, more sober. After that start some meditation music, close your eyes and lay down. This induces a intensive and deep mystical/religious state BUT still clear and soberlike.

SO 4-ACO-MET is stronger than 4-ACO-DMT,i thought the dmt would be stronger.

I've access to both these and the MET is winning so far,what do people think of this because i love a good trip out and the MET seems more colourfull(then again im wizzing ) so whats the coo.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Finally someones stocking this! I've tried 4-ho-met, 4-aco-dmt, and shrooms so I'm super excited to see the difference. Should be taking it in around two weeks, and I far, far prefer 4-aco-dmt over 4-ho/po-dmt(Shrooms) and I expect to like 4-aco-met even more than 4-ho-met. I dosed 33mg 4-aco-dmt, 20mg 4-ho-met, and 3.5g of shrooms typically. I'm thinking 25-30mg for my first time, haven't tripped on a phen or trpy for a month, and it'll be more by then. I'm so excited.

Extrapolating from subjective comparison of several 4-substituted AcO/OH tryptamines I would venture to assume that 4-aco-met is less potent than 4-ho-met.

This has been my experience comparing the AcO/OH substitution pattern.

That was my experience as well.  Only have had the chance to take 4-AcO-MET a couple of times, and it didn't get terribly interesting until +25mg.  4-HO-MET i found quite interesting even under 20mg, though more than that was fun as well :D  I also have substantially more experience with 4-HO-MET, so don't take my word as the absolute truth.


Another thing i've noticed is that, for me at least, the AcO tryptamines tend to be less stimulating than their free phenol counterparts.  This was most apparent when i compared 4-HO-MiPT with 4-AcO-MiPT.  Less noticeable with the METs, but still discernible, IMO.

Well, for me 4-ho-met isn´t stimulating at all.


Sounds like there is no real difference between the 2 really.

perhaps stimulating is the wrong word... I didn't find 4-HO-MET stimulating in the amphetamine/caffeine sense, but i would be unable to go to sleep on it or for a couple hours after, same goes for 4-HO-MiPT.  However, i've fallen asleep at or near the peak of a 4-AcO-MiPT trip, & during the comedown of a 4-AcO-MET experience.

I got to try this one out recently at 15mg, and had a pretty amazing experience.  First time I've ever cried tears of joy on any drug.  It was a lot more intense than I was expecting but definitely in a good way.


For those who are curious about it's comparison to 4-ho-met:  I've never tried it but it seems like it's pretty similar.  Very euphoric and colorful.  I've heard about 4-ho-met being a gentle and easy to handle experience though, and I wouldn't say 4-aco-met was gentle.  It was very good to me but I could see it being overwhelming to a beginner.


edit: 15mg of 4-aco-met felt more intense than 30mg of 4-aco-dmt.  I was very surprised at my strong +++ just from 15mg.

I would venture a guess that at higher doses 4-aco-met differs from 4-ho-met more significantly a la 4-aco-dmt vs. 4-ho-dmt but I couldn't say not having done them.

Interesting. Could you elaborate? I've found a convergence in effects of 4-ho-DMT and 4-aco-DMT, as in, they are strikingly similar, in higher doses.


In low doses I think it would be easier for me to tell them apart. Although I wouldn't bet money on it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Ah, well for me 4-aco-dmt has somewhat of its own quality at higher doses - it's "more DMT like" to quote others (visionary, maybe? It's hard to describe). It's all so subjective though, haha.

From what I've read, here are the main differences:


4-AcO-MET:  Gentler comeup, requires a slightly higher dose, longer lasting


4-HO-MET:  Rougher comeup, more stimulating, more potent


Recently tried 4-HO-MET and definitely didn't find it "gentle" or any of the other words people use that could be interpreted as "weak".  It's a powerful psychedelic that lasts waaaay longer than 4-AcO-DMT.

I did some. It was pretty fun.

As my first psychedelic, I couldn't really compare it to anything, but the visuals were really vivid and clear and just amazing. More emphasis on the CEVs rather than the OEVs, rainbows and shit.

The body load became really stimulating and uncomfortable at some points though, but that passed.

Overall, I would recommend it.

My new favorite tryptamine, i knew it in 5 seconds. 


Now normally other people don't get what i'm saying (you reading this nanobrain, nano, knowhatamines) , but, to my total and "shocking" surprise, 4-ho-MET keeps the DMT MAGIC... but, the cololrs are so much more pretty...  it felt most like DMT to me, it even had the fluidity, entities flying off walls and peaking out of the corners and stuff like that.  I read that you often see the 'ancient foreigh language' on it too, only seen it once on DMT i think.  


So a methyl and an ethyl retains the "DMTness", but 4-ho-MiPT does not.  Weird.. maybe its just too big?   Probably nobody knows what i'm talking about, but its that natural, spiritual, "earthy" hyperdimentional opening higher consciousness thing and a pleasant earthy body feeling, not that stuff like 4-ho-dipt doesn't feel good it does but there's no DMTness about it.  I think ho-met is better than psilocin.  If cheap MET could be had, to put in mushroom substrate, might be able to make legal shrooms.. that are more colorful and it seemed even more DMT like than psilocin/4-aco-dmt.    Or maybe it was the right day right time but i doubt it, i want a gram as soon as i find where to obtain one.  I'd trade all my 4-aco-dmt for 4-ho-met it was that good for me.  And i'm the one who brought the world 4-aco-dmt (didnt invent it i just got the first synthesis made, i assumed wrong that any other thing on there but a -dmt could be like DMT.)

Well that sounds nice yoyoman, and what dosage did you use with the 4-AcO-MET?

When you say it felt more intense than 4-AcO-DMT - in what ways? Was the mindfuck stronger? More visual? More intense euphoria? I find a lot of peoples definitions of intensity vary dramatically, so I'm quite curious.


I'm definitely looking towards trying this. I prefer 4-AcO-DMT to 4-HO-DMT, and since I've become interested in peoples reports regarding 4-HO-MET recently, I figure 4-AcO-MET might be preferable for me.

More intense in the sense of how disconnected I was from reality, so yeah mindfuck basically.  I did not find the intensity of visuals to be stronger though.  Also, for me, I think euphoria can be reached more easily on 4-aco-met than 4-aco-dmt.  The latter certainly has a warm and happy push to it, but 4-aco-met seems to facilitate mind blowing euphoria a bit easier.


I will be trying 4-ho-met in the near future and will be able to report back on qualitative differences between it and its acetylated brother. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Unlike campaigns, I felt an average amount of mindfuck, not really more or less. However the intensity of the visuals were much more than other psychedelics I've tried, and also it was filled with euphoria, so ymmv.

These things do seem to vary a bit from person to person. Wish I had more experience with 4-ACO-MET As to compare. At some point I may attempt some sort of blinded research with some 4-AcO & 4-HO tryptamines. There do seem to be differences between them, but said differences are experienced differently by different people. Interesting ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Here's a link to a TR I wrote about an experience I had with this substance a few years ago [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...ce-These-aren-t-the-droids-you-re-looking-for](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/501226-4-Aco-MET-(28mg)-New-Experience-These-aren-t-the-droids-you-re-looking-for)

All in all I think its a pretty worthwhile substance, though I only have had the one experience with it. If memory serves its a little less potent than the free phenol. I don't recall it having the long tail that metocin has, but its been a while so I'm not 100% sure. Will have to do some side by side testing with 4-HO-MET to know for sure ;-)

Might be aquiring some of this sooner or later... sounds fun. 


I've tried 4-aco-det a few times, and seem to like it better than 4-aco-dmt I think. It seems "lighter"? I think I prefer mushrooms to 4-aco-dmt as well, but I don't think I've given 4-aco-dmt a full fair shake yet though.


Excited to try the 4-aco-met though. From what I've read here, it might be less of a "mind fuck". Sometimes it's nice to get inside your head and be serious, but sometimes it's nice to just relax with it ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

This stuff had me laughing to the point of tears. Seriously, if you're reading this thread and haven't tried this stuff yet, then you're missing out.

I'll just post this picture of my experience with 18mg + 6mg of the fumurate.


![jwVnw.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FjwVnw.png&hash=0c7576abf910cec5f56de698bd607e57)


The come-up was pretty fast and the peak seemed rather short compared to other trips. About 2 hours later I decided that 18mg wasn't very exciting and I took a 6mg booster dose. This booster surprisingly brought me up to a peak that was equal if not greater than the first peak. Three and a half hours after that some weed was smoked which amplified the trip nicely. The visuals of the trip were nice but nothing to write home about.

Overall, it was pretty good except that I couldn't sleep for many hours after. Just an endless train of recursive thoughts kept me awake. I recommend some benzos to knock you out if you plan on taking this at night.

Tried this stuff again. Seems to peak very quickly and then drop off just as quick, leaving you with a long tailing end that lasts quite a while. The body load was a little bumpy for me at first, but it mellowed out after the first hour. Good stuff though.

I did 25mg orally of this and it was mind blowing.  Set in very quickly and was gone in 4-6 hours.  Many colors, jewelike colors of orange, gold, yellow, and blue and such.  Morphing and 5-7 levels of tracers all layered.  When I looked at my hand I could see 5 of them all layered on each other.  The trip was some months ago but the experience is very profound.  Different than shrooms or L, better I'd say.


I am 6ft 2 at 180 pounds and the doseage was very heavy for me, an experienced L and shroom tripper.  Took me by surprise and took me from fear to elation to tears to joy and amazement.


Body load was rushing for the first hour but did level.  I have some 4-ho-met as well but have not tried it yet.

Just went and took a look at some 4-aco-met that I have been storing (in an original small zip bag) and it appears to have browned a bit... maybe this stuff breaks down into 4-ho-met pretty quickly?


Edit: After a second look, it does not appear as brown as I originally thought, it is more of an offshade of white.

Nah, it's fine.  Whatever causes the browning...they all do that and they all seem to remain the same potency.  Actually we probably know what these break down too if the results of 4-AcO-DET can be translated to all of the 4-AcOs.  They are not as unstable as often thought, especially salt forms.


Shulgin analyzed a batch of 4-AcO-DET that was browning years ago, and it...well just check out the vaults of Erowid for those details.  A little brown won't hurt ya.

It's gentler and more recreational than 4-HO-MET and 4-AcO-DMT.  I do enjoy 4-HO-MET, but the only batches I've seen for the past year have been brown/tan and the potency seems to be diminished.  4-AcO-MET is more lucid or the bunch.  The visuals are more interesting.  It's perfect for staring at a fish tank or the night sky and having great conversation for a few hours.  There are no GI issues that can occasionally accompany 4-AcO-DMT.  4-AcO-DET is like a beginners psychedelic.  4-AcO-MiPT can cause GI issues or amazing mental confusion that you don't want to deal with under that level of intoxication.  


If I want a light-hearted experience, 4-AcO-MET is my choice of 4-subs.  If I want to go to another world, mushrooms or 4-HO-MiPT.

That's a pretty accurate statement in vitro; quite likely in vivo as well.

Thanks so much! I am aware that tryptamines are less stable then phens (which is what I historically prefer/used/have most experience with when it comes to pyschs). If some of it did degrade into 4-ho then I am alright with that. From what I understand the dosing is pretty comparable between the two. I enjoyed 4-ho quite a bit as well.


Anyways, I am kinda feeling like sampling this again at some point in the near future. I enjoyed it the one other time I tried it, though it was a bit underwhelming. I did like that it was a bit more uplifting then mushrooms, which I have never been a big fan of. I tend to enjoy the more "fun" psychedelics.


 As I have noted, I tend to enjoy psychedelics the most at concerts/raves but it might be fun to share it with some friends (after fully explaining it to them of course)

Just tried 4-AcO-MET for the second time today, and I must say, I found the experiences to be VERY different from 4-HO-MET. 


I have tripped on 4-HO-MET dozens of times-- it is my favorite psychedelic-- and the effects have been extremely consistent overall. The chemical has always had an absurdly fast come-up for me when taken on an empty stomach, sometimes with peak effects arriving within 30 minutes of dosing. The come-up on the 4-AcO-MET, however, was much more drawn out, and unlike 4-HO-MET, which never produces negative body effects for me on the come-up, there was a notable body load for the 4-AcO-MET for the first ~60 minutes; I would almost describe it as a purely physical feeling of anxiety, if that makes any sense.


The visual effects were similar in geometry and color to 4-HO-MET, albeit less vibrant than the visuals from an equipotent dosage of the 4-HO. I found the mental effects overall to be quite disappointing. Whereas 4-HO-MET makes me feel creative, witty, energetic, and conversational, the 4-AcO-MET seemed to dull my creativity, and made it more difficult to remain engaged in conversation on complex topics.


Lastly, the duration and comedown were wayyy different. 4-HO-MET, even in dosages as high as 40mg, has never lasted a minute over 4 hours for me, and the comedown is so abrupt it is as if a switch is turned that precipitates an instant transition from tripping to nearly complete sobriety. The 4-AcO-MET, on the other hand, lasted fully 7 hours on both occasions I tried it! And the comedown was much more drawn-out and gradual than its 4-HO cousin.


About to go to bed now, and I'm still not really sure what to make of how different the 4-AcO-MET experiences were from all of my 4-HO-MET experiences, but I am inclined to think that it is strongly suggestive of the notion that 4-AcO-MET does not undergo significant metabolic conversion to 4-HO-MET before crossing the blood-brain-barrier, at least for someone with my particular splice variant of histone deacetylase, and whatever other relevant genetic factors would influence the enzymatic conversion.

Thanks for the report.


Does anyone have any dosage recemendations for this stuff? Like light dose v common dose v heavy dose?


A buddy and I have decided to trip and it has been awhile. I am thinking of going with 2c-c to be honest, just because we have not tripped much and plan on easing into it. I was thinking if that is the case then a 30 mg starter.


I also have a small amount of T7 so that is an option but that may be a bit heavy. My 2c-b is always saved for concerts so that is a no go except for maybe a booster.


Setting will likely just be chilling around the house.


Edit: Have not tripped much recently, both of us have plenty of lifetime experience.

Hello there, i have the chance to try this 4-aco-met. 15/20mg is a good starting dose to give someone a little sensitive to substances, and with a little anxiety? Thanks ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I didnt read all replys, but of corse you can mix it with hash no?


Edit: 20mg was very very nice, much better and stronger than wat i was expecting. i dont have much experience with psychedelics, but i loved the visuals, i couldnt belive wat i was seeing, amazing.

My friends did 20 mg recently, it was a tad stronger than they expected. I say it is stronger then 4-ho-met, from their description of effects. They were unable to understand anything/move around for 40+ mins.

10 mg fumerate. Tasted bitter and yukky. Couldn't get that taste out of my head.It was about what you'd expect from a combination of psilocybin and 4-HO-DET. Some omnipresent light nausea and tremors. Sort of visuals, nothing serious. My conclusion; ick...just ick. That was the last one I could try. They're all yukky. I'm out. I'm sticking with cannabinoids if anything. They actually do what I want them to do.


I will be so glad when this stuff clears my system so I can stop being thirsty and be able to eat something. This is why mushrooms put stuff like this out, so people won't eat them again. The heinosity is most heinous.

I agree with intensecycle there. 24mg 4-AcO-MET felt a lot stronger than 24mg 4-HO-MET, both fumarate.

A particular trustworthy supplier is offering a special combo deal on 4 aco MET and 5 meo MiPT. I'm wondering if anyone here has done both together. I'm thinking of doing 20mg 4acoMET and 5mg 5meoMiPT. Any suggestions?

^I'm going to mix each one of them (separately) in  375mL bottles of vodka, and then I can measure the doses with a tbsp for the 4acoMET and a Tsp for the 5meoMiPT. Then put that in a drink, good to go. I prefer that method over a capsule. Seems to hit a bit faster, plus it keeps me from having to whip out my scale every time I trip.

A spoon is not very accurate, you get the greatest volume differences where the surface area of the liquid is biggest, which is around the point where the spoon is filled to the brim. Obviously that is also the point where you spill the most so you get a sucky error margin.


Get an oral syringe, no needle required. They are used to give infants and pets doses of medications, so buy them at a pharmacy or pet store. Requiring no needle should help you avoid suspicion and you can make up some story about having to measure ingredients for some experiment or to give a pet an extra long regimen of meds.


First do the math so that you know what size syringe you need. Keep the volumes of vodka limited, because you shouldn't be forced to ingest some overly significant volume of alcohol every time you trip on these tryptamines. There's no point in diluting a lot.

Store the solution in some flask that suggests it is not a beverage, and/or add food dye, blue is the most unnatural.


Also, I'm not sure what concentration you have in mind but with 375 ml of vodka either you are seriously diluting or you are dissolving a LOT of tryptamine. If you are trying to compensate for inaccuracy...using a syringe helps with that. If you are weighing the psychedelics with a horribly inaccurate scale and want to augment the accuracy with liquid measurement then I could see why you sorta have to...

...but keep in mind that 4-substituted tryptamines are not really good to store in solution. Even though 4-AcO's are much less instable than 4-HO trypts, you still don't want to dissolve too much for long term storage! And preferably neither the 5-MeO-MiPT.

I've done the math. 500mg / 375mL. Gives you a concentration where one Tbsp is almost 20mg. Even if you're to assume a 15% margin of error, which is in my opinion a big stretch. Your still only looking at +/- 3mg, which isn't anything to worry about considering the dosage ranges of 4acoMET.


I understand that an oral syrenge is more accurate, however with this compound, I don't really feel that its going to be that big of an issue.


As far as long term storage, how long is long term? I'm only looking for this to remain stable for a couple weeks


Edit: just to clear, I'm using measuring tablespoons not household spoons

You can add an anti-oxidant to make up for the instability. Don't know how long it will last then, but my 4-Aco-DMT has been fine for a few months now. Best to split your stash in half just to be sure, if I were you.


Would second the oral syringe though, it's just nice to have some flexibility with your doses. Especially with 5-Meo-MiPT because it's hard to find your preferred dose, some like 4mg, some 6mg and so on. Would give your solution a different concentration if you do. I have a 20ml syringe for my 4-Aco-DMT at 2mg/ml, so that every .5ml has 1mg


p.s Is this less stimulating than than the 4-HO compound? Winter is coming so I need something that makes me content with sitting on a couch :D Could go for 4-Aco-MiPT otherwise, but it has to come from across the pond. Decisions, decisions, decisions..

My plan was to use tbsp for the 4acoMET and a tsp for for 5meoMiPT. In this concentration I find the following should work:

4acoDMT 20mg /Tbsp

Light dose = 3/4 Tbsp / 15mg

Medium = 1 Tbsp / 20mg

Heavy = 1 1/2 Tbsp / 30mg

Insane = 2 Tbsp / 40mg


5meoMiPT 6.66mg /Tsp (anyone superstitious?)

Light dose = 3/4 tsp / 5mg

Medium = 1 Tsp / 6.66mg

Heavy = 1 1/2 Tsp / 10mg

Insane = 2 tsp / 13.32mg


FYI, my light, medium, heavy, and insane is based on taking both together


Edit: also, I've measured my Teaspoons and Tablespoons before using a syringe that has .01mL graduations. Found them to be pretty accurate. At least for this application. Wouldn't use them for any 25x compunds tho


And I dunno if this is less stimiulating than the 4-HO, however I found the 4acoDMT to be very laid back, perfect for vegging on the couch watching family guy for 4 or 5 hours

I recently tested 12 mgs 5-meo-mipt followed at t+30 minutes with 13mgs 4-aco-met. The visuals were closer to what was experienced on 18 mgs 4-aco-met solo. The fantastic body component of 5-meo-mipt at the same dosage listed above was quite muted, but remained present if sought. Very enjoyable, however, not the best combo I've ever tried. May attempt again, but I'm in no hurry.

So today I had my first experience with this substance (14mg) and wow it blew me away. I was expecting maybe a medium strength trip but this was quite a strong one for me. I noticed the comeup within 10 minutes of dosing and at 1 hour in I was peaking. My ego was shattered at times where I just seemed to exist in a trance state blasting through the universe. There was a good half hour where I was in the trance state and it was amazing, I am still trying to integrate it and put it into words. The comeup was rather uncomfortable physically but it eventually became more comfortable...I definitely did have mild tremors and also heavy jaw clenching. I really wanted to go to the beach and trip in the beautiful weather but I decided to call off the beach trip and stay confined to my room because it was so intense and I was basically rendered useless and rolled into a ball on my bed for a couple hours. At one point I decided to take a shower and that was very intense because I was still experiencing ego loss and would just forget why I was in the shower or how long I had been in there. Also everything I heard would be changing pitch, either going higher or lower... Its hard to put this experience into words so sorry about my rambling.


Heres the notes I took on my phone:

14+-2mg 4-aco-met

1:20pm dosed

130 jittery, jaw clenching. Mind slower sweaty palms. A little nauseous/need to shit a little. Slight movement in visual field. Music sounds deeper/great. Diving into a trippy mindset

No increase in heart rate felt.

134 feel heavy 

137 getting chills through my body every so often 

Stuff shifting around a lot already 

139 small waves of nausea. Hard to focus. Music sounds really deep. Visuals move to music. I think I need to move around to exert some of this

energy that's building in my body

143 Kindof dizzy. Seems like time is flying by/thoughts are racing. Visualizer on Computer looks crazy

154. Body still really shaky this sucks.  Visuals already blew my mind. Intensification of colors . Hoping I don't have to puke

155 psychedelic crack? 

157 staring at a wall is quite entertaining

159 I feel like a child for some reason 

202 feel really drugged out yet compelled to go to the beach

211 feel like I am really high on weed+visuals. Body has calmed down a bit. Visuals are intense. I feel as if I'm peaking 

214 feel completely fucked

221 feels like bad hangover combined with crazy video game visuals. Can't think straight 

241 holding on to my ego

243 did I just see entities in my closed eye visuals? F

Flume sounds amazing and body feels slightly orgasmic 

247. Everything outside my window sounds really strange right now aside from the birds chirping . I get random moments where I feel 100% sober than get plowed in the face by this drug 

301 audio distortions very apparent

304 am I coming down? 

306 can't feel if I'm hot or cold right now. I just AM

310 how does my hair look so incredibly good right now

311 oldschool datsik groovin bass wobble 

312 just remembered my windows are open and this dub must be really loud haha

316 definitely past the peak and coming down but still have a lot of oev

320 feeling a little nauseous 

325 feel like I'm underwater 

342 residual anxiety as I come down

426 still a little spacey and oevs still going but mostly come down

500 body achey- still feel good/coming down mostly

519 slight audio distortions still


Overall I think this compound is beautiful and I recommend people to try it out. Just be safe with the doses, I think I will be testing this at a lower dose next time.

Good info. My first trial was 13 +/- 2 mgs orally in a gel cap.I found it to result in a +1, no real movement, but consciously aware I was askew. Then I tried 18 mgs and it was superb. Not too sure how far I'll push it, but I feel 22 mgs would be mint.

Seems to be a lot of variation in dose / impact reports for this one. 4ho met seems a lot more predictable.

I think it's just the lack of reports available. More research has to be done before a proper dose range can be determined.

I just ordered some. Impulse buy.


How is it for music enhancement? My only experience with 4-substituted tryptamines is 4-aco-dmt at 18 mg and 12 mg, which both times I found to be a bit weird and not very visual at all. Do folks recommend this one for a rather large psychedelic electronic concert?

I didn't find it specifically amazing for music enhancement but it is nice for sure. I think it could be awesome at a concert, if you find a good dose!

I'm thinking tomorrow I'm going for 7-9 mgs 5-meo-mipt and somewhere around 20 or a touch less of 4-aco-met capped together. It'll be a trial run for a wedding I'm attending in a week.


Update: so I opted not to do this at the wedding because I couldn't trial run it first. About 12 mgs 5-neo-mipt and about22 mgs 4-aco-met. The 4-met smoothed out the 5-mipt, but I think 4-aco-dmt will fit better into what I'm seeking from it. Got well out there, but slightly uncomfortable, not enough to not do it again, but somewhat intense.

My batch of 4-aco-met fumarate was VERY ACTIVE at 10 mg, and rather poorly suited for being in public in general. 


This was an interesting one. The setting I was in, as well as the company was pretty bad/far from ideal.  I would like to revisit, stagger doses, and be OUTSIDE.

I tried 20mg 4-aco-met on the weekend with 25mg x 4 doses of MXE throughout the evening. The MXE seemed to totally overpower the 4-aco-met. I barely felt it.

It's what I have and the quality is off the hook IMO. One the best 4 subbed Tryptamines they've ever carried.

It's been 4 or 5 years since I've taken this. May have to give it another swirl round the old 'noggin again this spring or summer sometime. The 4-AcO-MET & 4-AcO-DET I got back then both gave me mild but significant tremors for a short time on the come up. Haven't really had that happen since though. Go figure...

Yeah that infamous Canadian distributor's 4-AcO-MET is glorious. I think it's one of, if not the, strongest 4-subbed trypt.


4-AcO-MET is awesome, my favorite 4-sub alongside 4-HO-MiPT (4-AcO-DMT as well but that's for more "serious" trips). 4-AcO-MET is what LSD would be if it were a 4-subbed trypt, beautiful stuff, ecstatic body high, lovely, intense visuals that are like a direct middleground between LSD & shrooms/4-AcO-DMT (LSD colours/brightness w/ the shroom/acetylpsilocin character), classic psychedelic headspace- lucid, mystical, introspective. This is definitely one of those chems I'll consume vast quantities of over time.

Maybe.  I *think* I like it better than their 4-aco-dmt.


How is this one nasally?  Orally 10 mg at all once was almost too much.

Nice :D, thanks for the replies. I've heard a couple complaints about their recent batch of 4-ACO-DMT so I was a bit skeptical but then again they've had this in stock well before the new psilacetin batch came out. So I've got a question about dose as I'm confused, the post above and a couple more in the beginning of this thread makes it sound like Metacetin is more potent then Metocin but you've also got people saying the opposite so what dose would you guys say is equivalent to 30mgs of Metocin? My first trial with Metocin was at ~12mgs and it was slightly over threshold, 20-30mgs seemed to be the sweet spot for me depending on how deep I wanted to go. Also, would you say 4-ACO-MET has more depth than 4-HO-MET?

It's funny because my first impression of their new 4-aco-dmt was that it was a bit sub par. But additional tests have pretty much confirmed (for me anyways) that their 4-aco-dmt is the best I've ever had. Producing the most intense DmT like closed eye visuals I've ever experienced on 4-aco-dmt.

I haven't had metocin but I know Reddit seems to agree that metacetin is stronger and requires less for comparable effects.  Can staggered and/or nasal dosing reduce the body load?  The whole time after 10 mg orally, I felt like I was choking back a flood of saliva, and my lower back/kidney area hurt.


Interesting re: new batch of 4-aco-dmt.  The batch I have is OK, but I would probably give it away to a friend if I knew another batch was coming...whereas other things I hoard.

Huh, weird, I don't usually get much bodyload on 4-subtryptamines... unless I succumb to come-up anxiety, then I get lots of psychosomatic bodyload.  I suppose some of them do give me saliva/mucous production, but I have never experienced pain (even when anxious).

The pain came at the tail end of the comedown/next couple days.  I was also shaking a lot, teeth chattering, vasoconstriction-type symptoms.  It seemed to come and go.  How does one differentiate between psychosomatic and actual bodyload..?

I don't know, it's tough.  Some drugs produce obvious physical symptoms, such as vasoconstriction (if your veins become super tiny and you feel pulling when you stretch your arms out, it's obviously something physical).  But if you just feel a general discomfort or malaise, or even pain, it CAN be psychosomatic.  My main reason for believing this is because of my experiences with 2C-E.  Whenever I let the difficult come-up get to me and fail to rise above it, 2C-E feels like poison.  But if I am able to get past it, then it dissipates into a beautiful feeling by the time I reach the peak.  It showed me just how much your mental state can affect the way you feel.  Also consider depression, which can cause a person to actually feel pain, but the pain is not caused by anything but the mental state.

Ehh, Reddit is the last place I would trust info from but It wouldn't hurt to take it into consideration... I'll start my trials at 15mgs when I decide to place an order. FWIW, Metocin, when taken towards the mid-tail end of an aMT trip, caused some slightly worrying back pain that felt different from the back tension I usually experience, the pain was mildly sharp and unresolved with hamstring stretches, acetaminophen, etizolam, and kratom. The pain eventually dissapated when the 4-HO-MET was a couple hours. There was also extreme diuresis coupled with pressure urinating, it was quite worrying for a little while. All problems aside 4-HO-MET was great material, surprisingly I found that it had more depth than others claim. It reminded me of DMT more than any other 4-sub while also retaining the "gothic" nature that 4-subs bring me.


 I had taken the combo (aMT/Metocin) a couple times before and the trips were great and with no side-effects. I think there's something about 4-HO-MET that has this likelyhood of causing either kidney problems or strange back pains in a small minority of users and I actually made a thread about 4-HO-MET and kidney problems as there are a few reports of the that type of stuff on the web. The consensus in that thread was that Metocin was a very smooth and gentle chem on the body, which was true, but not on that one occasion. However, some of these people may just be experiencing lower back muscle tension and two of the few reports may be linked back to the same person going on how the person explained the scenario.


Here's a small collection of three reports of these kidney problems associated with 4-HO-MET, the top two reports sound similar though so I'm not sure what to make of them. IIRC there are about one or two more reports of this problem.

[http://www.shroomery.org/forums/show...umber/17789788](https://www.shroomery.org/forums/show...umber/17789788) " I have never felt any negative effect from mushrooms.


However after using 4-HO-MET (a psilocin analog) I suffered pretty severe kidney pains on the comedown and pissed dark and smelly urine for over a week.


This happened to me twice after using that compound. The second time it got so bad I went to the doctor after a couple of days, but they did not find anything wrong with the sample (of urine) I provided. Needless to say I will not be taking anymore of that stuff.


The experience itself was quite nice though."

I always find the 4 aco tryptamines to be superior to the 4 ho subtypes. Recently I have started to enjoy dissociatives combined with say 4 aco dmt (great but not as fun as 4 aco met), 4 ho met, 4 aco met (these two are my personal favorites), 4aco mipt, 4 ho mipt (ok but not as good as the aco counterpart), etc. Those listed are my favorite tryptamines. Doses for me persoanlly range from 20-40 mg depending on type and tolerance at the time of ingestion. Each are unique enough to be easily identifiable in terms of subjective effects from one another. I often use a small dose of benzo or oral opiate with these substances which is nice. 


 However the real magic is unlocked with the addition of say ketamine or MXE (HR note a dose of benzo is strongly advised when combining these substances especially at high doses of tryptamine and hole level doses of dissociatives). You must achieve the hole combined with the psychedelic to experience the profoundness of this combination. 4 aco met is my personal favorite closely followed by 4 aco dmt. If you have not had the opportunity and are experienced with both tryptamine's and dissociatives perhaps this is the next level these substances have to offer the user. Be safe, have beno's on hand THEY WILL NOT KILL THE EXPERIENCE trust me, they may prevent serious side effects like seizure, MI, stroke etc. I LOVE the combination the OEV's make even high dose DMT seem like nothing. Make fun of my user name as much as you like ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

I'm in total agreement I believe I obtained from the same supplier. I consumed roughly 50mgs. and the visuals were amazing super good feeling all around. Only downside was I was a bit uncomfortable for the firs hour after insufflation. Though I was feeling a bit under the weather to begin with. It just seemed that I noticed every discomfort. After that though it was  great. I also IV'ed what I had left It was intense but not so much as 4-ho-det/dmt was. Going to order more soon. How do you think it would be to do with another person?

3 hours after ingestion of 4-ho-met, my sacroiliitis joint pain worsens like tenfold as normal.


I've done 4-ho-met at least 10 times now, and everytime the pain worsens so much. When I take 4-ho-mipt, 4-ho-dipt my pain doesn't worsen, maybe just a little.


I wonder why? According to the literature psilocin should have anti-inflammatory properties.

Weird.  Well, 4-HO-MET isn't psilocin.  I have no idea what's different about it that could cause that.

combining 4-aco-met and 4-ho-mipt was was one of the most visual trips I've ever had aside from high doses of LSD. Granted I polished off 100mgs of each one in about 3 hours by sniffing and IVing. No nausea, or weird bodyload either. Just pure bliss.

Tripped on 35mg orally with a few friends in the woods just about two weeks ago. Comparable to eating about 2.5g of shrooms but without the deep, conflicting thoughts. No nausea. Some back pains and general physical discomfort that I have found to be common amongst RC's. Majority of the effects lasted about four or five hours. Mild visuals toward the comedown after plopping down on a couch. It's a very easy trip all around. 50mg would have been a better time though![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

The first time I did 4-aco-met i took about 60mgs insufflated and it was very visual I was a little ill at the time and felt uncomfortable for a little while during come up almost like amplified all the aches and pains but once I got into it it was awesome. For me like I said in my last post the combo of 4-aco-met/4-ho-mipt is most magical. And depending on dose quite lengthy 6-8hrs or so. unlike say 4-ho-det only seems to last a few hours. Though I should try the oral route and see if it is more or less intense than sniffing. I doubt anything is as intense as IV though, its just over too fast.

I'm extremely comfortable with doses of 40 mg or more with 4-HO-met and 4-aco-dmt and 4 grams of mushrooms. What would be a good dose for this substance? Every reply is useful, thank you for your help

My guess would be that 4-aco and 4-ho met would be similar in potency, with 4-ho being a little stronger. Still, if it's your first time with it, harm reduction would say to start low just incase.

I took about 60mgs the first time i used it but I have an unusually high tolerance to everything. even after long periods of use of most substances. 60 was certainly very visual and not uncomfortable at all. the last two times i did it i combined it with way too much alcohol which i would advise against. I usually have a little alcohol before my tryptamine experience to alleviate come-up anxiety but these times i way over did it. Next time maybe i'll just take a klonopin a couple hours prior or just try dealing with it

This is excellent advice to people who constantly attempt to describe the subjective effects of one drug by comparing it to another. The first time I met Sasha Shulgin, he explained to myself and one of my ex-girlfriend's the folly of getting stuck in this frame of mind. He said that each and every chemical has a unique energy and feeling to it even though it may be almost identical in structure to another one. He compared thinking this way to always comparing one's current lover to past lovers. By doing this, you set yourself up for constant dissatisfaction with what you have instead of fully appreciating and immersing yourself in the moment. 


He was such an extremely wise and enlightened Soul. He will be dearly missed! 


Anyway, to the topic at hand: 4-aco-MET is one of my new favorite drugs. I found 20mg of the fumerate insufflated to be the perfect dose for me. It kicks in about 20 minutes after snorting it, and I'm completely back to baseline exactly 4 1/2 hours later. If I take it at 6 PM, I can easily fall asleep before midnight if I desire. Another reason I prefer 20mg to higher doses is that I can still physically function normally if needed, and others can't tell I'm even on a drug at this dose. One time after taking 60mg, my mother of all people decided to show up unannounced to take my wife and I out to dinner. I was practically catatonic at that point from the overwhelming vibrations that had consumed my body, and along with the disorienting, intense Visuals and Telepathic conversations with the spirit entities that showed up, the day became a complete disaster. I was doing extremely bizarre things in public (though at the time they made perfect sense, lol) that drew an inordinate amount of attention to me and almost got me arrested for public intoxication (my mother talked the pig into just letting her take me home), and my strange behavior and incomprehensible philosophizing centering around alien conspiracies pissed my mom off so bad that she didn't speak to me for over almost 2 years! 


The effects of any given dose of this drug have always been consistent for me, without the unpredictability of other Psychedelics. With my usual dose of 20mg, colors become fantastically brilliant and mesmerizing, music aquires a unique depth that I've never had from any other substance, and I always have a profound sense of Oneness with and Empathy for others. These effects are way more intense for me than even several hundred mg of good MDMA. The music (I usually listen to Beck albums and watch his trippy-ass videos while in Hyperspace from any drug), and especially the musically sweet sound of my wife's voice and the powerful vibration of just her natural, NOT drug-induced Spiritual Potency usually move me to uncontrollable crying for a large part of the Trip, though on 20mg I can almost instantly snap myself back to some semblance of objective reality in an emergency.


 It's an ideal drug for spiritual exploration, and the profound insights received not only still make sense after it wears off, but they stick with you permanently and inspire great changes in your life (this is from my own experience, as well as that of 9 close friends who regularly take this drug). So if you're not in the mood for a possible permanent religious conversion experience, or you're just content with where you're at spiritually right now, you may want to avoid this drug, or just use small doses.

I usually have a little alcohol before my tryptamine experience to alleviate come-up anxiety but these times i way over did it. Next time maybe i'll just take a klonopin a couple hours prior or just try dealing with it

Learning to deal with come-up anxiety taught me a lot about myself and went a long way towards me becoming a lot more comfortable in my own skin and less self-conscious.  Now I rarely get bad come-ups.  But I used to almost every time, it's ruined a number of trips for me because I got stuck in the anxiety.  But that's a part of the trip too, you can't just skim over it.  Well you can, sort of, but it's not a good idea to, IMO.

I saw a picture of a cat that looked just like my cat did while I'd had some 4-AcO-MET.

Dosage question:

I have myself a research sample of 4-aco-met fumarate (1mg allergy tested, no problems) and am having trouble deliberating on a dosage for a medium-strength trip. Myself and four others plan on doing some group research (all with moderate psych experience), and will only have one opportunity to do so in the foreseeable future. As such, we don't have time to titrate up from, say, 15mg over a period of days or weeks.

There appears to be no consensus on dose. All of us are in the 55-70kg range. What do you guys think of starting with 20mg and preparing 5mg boosters as failsafe?

Anybody wanna give me a comparison of 4-AcO-DMT and 4-AcO-MET? I've tried 4-AcO-DMT and would like to try 4-AcO-MET soon but I'd like to know a bit of what I'm getting myself into beforehand.

I'm 5'11" and 140 lbs. My first dose was 13 mgs 4-aco-met. It was in limbo, if you get my drift. At 18 it was enjoyable, but 20-23 was the tits, even 25, but not much higher was tried, nor needed. 


Regarding 4-aco-dmt v 4-aco-met, 4-a-met is much lighter and more visual. 4-a-dmt is more patterned and can get pretty heady, but if you keep the dose around 18-20 mgs, it keeps some more of its enjoyable qualities.

I've had 2 experiences with this substance. I'm 5'6", 115lbs, and female, but I have an average natural tolerance to psychs - I usually dose the same or higher than my larger male friends. 


My first experience was with 20mg of 4-AcO-MET HCl. It was enjoyable and gentle, with light visuals and not much mindfuck. It was pretty stimulating at this dose. It lasted around 3-4 hours. It was a fun experience; however, it was a bit too gentle for my liking.


My second experience was with 32mg of the fumarate salt. The fumarate salt is heavier than the HCl salt and I wanted a stronger experience so I figured this would be a good dose; however it turned out to be too intense and confusing. The come-up was too sudden and anxiety-provoking. I felt sober one minute, and the next minute I was having intense visuals and the setting seemed to suddenly change and become alien and foreign. I would look at my surroundings and become lost in them. I was also experiencing intense synesthesia. The intensity was comparable to a couple hits of DMT. I became paranoid and felt that I had overdosed. I called one of my close friends to come make sure I was okay, but once he arrived I felt even more anxious. My emotions also effected the visuals, and the more anxious I became, the more dull and strange the setting would become. After around 3-4 hours, the trip took a lighter turn and I started to feel better. I was still tripping hard but my visuals became beautiful and colourful, rather than eerie as they were before. They were geometric, bright, and almost DMT-like but still somewhat organic. I still felt a bit anxious but overall I felt a lot better. Mentally I started to return to baseline around 9-10 hours after dosing, but the visuals persisted until I went to sleep, around 13 hours after dosing. Would not repeat this dosage. Overall the trip turned out okay but the come-up was way too much. Also (not sure if related or not) I got a bad headache around 10 hours after dosing and it lasted well into the next day.

I ended up going with 23mg (as did my four friends) of the fumarate salt (so far as I know).

It was diluted in ethyl alcohol and consumed with a bit of tea (didn't taste great, but not horrid), which provided a fast come-up (~10 minutes to a +1.5, 40 minutes till a full on ++/+++). This was a surprisingly psychedelic dose for all of us. Shifting colors and slightly rolling shapes, confusion and pleasant derealization, stimulation, and good vibes (very positive and giggly, but not a deep or entactogenic love). It did wonders for binding our group of friends together, as we'd not spent much time together before, but requires a good degree of trust for those around you during the peak because of the inherent incapacitation of many tryptamines such as 4-AcO-MET. One of my favorite experiences to date! It felt as though I could graze across all of my past philosophies and accept them as pleasant interpretations and realities without becoming engrossed in them (which I do enjoy). To that end, it felt somewhat superficial (intellectually), though not to a debasing degree, as general philosophizing felt valuable and real, it was just difficult to manifest my focus on such a thing. The peak dropped off after about two hours, and coming down over three hours, followed by dissociation and friendly "trippiness" for the rest of the night, making the experience (with a 40 minute come-up) about 5.5 hours (not including the tail). I noticed a slight headache about 8 hours after dosing, but water and sleep took care of that. No body load or grossness today (this experience was yesterday), but I feel a slight serotonergic depletion; not depressed, persay, but a bit down and worn. This may be more from the contrast of such a wonderful experience to a day spent alone in thought.


All in all,

this compound is worth a try for its raw, silly, experiential flavor, though it doesn't have the intellectual/abstractly meaningful edge that some compounds do.

2nd time researching this chemical this past weekend. First time was 4 months ago with no tripping for over 6 months before that. So this was my 2nd trip this year.(2014) Started at 15mg weighed with a .001 scale and added 10mg once the initial come up/stimulation subsided.(About 45 min. between dose/redose) (Initial dose oral/redose insufflated) Was underwhelmed by the OEV's so about 20 min. following the redose i hopped into the shower with all the lights off and towels stuffed under the door so no light was visible. Then I got a very nice light show that I had been looking for. I think I will give it a month and go with 25mg dose/10mg redose to get all I want from this chem. More clear headed than cannabis by itself and little mindfuck. Not very confrontational etc. but still very pleasant. Had a beer and .5mg etizolam on the comedown but endee up staying awake all day. May wait later next time as I was all done by 3pm. Lasted ~4hrs total. This was the fumurate salt btw.

I added about 8 mg of this (for the first time), adding to my 4-HO-MiPT which ran out early when I tried to dose 19 or 21 mg (kinda forgot which). I figured, you can top off some psychedelics with similar compounds. Similarly I have topped off 2C-T-7 with 2C-B when the former ran out. I don't like mixing dissimilar psychedelic all too much, can be less 'aligned' and more chaotic. Sometimes synergetic of course but seems more unpredictable to me.


Anyway I don't recommend combining drugs the very first time you take it as a golden rule (tho I have had the very similar 4-HO-MET plenty of times which is just the non-acetoxy-ester version). I can't say all that much about the effects yet, it was a weird day.

When you are able, please describe the effects! 

I am mainly curious if its different enough from 4-ho-met to be worth chasing it...  I found very little info about this.

I combined it with 4-HO-MiPT, the dose of which was about twice as large (16 mg vs the 8 mg of 4-AcO-MET)... and 4-HO-MiPT often gives me very bizarre / weird / alien effects even for trippiness. 4-HO-MET is much more 'familiar' feeling to me, even if it can be super intricate, creative and complex.

I also tried plain MiPT by the way and found a similar weirdness, or feeling of alienation / non-recognition.


In any case, the contribution of the 4-AcO-MET was very obscured by the effects of the 4-HO-MiPT which is why further descriptions are probably rendered worthless to take anything away from. Other than entertainment of reading maybe.

This compound is definitely worth trying. I first tried it at 22mg to which I was not satisfied, so I dosed another 5mg an hour after the 22mg along with 30mg of MXE. Things started to get interesting after 2 hours of the initial dose. The visuals reminded me somewhat of DMT or 4-aco-DMT, but they didn't seem as sharp and intricate, rather they were pale bleak resemblances of DMT-like visuals. It seemed to only provide a visual aspect to the trip without much depth to it, but this changed when I tried a larger dose...


I tried 4-aco-MET last night at around 29-30mg followed by 80-100mg of MXE over the course of 3 hours. When hitting nitrous I was having very beautiful CEVs that did not remind me of anything else I have ever seen. This dose was much more visually prominent than the 22mg dose. I experienced a very introspective state in which I was very into myself. It kept making me think of my family, death, my future career, what I was doing with my life, and made me motivated to take care of my body more. I felt very refreshed after getting some sleep and was ready to take on the day and try to be as productive as possible. Overall, I really like this chemical, but it doesn't seem to put me where I want to be unless I add dissociatives to the mix. Perhaps future trials I will aim for 35-40mg doses. Also, I want to note that there are relatively few side effects with this chemical. It is very clean feeling with little to no bodyload. I did feel a bit nauseous in the beginning after an hour of dosing, but this could've been due to my stomach contents from a burrito I ate hours prior. 


Next I will be dosing 10mg of 4-aco-MET (it's all I have left) with 20mg of 4-aco-DMT. I'm wondering if it will resemble essentially taking 30mg of one or the other, or if it'll be weaker than taking a 30mg dose of 4-sub trypts. 4-aco-MET seems to be a little less potent/strong than 4-aco-DMT for me.

Well I just found out that my source is getting this one...


I have heard reports that its superior to 4-HO-MET?


I have the option to either get more 4-HO-MET or get 4-AcO-MET and a few other things. It sounds like people find 4-AcO-MET to be even more visual than 4-HO-MET? Comparisons with LSD style visuals as opposed to mushroom visuals?


Can someone elaborate?


I'm also going to be picking up 4-HO-MiPT as well which I know for a fact has visuals that are very neon in nature and its less serious than mushrooms are.


I just need to decide if I want the hydroxy or acetate ester for this new order. From what I've been reading, it looks like the acetate ester is more up my alley than the hydroxy but I'll tell you that I love the 4-subs. The only one I can't stand is 4-AcO-DMT (it gives me stupid amounts of anxiety every time I do it). I rate 4-HO-MET as my favorite because of its visuals, 4-AcO-MiPT is probably second, 4-HO-MiPT third, 4-HO-DiPT fourth, and 4-AcO-DMT is so last that I'd rather do DPT which REALLY causes tachycardia than that one.

4-AcO-DET has physical side effects that are odd... its like someone is opening and shutting the blinds but the blinds are your body... don't pass 30mg, shouldn't be an issue.


Otherwise... combine DET with mushrooms... and it about fits... your auditory... not so pleasant... but your visual... entertaining. I don't know, it was so long ago. I just remember shivering like I was in -20F when it was 70F...

For me personally... I couldn't stand 4-AcO-DMT. I tried two batches, it wasn't a batch issue... was a chemical issue... very anxious chemical... extra benzos didn't really help... I only ever really got into it where I could let go once and that was AMT and 4-AcO-DMT... but even then I still had the anxiety while I was on the verge of ego death... then in ego death... its very hard to explain... I remember I was playing with the folds  of reality with a friend... and I was on the verge of a panic attack the whole time so I took an extra 1mg of Klonopin and that still wasn't enough to really smooth it out... 


But I don't get along with mushrooms either. I had a bag of penis envy. Those were the only shrooms I could do without feeling like I just got poisoned. They were indeed very special because I couldn't stand shrooms because of the anxiety they provoked but man did I love those penis envy.... Was pissed when I was made to flush them I'll tell you that. Still actually makes me want to blow up now lol. And I'm tripping quite happily on 4-HO-MET and MXE... but damn.... Only mushrooms ever got along with me and he made me flush them......


4-AcO-DET vs 4-AcO-DMT... I'm going to take the objective stance and say that from what I've observed, I'm just fuckin weird and everyone loves 4-AcO-DMT but I've never heard any reports of the DET shivers or the like with it. Even with the anxiety that 4-AcO-DMT caused... it was still physically better than 4-AcO-DET by a lot... I actually hated that chem so much I try to forget that I've taken it... I don't deny taking 4-AcO-DMT though, it just gave me uncomfortable anxiety while 4-AcO-DET actually felt really toxic...

Yeah DET and DiPT were both really short although I thoroughly enjoyed DiPT. DET is just the devil.

Stuff sounds amazing. Getting my own from a freshly made batch in about two weeks. Sounds like the tryptamine I've been waiting for. 


Why do people snort MXE though? I thought this RoA is wasteful? The reason I ask is because I've been doing it orally (dump on tongue and then lick the weigh plate clean) and washing it down with water... So I guess it's a combo sub/oral but I remember when I first got the first batch back in 11 I was snorting it and it took a LOT to get where I wanted. Huge lines.

Yeah, it's mainly a snorting fetish for some people. People even prefer to rail the x-FA's which are notorious for their causticity and tendency to cause nosebleeds, while having less absorption than other ROA's. Same with mephedrone, which ime was not pleasant nor the least bit superior to oral or rectal. I notice alot of these snorters are from the UK (of course not all), and alot of these folks will stick anything up their nose, whether beneficial or not. After experimenting with alternative ROA's, I would also agree snorting MXE is a waste. The effects aren't even the same, far more stimulated, far less intoxicating.

^I honestly think it's subjective. I admittedly have a nasal fetish but have tried oral dosing over ten different times and usually found it somewhat underwhelming. With my current batch/tolerance I sniff 100mgs to get to the promised land while it takes about 150mgs when used orally to get the same effects. After my month long break is up I am going to trying eating my first dose to see if anything has changed. /ends off topic post

I've read posts from some people who seem to not respond to it as well orally.  For me it comes on a bit in 5-10 minutes orally, and reaches a peak by 45 minutes, but I've heard reports of people having it take 2+ hours to start coming on.  But I do think that in most cases people just like to snort drugs.  To me it's a total waste, MXE seems to much more fully affect the mind-body machine orally, it really gets in there smoothly and completely.  I find when I snort it, or worse, smoke it, it never really seems like it gets all the way there, it feels different in an inferior way.

When I was heavily experimenting in 2006-2008, I got to a point where I often just wouldn't get anything unique from substances anymore most of the time.  I don't know how often you're taking psychedelics/serotonergics, but long-term tolerance begins to form when you habitually don't give yourself enough time to return to normal between trips.  I don't believe I will ever lose it completely but I get full effects from psychedelics again, I just require higher dosages than I used to.  Maybe that's not your case and you space things out well, but I thought I'd say it anyway.  When you trip a lot you start to need higher and higher dosages and the trips become much less full-on (in general, I still had some really intense ones sometimes during that period of time).

My tryptamine tolerance went to 0, maybe even -1 or -2 during my 4 year break from them... 4-HO-MET wrecks me... I'm hoping 4-AcO-MET is a little bit smoother...

I have some of this and 4-aco-dmt available to try today. I think I'm going to go with the -met since some of mg friends are looking for a lighter trip. My only mushroom trip was 4.5 g dried and it was extremely positive from start to finish. So I am pretty positive I can handle this and thus I am more worried about under dosing than going to high with this one. What dosage range would compare to 3.5-4.5 g cubensis in intensity alone? I have not tripped in ~3 weeks so my tolerance should be close to baseline though I guess it could be noted in the month prior I was tripping heavily and often off of 2c-b. I guess re-dosing could be a possibility, but the anecdote in this thread on it are pretty sparse. Any input would be appreciated.


Update: took 26 mg and wow. Blew me out of the water.

i found this chem to be exceptionally pleasant at 34mg, at this dose i had wonderful neon 3d visuals but i was still able to fully communicate with people who weren't tripping without them knowing i was tripping. a great chemical for when you want to be high without the mindfuck

Thought I'd post a trip report here since this still seems to be a less popular chem.


Over the summer I tried this substance with my girlfriend (A) and her close friend (B) at the beach. I measured out doses on a milligram scale ahead of time and loaded them into gelcaps to take with us. I gave myself 24mg (a standard dose), A got 34mg because she's an extreme hardhead, and B got 28mg because she told me she could take it. We didn't factor in the potential awkwardness of taking substantial doses in public but it turned out ok in the end.


At 1:30pm the weather was absolutely perfect and the beach not too crowded. We parked the car near the beach and dropped before walking over and setting up, which ended up being a mistake because the comeup was faster than expected -- I'd say around 20-30 minutes until first alerts. We hadn't eaten anything since breakfast at 10:30am so our stomachs were mostly empty. A had some GI issues (as is usual for her with tryptamines) but cleared them up in a nearby hotel bathroom. B and I were fine after taking a little preemptive Alka-Seltzer. The trip was nausea-free for all of us after that.


B is the smallest of us and she was up first, though A and I weren't far behind. I would describe the overall headspace as languid, stoning, sensual without being overly erotic, and a distinct undercurrent of absurdity - everything seemed hilarious. Sound took on an interesting character - sustained noises like insects, the crash of the waves, and helicopters seemed to be amplified while speech seemed muted. I think it had something to do with attention creating a kind of "tunnel hearing" where particular sounds become immersive while others drop out. Visuals were both gorgeous and weird. Colors were amplified to the point of seeing color "halos" surrounding (for example) swimsuits. A's skin is very fair and when we were in the water I could see the ocean reflected on her body. Facial details and peoples' bodies generally were distorted and wavy/wobbly - we couldn't look directly at each other without laughing. If anyone's ever seen a painting by El Greco that's the closest image I can compare it to. Movement slowed down. Perspective was also distorted, to the point where distant objects seemed to exist on the same plane as nearer ones if you focused on them. I've taken 4-HO-MET, and while feeling somewhat less "cinematic," this chemical was similarly immersive, like being enveloped by the objects of your senses. Being in the water felt incredible. The body high was pleasant in general, but again attention played a major role - if you weren't concentrating on your body you'd almost forget it was there. The drug was lightly dissociative in that way - I remember A saying once, "I can't tell the difference between my body and not my body." Which was good, because one of the downsides to the experience had to do with the setting - when your senses are heightened, having wet sand stick to your skin under the hot sun quickly becomes intolerable. Nothing scary with the exception of a trio of military helicopters that kept buzzing the shoreline (a base is nearby).


One of the most interesting things about this substance was how it slowed down time. For me, 4-HO-MET had a very different effect, that of slipping in and out of partial consciousness, with no idea how much time had passed. On 4-AcO-MET, it just felt like time was eternal. However, I would say I experienced the same lapses in short-term memory. We were awful at reapplying sunscreen for that reason and got badly sunburned. Funny at the time but pretty miserable for the next few days.


When we were almost all the way down (around sunset - 6pm) we foolishly smoked a joint, which extended the trip another 3 hours. I say foolishly because by this time we were starving, leading us to take the stupid risk of driving into town for dinner. Anyway, we survived. 


Overall I would describe the experience as ridiculously fun. I would not call it very insightful or deep. A & B compared it to a "hot dumb girl" and I have to agree -- not that there's anything wrong with that ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). Downsides were only 1) that B took a bit too much (28mg and she's maybe 5'5 and 115lbs) and was borderline uncomfortable during the peak 2) we should have prepared better for the beach and 3) it went on a little too long, though that's because we smoked during the comedown. I'm sure I'll do it again & I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a gentle, lighthearted trip with minimal mindfuck (even less than its 4-HO ester). We were all tripping pretty hard but didn't have a problem keeping it together in public. Next to 4-HO-MET it's the most purely enjoyable RC I've tried and definitley among the most visually exciting (my experience also includes 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 2C-B and 2C-D).

i've only tried each once. Aside from the subtler aesthetic differences I listed above, I'd say they break down along standard 4HO vs 4AcO lines -- 4HO has a sharper comeup, feels clearer-headed (as long as your dose isn't too intense) and more "stimmy," shorter duration. The 4AcO has a more gradual comeup (some say they find 4AcOs more nauseating but I felt almost zero bodyload on 4Aco-MET) and the headspace is more stoning, while still being very social. Part of my 4HO-MET trip was "bad" -- thought loops, anxiety, paranoia, etc. -- but I was able to ride it out and I don't think that's a common reaction. I feel like it's probably near impossible to get a bad trip on 4AcO-MET unless you just take way too much.

Got here today... looks incredible... so tempted... and the new batch of MXE they sent me... colors @ 20mg like its supposed to do... Glad I didn't just dump 80mg in a glass and add water and go. This shit is good.


So their brand new fresh 4-AcO-MET has to be something else.


Interesting comment you made about 4-AcO-MET buttannibal69 - just about everyone says its the closest you'll get to DMT without DMT in visual context. Guess we'll find out when I dive into 20mg... nice to know its not stimulating though. The only 4-sub that ever has been was 4-HO-MiPT. Something about that chem likes to pump the heart and work the kidneys... but I just got enough to last a damn lifetime so I'll try it soon.

Wait MagickalKat, 4-Aco-MET being the closest to DMT in visuals...? IME that is very, very far off. I'd actually say 4-ho-mipt or unsurprisingly 4-aco-dmt are the closest.

I had a really weird experience when I IMed 4-aco-met (only 5mg) after taking a "small handful" of vitamin D3 pills the night before and a couple hours before the trip.  Felt like the times I mixed piracetam with DMT... baaad.  Felt like a bunch of cables got unplugged and plugged into the wrong slots in my brain.  Sensory overload.  Won't be mixing D3 with trips anymore ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

4-HO-MET was close enough... We are not talking about smoked DMT... oral. MAOI. *huasca. But I'll tell you I've smoked DMT on top of a 2C-T-2 trip and the visuals I've had from too much 4-HO-MET EASILY rivaled the visuals but not the visions. There is a distinction that must be made.


DMT once you break through causes visions... but the visuals when you come out of the visions are impressive but nothing like 4-HO-MET can bring on. I think that is the point that was being made.


We can't smoke 4-HO-MET. Take DMT orally with an MAOI and you're in the same land as mescaline really... which is to say, amazing. But 4-HO-MET can rival pre-breakthrough visuals of DMT. Easily. So can 5-MeO-AMT and so can 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7.


We're talking smoked versus oral... You can't (well I suppose it may be possible with the base but these are fumarate salts) smoke these chems...


The closest to DMT in visuals for me? 4th plateau DXM... Actually my DXM experiences have far surpassed DMT multiple times in their intensity because DXM actually warps your concept of what your body is... DMT destroys the ego but there is still a body. DXM can make it feel like your body is a pretzel while at the same time destroying your ego. There's a reason dissociatives have a following... Close your eyes on a high dose dissociative and be amazed... Its incredible the dimensions they create. DMT and other tryptamine and phenethylamine psychedelics tend to be rather weak in comparison with visuals unless you break through on DMT and have effectively entered a new dimension. I've smoked DMT. I hope to smoke it again some day. But the closest you're going to get to ayahuasca from the tryptamines? The 4-subs. So far 4-HO-MET has my vote as best candidate. Since I just did 50mg of this new batch of MXE... I really shouldn't mess with the MET tonight. But soon.


And, at least for me, dissociatives cause visions. Insane visions... Its why I love to push the envelope so hard with MXE. It has euphoria guaranteed with those visions while DXM is very cold... its really all on you to make it into something pleasant.

40mg is way too high for a first dose, man. Start with 20, wait an hour and a half to two hours, see how you're feeling. If you want to go higher, take 10mg more. Wait another hour, if you want to go higher, take 10mg more. So on and so forth. It isn't like psychedelics where once you've passed the one or two hour mark you're screwed for redosing. The effects will build and build, so give it time.


By dosing too high too quickly, no less for your dissociative experience, you could easily end up in mass confusion territory instead of beautiful peaceful profound thoughts territory ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Yeah so.......... No idea how much..... 


Because it was to see if 400mg flubromazepam would kill me... I only woke up because of the gunshots in the alley. 


What a way start a trip. +++ for what it's worth.


Have to edit to say........... Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow


Okay. Amazingly. I remember. I lost the stupid plate for my scale so I took two scoops I'd say I'm at 30mg (high estimate)  and this is definitely my favorite. I can't say anything about the tachycardia given my stupid shit earlier...... 


Cevs are out of this world. Great stuff

This compound exceeded my expectations greatly.  The frequency of the source vibration was approaching DMT territory. The visuals were astounding, and music enhancement was sublime, and I'm lucky I had some really perfect groovy melty psychedelic music mixsets streaming from my soundcloud during the peak. I was entranced by the fidelity and vibrance of the fields of energy in the air I saw, clear as day OEVs, I'm almost convinced I was seeing actual electromagnetic wave interference patterns, and that this chemical turned off the filters that normally prevents us from perceiving them. For the majority of the time I laid in bed cozy'd up with my kitty cat who also got a kick out of the energy. He was grooving with it like 'yeah this is some stuff!!!'-  a similar reaction that he had when I was on DPT, as if he could pick up on everything that was happening. We bonded our spirits in a most sacred fashion. All in all it was something to write home about. Not much of a body load considering the strength of the experience. consumed between 20-30 mg, and it was combined with a generous portion of MXE. I basically see MXE as my 'space suit' for psychedelics. Keeps me safe and comfortable while allowing me to travel further into the deep than I would be able to otherwise.

I've had somewhere around 10 experiences with 4acomet from 12-36 mg and honestly i don't know if I'll do it again. It's a good light-hearted trip, but seems pointless to me for lack of a better word. It doesn't seem to offer much in the way of introspection and for pure recreation there's stuff like al-lad and 2cb that I enjoy much,  much more.


I would like to try 4-ho-met  as I've heard it is better than its counterpart.

Visuals are the most overrated part of the psychedelic experience imo...


For a recreational psych I think euphoria and music enhancement and clear headedness are important to me. Tryptamines in general don't seem all too recreational.

I took a ride on 4-ho-met at 22 mgs yesterday and it was by FAR the most visual thing I've taken. I'llhaveto remind myself about 4-aco-met, but IIRC, the come up was vastly smoother than on its -ho- counterpart. If your d desire is mental effects, go -aco-, visual -ho-. The aco lasts longer too, maybe an hour more.  HO seemed to drop off very abruptly.

If HO is more visual than ACO I can't even imagine. ACO was the most visual trip I've had short of DMT and DPT.

Haha, yeah, and this time, blast off was before sunrise and wandering through a dark house, playing  with a black lab puppy was almost overwhelming. Visuals akin to CEVs with eyes open, quite kaleidoscopic. (This is the HO, BTW). My order of al lad came in the next day, so now I'm torn: do I re-research this (4-aco-met), or go with al lad, for my next headventure.

It's all going to be very subjective. For me 4-AcO-MET is FAR more visual than the same dose of 4-HO-MET, like no comparison at all. That's not to say that 4-HO-MET isn't extremely visual, comparable only DMT for me as has been said, but for me 4-AcO-MET is basically the same but more plus actual hyperspace visions plus a cosmic mindset. 4-HO-MET seems like a toy by comparison.

By the way, don't be so sure. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I've vaporized the fumarate salts of 4-AcO-MET and 4-AcO-DET and they were both beautiful. I'm not sure if 4-HO-MET would hold up as well as 4-AcO-MET under the flame but I'd definitely be willing to experiment with it. I've only vaporized 4-AcO-MET once so far and didn't quite reach the dose I was hoping for, but rather than taking more I just tried meditating with it and putting on some of those flashing LED glasses for putting yourself in trances, and that turned it into one of the most incredibly visual and euphoric things I have yet experienced. The visuals were quick like smoking DMT, but the way they unfolded was more like high dose LSD with the realism and hedonism pumped up a few orders of magnitude (though it's less like crazy or raw, more real). There was a point where I was feeling like seven or eight bodies at once and that allowed to me experience several different aspects of a person at once as my identity was constantly shifting from one to the next out of control.... Can't wait to get there from just the dose alone. 4-AcO-DET actually produced the completely autonomous entities for me when vaporized. I bet 4-AcO-MET can get there too if it wants to. :D

Recently picked up a gram of this along with some 4-HO-MET and a restock of 4-HO-MiPT. I've only trialed the metocin thus far, which was underwhelming in that I got virtually no visuals off 20mg plus a 10mg booster. I wonder if this hard-headedness will transfer over to the aco ester. 

I most likely won't get to metacetin until a couple weeks after bicycle day, but I'm hoping it hits me harder than metocin when I do get to it! Reports seem to vary in this thread over whether it's more or less potent than 4-HO-MET.

You certainly can't necessarily conclude impure chemical from having a weak experience. A dose of the same batch on which one person is comfortable can blow somebody else out of the water, beyond the expected differences caused by body weight and such. 

People can differ in the way they metabolise a chemical, for instance through the presence or absence of particular enzymes, leading to higher or lower levels of actives reaching the brain.

Having not tripped in around a month and some positive things in my life happening I wanted to. 4acomet is the only thing I had so I gave it another shot in a new setting. I was very surprised how strong 23 mg was and the new setting gave me a totally different, better feel for this stuff. Surprisingly not very visual for me, but the mental and emotional trip was very intense, especially after I started smoking cannabis. My friend took 23 mg as well and he reported very strong visuals. This stuff can definitely play tricks on your mind, especially with weed in the mix. I will probably use this again at 30-40 mg with n2o and leave the weed out.

Glad I was finally able to have a great Time on this though. 


Has anyone tried MET that could compare the 2?

I gave my dad 32mg of this a few months ago & he said it was the strongest trip he's ever had, visually & physically, which surprised me because he used to eat a lot of LSD in his youth (didn't trip for over a decade until a little over a year ago though & rarely does now)! Doesn't surprise me that he was able to mentally "keep it together" much better than he did oftentimes back in his lysergic days, I've always found 4-AcO-MET very easy to control. It's color scheme & elements of the body buzz also kind of remind me of LSD. The headspace is pretty clear & functional, but still gets pretty deep, every time I've done it I've become very analytical & figured things out quite well.

My sister and I took 22mg MET last night and spent most of the trip watching videos of our infancy/toddler years our parents recorded with shitty 90s camcorders. That was something else..


Also came to a lof of realizations about my existence in the universe and how to balance the no self with personal development, which I've been pondering for a few months now. I love it when I actually remember my trip revelations the next day!:D

i find the 4-Aco to be less stimulating then 4-ho-met. Slowed down and a little deeper. prefer it to 4-ho-met but 4-ho-met is fast and in your face. maybe a littlte more visual but i dont really think so...

Are there any updates as to the stability of this chem? Is it as prone to breaking down as 4-aco-dmt?


I'm wondering if making a solution would be better for long term storage as well.

60 mg dxm + 17 mg 4-aco-met. The dxm completely changed the character of the metacetin so I guess there is some NMDA antagonism going on even with threshold dxm doses. The visuals were very different as walls were bending and the ground was sloping and warping. Much less anxiety than normal.

Tried 40mg on an empty stomach with no tolerance, hoping for a very strong trip. Came up after 30 mins and it wasn't very intense so I suspect the product was degraded, despite being sold alongside partially degraded 4-aco-met as the non-degraded version. I'd say it was comparable to 25mg of 4-aco-dmt.


Music enhancement was superb, CEVs nonexistent, but OEVs were very bright with hue shifting, twisting, warping and breathing. Easy concept visualization, and quite strong stoning effect but no confusion. Felt very relaxed and calm.

Oral actually has better bioavailability IME. Insufflation seems a tad weaker with more side effects and a greatly reduced duration. Just my gf and my opinion though. Never did more than 40mg-45mg which was never much different than 30mg just more side effects. Best at 20mg-30mg.

Did 20-22mg sublingual for five minutes then swallowed with the girl I'm talking to this past Saturday. It's such an amazing chemical. So euphoric and giggly and positive. I haven't laughed like that in ages, maybe in over a year. OEVs were not as strong as I'd hoped, mental effects a little less than I wanted also, but damn did I feel great.


Pro-tip: mix this with MXE and it's even more god-tier. Lower doses of each at a show feels so similar to MDMA.

I have had about 100mg of 4-aco-met for about 3 months now untouched and i would like to try it soon but as i have never once ingested a psychedelic of any sorts (not not lsd or even shrooms) im a little nervous. What would be a good dose for a 220lb 6'1" male with no tolerance. Also I have 300mg of clonazolam on hand. If I ended up having a bad trip or other misc problems too much to handle would that be of use?

Agreed mixing with MXE is a near-perfect experience, in lower doses it feels more like a psychedelic MDMA roll, in high doses it is like a DMT trip without completely breaking through, like at the 'veil' for hours.

I really feel it would be next to impossible to have a bad trip on this substance....it's the easiest psych I've ever done regarding "head games"


Most people would prolly recommend 20mg as a good starting dose.....I would say 25mg is right

My first experiment with this was 13 mgs. I could *almost* feel it. 17 mgs was a nice go, still underwhelmed, but was having a nice enough time. 20-22 mgs works fairly well for me. This Chem definitely is softer on the edges, oh and my specs are 5'11" @ 145 lbs with two bricks and a lead parka. Although, isn't general consensus moving toward brain chemistry having more of a relevant effect than body properties?

I wouldn't count either out. Everyone I've seen reacts to psychedelics quite differently, but that hasn't changed the fact that nine out of ten that I've observed the smaller, skinnier people still trip on average considerably harder than the larger, heavier set people at the same doses.

Not that I'm doubting that this combination rocks, but I'm wondering, do you guys not get effects resembling MDMA and DMT already from 4-AcO-MET just on its own? That's pretty much like its major appeal to me, if I wasn't at the veil I wouldn't think I dosed high enough!

It has been a while since I have had 4-ho-met (I once went through over a gram of it by myself when it was all I could get), but I have recently had a number of experiences with this compound 4-aco-met. 4-aco-met I personally find somewhat inferior to the 4-ho counterpart. It is still a great chemical and pretty useful in situations such as concerts where an extremely clear mindset is desirable. In terms of the PURE 4-sub tryptamines I have experienced (not counting mushrooms), the mindfuck level goes from most to least:4-ho-dmt>4-aco-dmt>4-ho-mipt(though it can be VERY intense)>>>4-aco-met>4-ho-met. The first two are difficult to place, I have had much more experience with 4-aco-dmt than 4-ho-dmt and I think 4-ho-dmt might edge it out just a bit. 


 I find the euphoria from 4-aco-met to be somewhat less than the 4-ho. 4-aco-met is also significantly less stimulating than 4-ho-met, however both are stimulating in comparison to 4-aco-dmt. Both are extremely light and easy (least mindfuck of any psychedelic I have had, other than 5-meo-dalt, which was a waste of time). I don't consider either one to be ideal for a deep trip, and honestly find both somewhat boring. However, my ideal dose of 4-ho-met was quite high, as in 40mg or more, and at that point, the euphoria and feelings of love were sometimes absolutely overwhelming and life-affirming (my mind remained CRYSTAL clear). Visuals are also less present with 4-aco-met, though they can be impressive at higher doses. The 4-aco counterpart also has great clarity, though somewhat less so. 


MXE goes great with either one, though if the MXE dose is above 60mg, it really takes over. A hole dose of MXE (120mg) with 50mg of 4-ho-met (with cannabis) was absolutely incredible and incapacitating, several hours of OBE and trance states. Overwhelming euphoria, nothing else I have ever experienced has come close. Not even nitrous, DMT and MXE together matched that. My brain felt like it was going to explode ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Has anybody took a fairly high dose of 4acomet and did not have any cevs, quite odd for me too say, most every psychedelic for me has cevs and its my most enjoyable part, this substance had zero cevs, even with a dose of 50mgs but it did have rather intense oevs visuals and a very enjoyable strong body high that for me was the best part

I love this material. It provides a cool, clean, childlike happiness and the most extravagant visual display of just about any material I've ever worked with. While no amount of LSD has ever proven to be that visual, this material is really stunning. Above is a link to a trip report from my first experience. Subsequent ones have been just as good, and 30mg has turned out to be the sweet spot for me, although lower levels are nice, as well. I do have a friend that experiences long-lasting irritability and depression from this material, although a light dose of a different 4-subbed tryptamine (like 4-HO-Mipt) afterwards terminates the negative effects immediately. I have found that, like psilocybin, the 4-AcO-MET trip can be bi-phasic--upbeat for the first few hours, down in the dumps for the last few hours. Again, a light dose of a different 5-HT2a agonist terminates this negativity immediately. Incidentally, I've also noticed that the persistent afterglow that I get from mescaline and MAL will also be abruptly terminated as soon as another 5-HT2a agonist is ingested. It seems worth further investigation...

So it had been a couple of months since I dosed this substance, so I measured out 40mg and down the hatch.


For me the comeup on a high dose is very much rough, so I decided to hop in a hot shower (I've got to get some magnesium chloride).


And WHAM, just almost like smoking a rip of deemsters I was thrust into a world of brightly colored jewels, and oh yes there were elves and it was like being in a circus ( this was in a brightly lit room with me eyes closed under running water)


Wow....but I'm wanting music and darkness, so I hop out of the shower  after a few minutes of circus show closed eye visuals.


To the couch and stereo.....very weird thing here.....visuals are almost gone ! Like that....shit was unreal elves jeweled circus to almost no visuals in a matter of 10 minutes.....I don't understand. I beleive I have just gotten so used to this material that the trip is just somehow not as intense as it was when I first started using it......it's like I'm burnt out on sub4 trypts


I need some 2C-anything in my life;-) or some al/eth lad.....

I tried 45mg of 4-Aco-met yeaterday. It was nice. I'm at the beach and took it around 11am. It was very beautiful. Clouds were like tiny fractals and crystals. Colors were so bright. If I took my sun glasses off, I felt blinded. The water was also 10 different shades of blue, the grass was so many different shades of brilliant green. Everything was very colorful. I didn't feel to stimulated. I felt pretty good 


The mental aspect of the trip was not very deep. And that was ok with me, since I am on vacation with family. I also took 2 (100μg) tabs of AL-LAD around 1045. 


Overall it was a fun trip. I seemed to be talking more than normal, and laughing. I was having fun. I was very functional and no one thought I was acting different.

Finally got round to testing this stuff. 30mg ingested in water; tolerance was low, but I did trip on lsd one week ago.


As usual with the 4 subs, alerts were felt quickly; within 30 minutes visuals were sparking into life, patterns gently easing across the carpet.


Found it very easy to get lost in thoughts. I started by listening to Melody AM by Royksopp, always a favourite on a charging come up and allowed myself to drift away. Lots of thoughts about politics dominating at the moment following the UK'S vote to leave the EU in June. 4-aco-met, like miprocin, seems to allow for concise thinking. I was against leaving and still am, but need to look at how to make this clusterfuck of a situation work.


After about 2 hours I vape some weed. This kicked off a second, much more intense phase. I had a massively intense ride on lsd and ald52 last week, so I was happy to push it further and vape some more. The next 3 hours were like a white knuckle ride with intense visuals and deep introspection. Massively enjoyable and therapeutic. 


As things wore down a little, I drank a cup of tea and lined up about 50mg of ketamine.  This brought me right back up to the peak with some incredibly intense visuals almost on a level with the 300ug lsd + 375ug ald52 trip from the week before. I say almost, the detail wasn't there, but stuff was certainly flying.


To compare with metocin, I think that this stuff is more visual, albeit in a different way. Metocin is all about playing with light; focusing on something seems to create an aura around it. Aco-met seems keener to get things moving. I think that mixing with metocin may produce interesting results. 


All in all a very interesting substance.

Does anyone know the shelf life of 4-subbed-trypts, particularly this one ?

I have some stored for about a year, and I'm not sure if activity has been lost. 


Anyone here has an old metacetin batch stashed and can comment on stability?

4-substituted tryptamines generally have short shelf lives compared to a lot of other chemicals. But if stored correctly I'd say 1-2 years at least. However I have received batches that had degraded to about half its normal potency, the vendor didn't specify the storage conditions for that perticular batch but I'm pretty sure it was probably double vacuum sealed & put in the freezer. So 4-AcO-MET seems to be rather unstable.

I've had some for about a year in my freezer, vial, bagged, dessicant etc.. It was supposedly degraded and on sale when I bought it. Kind of a tannish color. Color hasn't changed, still as potent for me after a year.

Some of my 4-subs I've had for close to 4 years, I've never noticed degradation. Stored in air tight glass jars with rubber seals, duct taped to block light and dri-rite as it was available at the lab i worked at so why not? Stored in the basement at room temp.

Mine are stored in sealed bags inside another bag with dessicant inside the freezer. No loss of potency or change in colour and consistency whatsoever after several months.

Maybe when it gets to years I may notice some, but I do think that as long as you are careful then there is nothing to fear.

A while ago I had planned to take some of this combined with 3-MeO-PCP at a rave, but ended up deciding against it when I arrived there; partly because the place was too packed and warm and didn't feel like an ideal place to trip, so I just took the PCP- 


After that I forgot I had the measured doses in my wallet and accidental carried it around for a couple of days. 


So with the fragile reputation this compound has, I was assuming it would be almost inactive by now. But this tuesday I went to see a band I really like and though "Fuck it, I'll take this putatively degraded metacetin and if I trip it will be cool, and if nothing happens it'll be fun too"


Turns out it was still active ! I didn't trip hard but it was a low dose (14 mg) ... Maybe it was a little bit less potent than what I expected, but marginally so. 


So ... I won't further worry about the remaining of my batch, which is in proper storage conditions. Looks like this is not as unstable as I thought.

No, honestly these days the salts they form of tryptamines are all much more stable than the HCl or freebase versions that they all were back in the day.  They figured out that acetates, fumarates and succinates (depending on the tryptamine) are much less prone to degradation.  I remember receiving some 4-HO-DiPT freebase back in the day, and it turned into a black sticky goo in a matter of like a month.  The HCl salts also seem rather unstable as far as the tryptamines go.

This summer I had some 4-aco-met and it was very white. I recently ordered some more and it is light brown. The consistency is also a little different. 


Has anyone else ever received any of this product and it was very light brown?

Received approximately 1g of 4-aco-met earlier this week. First night I tried approximately 10mg to test (don't have an mg scale, used a bic pen cap). Had a nice time, played some video games, read a bit, and fell asleep at around 4 am (started at 10pm). The next night, knowing I had a tolerance but wanting to try again since I enjoyed it so much, I took 50mg, Had no visuals, but a nice headspace. Drove to a store to pickup some DXM. Came back home, took a 200mg of dex, around 100mg of aco. In around 2 hours I was feeling quite well, I ended up shit posting on 4chan about how Alexander Shulgin was an autistic N**ga and I deeply respected his work. Fell asleep for a few hours, woke up and then got real weird, took around 100mg more dex and polished off another 400 mg of 4-aco-met, along with a shot or 2 of vodka. Tripped a few balls on my bed while watching Lost in bed, then fell asleep after 2 episodes. Woke up 3 hours later. During that time I also sent a text or 2 to some good friends and had some choice words for them. Still alive and feeling well, would not repeat: 8/10.

Yes quite, it was from a very reputable supplier. I have ordered some more. This is quality stuff, seems to have a similar toxicity profile as LSD (very little if not none).

**ETA: Do not do what I did and try the substances if this happens to you.** **It was stupid and irresponsible by me and I'm happy to be ok.** I ordered 10 g (was minimum you could order) from a Chinese chem-company  a few weeks ago, recieved it this week. Thing is it's all supposed to  be 4-aco-met but each bag looks different in color/shape. One is purple  crystal, another white crystal, the rest tan/brownish. I saw in this thread that some others had been tan/brown? Ordered a marquis  but I couldn't help myself and tried a bit from one of the bags. Did  not get any visuals. Feels like , I  get sweaty hands, had to use the toilet, slight but tolerable uneasy  body load. I did not take as much as I did with the 4-aco-met I bought from a  national seller, when I also redosed and had a nice trip on only a little.  Thing is that the aco-met which I got from the national seller was pure  white and showed positive in urine for 4-ho-met in GC/MS, but maybe  that's natural since 4-aco-met is a prodrug to ho-met? I am not a  chemist, obviously xD Did contant the chem-company but it's nighttime in  China atm so can't get a response.


Here are the different bags (I do not expect you to guess about what it is, I am just showing them for interest):

I would bet that your provider sent you another client's order by mistake. Be very careful because you cannot know what these substances are, and some RCs can be dangerous in sub-milligram doses.

I would not try anything without testing in a lab first.

Thank you Mondeva. You are right. I was supposed to get white powder. I was too eager and shouldn't have tried it, foolish druggie as I am. Going to be interesting to see what the marquis says. Glad I only took a little and only from one.

Color or appearance don't indicate anything. (FWIW all the 4-AcO-MET I've ever had was tan/brown and sand-like)


Looks like indeed like your order was mixed up because this looks like a bunch of different substances.

Have you tried asking the supplier what each number stands for? They probably use those when shipping out orders.

It's probably fine but yeah, best to test it.  The color can vary, even a miniscule amount of unreacted precursor or other impurity can cause a color change, but is nothing to worry about.  I've had tan and pure white batches of many tryptamines.

I did get a reponse from the manufacture and it was #1 4-aco-met

#2 ethylhexedrone

#3 is BK-EBDP

#17 4cmc

#28  MMBC

#64 FUB-AMB

#72 MDPV

#73 5F-ADB

So they had simply sent some extra 1g samples with my 10 aco. I will still test it with marquis though. Going to get rid of most the samples. Not anything I'm interested in.

No worries. Next time you maybe could consider filling in the "... "and say something useful (like what can actually be used instead) when posting imo, instead of being snarky.

I'm not being snarky, it's just that to my knowledge there isn't a reagent test that can help you differentiate between different tryptamines. The Ehrlich will react to (some) indoles, but that's about it. The marquis is pretty much useless in this case.

Hi was the GC MS test you took specifically looking for 4 sub tryptamines do you know if 4 aco met would show up on any normal confirmatory GC MS At a lab in Canada?? Also do you know if most RCs show on these types of tests or do they have to be specifically looked for?

The other night I decided to have a little adventure and took a combo of 18mg of 4-AcO-MET following with 400mcg of 25i-NBOH.  


25i-NBOH was on blotter and I took it about 30 minutes past ingestion of 4-AcO-MET which already started to produce a familiar warm psychedelia.  


As everything was kicking in I went to take a shower, then made some kratom tea, ate some dark chocolate. I was feeling uneasy and restless, I tried reading and words were just jumping away from me - I couldn't make up any meaning and it started making me a bit dizzy. The dizziness had progressed as my view of the world started getting pretty wavy - it felt like my brain was free-floating inside my skull along with my eyeballs.  


To combat the dizziness I drank some strong ginger brew, laid on the sofa and decided to check out videogames. After trying a few of them I realized that it was really hard to concentrate on anything in particular so I loaded the game called "Everything" - it has no plot, no purpose, no enemies, the game is filled with Alan Watts recordings so I really enjoy this game when I'm shooting out there but feeling very active mentally.  


And man....![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) the Reality itself unfolded the message after message about MY life (which in a way is a life of everything) and EVERYTHING I was, am and going to be was right in front of me, amazingly transcendent experience! When I ascended from being the swirling galaxy into yet bigger object I became a Planck's length in a world of basic geometry - this seriously blew my mind with such visuals and understanding, I started crying... Geometry started coming out from the wall (I use LCD projector all the time) and shooting out in different directions with multitude of colors! I felt so clear, so bright, so awakened!   ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)


Then as I was listening to recordings of Alan Watts in game I have experienced the freakiest psychedelic effect - the time started to alterate it's speed for me - first I noticed the voice was floating extremely in pitch - it got me curious. Along with the voice, all the letters were floating around, up and down, further and closer and as I got up to check it out closer I've noticed frames of reality freezing up - as if my brain was waaay faster than the physical world and my own body. It was not very pleasurable at that particular time as I immediately thought that I've never experienced it like that and it might be damaging in some way, especially extreme pitch alteration of sounds - it was like some crazy DJ was swinging the pitch slider up and down along with my waviness. All along I maintain body-ego awareness.  


At that point (about 3 hours in) I decided I need to calm down, took out my signing bowls and popped a 0,25mg of Etizolam. As I started playing the bowls, I intensely realized that my mind (and every other mind) is truly empty - it gets filled up by only recent and most memorable inputs that shape who we think we are. As I played the bowls, my mind had become a beautiful mandala, that grew in size and pushed away all anxiety. I was very impressed.  


From there on I coasted down vaporizing some cannabis and enjoying the beautiful psychedelic glow.  


Thinking of it now, it was in a way a process of time transcending - I thought that if the Universe becomes so self-aware of itself, then everything would have to come to a halt, including time. As I see it, time allows us to maintain the illusion of continuity, illusion of being separate and I have felt it that time very strongly that it is merely an illusion. Time is necessary for the drama of life to happen.   


We are so damn connected and it's so much fun to play with it! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

2C-I is nothing like the others, it's by far the least interesting, just visuals and stimulation/euphoria.  2C-B and 2C-C are clean, beautiful empathogenic psychedelics, 2C-E is SO glorious and deeper than almost anything else I've ever taken and is in my top 5 if not my top 3 of all drugs I've ever taken, 2C-T-2 is mescaline-like and wonderful... it's a great class, you just tried the worst one. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I agree completely.  I never got the euphoria Xorkoth mentions either....just made me feel like my skin was crawling and a weird tension/anxiety.  It's funny because at the time it was toted as a great introductory experience to phenethylamines and so, aside from MDMA, it was the first I tried and due to the results I put off trying the others for a long time....too long.

I quite liked 2C-I, but it was my first psychedelic experience at all, so a lot of what might have been bland and uninteresting to a more experienced person was pretty fucking amazing to me at the time. Anyway, doesn't all this stuff about 2Cs belong in another thread? I remembered this discussion and wanted to post a question about 2Cs.... but I don't want to clutter the 4-AcO-MET thread with it.

I just realized this... Man, as a harrem duction forum I think it needs to be made clear that this type of behavior was beyond reckless. You get 8 bags, one of which *may* contain 4-AcO-MET. And one of which *Absolutely* contained 5F-ADB, which is active in the microgram range and can easily cause very scary experiences or worse, an extremely toxic over dose. 


Choosing at random one of those powders and trying even a few milligrams of it could have been suicide, since you dont even know what else that lab makes, much less taking a overdose of a CB1 agonist. 


Lets try to be smarter than this guys. This is why we cant have nice things.

Regarding my earlier trip on 18mg of 4-AcO-MET and 400mcg of 25I-NBOH, the "leader" substance was 4-AcO-MET, where the NBOH was a catalyst and a "bending factor" for the trip to skyrocket. By itself I find NBOH pretty bland and 4-AcO-MET also feel like it's missing something. 

I do not recommend 25I-NBOH and it's combos to anyone in the right mind! ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


I said it before but I like to mention it again - 4-AcO-MET is the best psychedelic for combos - numerous accounts of notably good interactions IME! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Dont have any pics or links for you unfortunately but a person I used to know worked in China exporting variety of goods, including chemicals - he liked talking about how different (very mildly put) most businesses are run over there and how much incompetence and plain ignorance is at every step, just to increase the profit.


Im sure there are numbers of very clean and professionally run labs out there but just saying.

So I had this really interesting experience earlier this spring, on Bicycle Day.

So I decided to write trip report, [4-AcO-MET/~33 mg - 2nd trial - Suddenly there was a change](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/846660-4-AcO-MET-33-mg-2nd-trial-Suddenly-there-was-a-change?p=14356877#post14356877)


Now I normally wouldnt post such a trip report but the stark and sudden change in visuals surrounding the confusion I experienced really made me wonder ... This change persisted for the rest of the trip (perhaps in part due to the setting sun??). Has anyone experienced something similar?

About the China - quite pointless discussion, as I see pros and cons with everything. But in the sake of harm reduction: 


IMO buying straight from that country drastically reduces the guarantee of the authenticity of the product (ie you'd think you're getting 4-AcO-MET but it can easily turn up to be some designer cannabinoid active in micrograms). Whether if it comes from reseller, vendors usually want to keep their customers alive and well (as I would imagine they themselves dabble in some experiences) so they at least try to make sure it is what it really is. Of course there are exceptions, like with BromoDragonfly deaths and infamously known vendor who was indeed a reseller of chems from China. It was a very tragic lesson for all vendors and users.

REPOSTED FROM TRs:


These kind of things happen to me very often and lately it started  involving auditory hallucinations and distortions as well. My first ever  trip on mushrooms showed it in all it's glory - I got freaked out  because of some disagreements with my then girlfriend and it triggered  visual demonic growth in everything, it was quite realistic looking too.  ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Aye I have had these sorts of externalizing of my inner confusion but I was simply not expecting it from this compound. It caught me off guard, in a good way.

I just wanted ot make sure I wasnt having some sort of episode (/ psychotic break). Ive posted about it after various acid trips (alone (high dose) and in combo with T7, another with 2ce and mushrooms and another high dose with mda) but no one really had any insight other than "ya Ive had that when Im tripping hard." But Ive also had it from a dxm+weed trip.  So thank you for your insight Volsam


..


Im just curious though does anyone have any insight on combing this with md(m)a?

I have a festival coming up and I think this might be a wonderful combo. Bright and visual without too much headspace. Im hoping the m will synergize and add some mental aspects.

Thoughts?


edit: after considering the weather and Ms increased neurotoxicity with elevated temperatures and the fact this will be a day time trip and I dont want to just bunker down in the shade.... I think Ill pass on the M.


But Im still interested in the 4 aco met... I know the safety profile is similar to mushrooms (et al) but would there be any cause for concern to combine with 5 meo mipt? Given 5 meo mipt is said to have maoi properties?

Took 11mg of this stuff last night with no psychedelic tolerance, combined with a bunch of wine


Got pretty spun, definitely less of a creepy come-up in comparison to 4-aco-DMT, still got a bit paranoid and loopy though. Hard not to be paranoid during this creepy coronavirus world we're living in


Stood up from my couch and said "oh my god!" out loud when it started hitting me because the colors on my TV were blowing my mind haha.


Didn't have a great time because I combined it with so much wine and I got all stupified and disoriented, but it seems like a great drug and look forward to trying it again when the world is more normal and without alcohol


I've never tried 4-ho-MET but it was similar to how it's been described


Didn't get any weird side-effects that couldn't be ruled out from the wine, although it was pretty stimulating. I felt a big sick towards the end but I attribute that to sleep deprivation and wine. Less of a forceful stimulation compared to phenethylamines though.


It was a brown powder with the classic tryptamine smell. Appeared and smelled the same as a batch of 4-aco-DMT I had 8 years ago, minus the clumpiness.

It’s nice stuff, one of my favourites. I prefer 4-AcO to 4-HO but they are very close. Not for everyone but my most euphoric experiences has been with a 50/50 combo of 4-AcO-MET and 4-AcO-DMT. Careful with the dose, many call this one mild in the headspace department but I have found if I push the dose the visual experience gets so intense and beautifully sinister. I have had what appeared to be entity contact OEV on 45mg 4-AcO-MET combo with 15mg 4-AcO-DMT. These are high doses for and I have had a lot of experience with them both alone, so everyone is different.

Yes I once comboed this with 4 aco dmt and dxm

I took 400 mg of dxm. At t1:00 I took 20 mg of 4 aco dmt and 20 mg of 4 aco met. 

The plan was to be more social than a higher dose of any of the three but by t2:00 I knew Id made a huge mistake lol ... 


Playing video games with friends became entirely undeisrably and I passed the controller

so that I could roll on the couch. With a warm electrified but mellow body a plethora of colours danced over open eyes. 


At one point a foaf made mentioned how I was fucked and laughed about my hair... and I suddenly tried to sit up and straighten up. Only to be rolling unabashedly in ecstasy some minutes later. It took a few hours to come off the peak. It was a challenge not to just excuse myself to escape as my mind raced... but not into the loops which higher doses of either dxm or 4 aco dmt (or other full psychedelics) seem to cause for me,.


The experience wasnt social and for a party where everyone was drinking was a little too intense 

but ..it was managable and I will def repeat on my own, in a proper setting

20mg 4-AcO-DMT + 20mg 4-AcO-MET would be a strong experience on it's on.


400mg of DXM + 20mg of any 4-sub would also be a strong experience on it's on. DXM potentiates psychedelics by a lot, and 400mg isn't necessarily a low dose of it, either.


I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. I would have been out of there ASAP ![:ROFLMAO:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)

I should note that I had a higher tolerance to dissos from recent dxm use in months leading up to this event.. So though 400 was only half of what I had weighed out lol, another 400 for t3:00 but 15 min after dosing the tryps I realized how silly such a large dose was with dxm as a launch pad... 


And as much as i wanted to bail it was a birthday party for a friend... at my place ... and I had bailed on New Years on these guys (after overshooting a 1a-lsd and 2ct7 combo lol). So I figured I should stick this one out ...

Just ordered my first 4-ho, I'm a big fan of 4-aco. At big doses I find it the same as oral DMT without the hellish vomiting. Absolute brain food - it's like your brain says "Excuse me while I take the controls for a bit mate". Don't think I've ever experienced laughing fits like it.

I'm planning on researching a different tryptamine than the usual 4acodmt soon, and this has had my eye for awhile. 


Anyone that's tried it, how does it compare to 4acodmt, mushrooms, dmt, and lsd?


I have also tried 4homet and 4homipt, but they were both so long ago and I only tried them once so they are less of a useful comparison but still desired if anyone can.

4-HO-MET / 20-22mg orally - Second Time - "Surprise, Surprise!"  This was my second time with this drug, and the first for my friend. We are both very experienced with a wide variety of classical and novel psychedelics, although we rarely push the doses to the high level and even more rarely...

4-AcO-MET is somewhat less in your face, which applies in every context of the word, but out of all tryptamines 4-HO-MET is closest. Generally people like 4-HO-MET better though, there was some more discussion about the differences between the two a while ago in the social threads. They're all great honestly.

I think it's theorized that 4acomet is a prodrug for 4homet anyway. So I'm assuming they're fairly similar. I remember enjoying 4homet, but it's been so long and I never had a peak experience like I have with 4acodmt so it's less memorable for me.

Nice! Thanks man. I've read that it's a little more visually intense, which I'm totally cool with. 


Trypts are generally my favorite but I like to combo with phens too, I feel that usually ends up feeling like a completely full psychedelic experience.

so yesterday I tried a small taste of 4-ACO-MET. I put an ammount that didn't even register on my cheap Gemini-20 scale and then about an equal amount that stuck to the tweezers in a glass of water. I'm guessing this was 3-5mg total. I wasn't expecting to feel anything but was surprised to feel a definite +1 some time later (2 hours maybe?). The buzzing (flanging?) in the body felt really good, and there was some sparkling to the visual field as well. No visuals, more like the pixles were tending to flicker in slightly bigger clumps. Its been a few years since I've used mushrooms and haven't tried any other 4 sub tryptamines so I feel excited about this one.

I found it to be an ok tryptamine, not really bad but there are a lot of better ones out there. From the 4aco‘s I’ve tried I found only 4aco-mipt less interesting.

What did you find lacking with it?


I tried it at 21mg orally in a capsule yesterday at the start of a hike in a beautiful state park on a beautiful day after a thunderstorm. The sun came out in patches between billowing cumulous clouds. The trail was full of all sorts of wildflowers and the sun was shining through the grass and other plant. First alerts were at ~20 minutes and then at ~35 minutes the effects started building rapidly. I stopped at a bench for the next 30-60 minutes to focus on opening up to the rapidly increasing changes. Like others have mentioned there was a focus on the visual. Colors became more and more bright, vivid and saturated, and along with this an appreciation of the beauty. There was some physical intensity as the feelings in the heart center and gut increased and then an integration of those centers of feeling happened where "I" transitioned from being an observer of those centers to those centers being a part of "me". I noticed a brief moment of nausea that corresponded to a moment of resisting that integration (an old fear of being overwhelmed by the intimacy with my own feeling centers that quickly passed. In the past this would have been more difficult and taken up more time in the trip.


My watch died and I lost my pen, so I was unable to keep track of time or take careful notes. I believe the peak happened at about 1.5-2 hr after ingestion. There were DMT like closed eye visuals at the peak - images made of many fine lines of simple colors with a dark background. Around the peak I felt like I could have closed my eyes, laid down and fallen into another universe. I'm curious what would have happened had I gone with that, however I was with my girlfriend on a hike and had the intention of being more extroverted. Next time I may take a higher dose alone and see if that other universe is available.


The previous week I had spent a lot of time creating midjourney ai images in the style of different impressionist painters and this seemed to influence the aesthetic of the visual landscape of the park. I spent some time talking with my girlfriend and looking out at a large landscape and it was like a living impressionist painting perhaps a mix of monet and van gogh. I was deeply affected by the beauty, I don't know how to explain it except to speak in cliches like it was unbelievably wonderfully amazingly beautiful.


During the ramp up to the peak and at the peak I was able to talk to my girlfriend. We talked about some difficult relationship issues. After the peak we started hiking again and continued to talk about our relationship and other things. I noticed something that I feel with almost every trip on every psychedelic, a sense of deep wellbeing that inhibits reactivity. I was able to hear difficult things without the usual defenses. I seemed more clearheaded doing this than with 2C-B or TMA-2. With those substances I seemed to get pulled out of my own experience and deeply drawn into a representation of my girlfriend's mind. This useful for understanding/empathizing with her but reduced my own self-awareness.


Along the way there were great big majestic oak trees, gold finches, boston oriels, a golden iridescent daddy long legs, blue herons and even a pair of sand hill cranes that walked with us for a way and then took off together to fly across the valley. I felt so much gratitude to see these creatures and the landscape, the flowers and clouds and trees.


I love to run and I went on about an 8 mile run with my girlfriend biking along. It felt easier than normal, there are signals of discomfort the body sends when running up hills or after running for a while and these were greatly diminished. I felt full of energy and was making jokes about drinking beers with my bat boys and eating lighting bugs. I felt really close with my girlfriend and she could feel it too. She is a therapist and said something like, "people who are tripping make the best therapists" (she sometimes volunteers at festivials to help with tripping people who need help and says they often notice stuff about her and she feels like she gets a therapy session from it).


At about the end of the run we could see sand hill cranes flying into the sky from many areas of the park and gathering in a large group and flying off in the distance as the sun started to go down. This was about at the 4 hr mark and most of the primary effects were gone, although there was a great afterglow that lasted for the rest of the night. The combination of the psychedelic and the run left me feeling deeply relaxed in my body and open in my mind. I think this could be a powerful way to reset the mind and body if I ever get into a funk.


This one seems like a big winner to me. It felt very clean, very little side effects. No nausea, no thickening of the saliva, there was relaxed energy without anxiety or tightness. Even the strange electric tingling of what I imagine to be the olfactory nerve was absent (this has been present for every other psychedelic experience as far as I remember). If this experience was universal, I would recommend it for people nervous about psychedelics to try because of its shorter time and absence of side effects. It appears I am more sensitive than normal to this one, which is great because I tend to be a hard head. Its interesting that I am less sensitive to mushrooms than normal but apparently more sensitive to metocetin.

I had the following in ascending preference: 4aco-mipt < 4aco-met < 4aco-det < 4aco-dipt.

4aco-Met gave me a solid and fun trip, not too deep but I can live with that. 4aco-det which is my go to 4-substituted tryptamine these days is more balanced for example and I can get more out of the headspace produced. It seems for me that at least with the 4-substituted tryptamines symmetrical substitution on the nitrogen is more rewarding for me. This is not the case with the 5meo tryptamines I had, rather the opposite.

Anybody find 4-aco-met to give them a hot face, body, facial flushing, blushing, redness, and side effects? It feels like it's hard to metabolize, but then it's not so bad, though I stay hot. I stay hot enough that I sweat with and without the AC on!

Anybody else know what I'm referring to? Well get this, I tried some maca and cordyceps from a kratom shop(a high quality apothecary) and it potentiated the side effects and duration of the peak by about 3x. I'm talking hours longer and only a very small dose of 5mg IM.

I have tried IV(and failed, too caustic) and IM + oral. No nasal or 4-me-boofing. I found the side effects from IM to last shorter, though much stronger. I'll bet 5mg IM with no tolerance feels like 15mg oral no tolerance, but I have only tried up to 20mg with some tolerance and it wasn't as strong as the 5mg IM no tolerance.

I wish I could take this, but I'm going to take it very easy on this.

Is there any way to convert it into 4-ho-met?

Is there a supposed mechanism for the side effects? Perhaps a receptor, enzyme, or phenomena that makes explains this side effects being so strong for me via any ROA?

Is it worth it to freebase the fumurate salt for smoking?

What do you think about IM tryptamines? I'd IM 1cp-lsd if I knew it would shorten the duration, that'd be freaking awesome! Nothing quite like the shorter duration of tryptamines lol.

I've personally never experienced this side effect. I've read several reports of people freebasing 4-xxx-MET, but I doubt vaping it is something most would do more than a few times as a novelty. It definitely shortens the duration. You can IM it, as well, but personally I get to where I want to with oral dosing with this material.

I seem to have quite a bit of side effects from this substance. Today I had a microdose of 2.5mg, sublingual held for minutes @50mg/ml, so potent. I only had a few drops really. It was much stronger than it would have been oral. Anyways I found myself paranoid! I've noticed this a few times, I have no idea if mushrooms and lsd would treat me this way, it's been awhile since I've tripped on either, though I'm hoping it's the strong D2 receptor binding affinity of 4-aco-met that is causing this as opposed to psychedelics in general. Perhaps I can use LSD to reverse this with some neurolinguistic programming lol

I had a nice trip on 28mg 4-AcO-MET fumarate (oral in gel cap) the other evening.


I was shocked at how quickly it came on. I swallowed the pill on a slightly hungry belly, and then followed it with a bowl of rice and some dal and veg, and I think it was hitting me within 10mins already. Another 10-20mins and I was getting pretty unable to operate my computer, managed to queue up a new album I've been very interested, and spent the next hour tripping out during the peak to  - wonderful album for the substance! Probably another 30-60mins roughly at the peak after that and then a gradual taper, was sleeping probably 6 hours after ingestion.


I think this was my largest dose of the substance [edit: after looking at my notes, it was not, have taken 35mg before, and that was pretty similar in potency to this trip], nothing too much to handle and could probably bump up the dose still, but also not sure it would be necessary either. It's really peaky in terms of the envelope of it's effects, very quickly absorbed, and with a long tail of being quite alert. Very pleasant and aesthetically stimulating - the music was very much enhanced and coupled with incredible geometric fractal visions inside my mind. Probably less deep and soul searching than some other materials (e.g. 4-AcO-DMT, mushrooms, DPT, and definitely less so than 5-MeO-DMT) and that's just great, sometimes it's lovely to take a walk in a beautiful garden and not need to go to the basement library. It's occurred to me before, and this trip reinforced the idea that maybe 4-AcO-MET is to mushrooms/4-AcO-DMT as AL-LAD is to LSD - although AL-LAD does have a bit more humour to it, which I don't think 4-AcO-MET has particularly. It's like a beautiful delicate and intricate flower. So much sparkle and colour.


Getting to the end of my supply for this one, I wonder if it's worth stocking up for the long haul or use it as an excuse to explore other molecules.

I like this analogy. I do love 4-AcO-MET...but not enough to actually ever take it. It's lovely stuff to be sure, but it's never at the top of my list of things to take. I think it's been four years since I last took it with another four year gap before that. If I want to be awestruck with the beauty of nature, it's just wonderful. The visual element is truly remarkable. But recapturing childlike innocence and delight isn't something that I find myself trying to do a lot of. I think ~30mg is my functional maximum. 40mg did not improve things for me.

Out of curiosity [@Pfafffed](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/369391/) what substances do you put at the top of your list of things to take?

That's a lot like asking what my favorite tool in the toolbox is. It all comes down to the job. 


I take 5-MeO-MiPT more often than any other psychedelic, but it's not a very *psychedelic* psychedelic. It's more of a way to step back and slow down from the distractions of daily life, and focus instead on reconnecting with those I care about. 


Mescaline is one of my favorite psychedelics for emotional opening and recalibration. It's just too long for me to take frequently. 2C-T-2 does a decent impersonation at a shorter duration, but it's as rare as hen's teeth. 


N,N-EPT is one of the only psychedelics that I have few reservations about sharing with anyone, but that's because it's just so damn gentle. 


When I actually want a tryptamine *trip*, I usually gravitate towards 4-xxx-MPT or 4-xxx-DET these days, just because I've found them to be valuable and interesting, and I haven't spent enough time with them yet. More often, though, I find that I go for a

short acting phenethylamine instead, usually a halogenated 2C-x.

[@Pfafffed](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/369391/) it's really interesting to read that. Yes I agree about the tools analogy.


I think I've only taken 5-MeO-MiPT a couple of times, and at pretty low doses, 3mg and then I think it was 5-6mg. My notes say exactly what you said - not a very *psychedelic* psychedelic, and very social. Pretty interesting. You remind me to revisit it. I remember a period when it was available for ridiculously low prices at very high purity. Ah the good ol days.


I'm a big fan of mescaline too although I've actually only had it a handful of times. I regret not stocking up more on 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 when I had the chance.


EPT hasn't been on my radar at all, interesting that you mention it. Is it orally active, or is it like the other base tryptamines where you have to bypass the gut?


Also interesting that you mention 4-xxx-MPT and 4-xxx-DET, these haven't been on my radar much.

It's orally active, but not potent. I've taken it orally and rectally, but more often than not I vape it.

The former is like psilocin's glamorous sibling - it's warm, baroque, splendid. Unless it's a complete dud, which it sometimes is. The latter is polarizing in the way of DPT and 5-MeO-DMT. I just happen to get on well with it. It's a unique and tasty take on the 4-sub tryptamine experience.

I'm big into 5-MeO-DMT and DPT, so I might need to give 4-xxx-DET a chance. Way back when I was reading every trip report on all the tryptamines I remember deciding that 4-xxx-DET reports made it sound less compelling - but like you said, you could easily be given the same impression about DPT and 5-MeO-DMT just going on the trip reports out there.


> How about you?

Yeah it's hard to answer, different tools for the job. I have a problem where when I take any psychedelic I usually think "wow that one is really good, really special, top tier". So I think I just like psychedelics in general.


But 5-MeO-DMT, 4-AcO-DMT, 2C-D, 2C-E, AL-LAD, ETH-LAD all rank highly for me

Honourable mention to DPT, 4-AcO-MET and of course the established classics like mushrooms, LSD and mescaline


If I had to take one to the desert island for the rest of my life it would probably be LSD, but if I could have a 2nd it might be 2C-E or 5-MeO-DMT


you have me intrigued about 4-xxx-MPT and 4-xxx-DET, and I'm also very curious about 5-MeO-MALT and 5-MeO-MET

What's the It here? 4-AcO-MET? I haven't found it boring personally, but it seems stronger in the aesthetic dimension than in insight and introspection.

That's so interesting to hear you say that! The prevailing consensus seems to be that 4-AcO-MET and 4-HO-MET are interchangeable, but that *does not* reflect my experience. I enjoy them both, but as you said, for me 4-HO-MET is deep, emotional, and rich like psilocybin, while 4-AcO-MET is cold, crystalline, and exquisitely beautiful while being pretty clear-headed.

 It doesn't sound like we can generalize much from each other. The materials you mention are all over the scatter chart for me, from exquisite to forgettable to highly dysphoric. There's no telling how you'll like 4-xxx-MPT/DET, but they're worth a shot (two shots with ...MPT just in case it's a dud.) My one experience with 5-MeO-MALT was an "allergy dose," and it made me feel tense and awful, like it was just straight up poisonous to me (and for reference, I get no side effects from bufotenin!) I've never touched it again, but most people talk about it like it's baby 5-MeO-DMT. 5-MeO-MET is fairly lovely. I like it quite a bit, but it does suffer from being not very psychedelic and kind of stimulating in a mildly anxiogenic way. I still appreciate it quite a bit. It has that cool clarity and emotional vibrance of 4-AcO-MET.
