## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dichlorobenzenes. These are compounds containing a benzene with exactly two chlorine atoms attached to it.

### Background

Clonidine is an imidazole derivate that acts as an agonist of alpha-2 adrenoceptors.
2
This activity is useful for the treatment of hypertension, severe pain, and ADHD.

### Indication

Clonidine tablets, oral solution and transdermal systems are indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other medications.
8
,
9
,
15
A clonidine injection is indicated for use with opiates in the treatment of severe cancer pain where opiates alone are insufficient.
10
An extended-release tablet of clonidine is indicated for the treatment of ADHD, either alone or in combination with other medications.
11
Clonidine is also used for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma,
3
treatment of nicotine dependance,
4
and opiate withdrawal.
5
Additionally, clonidine is also indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy to central nervous system (CNS) stimulant medications in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older.
13
,
14

### Pharmacodynamics

Clonidine functions through agonism of alpha-2 adrenoceptors which have effects such as lowering blood pressure, sedation, and hyperpolarization of nerves.
2
It has a long duration of action as it is given twice daily and the therapeutic window is between 0.1mg and 2.4mg daily.

### Absorption

Clonidine reaches maximum concentration in 60-90 minutes after oral administration.
2
,
6
Race and fasting status do not influence pharmacokinetics of clonidine.
8
A 100µg oral clonidine tablet reaches a C
max
of 400.72pg/mL with an AUC of 5606.78h*pg/mL and a bioavailability of 55-87%.
6

### Metabolism

The metabolism of clonidine is poorly understood.
7
The main reaction in clonidine metabolism is the 4-hydroxylation of clonidine by CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP1A1, and CYP3A5.
7
Clonidine is <50% metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites.

### Half-life

The elimination half life after epidural administration is 30 minutes but otherwise can range from 6-23h.

### Toxicity

Oral LD
50
is 126 mg/kg in rats.
12
The TDLO is 70µg/kg in children, 126µg/kg in women, and 69µg/kg in men.
12
Symptoms of overdose include hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, drowsiness, decreased reflexes, weakness, irritability, and miosis.
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
Severe overdoses can cause reversible cardiac conduction defects or dysrhythmias, apnea, coma, and seizures.
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
Induction of vomiting is not recommended due to CNS depression but gastric lavage or activated charcoal may be useful in recent ingestion.
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
Dialysis is also unlikely to be beneficial.
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
Overdose can be treated with supportive measures such as atropine sulfate for bradycardia, intravenous fluids or vasopressors for hypotension, vasodilators for hypertension, naloxone for respiratory depression, and blood pressure monitoring.

### Mechanism of action

Clonidine is primarily an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist which causes central hypotensive and anti-arrhythmogenic effects.
2
The alpha-2 adrenoceptor is coupled to the G-proteins G
o
and G
i
.
2
G
i
inhibits adenylyl cyclase and activates opening of a potassium channel that causes hyperpolarization.
2
Clonidine binding to the alpha-2 adrenoceptor causes structural changes in the alpha subunit of the G-protein, reducing its affinity for GDP.
2
Magnesium catalyzes the replacement of GDP with GTP.
2
The alpha subunit dissociates from the other subunits and associates with an effector.
2
The stimulation of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the locus coeruleus may be responsible for the hypnotic effects of clonidine as this region of the brain helps regulate wakefulness.
2
Clonidine can also decrease transmission of pain signals at the spine.
2
Finally clonidine can affect regulators of blood pressure in the ventromedial and rostral-ventrolateral areas of the medulla.

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution of clonidine has been reported as 1.7-2.5L/kg
2
, 2.9L/kg
9
, or 2.1±0.4L/kg

### General Function

Transporter that mediates the transport of endogenous and microbial zwitterions and organic cations (PubMed:10215651, PubMed:15107849, PubMed:15795384, PubMed:16729965, PubMed:20601551, PubMed:22206629, PubMed:22569296, PubMed:29530864). Functions as a Na(+)-dependent and pH-dependent high affinity microbial symporter of potent food-derived antioxidant ergothioeine (PubMed:15795384, PubMed:29530864, PubMed:33124720). Transports one sodium ion with one ergothioeine molecule (By similarity). Involved in the absorption of ergothioneine from the luminal/apical side of the small intestine and renal tubular cells, and into non-parenchymal liver cells, thereby contributing to maintain steady-state ergothioneine level in the body (PubMed:20601551). Also mediates the bidirectional transport of acetycholine, although the exact transport mechanism has not been fully identified yet (PubMed:22206629). Most likely exports anti-inflammatory acetylcholine in non-neuronal tissues, thereby contributing to the non-neuronal cholinergic system (PubMed:22206629, PubMed:22569296). Displays a general physiological role linked to better survival by controlling inflammation and oxidative stress, which may be related to ergothioneine and acetycholine transports (PubMed:15795384, PubMed:22206629). May also function as a low-affinity Na(+)-dependent transporter of L-carnitine through the mitochondrial membrane, thereby maintaining intracellular carnitine homeostasis (PubMed:10215651, PubMed:15107849, PubMed:16729965). May contribute to regulate the transport of cationic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (PubMed:35307651)
