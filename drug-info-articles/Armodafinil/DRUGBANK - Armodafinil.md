# Armodafinil
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06413*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diphenylmethanes. These are compounds containing a diphenylmethane moiety, which consists of a methane wherein two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two phenyl groups.

### Background

Armodafinil is the enantiopure of the wakefulness-promoting agent modafinil (Provigil), and is indicated to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), narcolepsy, or shift work disorder (SWD). Research has shown that armodafinil significantly improves driving simulator performance in patients with SWD. Armodafinil consists of the (−)-R-enantiomer of the racemic modafinil. Armodafinil is produced by the pharmaceutical company Cephalon Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.) and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2007.

### Indication

Investigated for use/treatment in sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, depression, and bipolar disorders.

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent dopamine transporter
Antagonist

### Absorption

Tmax is 2 hours when fasted and can be delayed approximately 2-4 hours by food, potentially affecting the onset of action.

### Metabolism

In vitro and in vivo data show that armodafinil undergoes hydrolytic deamidation, S-oxidation, and aromatic ring hydroxylation, with subsequent glucuronide conjugation of the hydroxylated products. Amide hydrolysis is the single most prominent metabolic pathway, with sulfone formation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 being next in importance. The other oxidative products are formed too slowly in vitro to enable identification of the enzyme(s) responsible. Only two metabolites reach appreciable concentrations in plasma (i.e., R-modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone). Data specific to armodafinil disposition are not available.

### Half-life

Terminal half-life is approximately 15 hours.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Abemaciclib
The metabolism of Abemaciclib can be increased when combined with Armodafinil.
Abrocitinib
The metabolism of Abrocitinib can be decreased when combined with Armodafinil.
Acalabrutinib
The metabolism of Acalabrutinib can be increased when combined with Armodafinil.
Acenocoumarol
The metabolism of Acenocoumarol can be increased when combined with Armodafinil.
Acetaminophen
The metabolism of Acetaminophen can be increased when combined with Armodafinil.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Exercise caution with grapefruit products. Armodafinil is partially metabolized by CYP3A4, and grapefruit is a CYP3A4 inhibitor.
Exercise caution with St. John's Wort. Armodafinil is partially metabolized by CYP3A4, and St. John's Wort is a CYP3A4 inducer.
Take with or without food. Taking armodafinil with food can delay the Tmax by 2-4 hours.

### Mechanism of action

Nuvigil (armodafinil) is a single-isomer of modafini. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Armodafinil belongs to a class of drugs known as eugeroics, which are stimulants that provide long-lasting mental arousal. Pharmacologically, armodafinil does not bind to or inhibit several receptors and enzymes potentially relevant for sleep/wake regulation. Armodafinil is not a direct- or indirect-acting dopamine receptor agonist. However, in vitro, both armodafinil and modafinil bind to the dopamine transporter and inhibit dopamine reuptake.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids and steroids (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). Exhibits low catalytic activity for the formation of catechol estrogens from 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2 (PubMed:12865317). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation and hydroxylation with double-bond migration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Contributes to the wide pharmacokinetics variability of the metabolism of drugs such as S-warfarin, diclofenac, phenytoin, tolbutamide and losartan (PubMed:25994031)
