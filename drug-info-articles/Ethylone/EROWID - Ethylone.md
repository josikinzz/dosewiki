- **Class:** Euphoric empathogen; phenethylamine
- **Other Names:** bk-MDEA, MDEC

## Effects

Ethylone is classified as a euphoric empathogen. User reports suggest effects are generally milder and less satisfying than MDMA, with titles such as:

- "Like MDMA Without the Fun"
- "Not the Molly I Was Looking for"

These reports indicate users often find the effects less pronounced than expected.
