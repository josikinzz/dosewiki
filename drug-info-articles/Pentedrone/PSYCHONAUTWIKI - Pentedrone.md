**Pentedrone** (also known as **drone** ) is a lesser-known novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) class. Pentedrone belongs to a group of compounds known as [substituted cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinones) . Pentedrone acts as a [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (NDRI).

Pentedrone was first detected being sold online in 2010. It is an example of a contemporary [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) specifically chosen to mimic and/or replace the effects of street drugs like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . Pentedrone and similar compounds are sometimes referred to as "bath salts".

Pentedrone is known to come in the form of either a white powder or crystallized shards [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] which users can ingest to produce a powerful, fast-acting but short-lived euphoric stimulant effects which are comparable to those of [crack-cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Crack-cocaine) , [N-ethylpentedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/N-ethylpentedrone) and [a-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) -type compounds, particularly when they are [insufflated](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Insufflated) , [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Vaporized) or [injected](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Injection) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Starting with the advent of [MDPV](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDPV) , research chemical stimulants like pentedrone have gained notoriety for its tendency to induce [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) and addictive behaviors in a seemingly significant percentage of its users as well the ability to readily induce [paranoid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [delusional states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [stimulant psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant_psychosis) when abused. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Little data exists about the toxicity and abuse potential of pentedrone in humans. Due to its novelty and brief history of human usage, all information related to this compound should be treated with extreme caution. It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Pentedrone is a molecule of the [substituted cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) chemical class. Substituted cathinones refer to a class of molecules which are principally constituted of a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core with an alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon and an oxygen group attached to the beta carbon. They are also known as the beta-ketone (double-bonded oxygen to the β-carbon) analogs of [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) . Pentedrone is the a-pentyl beta-keto analog of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) .

Of general note, the cathinone backbone can be modified in three different places to create hundreds of possible compounds, which include substituents on the aromatic ring, the alpha carbon, and the amine group.

## Pharmacology

Due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all proceeding discussion regarding the pharmacology of this compound derives from speculation based upon its structure and subjective effect similarities to other [cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) and related molecules, such as [prolintane](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prolintane) , [a-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) , [a-PHP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PHP) and analogs like [N-ethyl-(nor)-pentedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/N-ethyl-(nor)-pentedrone) (i.e. **NEP** ).

Unlike many other substituted cathinones, which display both [reuptake-inhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) and [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) properties, pentedrone has been shown to act as a pure [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) for the major [catecholamine](/w/index.php?title=Catecholamine&action=edit&redlink=1) neurotransmitters [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , with very modest activity on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . This renders its pharmacological activity similar to that of [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [MDPV](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDPV) (although the latter two possess heavy additional [serotonergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) activity. These pure uptake inhibitors likely do not enter the intracellular space of the synapse via the transporter, which may be associated with less intracellular pharmacological effects and toxicity compared with substrate-type releasers This enables the endogenous neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within various synaptic regions in the brain, resulting in [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Notably, the addition of an ethyl group to the terminal amine (-NH2) group of the pentedrone molecule seems to increase its potency significantly, as is observed with its successor analog [N-ethyl-(nor)-pentedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/N-ethyl-(nor)-pentedrone) (i.e. *NEP* ) which is viewed as having preferential recreational properties.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, pentedrone can be considered to be very stimulating and energetic.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - Much like related cathninones, it is commonly reported that medium to high doses of pentedrone can result in a pleasurable body high characterized by a pleasant tingling sensation, which persists for a short period after administration before quickly falling off, which can lead users to redose more than they initially intended. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This effect usually occurs at the peak of the experience, which can be short-lived compared to its total duration.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Dry mouth and increased sweating can occur after consuming pentedrone.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - A number of reports indicate that pentedrone can produce slight vasoconstriction, though this has yet to be scientifically validated. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - At common doses, this component has been reported considerably to less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or other [cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinones) like [a-PHP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PHP) or [NEP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NEP) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**

- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational pentedrone use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because pentedrone has a very short history of human usage. Early anecdotal evidence from people who have tried pentedrone within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it in a sparing and controlled fashion (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of pentedrone can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and seems to be readily liable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of pentedrone develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the total absence of further consumption). Pentedrone presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of pentedrone all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the stimulant class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for (dextro) [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Pentedrone can be potentially dangerous in combination with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) as it can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Pentedrone should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Pentedrone may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA are generally believed to be increased when combined with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and other stimulants.
- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart to dangerous levels.
