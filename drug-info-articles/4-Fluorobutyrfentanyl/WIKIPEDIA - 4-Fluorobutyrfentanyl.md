4-Fluorobutyrylfentanyl (also known as 4-FBF and p-FBF or para-fluorobutyrylfentanyl) is an opioid analgesic that is an analog of butyrfentanyl and has been sold online as a designer drug. It is closely related to 4-fluorofentanyl, which has an EC50 value of 4.2 nM for the human μ-opioid receptor.

## Side effects

Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.

Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying 4-fluorobutyrylfentanyl as hazardous substance on August 18, 2014.
In October 2015, 4-fluorobutyrylfentanyl became a controlled substance in China.
