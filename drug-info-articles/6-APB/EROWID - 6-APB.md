6-APB
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**6-APB**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
6-APB is unscheduled in the United States. It is possible that it could be considered an analog (of MDA), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) though we are unaware of any such existing cases (01/26/11).
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Florida #
 
6-APB and 5-APB are now Schedule I by law as of Apr 29, 2013. Previously, 6-APB and 5-APB were added to Schedule I by emergency rule in Florida as "APB ((2-aminopropyl)benzofuran)". See [myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MMFD-92VKZ8/$file/ER+RuleOAGRuleCertification12-11-2012.pdf](http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MMFD-92VKZ8/$file/ER+RuleOAGRuleCertification12-11-2012.pdf) , but this emergency rule appears to have expired after 90 days. There is a senate bill that would control 5/6-APB along with a dozen other stimulants and cannabinoids, but it has not yet passed into law. See [http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2013/0294](http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2013/0294) . (SB 294). (thanks CM) (last updated May 14, 2013)
