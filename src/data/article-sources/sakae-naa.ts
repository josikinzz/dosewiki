## Subjective Experience

Although sometimes used as a substitute for kratom, in terms of effect the
similarities are disputed. On initial use, some years ago, I found it to be extremely
weak in comparison; too weak to form a judgement. This applied to both oral use
(10g as a tea) and intake via a vaporiser.

I have returned to this for two reasons. The first is that it took a number of
experiments to actually experience anything worthwhile from kratom; hence the
feeling that I should give this at least one more punt before writing it off. The second
is that I continue to encounter Internet reports which claim that it actually delivers,
albeit in a mild form.

A relevant factor is also that I am not a great connoisseur of the opioid type of
venture. The overall ride, as I have always experienced it (mood lift, relative
euphoria/happiness, sedation, nausea/headache), has never been compelling, or
particularly rewarding as a whole.

It’s fair to say that I enter this exercise with fairly low expectations.

Re-visiting the Internet I notice frequent claims that farmers in Thailand and
Myanmar “chew or smoke the leaves for their sedative properties”. Indeed, a
number of sources cite smoking as the preferred method.

My course is set accordingly.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I fill the bowl of a small bong, light, take a large hit, and hold. I then
repeat the exercise, twice. It is quite an easy smoke. [4:20pm].
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:05 There is a change of headspace, albeit a very mild one. It is the
gentlest of sedations, with a slightly dreamy edge. I feel comfortable as I sit at
my desk typing these notes.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:15 I feel much the same as I did on 5 minutes. The tranquillising effect
has neither strengthened nor weakened. The shift from normality is extremely
subtle, but real.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 To determine if I can take this any further I re-load the bowl and take
another couple of hits. Again, it is nice and easy on the lungs. Within a couple
of minutes the dreamy heady edge is back to where it was immediately
following the first blast.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This is moderately pleasing, and assuming that expectations are not set
unreasonably high, provides a positive mellow ambience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:35 I am experiencing a general disposition of contentedness, which has
replaced my slightly edgy and bored mood of 40 minutes ago.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 The intensity has faded, but the vibe still lingers at a slightly lower
level. At this point lightly chilled is probably a good way of describing it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I am approaching base, although some residue sedation is still in play.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 I feel almost at baseline, but my background mood continues to be
relaxed and calm.
\`\`\`
I didn’t find this to be energising, as some forum posters suggest, nor particularly
like kratom. This certainly applied to intake via smoking.

For me, as consumed above, it induced the mildest of anxiolytic states, but with a
positive and dreamy aura. Having stated this, it may well be one for which the use of
fresh leaves presents a different proposition in terms of potency, particularly if
consumed in an authentic setting.

Overall, I found this to be more agreeable than I had anticipated. Pleasant is
probably the best word I can find.

## Summary
Combretum quadrangulare, or commonly known with its Thai name sakae naa (สะแกนา) is a species of flowering plant in the family Combretaceae. It is a small tree that grouws up to 10 m high. The tree grows wildly or is planted in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand.
The tree is planted along the banks of rivers or arroyos for firing. It is found throughout Thailand especially in open, wet places. Studies of the chemical constituents of this plant have revealed that alcoholic and other extracts from the roots and seeds could kill earthworms.

## Description
Tree, 5-10m high: young branchlets acutely quad-rangular or very narrowly quadrialate. Leaves simple, opposite, elliptic or obovate, 3–8 cm wide, 6–16 cm long: petiole acutely ridged. Inflorescence in terminal and axillary spike; flower small, yellowish white. Fruit dry, thinly quadrialate: seed brownish red, ellipsoid, 4- angled.

## Chemistry
Combretol is an O-methylated flavonol, found in C. quadrangulare. The plant also contains the gallic acid derivative, 1-O-galloyl-6-O-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy)benzoyl-beta-D-glucose.
