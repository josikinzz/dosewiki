This one has potentially surfaced and it looks extremely intriguing. Very similar structurally to both MXE & MXPr. I ordered some and it has shipped so I'm excited to test it out and compare to the aforementioned. Will send off for analytical confirmation as well.

God super excited to get my hands on this. Also really wanna track down 3-Cl-PCP that's come on the market recently. So many dissos that have come out lately! (tho very hit or miss so far tbh)

3-cl-pcp?. Sounds nice. I guess 3-cl-pce should be a thing too, isn´t?

Halogenated PCM analogues have proven fruitful, the only halogenated PCP analogue I've tried so far was just ok and 3-Cl-PCP may be similar. Halogenated PCE analogues haven't been tried yet but I think it's a promising avenue for development. I would expect a much lower potency though.

And then we have the PCPr and now the PCiPr backbone to build analogues from! The reflex seems to always try a 3-MeO + 2'-Oxo substitution because MXE but I think 3-MeO alone, 3-HO, and 2'-Oxo substitutions should be attempted for all the arylcyclohexylamine bases. I think it would be a good way to find fruitful compounds! Halogenated analogues and halogenated + 2'-Oxo analogues should be tried too (though PCP and perhaps even PCPr and PCiPr may have too much steric hindrance for a 2'-Oxo).


Compounds I would love to see:

2-Br-PCM

2-Br-2'-Oxo-PCM

3-MeO-PCM

3-F-PCM

3-Cl-PCM

3-F-PCE

3-Cl-PCE

3-HO-2'-Oxo-PCE

2-Cl-2'-Oxo-PCE

2-F-2'-Oxo-PCE

3-F-PCPr

3-Cl-PCPr

3-MeO-PCPr

3-HO-PCPr

2'-Oxo-PCPr

3-HO-2'-Oxo-PCPr

2-Cl-2'-Oxo-PCPr

3-F-PCiPr

3-Cl-PCiPr

3-MeO-PCiPr

3-HO-PCiPr

2'-Oxo-PCiPr

3-HO-2'-Oxo-PCiPr

2-Cl-2'-Oxo-PCiPr

3-Br-PCP

2'-Oxo-PCP (?)

2-Cl-2'-Oxo-PCP (???)

3-MeO-2'-Oxo-PCP (????)


I don't know how possible the synthesis of any of these would be or what their stability would be like but its fun to imagine.....

Great post, I think it's so exciting that the ACH dissociatives are becoming seriously explored.  The fact that MXE was possible points to there being a lot of great possibilities in this avenue of exploration.  There are already some other great ones (DCK, MXPr is quite nice too).  MXiPr could be a real winner.  Or any of the other possibilities, that you listed and that no one has even thought of so far.

I've heard the oxo PCP analogues see synthetically inaccessible but I've never gotten a good explanation why.


3-MeO-PCPr did hit the market briefly back in those halcyon days before the UK blanket ban

Plugging MXiPr gives a good rush. The plateau isn't particularly interesting. Did some yesterday but will just give my results of today (all doses were IR administration). Started with 40mg, then 25mg an hour later. At some point I did a shot of 20mg MXiPr and 13mg DPT, which was completely immersive. It felt very amphibian, reptilian when combined with the music I was listening to. I lost track of time and this state persisted for about an hour according to my girlfriend watching tv next to me. At some point later I did another shot of 20mg MXiPr and 10mg of 2C-C which slowly developed into a quite interesting experience involving all of the senses. Going outside I had the impression of being in a lush, tropical landscape (for reference I'm currently in the dreary midwest).


I haven't tried to push to see if a hole is present and I doubt that I will. This stuff seems like it would be a most excellent launching pad for about any psychedelic. Relative to MXE there is much less peripheral action in the body, which is a good thing in my book. In fact, this substance feels quite smooth in the body. I've had a couple very stressful things arise in the past couple of days but the MXiPr has provided a steadfast point of reference. While it may lack the transcendent qualities of MXE, it seems a solid addition to the dissociative lover's armamentarium nonetheless.

Thanks for the report, this is the first I've heard. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Did you try MXPr?  How does it compare to that, if so?  One of the things I love about dissos is how they can make amazing launching pads for psychedelics.  MXE is still my favorite one (both as a standalone and as a launching pad), but I might acquire some of this to try out how it works in that regard.

I tried MXPr 4 times last year and actually liked it a lot. While I don't think I combined it with anything, I reached a hole on a couple of those occasions.


The MXiPr is definitely more potent with a longer duration relative to MXPr. Actually I would say MXiPr is about equipotent to MXE. MXiPr's come-up has a euphoric rush for the first 30-60 minutes, but then it settled into a strong, sedating dissociation on the plateau which wasn't really interesting or immersive. Once I brought in a touch of psychedelics it was much more interesting/fun and the music enhancement became very pronounced.


Some acute tolerance was in play because yesterday was the second day in a row I tried the MXiPr, plus I used deschloroketamine and nitrous the day before that. I took some NAC this morning for recovery. My plan is to wait a week and then try again with 30mg MXiPR and 20mg of DPT, then an hour or two later to add an MXiPr booster with either some 2C-C or 2C-D.

Will add that I find it rather compulsive, probably enhanced by the rapid come-up, still this one is like MXE in the habituation department for myself.

Couldn't resist after reading few very positive experiences and ordered 3g, hope it'll deliver. If not, I'm pretty sure it's longer version of MXPr which I also liked very much. Win win

Tried 20mg oral/sublingual with a half a bottle of wine. Wasnt really anywhere enough to blast off. Felt like a light warm blanket threaded through very light dissociation.


I have a bit of disso tolerance id say, but nothing extreme. If i were to hit a point or two of k id almost certainly hole.


Kind of felt like a 2f experience, but with more warmth than k. Can faintly understand some nitrous comparisons, though, no where even close to as intense. 


Definitely warmer and sedating. Overall, enjoyable experience, but will need to shovel more to explore the depths. Hues were golden. You definitely get light saturation.

I think 30mg with a redose a couple hours in would be a good way to go about it. Based on the few reports about it and my own experience with MXE and MXPr

I got a gram of this about a month ago and have experimented with high doses.  


This one may leave you in a hole state but highly mobile at high doses.  May not he conducive to apartment living lol.  "10 minutes of top of lungs maniacal laughter you say?"  Well I certainly don't remember THAT girlfriend! LoL.  


It is a fickle mistress as well, either divinely inspired states or I have experienced hell and the apocalypse for periods of time.  


I would say MXPr is less potent than MXE by 10% or so and is much friendlier to high dose experiences.  MXiPr is a much more manic wild ride that can bite you if you push it too hard. I would say this material is more potent than MXE.  I would highly recommend not pushing MXiPr any further than 100mg cumulative for an evening.  Recovery time is much longer than MXPr for certain.


Even after I get thoroughly terrified  I find myself reaching for the bag after a week to roll the dice again!  I would actually highly recommend a sitter for going deep with MXiPr.  It seems to be alot further towards the PCP end of the "naked and outside" spectrum compared to MXE or MXPr.


Lower spectrum doses this material is quite like MXE in character. 


The batch I have also smells like a freshly opened booster pack of pokemon cards.  Nostalgia mmmmm

Just got my 3g today, I'm so excited. That's weird what you said about MXPr tho, I had to do 60mg + 60mg to a nice hole. And it was lasting not so long. I want to say tolerance but my other doses are:


13-15mg 3-ho-pcp

25-30mg 3-meo-pce


Which dose should I start with this one do you think? 


Also, is posting photo here permitted? Because I wanted to see of everyone has same batch.

3 time less potent then OPCE, down to earth almost iboga style, may be fun a la MXE in cocktails, 6/10, better than MXPR that is anesthetic and empty.

Initial thoughts, it's way more potent than MXPr. I'm so glad I got 3g![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)


Peaking currently. I am really really loving it. And I just did 20mg. This is definitely going to be my favorite haahahah


My doses for other dissos for comparison 


3-ho-pcp 12-15mg

3-meo-pce 25-30mg

MXPr 60mg + 60mg (hole)

DCK 60mg + 60mg (hole)


It's like they took the good qualities of above mentioned dissos and put then in one. Lol I hope I'm making sense,  the more I write to higher I got.

There's good reason to believe that there's only one batch of MXiPr (and MXPr for that matter) at the moment.

After two days of trying it, I think I can easily say that it's the best dissociative around right now, imo of course.

Earlier on this page a scent was reported to this batch. It might not be a good idea to inject then.

Well, most drugs have a scent, it doesn't necessarily mean impurities are present.  However the MXPr (from the same source, I imagine the same chemist too, but maybe not) clearly had some impurities as evidenced by people doing acetone washes and getting a less wet/smelly product and losing some weight.  So I wouldn't count on there not being impurities.  Would be nice if someone could get an analysis done.

Thanks for the heads up, as great as this is sounding I think I'll maybe leave it a while like the meo-pcp chemicals. 4-meo-pcp was particularly dangerous when it was a scented batch.

I also did an acetone wash on my MXIPr, because of the smell and the light headache I got in my first experiment.

After the washing, the scent went almost completely away and the trips feel cleaner now.

Very little material was lost in the washing, maybe 10-15 mg from 0.5 grams.

the scent I and everyone that has tried concludes is that it smells/tastes of burnt plastic. Taste is much more noticeable than smell, but smell is still pretty defined in character. Trying again, it was impossible to sleep on and had similar semi-manic thought musings as I find myself having with 2f-dck (k gives me this too, but too....rapid?)


What is unfortunate about mxipr is that it doesnt seem that great for "turning up". K and 2f are great for this. Instead, mxipr feels much more like a chill and watch movies ordeal. I am a bit curious how it would do in a mix, for some reason it feels like it could add a really nice sun-behind-clouds type atmosphere, perhaps that could be the better purpose.

There were rumblings of MXE having serotonin activity, too.  I used to love combining MDMA and MXE, but you only need like a third of the dose of MDMA, it definitely makes it a lot stronger, and changes it.  If you try, be careful and try taking a lot less MDMA.

Pretty sure MXE will come back. Its just too good to dissapear forever. Some smart chemist will synth 10 pounds, do a social work distributing it and will buy a little mansion with the earnings


Dont know when, but it will


In the meantime, I remember the MXE analisys book by vortech calling to do an association or church to research it legally.


Fucking Vortech, always havig great ideas. Wherever he is now, there must be plenty of MXE available there

Tried mxipr up the ol sniff hole and, I gotta say, it was quite nice. Really got some nitrous sensations to start then peaked into a nice light disso state thst felt warm and familiar. It was quite enchanting. 25mg in one go roughly. I think this is one of those that gets better after the first few times

Well, we could bet on which one will come back first: MXE or the Messiah ![😄](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f604.png)

Until then, I think mxipr is the most interesting substitute we have on hand (for MXE, I mean)

Had a new experience with the mxipr, this time with some 2f and alcohol. Honestly, was probably a bit of a dumb move as I was feeling quite intoxicated on alcohol alrready, but what was to follow was the most insane disso experience i have had to date. I was on a completely different planet and plane of dimension every few seconds. Incredibly textured and vibrant and colorful, but digitally choppy layered on to waves. It was like the chaotic madness following k+psych at the tail end, exceot rather than being more of things at the edge of your visiom, i was completely engulfed in it. Incredible experience, but i will probably take a break from dissos now. Had a awakening aspect to it one might come to expect from a strong acid trip

This one is a bit like the dissociative version of bungee jumping at high doses.  It seems physically safe but holy shit,  have a solid trip sitter that has done dissos before 


Over all it has helped me, it has made me confront my own mortality and shown me what I want to do in life. I would just highly suggest a trip sitter if you take high doses.


up to 50mg seems rather comfortable quite MXE like


higher doses (for instance 86mg at once first dose) The "hole" is often terrifying, apocalypse, trips through hell type stuff. Also, mobile so please have a trip sitter if you plan on going deep into this one.


I have tried high doses several times in the 70-86mg range and taken approx 150mg-165mg maximum in a night (stepping up to "desired" state) and reaching MXiPr's hole state has generally been a very scary experience. After the peak subsides it has this divine mystical quality though. Could just be my current frame of mind and I have been abstinent from dissociatives for about a year. My tolerance is impossible to really gauge right now I suppose.


Over all, it is certainly worth a try. I have been through many high dose dissociative experiences and this one has truly scared the shit out of me. It has helped me confront my own mortality and left me wanting more however, so it is odd. I reiterate, have a (preferably experienced, sober trip buddy) going deep.


Not for the new or faint of heart.

So, not sure what to think about this one yet. Could the ones that have tested this one do a quick comparison VS MXE in terms of quality, potency and duration?

Hard to say, as I haven't done MXE in years now. I am going to give it another go at the end of this month and I'll try to make a decent trip report, for science.

I need to get myself some acetone then and do the wash!  I got 2g, if I lose 100-120mg, I'm fine with that.  I am thinking about trying 25mg today, in a short bit.  No acetone yet, so will do one trial without washing and then will be able to compare.

Oh wait that's MXiPR, not DMXE as I thought when I started posting.  Anyone know if the MXiPR needs a wash, too?

Wow, you're not lying about the burnt plastic taste and smell.  Very intense and strange smelling, same taste.  Kinda sketchy, I will certainly acetone wash it tomorrow.  But for now, I just ate 25mg. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Here is a mini report of my first MXiPR trial I had tonight.  Clif notes: fun, nice, but subtle and more or less uneventful.  I will raise the dose to probably double next time.  Similar to MXPr at this level, but more euphoric and fun.


**11-1-2020 - MXiPR, first trial**​

6:20pm (T+0:00) - Ate 25mg.  The powder is white, chalky and clumpy, with a strong and distinctive burnt plastic smell, and taste.  Someone reported that they acetone washed theirs and lost a little bit, but not too much, and it got rid of the sketchy plastic smell and taste and made the experience cleaner.  But, I didn't want to wait, so although I need to get some acetone and do that, I went ahead with my first trial anyway.  The taste actually wasn't as bad as the smell, it was bitter and left a plasticy aftertaste but it was bearable, and I just washed it down with a finger dip of peanut butter (the best bad taste eraser I know of).  It tasted and smelled a lot different from MXPr and especially from MXE.  MXE's taste varied widely based on batch, but the best stuff tasted a lot like a weird slightly bitter sea salt.  Anyway I digress.


6:40pm (T+0:20) - Coming up, it is a moderately euphoric rushy come-up, I feel very nice mentally and physically.  I felt it first at around 10 minutes in, very quickly.  Watching some TV with my girlfriend.


7:00pm (T+0:40) - I have settled, seemingly, into a light, pleasant dissociative state.  I feel the slightest wonkiness when walking, but not much, and I have to look for it.  Functioning and conversing is easy, I do not feel inebriated, really.  There is a nice body feeling, and a good mood lift and relaxation.  Surprisingly, I seem to have gotten more tired, rather than stimulated, but that could be because I played a music festival last night and haven't slept since 2 nights ago, and spent all of yesterday lifting things, setting up a stage, and playing 4 and a half hours of music.  I am thinking I will redose 25mg more, but first I am going to make some dinner.  I feel as if I will not be inhibited in any way from cooking, I feel perfectly coordinated and with it.


7:45pm (T+1:25) - Just redosed 20mg more, orally, bringing my total ingested to 45mg.  Made some food, I am quite hungry and looking forward to eating it (pasta with vodka sauce).  Enjoying watching TV with my girlfriend.  Not very wonky at all at this dose so far, but very pleasant and more pronounced/defined in character than MXPr.  But notably, with 25mg of MXE, I would have been feeling the magic, a light wonk, beautiful thought process, delicate vision, and insightful, inspirational mindset.  I feel none of these things, not yet anyway.


9:25pm (T+3:05) - The redose did increase the effects somewhat, but less than I expected.  Actually it reminds me of my MXPr trial a lot, except more at-home feeling in my organism, more functional (MXPr is functional at the doses I've taken, but this stuff feels like my brain is working quickly, like I might even use it as a performance enhancer for something like coding or playing music).  The redose came on pretty smoothly and transparently, to the point that I forgot I took it until I got up to do some stuff.


I just got a message from an old, dear friend, in fact my oldest good friend from Bluelight.  I had been worried about him and missed him, and thankfully he is doing really well.  This makes me smile a lot.  


10:15pm (T+3:55) - Upon reflection, I have spent the last little bit telling my girlfriend that I love her, and expressing feelings of closeness and companionship with some Bluelight members and staff, so perhaps MXiPR is having more of an effect than I thought!  Hehe.  I mean I am a loving guy anyway but I feel a little gushy right now.  It's funny because I don't really feel all that high, but I just have a beaming feeling of love and happiness emanating from my chest.


12:00am (T+5:40) - I've been reading and Bluelighting since the last entry.  I took a few hits off my delta-8 THC vape a bit ago, which basically just made me a little high on delta-8, didn't seem to interact with the MXiPR.  Been having a nice time, for sure.  But I really never felt dissociated, at all, or barely at least, and then only for a brief period of time.  It was similar to my low dose MXPr experience in that way.  Compared to MXPr, MXiPR tonight was more fun, more euphoric, and more positive-focused emotionally.  Like with MXPr, it seems like at this dosage level, orally, the meat of the effects consisted primarily of a very active and inspired mind, and a looseness in my thoughts that somewhat lowers my inhibitions and slightly alters my inner monologue.  I will say this dose of MXE would be much more of an experience and would be moderately dissociating.


I still feel it, but it is subtle.  In fact it never got above subtle, and I'm even willing to believe it could be simply that I am high on delta-8 THC and I am associating that feeling with what I felt from MXiPR, and the drug has worn off entirely by now.  It's hard to tell which.  


Next time I will take a larger initial dose, and a larger redose.  Also I will acetone wash some of it and see how much is lost and clean up the product.  Hopefully get rid of that sketchy smell/taste.  I will probably try plugging it when I want to go for an actual powerful dissociative experience.   I also realize that each dissociative I have grown to enjoy, the first handful of times I took it, I didn't care for it, and/or didn't get the effects that started to develop with a little more experience with the drug.  The first half dozen times I took MXE, I actively disliked it, it made me feel dysphoric and weird and anxious.  I kept trying though because of all the MXE love from friends and Bluelight posters,  Then one day it clicked for some reason and it was pure magic, and from then on it was among the most magical feeling drugs I've ever taken.  I keep hoping that something will come along that has something comparable to MXE's level of quality.


I am going to compile the first 3 trials' notes together and submit an actual trip report.  Hoping to get a medium-level dosage and heavy dosage to compare.  I still have to do the medium and heavy dloses with MXPr, too.  And I definitely want to try DMXE.

My latest trial of Mxipr was the most profound. I hit three 30mg lines in roughly 1-1.5h intervals. The first two lines took me to the wonderful warm disso state, colors very saturated and goldish red hues to them, but still in the plane of reality we all know. Lights are more noticeable, nothing terribly profound in terms of the mind surfing state, but a bit akin to what reminds me of when im on the tail end of 2f. They say dissos generally take a few goes to get comfortable with it and understand it, and i agree here.


When I hit the third line, this is when things got crazy. This was clearly my hole threshhold. Everything immediately started to progressively fold in on itself, it starts with the pictures. Every frame starts looking a bit stranger and stranger and with each fold and wipe, my mind, perhaps in anxiety, but also perhaps in an almost amnesiac state puts me in the mindset that ive broken through and completely uncovered the true reality, life has been a lie and im going deeper and deeper towards the truth.


How would I get to doing work on Monday? I wouldn't be, there is no existence where work has any matter or meaning. I constantly fall deeper and deeper, its like the "tripping over your thoughts" aspect of a psychadelic trip, but exponetiated. I even think about my first psychadelic trip where I was convinced I could only think the thoughts to communicate on the biological plane where my body was, but the rate at which I was following into this new reality, that concept almost seemed like a joke. I was falling in so deep and so fast, i could only think of the word "positivity" and " chill" and hope for the best.


Every fold, there was an increasing profoundness and increasing realization that the grasp of that planes reality was false, each fold i would realize the last was a lie. I fell deeper and deeper until I realized that this constant state of chaos was my new reality forever. Just being a state of consciousness in this ever shifting state was my reality forever and I had to accept that I was nothing, but in being nothing...I was everything.


I was chosen.... I was god. I was the energy of being to create worlds within the space of infinite everything.... And it was beautiful and I was ready to accept this existence.


At this point I slowly started gaining consciousness into the real world, I see my girlfriends face, although a bit unfamiliar. She turns on music (we were previously watching a movie, but felt it would be good to put on something calming). It was like I was being born and she was the first face I saw and she seemingly knew of this new uncovered truth all along...seemingly communicating "are you ready to be in this new reality?" I could only tell her I love her and hug her. I was ready. It was profound. It was beautiful. Everything was still warping all around me at this point, I didnt really have a body, just a consciousness.


Eventually things settled down and I was slowly grasping at coming back to this plane of reality. I asked her what had happened as I had no idea how i had behaved. I had apparently been communicating with her, albeit a bit nonsensically during the time, but i had no recollection. At a point i was exclaiming how great everything was and even cried in elation.


There was a greatly spiritual sense after the experience. I had a realization that our consciousnesses are just all part of a greater singular consciousness.


The irony...dissociatives make life harder to operate in and yet the hole led me to realize thats all life was. From an infinity of dimensions and space and being, life was just something created to make operating more difficult, but it brings structure and a platform to experience being in a non completely infinite space of energy.


There was a profound positivity following the experience. It has made me want to be a better person and has had a positive afterglow on life. Life is just a structured level of being. You can choose to do what you want with it and eventually we will all return to the singular state of consciousness.


Ive had complete ego death before from psychadelics, but this felt more spiritual. Also, if anyone has taken nitrous with psychadelics...you feel and understand that the"crossing" of all senses is exponentiated as you come off the nitrous...a curve downwards towards from infinite crossing back to that of the normal trip. When I was falling deeper into the hole, it was like experiencing each of those levels, but more immersed and of course instead of a curve downward from infinity to 0, it was 0 to infinity. Also, I was actually in those different planes rather than just experiencing the senses...the difference I can only explain as being more...3d than the 2d experience of nitrous with psychadelics


All I can say is wow. Mxipr is truly special and in a completely different category than ketamine/2f.


I will also say, this is not for the faint of heart, i would only recommend this for people who have experience with holing, perhaps be ok with dying, and you should 100% have a trip sitter if you plan on holing as its not debilitating and you can move around...i didnt get up and run or anything, but it seems like there should be precautions.


Wowowow.

I see.  I preferred oral for MXE actually, well, rectal is the best for holing, but oral is the best overall, for me.  But with MXPr I feel like oral dosing is just weak, and I feel the same might be true of MXiPr.


That taste and smell though... makes me wonder what impurity is causing that, since someone said they did an acetone wash and got rid of it.  The MXPr, too... not the same, but it's wet and people claimed that an acetone wash cleans it up but loses some of it, too.  That suggests a fairly substantial amount of impurity.

Edited:

Fwiw, I was going to recommend using baked Epsom salts is to dry your acetone, but then I read [this](https://www.bluelight.org/xf/threads/anhydrous-acetone-via-anhydrous-magnesium-sulphate.409908/). While we're talking acetone washing, I really recommend doing that to your MDMA. [@treespls](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/530716/)

Yeeup.


I believe I know who you're talking about, and have a half g on the way. Can update asap.


I'm a heavy disso vet but have been out of everything for quite some time. I even loved reg MXP  back in 2014, believe it or not lmao. Really excited to see some better ones comin over here, though.


I've tried O-PCE, DCK, K, ephenidine, dephenidine, LOTS of DXM back when, n LOTS of NOS. Hopefully I can recall enough of my experiences to make an accurate comparison, if there is one at all to me.


SO excited to see what this bad bitch has to offer. I was one to really push O-PCE when I had it, with up to 100mg in a night shared w/ a bud. I assume it was the pretzel, though, so shit was impure. (Was sold to me AS O-PCE) Was still pretty nutty, though.


I was getting into RC's when MXE was around, even in the north. But it was only for the first few weeks before it peaced, n I ended up grabbing some 4-AcO-DMT instead. Really wish I could've experienced that warmth. I used to mix a lil down w/ my ket in lines, just to give it that extra sedation n warmth. Was such a nice combo. I'm seriously excited if this shit gets that sedating, since I've been on methadone for time n quit doin all that extra shit. Would be nice to have that combo in one.

Nope, unfortunately. Wayyyyy other side of the pond. Where we would normally never see this kinda stuff (Basically all disso analogues are illegal. Even dephenidines [Good riddance of MT-45]). Honestly really surprised the guy is cool w/ havin it up. I looked at the list, and it doesn't really list anything other than specifically Phencyclidine and Ketamine. \(._.)/


Regardless, I will update this thread tomorrow with first experiences! Expect a few reports from me, and I'll hopefully have two other experiences from research assistants to throw up. Not very many on this guy, so I figure I'd try n populate it a lil, n with some differences! Personally, I've never been able to get plugging to work very well, but was always using the fokin 5ml's n shit. So I bought some 1mls in anticipation of the MXiPr. My first experience, I'll probably just end up insufflating, but I will try for a hard-hitting dose n boof it this week. Either tuesday or the day after.


Unbelievably excited for this stuff after reading what there is!

Can’t speak for [@InfoBlue](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/369895/) but I’m on the other side lol ... Canada, where I thought there was a blanket ban on ach dissos.. not up on the exact wording of the law but glad to see there’s more than just tiletamine and dxm.


Been a fan of dissos since I first start experimenting (years and years ago... damn I’m old ya) and with promising reports I don’t wanna miss the boat on this as I did with others

I honestly don't even care if it's as good as MXE. I just want a half decent sedating disso, that I can get above board and pay taxes for. I'm just so tired of dealing w/ those other people, n basically exclusively do RC's now. If this shit is even decent, I'll be happy n set..

Holy fuck, does it ever. Smells like if someone didn't like cilantro. Gross.


I'm wondering if it's all the same batch, and that it's just impurities. Sucks, though cuz I love insufflating dissos. I'm almost scared to with how awful this shit smells

[@tired of crap](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/131794/)


So, first thoughts of our mutual friend's product.


Fucking cilantro. That's all I can describe the smell as. You know how sometimes people say cilantro tastes like soap? I'm personally not one of them, love the damn shit, but it smells like what I think someone who had that whole thing would taste cilantro as. Real fucking weird.


Before I weighed out my 14mg, I took a tiny bit of etiz. So any subjective affects from this particular run through will have that intertwined.


I've only insufflated about a third of the weighed powder, as a lil tester. Definitely should've done more of an allergy with that retched smell. Oh well, was 10 mins ago n not much atm.

Initial insufflation is smooth, but once it gets to the part where your nasal cavities enter your throat, it feels gross as hell. I think boofing will probably be my main ROA w/ this guy. 1mls aren't in yet though, unfortunately.


About 15 minutes in to a couple mg dose, I'm feeling slightly dissociated. However, the etizolam I took is kicking in as well, I imagine.


Should probably dose my methadone, soon too. Curious to see if that has any interactions.


I think it probably is all the same batch, if ya'll have the same smells as me.

No, quite different.  It's hard to describe.  DMT doesn't smell like plastic to me.  This smells like some sort of industrial rubber that's scorched.

This was my first time performing an acetone wash and my setup is certainly lacking, but overall I'm satisfied with the result.

Washed product hardly smells at all, and I lost about 15% of the weight, which is a lot better than I expected (I think a lot of it got stuck to the filter). 

Now that I'm less sketched out by it, I think I will try an oral dose sometime this week.

Also, if that's the case then that is an incredibly disappointing and shoddy synth on the part of the distributor. That should have been sent right back to the lab, not on to the end user. Tsk tsk

I’m with [@Pfafffed](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/369391/) 

If the smell is so prominent and significantly reduced with a simple wash it is disconcerting that this was sent out to customers. As much as I want to try this I think I’ll pass, at least until another batch makes the rounds

Holy shit this stuff is absolutely wild. If the chem itself doesn't actually smell like that, then holy fuck is it ever potent by weight. I hit about a 26mg boof, and was begging to come back down to reality through a message with my friend. Problem is, I don't even remeber the trip at all. I'd been doing 20mg boofs the whole day with LOADS of fun, literally exactly what I wanted out of this chem. But because I dosed that etiz, I just straight up can not remember most of them.


Oh well. I haven't done an acetone wash on anything yet n am scared to fuck this product up considering how expensive it is. Guess I'll just shoot for a bluelight guide, cuz this stuff is fucking awesome n I'm be putting it in my body one way or another.


I'm just curious that my smell is o-so different than other's. Because plastic is not at all what I get from mine. N taking another lil wiff of it, I can almost barely smell it? Very weird.


Update, yeah my atuff is most likely impure as well, and the source would not like to comment on the smell. When I threw this current dose on the spoon, there was one rock, with the rest being powder. The powder all stayed that white colour, while the little rock darkened a shade or two. Very odd. Will break it up and update.


Another update, this stuff has got some serious anti-depressant afterglow. After my two day crazy-ass binge, I woke up this morning feeling unusually energized, happy, motivated, and all around awesome.

I have the same batch that everyone has and haven’t noticed any alarming smell coming off of it. I’ve certainly had stinkier chems. AMT and 2 fma come to mind. 

I tried snorting this and just like MXE I can barely feel it going down. Despite being about 3x the amount of powder I usually sniff with 3 meo/ho PCx’s this had less sting and drip.

The high was nice but mild, nothing mind blowing. I did 35mg then another 25mg within the hour. It was reminiscent of a low dose of MXE or Ketamine. I need to go further to see what unique characteristics this has to offer. The body high was relaxing, warm and pleasant and the head high mildly euphoric and clear headed. I ended up adding 10mg of 3 ho pcp and had a fun wonky night after that. 

i have a high dissociative tolerance from using a lot of 3 ho pcp in recent months, I know that played in to why it wasn’t as strong as I’d expected.  Then again, my first time doing MXE I did three 30mg doses in one night, I’ve always enjoyed a sightly stronger dissociative experience, especially with dissociative that you can hole on.

I’m going to try 50mg as an initial dose next time and add one or two redoses at 20-30mg

AMT is definitely a worse smell, but I like how 2-FMA smells.  Honestly I think perception of drug smells is a rather variable thing.  I've heard people describe the smell of DMT way differently than my experience of it is, too.


That's crazy though that you don't notice much smell, I know for a fact we both have the same batch, Delsyd (we probably all do, besides), and to me it absolutely reeks, like I open my drug box and am slapped in the face with the smell, my whole closet that the box is in (closed) smells a little like it to me.

I didn't notice much of a smell either until I put it into solution. Once in solution, MXiPr has an extremely distinct smell. I don't know what to compare it to, but it's almost pleasant in a strange way.

Yeah, I don't notice much of a smell from 2—FMA either. AMT and AET are both scatoles - it's their nature to smell like shit. 


The first time I vaporized DMT, it was lab synthed and smelled just like burning plastic. Subsequent use of botanically extracted DMT has always smelled quite pleasant, though.

Hey folks..


Got a gram of this in Canada today.


Just did an unknown amount I'll guess 40-50mg under the tongue.


It made my tongue and mouth so glad damn numb.


It's consistency is slightly pebbly powder. Numbs the mouth greatly don't think it's caustic though.


I'm slowly slipping into a warm feeling ..


In twenty mins I'll snort a line and see where I end up, if the sublingual original dose dose not hit hard enough - I did do 250mg DMXE via IM yesterday.


Also took about 1mg Flunitrazolam twelve hours ago.


As the time goes on I feel more warmth coming on. Feels very good and content. Music is so nice sounding. Wow.


Have lots of experience with old school MXE, pcp analogs, tons of dissos. I need a scale so that I can weigh out proper doses to do some detailed trip reports for the community.


I've been in the scene for fifteen years almost and stilll going strong contributing to the cause.


A very good mood boost experience right now. I'm in a very happy mood and my feet are tingly. My tolerance may be a bit high so I will do a nasal dose soon, and then take a week break and follow up with more reports.


I have five or six dissos in my possession right now, some of which are this, 3-ho-pce, DMXE, O-pce. Various routes of administration but I am planning on doing more IM injections once I get a scale. Have a few needles now though but 25g leave my muscles hurting day later maybe not doing proper technique.


Yeah I'm gonna have to do a higher nasal dose of this then I'll put it away for tolerance to wane. The earlier benzo use and prior intramuscular DMXE use yesterday probably has made my tolerance sky high.

I holed on MXiPr a couple days ago in combination with the perfect amount of edibles and nitrous and it was amazing.


I'm not particularly experienced with dissos; I've holed on ketamine and combined DXM up to a second plat with a number of psychs including DMT. No tolerance. Ketamine has been known to make me puke from motion sickness so I took a ginger pill to be sure (and didnt experience any nausea). I didnt measure out my doses, instead opting to sniff small lines and wait for the come up to start before taking my next small line. To be honest, this definitely feels like the way to go for me.


I had been chilling and feeling the drug out for an hour already. The music I was listening to gave the perfect mood as I sat back in my chair. I hit my last line and took a breath out of my nitrous canister. The next few minutes slipped by me as I floated deeper and deeper into a dream, not even aware of how far dissociated I was until I was no more. Full ego death, moments of eternity, impossible to describe. Coming back, I began to grapple with the universe around me observing everything in a vacuum starting with time. A multidimensional mesh of time that I happened to be moving through linearly. Why? I began to question who I was. Everything I had once known and taken for granted was now an independent variable I had to rediscover. I saw myself as a being with aspirations and saw the paths through time I could take to accomplish them. I redosed again and repeated the process with no magic lost.


I sobered up enough and decided I needed some sleep I crawled into bed around 3AM, around 2 hours from when I started and 1 hour since I started going hard. I think I fell into a very light sleep here until 7AM where I woke up to me stroking my own arm (I recently got tattooed in that spot so it felt good). My head was spinning and pounding and I was dehydrated. I drank some water and that really helped my headache. I eventually managed to fall asleep until 2PM where I spent the rest of my day tired. A lot of the trip was hard to remember. I'd probably dose sooner next time.


TL;DR:

This might be my favourite new drug, definitely favourite dissociative of the three I've tried (lol). Seems to be sedating enough to hole and chill out on. Heavier doses can lead to ego death, at the very least with the aid of cannabis and nitrous. Seemed less likely to make me feel nauseous than Ketamine but this might've been the ginger I took. Will definitely be continuing with this chem.

So what’s the consensus on oral/sublingual with this fine goddess?


it seems fairly potent and I’ll be volumetrically portioning it out (no scale I usually get pellets or blotter)


I’d like to dissolve 2g into 30ml of PG. will probably start with a 33.33 mg dose or .5ml of the solution sublingually. For tolerance I have basically none, only do dissos like once a week tops and 100mg of ket will usually hole me.


edit: also anyone trialed mixing this with a 4-sub tryptamine yet?

Possible serious warning.


I boofed basically the whole half gram in about two days and had some very weird side effects on the last night. And mind you, I had not washed any of this stuff so it could just be from the impurities being fucked or some.


I was staying the night at a buddy's house, n had done my last dose before he picked me up. The night was awesome, but I was dosing tons of etiz and drinking too. I have permanently damaged GABA receptors, so for some reason I'm able to eat straight powder n not black out. ANYWAY


While trying to sleep, I had the worst muscle jerks I've ever had in my entire life. Worse than EXTREME benzo withdrawal (more than seizure level)


I was completely unable to sleep due to this and ended up taking my last 15mg or whatever it was of etiz, just for some relief. The jerks were something like my legs shooting STRAIGHT up. I was constantly uncomfortable and changed where I was sleeping almost every 15 minutes. Actually at one point sleeping beside my other buddy's air mattress n he pet my head thinking it was his cat LMAO


anyway. Really fucking weird, n with some other chems involved who can really say. Just wanted to relay my experience.


Stay safe, all. I will most likely be ordering more, but washing it.

Not at all! Funny since usually pot will make me a little uncomfortable and would make ketamine feel a little weird and funky (not necessarily in a bad way). With MXiPr the hole and ego death was welcome. Even if it was uncomfortable at times it just seemed like there was no use resisting. Everything would turn out alright. I had total trust in the molecule. Everything just felt right.


I will likely give it another test Sunday or Monday and see if I can replicate this feeling and experience with any consistency and report back here. I'll try to record the first half dozen or so doses. I tend to dose light but often so I may eyeball the rest of my doses if I don't have enough to get me to a hole. I find it too hard and too distracting to use my inconsistent scale when I'm all wonked out.

yea, that sounds perfect. even though working through fear and anxiety as you pop through the levels has been an integral part of the psychedelic experience, I feel that at a certain point it’s just an annoying distraction/barrier to truly engaging with the deepest levels of experience. my best shroom trip was like that, just peace and acceptance, and no attachment to either the fantastical or hellish visions - it was kind of just , oh yea, there those are again,cool, if you know what I mean. Then you just surf the waves.


naturally I’ve found it hard to recreate that special sense of wholesome apathy lol. Not much experience with dissos let alone research chemicals. Don’t have cool enough friends I guess haha ![😆](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png)


Have a great time today or tomorrow mate! We’re looking forward to reading the report !

Dissos and psychs are a winner combo. It should work fantastic. Just cut in half every dosage as they tend to sinergize/multiply each other

Anyone know if this is safe to combo with a MAOI? I have Changa (DMT+MAOI) on hand and I'm willing to go for it. I almost did it during my latest experience but stopped myself when I remembered the implication of trying a combination without looking up if they're even safe to combine.


Also I wont be posting a detailed trip report for my last experience but I have to say that was by far the most intense dissociative hole I have ever experienced. I definitely went through a few stages of understanding and accepting my own death. My entire existence and perception of time and space just folded away. The closest thing I could relate it to other than ketamine would be Salvia except with even less ability to perceive and just enough euphoria for me to feel okay. Not enough to spare. After my ego death I crawled into bed in my confusion trying to understand where/who I was, what was going on, if I had work in the morning or if I was supposed to be doing something. How I got there and if what I was feeling was normal and how it's always been. I just layed there in the dark as my life slowly came back to me like a dream I had forgotten but was remembering. Eventually I fell asleep. As crazy and kind of terrifying as it was, I definitely enjoyed it and will be repeating the experience.


I will say I think I also noticed a little sharp pain in my lower back, maybe indicating some strain on my kidneys.

I don't THINK dissociatives are affected by MAOIs but please don't take my word for it, as I'm not positive.


I'm getting the sense that MXiPr can be really serious and amazing at the right dose.

(Here's an edited version of my previous post.)


As mentioned earlier in the thread, I did an an acetone wash on mine and transferred it to a glass vial before trying it, since I found the burnt plastic smell genuinely worrisome. The product no longer smells of anything, although when taken orally the taste is similarly unpleasant.


TRIAL #1


Orally dosed about 22mg,  First alerts felt around +0:15. Tactile sensations enhanced. Slight headache felt on the top of my skull, but nothing unbearable (it subsided without my noticing it). It quickly became clear that this was indeed a dissociative, and that this dose was on the low end.


Re-dosed around 20mg at +0:50. Effects become more pronounced. Was chatting with my closest friends and giving my impressions.


I did not keep track of time, but I soon became wobbly and more and more dissociated. Ketamine is the only other dissociative I have experience with, but it provides an excellent point of reference. Whereas ketamine is cold and clinical, this provides a warm, comforting euphoria that I was somewhat surprised by (although I was expecting it from reading other reports). 


Now I found myself understanding why some people **really** like dissociatives. At last I understand the abuse potential (from the chat: "somehow i feel like until now i was mostly being polite in my appreciation of k. now i fully get why one would become a disso fiend"). This is almost too nice to have no downsides. I also write:

"to make a really wonky analogy: this is to k what an indica is to a sativa". Other aspect that makes this a clear winner over ketamine: no nausea.


Speaking of weed, made one bad decision around the +2:00 mark and had a few tokes of an indica joint (I know, much 

too soon). Shit got intense for about 5-10 minutes and I had to lie down. The strangeness of dissociation and thoughts on the potential for abuse (and all the weird societal guilt associated with it), as well as an uncomfortable sensation in my lower back almost completely killed the previous euphoria and sent me in a somber mood.


Nevertheless, I set about to try working on music in that state, and I guess this is where the more manic side of the drug proved useful. I already had a setup ready to go for recording, so I just hit record and jammed with something I'd been working on in the past few days. I found myself nicely uninhibited and driven to complete at least one take of this one track.


The rest of the night was uneventful. I didn't sleep long, but upon waking up I felt quite relaxed and content. This has clear immediate antidepressant effects. The sensation in my kidney/lower back, however, did not go away for a good couple of days (I'm not sure it even fully went away). I drank lots of water and green tea. Then I tried to convince myself it was muscular.


TRIAL #2


Four days later, I decided to plug 25 mg.


This time the effects came on stronger and faster. 

This time around I found the difference between this and ketamine to be more subtle. The actual dissociative aspect, the feeling of being "far away" inside my body, was almost identical.


At around +1:30 I decided it was time for a redose, and plug about 30mg more.


I decided to throw on a non-narrative movie. Every tableau felt fraught with deep, quasi-mystical meaning that resonated with current happenings in my own life. Many absurd associations and mini-epiphanies were had. I believe I was on the verge of a hole the entire time, and briefly forgot I was on a drug (or what a drug was), thought that the film and the drug were one and the same, etc. Classic delusions.


Again, at the most acute part of the experience, this was something I'd describe as a more euphoric, non-nauseating ketamine-like high (comparable to 40-50 mg IM).


This time around I experienced no immediate physical discomfort, no headache. Interestingly at one point I burped, and briefly tasted that weird burnt plastic taste. I noted a strange dry-but-sweaty sensation on my hands, also characteristic of a decent ketamine dose. Tinnitus was also present both times the acute effects manifested themselves.


I went to bed at about +5:00 and woke up about 6 hours later, again feeling a nice afterglow. This time, the uncomfortable sensation in my lower back  returned, so I've been drinking lots of water. It is still lingering 3 days later. While it's not exactly painful, I am worried I may have damaged my kidney to a certain extent.


So yeah, it looks like this drug might indeed consistently prove a strain on the body. 

I did also experience, like one of the posters above, mild spasms in my inner thighs on a few occasions in the days following the last dose. They fortunately didn't return today.


The good news is bladder function seems completely unaffected: no pain, no difficulty, no change in frequency or urine appearance/smell.


Well, there you have it. The immediate psychoactive effects are everything I was hoping for, but the physical side effects are alarming. Currently debating whether I should get rid of what I have left, because this being a dissociative, the temptation to say fuck it and just ingest it anyway is also quite real.


I know the novelty aspect is quite alluring, but I can't say I recommend putting your health at risk with such a new and unknown substance - at the very least with the batch that's currently in circulation. Needless to say I feel silly for not waiting longer before deciding whether to order this or not. 


I encourage anyone who can to send in samples for analysis. I'm hoping to get this done soon.

All the ACH dissociatives are.  The higher the dose, the worse it seems to be.  Ketamine seems to fuck people up the worst because people are doing grams a day.  The RC dissos tend to be way more potent.  But still, yeah, they're all bad for your kidneys/bladder.

Touch wood, i rarely get kidney pain from k, like almost never, even I've been a proper bender (i class a proper bender as 25g in a few days) 

I do take quite alot of supps/vits when i am binging though (but nothing kidney specific - i take strong cranberry extract for my bladder, little pills that are the equivalent of 5g dried berry, I take 2 daily, aswel as turmeric, omega3 oils, strong multi vits, garlic, magnesium, iron, zinc, extra vit c+d) and always drink plenty of fluids. And eat hot chilli every day as an antioxidant, even if im not eating ANY food, ill eat a spoonful of chilli ![😋](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60b.png)

Ketamine has never given me kidney pain either, but it clearly affects my bladder (dull throbbing pain that comes and goes for a few days), and I've never gone on binges -- most I've done in one sitting is about 100mg, and I don't think I've ever taken it two days in a row. I always revert back to normal if I abstain. It's also possible that I'm particularly sensitive to dissociatives.

Anyway, I'll report back when this hopefully goes away.

Yeah I nearly lost it, was pissing blood, bright green bloody shot, black blot clots 50+ times a day no exaggeration, constant 10/10 pain, ket bladder syndrome, ulcers  ket cystitis, mass fibrosis, uti, etc, did a month clean in rehab with 3.5 weeks of Co-amoxiclav to clear the infection and oxybutyn 3 times a day, plus codeine paracetamol naproxen and diazepam for pain, promethazine at night, and started using again as soon as i left rehab, but no where the amounts I was doing. 

It was before i injected, i was selling it, and selling coke, so endless supply, going through minimum 10g of k, more like 15-20g a day. Literally id wake up get my frying pan and take a biiig pinch 2-3g of crystal, not even cook it, rack it into 5 or 6 lines, do them one after the over, to kill the pain i was in BECAUSE of the k. It was a vicious cycle. And the last 3 months before rehab i was mixing coke into my lines which would make my throat numb and i wouldn't realize that i was swallowing the k drip, im sure this played a major factor, because I was always MILITANT with spitting. 

That and some super strong chinese s isomer 'big ball' i blame those 2 factors. 

Because i did 10-15g a day for years n years with very little break (i sold it for a long time) and never got that bad. 

Also back then, i didnt take vit or sup, didn't drink water, didnt eat properly, didnt sleep properly. I was sofa surfing/hotelling, selling, be awake for 3 days at a time, not eat, sleep a few hoirs, eat a shitty meal deal, repeat. All factors


But yea now i just supplement, eat well, sleep well, plenty of fluid, n barely snort, just inject.

[@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) ive got non reversible damage now, mass massive fibrosis, my is basically a rock hard shell, it doesn't stretch/expand like most ppl, it can't hold more than about 500ml, and if i need to go, i need to go, i cant hold it. Ive had to piss in the street infront of crowds of ppl, piss on the bus, make taxis/lifts pull over etc, and i always will now, forever. 

I have to get up 2 or 3 times a night to go. 

But its way better than before... Now id say i go 5 or 6 times per 24hr. Big improvement from 50+ (i know it was 50+ because i kept a piss diary at rehab, lol) 

I used to squirt out about 25ml of dark red fluid with green stringy bits in it. Was gross. 


Kets a beautiful drug, but if u abuse it, it'll abuse u harder.

I got a load of pics backed up somewhere.

Wana make a thread one day as a warning to ppl who are abusing it or going down that path.

Scare em straight i tell ya. It's gross. 


They felt like red hot razorblades coming out, and they didnt come out easy, i had to almost 'milk' them out ![🤢](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f922.png) it would make me weak at the knees, almost floor me, and no amount of oxy, xanax i was on and nitrous balloons i would do while pissing would help, so id have to do more K to kill the pain... Really really bad vicious circle it was.


Also, yea my balls are big, i dont think its down to that - more like lack of braincells ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)


But nah in seriousness i saw the signs back then, but i was in a bad place, i just didn't care if i lived or died. Being in that frame of mind and always having a big bag of it on you, 24/7 use, unhealthy lifestyle, *anyone* would get ill.

Now i have like a week between binges, and look after myself, and i dont sell it, so i never have ridiculous amounts (i used to get 250g at a time back then, lol)


One of the worst periods of my life. Up there with benzo WDs.

My entire existence and perception of time and space just folded away. The closest thing I could relate it to other than ketamine would be Salvia except with even less ability to perceive and just enough euphoria for me to feel okay. Not enough to spare. After my ego death I crawled into bed in my confusion trying to understand who/what/where I was and what was going on, if I had work in the morning or if I was supposed to be doing something, how I got there and if what I was feeling was normal or how it's always been. I kinda just lied there in the dark as my life slowly came back to me like a dream I had forgotten. Eventually I fell asleep. As crazy and kind of terrifying as it was, I definitely enjoyed it and will be repeating the experience.

The small amount of maoi in changa is usually No problem with any substance.

The standard is about 5-10%, so 100mg of changa should have about 5-10mg of harmalas in it.


I dont recomend this at all but i have smoked changa many times on mdma and dxm with zero issues for example.

So i doubt it will have any danger when combining with a non serotonin drug like this.

Man I can´t believe what I am reading. I mean I knew to some extent dissos were bad for bladder but not so much to the kidneys.  And not THAT bad, like the guy did 50mg. 


I remember last summer I did 3-meo-pcp for some weeks almost daily, and some weeks in i started noticing a persisting sensatinon in the area where i think the kidneys are localized too. A little worried, I opened a thread asking about this in another RC forum, and they fast said it to me that I was probably being hypocondriac and it was probably constipation (or even psychosomatic they said).


Glad this forum is more honest with the dangers of drus lol.

The ACH dissociatives are largely a fantastic group of drugs, with a lot of positive qualities, but they are not without serious risks.  The best advice I've got for users is to not overdo them.  Use them as an occasional recreational treat, or even spiritual tool, if that's your thing, but just don't get into a routine habit with them, and you should be fine.  Always hydrate well, and if you start to notice bladder symptoms, discontinue or reduce your usage.  Some people want to believe ketamine and analogues are totally benign, but they are not. even though they're also very worthwhile drugs.

Update: it took about 7 days, but I'd say I'm pretty much back to normal and no longer feel like I have small rocks stuck in my sides. The discomfort peaked about 4 days in, then gradually faded. I upped my intake of chili, cayenne and turmeric and drank a lot of cranberry juice, fwiw. Ibuprofen also helped. Will not be trying this one again lol

*POSSIBLE SERIOUS WARNING*

First, I'm a fucking dumbass. Nobody should ever even want to take this much in a short span of time. I may have done irreversible damage to my brain.


I'n the guy who did 500mg within the span of two days, of the unwashed shit. All dosed rectally. I was basically blacked out on etizolam too. Had been sober 8 or so months from benzos, n ended up seriously fucking up.


So, my methadone doctor has already mentioned he thinks that I'm Bipolar. I've been seeing him for the past 2.5 years, and he's one of the most caring doctors I have ever had. I've had a very wide range too. I apparently exhibit similar behaviours. Well, with my relative lack of knowledge of pharmacology, I know NMDA related drugs are used for mood stabilizers in people with bpd.


Anyway, so now looking back, because I was curious if this potentially brought something earlier onset (am early 20s, so not super early, but still relatively). I have had these bouts of overwhelming emotion where all I can do is clentch muscles/jaw, and cry, or yell at whatever is frustrating me. Including inanimate objects, but less so. I've started a Lithium treatment today, and took my first dose a few hours back because I was having my second episode of today.


Please be careful, guys. These symptoms only came after after my binge. I have never felt emotional extremities like this before. Even in absolutely insane ego deaths.


Edit: For clarification n more info, Binge ended around 10th, and symptoms started around 12th

Watch out with dissos if you often experience serious mood swings, they can induce manic episodes quite easily, hence making reckless decisions. Ultimately you'll eventually always crash from this, and I can relate to overwhelming bouts of emotions occurring.

Don't worry about irreversible damage to your brain, that is highly unlikely and you'll be good as old in no time. 

But for sure to talk to your doctor more about it, and it might be worth talking to a true professional about this too.

(Id like a new disso to try And all that’s available here are o-tce and this. despite the smell And resulting loss, for some reason I’m more inclined to this lol.. )

I think my recreational drug days are over, having not used them for a year with exception to MXPr because the research had stalled and I felt the inner calling to do it, not just to advance the knowledge but also to prove to myself that when my addiction to dissociatives was OVER it really was OVER, and indeed there was no desire to repeat the experience no matter how pleasurable.


My desire to get high on drugs is erased.


Knowing MXE very intimately and MXPr, in the knowledge that iPr lies inbetween as a kind of two-headed Ethyl, I have no doubt that this one is very good indeed.

It has happened before, years and years and years ago, on mxe quite alot, after i grew tolerance and starting dosing high, and on mxp most of the times i did it too.

Its why I havent tried any of the new RC dissos since the 'phenidines and I wont be trying this. I think my brain is tweaked or im more prone to it happening due to my 18 ish years of disso/drug abuse. 

Its also making me reconsider my K use for the first time in years, but that's going off topic.

When I used MXE in 2 day binges, skipping a night, about once or twice a month, in amounts of 0.4-1gr per such binge, it was expected for me to become highly manic on the second day, and have an anti anxiety and anti depressant mood boosting effect lasting about 3 weeks in between.


MXE was a strong antidepressant, and I was not depressed so, weeeeee!

[@Asante](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/242722/) yeah I used to get the same effects alot, i loved the mania/hyper afterglow after the hole part of mxe more than the initial hole i think, this is why i think id love pcp or 3meopcp but never had chance to get pcp and never trusted myself to do 3meopcp because of what i heard about being really manic and thinking you were sober and just dosing loads and being well out of it

Phooey. Early morning math. Corrected above. I. Can def live with those losses. 


Curious, did you filter the washed product or just draw the acetone off the top? (I don’t have a proper filtering system... despite talking about getting a vacuum pump and Buchner setup for ages :-( lol )

I found that it was easier decanting than filtering. I usually do two or three washes, in each one I let it decant for some minutes and then I remove the top layer of acetone with a syringe. After the last wash I extend the material in a plate and let the remainders of acetone completely evaporate.

For a good decanting, I use a small glass which hollow part has a inverted cone shape. Here is a photo:

[@Mondeva](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/339489/) does the acetone not destroy the syringe? 


Glad to see keepin it simple works tho. 


Still waiting to make my order but knowing it’s as easy as decanting is a relief and I’ll likely opt for this over otce (tiletamine) when the time comes

[@Mondeva](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/339489/) damn that's what I should've done. No wonder you lost so little. I was using coffee filters and spilling all over the place since I don't have proper glassware.


Out of sheer foolishness and masochism I did a bit of ketamine (35mg IM) the other night and... drum roll... that darned sensation flared up again the next day. It did go away more quickly however (3 days later I feel normal again). So it looks like it's a me + arylcyclohexamines problem rather than an MXiPr-specific issue.

Fortunately not. At the moment of the washing, I was not aware of the acetone tendency to "eat" plastics. But eventually the syringe is ok, so it must be made of some kind of plastic that acetone cannot disolve.

Anyway, I should have used a crystal pipette instead, to prevent from bad surprises.

Well, acetone is sold in plastic containers, so I'm not sure what that's about. Acetone squeeze bottles for lab use are also plastic.

The internet says certain plastics are acetone safe. Can’t comment on the credibility but [this site](https://www.plasticsintl.com/chemical-resistance-chart) lists the compatibility* of various plastics with a number of different liquids (solvents, acids, etc)

2:30 AM

Ok 15-22mg of MXipr taken orally. Smells like pokemon cards kinda, that’s what someone on reddit says and I agree. Very plastic smell/taste,. Well this is my first ever disso experience so should be intresting. Dunno how much that metocin/4dmt will affect me since I did some earlier today but we shall see. Gonna put on mad max maybe?


2:48

Alright feeling bit weird, took a bongrip. Watching American Psycho. Feeling decent. Gotta pee

Changed clothes.


2:55 

dunno what to do, feeling alright


3:25

Not sure how much of this Im feeling but whatever feel good. Found myself just laughing out of nowhere? But I dunno. Tounge felt kinda weird in mount. N

Went upstairs and got my vape pen, have to pee but don't wana

looked in mirror for a bit. Decided I need to w0ork out . LMAO

Prince playing -danced a lot gonna take a bong rip. Thinking of taking more of this disso? But ahh


Alight snorted like 10mg? 10 min ago? I dunno I feel good tho. Get em to the greek playing.


I stopped writing after that but I snorted I think around 20-25 mg again around 6 AM. 

It was quite an interesting time and want to explore this some more but am a bit worried to now. All this reading about the smell meaning impurities has me anxious to try again. How harmful could this be? Would it be okay to test another 30-50mg of this or should I just attempt to filter it (have no experience ) 

Im planning on doing some lsd and guess id like an excuse to be able to dip into this a bit while im tripping. Birthday tommrow and wana have a wild time !

Did 68mg of this is two goes the other night, just put it on my tongue. Took 2 tabs of 1p-lsd 7pm and took 35mg of 4-aco-dmt with the ~30mg Mxipr and 9pm. Starting feeling the 4-aco-dmt more than the lsd and became very sedated, intense open and closed eye visuals. Hard to tell what substance was doing what, was able to walk around and talk with my family. Take around 20mg of 4-HO-met around and finished of the rest of the MxiRr. N>ow at this point im starting to feel a bit of discomfort in my left abdomen and inner left thing/leg. I'm feeling it enough that I get a heat back going and make some ginger tea and look up what to do. Okay k-cramps are a thing apparently (i have no experience with other dissos) I use heat pack and drink some tea its not bothering me much. I start watching scott pilgrim vs the world and begin to get totally into it. I feel like it relates to many things in my life and it looks amazing and im laughing and enjoying it a ton. I take a couple bong rips and get really into the movie. I was just having so much fun for about 30-40 min with evrything just falling in place perfectly. Get up to pee a couple times with not much issue. The movie is ending and im starting feelign really high, all the drugs seem to be hitting. the pain in my leg and side and what i assume is my kidneys just keep worrying me. Im not feeling so great anymore, thinking why did I take this new drug with no experience, why didn't I wash it? Will I be oaky. I was panicking an was going to take some clonazapam to try to kill it and sleep. But I decided to ride it out and did some meditating had a bath etc. The rest of the night from about 2 till I slept at 10am there was discomfort on my left side/leg and trouble peeing. All this has me pretty worried and hesitant to try this drug again. Also pretty bummed as it seems to have a lot of potential if used correctly. Are these symptoms normal for this class of drugs? Could this cause serious damage if you only occasionally? I have almost a gram of this left and really dont know what to do. I guess im going to give it a acetone wash if I try it again, but I also know the potential to just say fuck it is there too. Considering tossing it or prob giving it to a family member to hold on to till more research comes out on this or I can wash it. Ive quit drinking since febuary and really don't want to have to deal with another addiction or organ damage. Are other dissos more kidney friendly ? Anyways yea, it was an intense fun experience that was slightly marred by the discomfort and anxiety of ingesting a novel disso. I will also say my first time trying this I did not experiecne these discomforts. I feel mostly normal today maybe only slight discomfort , not very noticable.

I had 42mg of this orally tonight (and a 25mg booster later on).  I had what I can only describe as an absolutely lovely time, had a mind to mind really important talk with my girlfriend, it opened the door to a lot of healing, and then we just had the the best day, made love, which surprisingly was greatly enhanced (dissos generally don't enhance that for me to say the least).  9/10, I hit the flow, and the body high and euphoria fading into contentment were out of this world.  I think I finally "got" this drug.  It's not the same as MXE, it's fuzzier and there is a certain similarity to alcohol after the peak (not in a bad way).  But this stuff is pretty great.  Or at least it was for me, tonight.  I'm going to write a TR, probably tomorrow though.

Yeah i thought it was pretty good drug also the peak was really euphoric for me i sniffed 60mgs MXiPr mixed in a pile with 15-20mgs of 2C-E and had really intense hole, saw my father who died a decade ago it was beautiful experience when i came out of it i snorted the other 40mgs MXiPr and dragged it out id had and redosed more 2C-E in the morning and pulled all nighter it epic had some Alprazolam and Heroin prioir which deff probably dulled to degree but i mean i had intense hole and the euphoria during that period was bananas i sniffed the Dope and popped the Xanax couple hours prioir.

30mg oral is a good place to start.  It's weird, some of my experiences with it have been quite strong at around that level, and then sometimes it will barely do anything.  It's no MXE, but it has some magic in it.

So would the general consensus say this is stimulating at all like mxe could be on the afterglow, or after the hole, manic as such, or not at all?

I would say that the come-up and peak are magical, similar to MXE (sometimes anyway, sometimes it seems to just not really do a whole lot), but that is short-lived, and wears off pretty quickly.  It's no MXE, but I have experienced some magic on it.

I missed/dont remember this, [@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) so no need to answer my last question.


I have little to no self control with dissos and I'd definitely end up naked and outside.


I'll be giving this one a miss. Not that I can even order it to UK.

Unless somehow I can, and I could order just a tiny bit at a time, say 50mg or so.


I would probably IV it tbh.

So I dont use dissos frequently, but a few days ago I had one the most  psychedelic experience of my life.


I'd been doing small lines of 2FDCK over a few hrs, prolly 150mg or so and I walked my friend home. When I got back I felt like I could handle a little bit more, so I pulled out a 50mg sample of MXipr and insufflated it. I may have taken a toke of dmt, when I came to it had been moved.


Anyway I had a complete OBE spiritual experience. I'm honestly still a bit in shock and just exhausted but it's been about 36 hrs. Umm in a nutshell, I basically became aware that I was a single point of conciousness In the center of a massive toroid structure. Withikely trillions of colored lines that were constantly moving. I spent easily 10,000 years in a state of complete nirvana before remembering my original existence and as soon as I had a memory of it, I started to slide down one of the millions of colored lines of the toroid. As I moved I watched all the other lines moving in a different way and they started turning into these waveforms and then into water. Which I realized was the ocean. I could hear it as well. Then I remembered someone I love, and then I remembered who I was, and that I can control my body with my mind so I opened my eyes to find myself in my little house 1000s of miles away. I've never had such an experience and I've had several breakthrough experiences with 5 meo dmt.

I used to get trips like this my first few years of K, especially combined with nitrous. Amazing. 

Lost the magic thru abusing it way too often and never get them now. MXE and nitrous came close a few times. 

Never tried 2fdck. May give it a go alongside mxipr one day. That sounds awesome man.

Ill betcha you hit that deems


I’ve been trying to get this into solution for a couple hours now. Most of it went immediately into solution after a few hot baths and shakey shakes , but there is maybe 50mg of white rocks that refuses to go into the hot PG.


I might have to pour it out of the 30ml bottle and try smash up these rocks with a fork or something. Or maybe my ~66mg per ml is too high a concentration? Wonderi mg if these rocks are the mysterious agent responsible for most of this “New Sneakers” odor I’m getting from the solution

I guess it is possible that the rocks are the smelly stuff thats being removed from the acetone washes. It could be non-soluble in PG. 

Id just filter you PG solution out and away from them. Dry them and weigh them, see if they are anything similar to the amounts that have been lost when others have washed.

[@HearWhalesLaugh](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/536780/) as for 66mg/ml in PG being too high... I once got 200mg of MXE into 2ml of PG... Stirring in a shot glass over a candle for a few minutes. Take of that what you will

[@jhjhsdi](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/159729/) good to know about the concentration level thang. Im fairly lazy and might not filter those rocks out, they tend to collect at the bottom pretty quickly and don’t seem to get sucked up into the dropper

Bro it wont be hard jus tip it slowly at an angle into something else the rocks will stay at the bottom. When theres a few ml and the rocks left, you can either tilt it and use the dropper to get the rest of the fluid out, or crush them with a fork n see if they dissolve.

Or just tip the lot thru a coffee filter or t shirt into anothet glass. 

That cut/impurity that smells that people are getting out, sounds to me like it really IS worth getting out, no headache, no kidney pain etc, it cant be good

No I haven't.  Honestly the smell/taste sketches me out.  And I usually am not bothered by tastes, I pour 2C-Xs directly on my tongue and taste them and try to let the full taste happen because I think it's interesting.  But this one just seems wrong.  The fact that acetone washing reportedly gets rid of that smell, with a minimal loss of product, makes me want to do it.  But I have honestly never done an acetone wash yet, and I am not getting more MXiPr, this is it.  Don't want to fuck it up by having insufficiently dry acetone.

Sounds like an acetone wash could not be the only way to seperate from the sketchy stuff. How much did you get? 

Could try the PG thing H.W.L mentioned above. Would be less risky than using acetone, surely.

After all these reports im actually kinda gutted for the first time in YEARS you can't get RCs in the UK anymore. 

I want to try a small amount of this. Alone and moreso, a few sprinkles (say 10-20mg) mixed with standard sized standard ketamine in an IV shot. 

I'd quite like to try 2fdck too. Id probably only sniff that one though, i feel an IV dose for me would have to have a lot of material and im not sure how much experimentation has been done on big IV hits of that. K was DESIGNED to go in your blood at high doses, 2f wasnt... 

Considering getting back on the DNM ya know. Shame we can't discuss that kinda shit here. 

Any sites i can go to where that sort of discussion is allowed? Or is asking that not allowed either? Sorry if it is.

Yea i thought as much. Oh well. Im sure i can figure out if its possible. I mean all the RCs used to end up on the darknet back in the days i was using it, especially the banned ones.

Fair enough, if it is easy enough to take out I might as well. Even if it’s not the contaminant (which some connected NL

Person on another board denied being possible saying something along the lines of “amines have a smell” etc etc)


I could stand to lose a few small chunks in the interest of HR. Maybe I’ll be back with a pic when I filter.  Guess I won’t be trialing this magickal potion this evening, tommorow is an eclipse anyways so better day for some real work.

 Ya, know the friend who shared w me to only eat it and not to snort it but I didnt listen.


I've prolly never been in a true k hole, was my experience merely just an mxipr hole? 


What's also interesting is I'm pretty sure I can go back there at will. If I just mediate and focus on my breathing I can feel myself start to dissolve but I always break the trance before it gets very deep. I think a part of me worries that I will not make the choice to return here.

It was a 2fdck/mxipr hole. Every dissociative has its own unique 'hole' - albeit they can be similar. You cant get in a 'K-hole' on anything other than ketamine alone. 


I'm think I'm going to order 2g of 2fdck and ask them if they'll send me a small 50mg sample of mxipr, as ive found a site that sells both that will offer tracked shipping to UK (i dont trust myself with any more than 50mg if mxipr tbh and the smallest they sell is 500mg...way too much as i think i would black out become manic and do it all in one night lol)

I sampled this compound in recent days. ROA mostly nasal and oral.

Acetone wash was done and lead to reduced smell and maybe a faintly lightening in color, but didn't alter the substance in any other way.


The comeup can be rather bumpy, but doesn't last longer than a few minutes. The peak provides a buzzing body sensation in higher doses and typical analgesic effects. The body also heats up and blood pressure / heart rate is likely to increase. MXiPr is on the weaker side regarding euphoria, however I found it way more comforting than MXPr for example. The dissociation does ramp up faster than the euphoric effects, making the peak challenging and confusing.

I realized a mild afterglow, energy boost, emptiness of though and increased focus the next morning, so antidepressant effects are a given.


The mayor selling point for me is the lack of stimulation. It is not particularly sedating, but even in higher ranges there is no pushiness and very mild lingering stimulation, so sleeping afterwards is not a problem. For comparison i tried 3-ho-PCP the other day, which is said to have sedating qualities as well, and found it really hard to calm down once the primary effects had worn off.


Edit: There is a mild lingering stimulation, that only manifests itself after several hours and takes longer than one day to completely wear off. When used consecutively this stacks up to hypomanic states followed by the usual stim comedown (sweaty cold hands and feet, increased heart rate, cheyne strokes respiration, restlessness).

can you IV this? i did 20mg intranasal and was very underwhelmed. thanks.


edit: i did and it didn't kill me, yet. was filtered and with brand new needle. probably 10mg.


this stuff is more euphoric but lacks the depth of whatever previous one they said was the new mxe. mxpr, right?

What was the rush like? In comparison to say IV ketamine? 

I guess with your disso experience 10mg probably isnt enough for a 'proper one'. 

I dont think anyone else has reported IV use yet. Go easy ![💙](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f499.png)

Even though ive never tried 2fk, from what ive read about it id expect the IV experiences (or the rush at least) to be pretty similar. 

IV K is fucking boss. But let's not go off topic, i could blab on about it for days lol

there’s no real rush. atleast not at the doses i am using. some people compared shooting 50mg to smoking dmt (which i haven’t done).


this drug makes things look purple like that past one, mxpr. it also makes my skin tingly.

Ah cool I didn't realize anyone else had even shot it. Or maybe i am confusing with dmxe. Take it the reports are on reddit as i cant see them here? 


Smoking dmt is intense like shooting k but wayyy more colorful. 

Purple vision sounds kinda weird. 

How long was your skin tingly? I get that after I shoot k sometimes. 


Sorry for so many questions I'm just really interested

might have been wrong about this one's depth. upon returning from a new year's eve party, i did an important shot. had done quite a bit of iv and oral osdmt and two lines of good but watered down cocaine prior. everything lined up perfectly. i had the most intense feeling about the concept of love. mxpr is more about math-based ethics for me. with the aforementioned combo, a 50mg-ish shot may have taught me a good deal about platonic love. will attempt to put into words tomorrow.

there's no beautiful rush. it's coolest rush is probably intranasal. 


i did just do an iv shot of it like 3 minutes ago but only because i was making an odsmt shot and threw some in.


my gram is gone but i'll get another because it's a party drug. showing someone an iv shot of 3 meo pce would be a big deal. this stuff could get passed around intranasal at a party like coke or k.

of course. i'm saying not with enough significance to always necessitate the more complicated roa of iv over im. obviously iv is the best. with this specific drug, it doesn't have huge advtangages over im.


it's a winner in my book. lots of euphoria. good party drug. i never did mxe, but i imagine this is the effect people were hoping for in mxpr. unlike mxipr, i would never do mxpr at a party. mxipr is like the cocaine of dissos. mxpr gets me calculating if i'm a good person and the steps the world needs to take in order to save itself. mxipr makes me wanna go out and share it.

Im surprised you could feel so little i blow 50mg lines and still want more couple hours later. But i suppose i have a bit of a permanent tolerance from over the years. Actually getting some MXPr this week 250mgs so i will be able to compare the two with fresh experiences of each. Havent had that one for over a year and back then i under shot the dose so im happy i will have enough material to really go for it. That being said MXiPr is deff better and if anyone has choice between the two that is what i would grab.

Would this trigger a false positive for pcp? I've searched an can't seem to find any info. Was using 3hopce extensively for treatment resistant depression but have to abstain for fear of a false positive. Was looking into DCK apparently that one can be used without the fear of a false positive.

It's hard to say.  Some people claimed MXE caused false positives for PCP, and some claimed it didn't.  I have heard that ketamine can, also, and also that it can't.  In general I think it's safe to say that the arylcyclohexylamines all have the potential to cause a false positive for PCP.  Or at least, operate under the assumption they might.

Ohhh no that is surely concerning. I've only ever used Intranasal and in pretty high dosages and I've never had anything bad happen. But I have read other people's stories of blacking out and they can certainly be having seizures during that time. I have a ridiculous tolerance to dissos and have always remained fully aware throughout my MXiPr trips and I love the stuff personally, id jump at the opportunity to do it again honestly.

What sort of doses were they using? 

I haven’t noticed any signs of shaking or what might feel seizure like at doses up to 100mg (eaten and snorted)

One time I was planning to take MXE and then smoke DMT on it. I ended up just taking a ton of MXE and didn't get into the DMT, but according to my girlfriend at the time, I was sitting on the couch and kept trying to stand up but would go into a fit of shaking and collapse. She  even debated trying to get me to the ER, although I was completely blacked out for all of this. What I do know is that whenever I came out of the blackout I felt unbelievably good the rest of the night, despite the scary news.


Then there was this time on a really high dose of ephenidine (600mg+) I believe something similar happened. This I vaguely recall and it almost felt like my body's electrical circuits were shorting out, especially when I would try to move around.


Of course I've used dissociatives hundreds of times and these were the only two times that something like this happened, and the doses were extremely high. Although it's possible that I could have been using alone and blacked out and so it may have happened on other occasions that I'm unaware of.

I've had my fair share of seizures on big IM/IV doses of K (1000-2000mg)


Or so my friends tell me.

I've definitely had some alone too. Coming round after a black out with a sore tounge and aching. This is why I stopped shooting more than 750mg(IV)

I always figured my tolerance was in the 99th percentile, which it's probably dropped over the past few years, but I can't imagine doing doses like that even at the peak of my usage. Are you still able to hole?

I copy paste my MXiPr trip report from reddit :


**Context**


I used RCs three days in a row, three days ago 4-AcO-MiPT, and yesterday and the day before yesterday of DMXE (~ 375mg over two evenings).


I am still in awe of how beautiful and fitting DMXE is to me, more relaxing, more lucid MXE and without any psychotic or overwhelming wobble moment, pure beauty of peace with oneself, less forced and less deep, or less remote from the world than the MXE but still perfect in what it is.


I have read that MXiPr can be "neutral" or uninteresting at low doses, so I will, after allergic test, go for 40mg intranasal I think, it would seem that it is more mindfucky, more unpredictable and chaotic, less zen and in short less lucid than DMXE, I'm not sure what to expect other than something more alien, deeper or out of the world, more bizarre, so maybe closer to these aspects of MXE in this sense (which are more or less absent in the DMXE, where these aspects are exchanged for a quiet and perfect bliss in DXME), but therefore something less saving, less precious, more erratic and stranger.


The sky oscillates between gray and white today, I am alone at home, I have my nicotine reserves, the housework is done, it is almost noon, I can put the music on the sound system of the apartment and not not worry about the noise I make.


I am happy to try this chemical, having been disappointed in the past by analogues of PCP and DCK, few dissociatives having marked my mind (2F-DCK, ephenidine, MXPr, and recently DMXE far winning the fight in my heart).


Yesterday, under DMXE, I was listening to melodic, minimal and soft electronic music that touched me emotionally, by the more alien and strange nature of the MXiPr, I chose a more anchored and alien playlist. Like yesterday, I put my phone in offline mode, because calls and messages from my friends or family tend to make me uncomfortable, confused or out of step with the experience. I put on nasal decongestant and blow my nose continually to clear my nostrils.


**Trip Report**


11:11 = Allergic test


11:25 = I weighed 40mg, which is a bigger pile than the equivalent of DMXE, I would say a little less than double the same dose of DMXE, about like the same than MXPr which was also very sparse, the texture and color make me anticipate a certain corrosiveness (a barely beige and gray white, the texture is rather banal between small consolidated heaps and snow powder), maybe I am wrong about the corrosiveness.


11:34 = Because of its size I cut the line in two, one for each nostril -> **40mg snorted**


The synthetic smell is really peculiar, the line makes me sneeze (I have a few allergies at the moment and it has also happened to me with DMXE and Kanna in recent days), apart from that the powder is neither corrosive nor unpleasant, except for the initial tickle and odor, nothing more to report, the DMXE was a bit more corrosive even (although negligible).


11:36 am = I have the impression of already feeling a slight dissociation, I set my hardtekno and techno rave playlist, more "perched" and anchored at the same time.


11:38 = the product goes up quickly! I feel my mushy hands and a buzz in my head, a visual veil is already setting in, the music is receding and hazy. Less electric but more "grounded" and more physical dissociation than DMXE. The choice of hardtekno fits perfectly.


I feel my body and mind swept away in a hazy wind, almost ketamine-esque, buzz feeling in the extremities, but not electric and precious (to compare with DXME), more muddled and twisted, mellow and grounded.


The body high is much more forced and gravitational, I remain lucid but it reminds me a bit of 2FDCK for the spatialized aspect and something of MXPr for the aspect a little out of the moment.


11:45 = It develops linearly and takes shape, bodyhigh is very present at the ends of the fingers and on the surface of the skin, with the eyelids half closed, while the DMXE bodyhigh is more internalized and externalized at the same time, paradoxically.


It's very slowed down. I feel that there are more abrupt disturbances than with DMXE in my brain.


I am much more physically disabled, getting up is complicated, as is writing.


The weather fluctuates between gray and white outside and it fits perfectly with the effect I feel (disturbed), I like it when the sky is white, less when it's grayish (I prefer either all white or storm), just a note to me.


There's that cold, out-of-the-way but not inhuman something that I loved about MXE, I mean that something out of the world and mythical, rocky, like becoming a mountain.


Much more wonky / ketamine-esque than DMXE, the nerve endings are very anesthetized, no warmth, something moon-esque.


The slowing down of the sound is deeper, more grounded, very particular, more physical and jerky. **Less emotions, more sensations.**


12:12 = I want to see further, I prepare 25mg more, snorted.


12:50 = MXiPr is incredible, it's heavenly and like the wind, an incredible flight facing a precipice, the dream


I have read there that the MXiPr hole and afterglow is like being reborn, and well it’s true, endless pleasure and saturation.


Hope i formatted well and the write up is nice, lovelylovely dissociative.

I read a report of someone taking a huge oral dose (something like 150 mg) and not holing or blacking out... Is this one not really potent orally ? Are parenteral ROAs preferred, kinda like ketamine?

To be fair, my friend used to take that much orally with MXE and it was just his normal dose... disso tolerance is intense.  The same friend took 120mg recently, orally, and found it a nice level, but not very strong.

Hey guys, I just wanted to let you know I've been working on this article over on psychonautwiki. [https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Talk:MXiPr](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Talk:MXiPr)


I think the substance is quite intriguing. At low doses (7-20mg rectal) it produced relatively unpredictable effects. But above 25mg it produced an experience unlike the lower doses, it felt more like a journey over the course of an hour and a half, and by the end of it it left me feeling quite refreshed.


Out of necessity I am practicing harm reduction with this, especially given its undocumented nature and anecdotal reports of major harm, blackouts, seizures, etc. This is exactly why it needs to be documented better. I can't do all the research, nor will I try to.


A lot of it is boilerplate copied in from similar substances, but if some of you could review it, add to it, etc, that would be great.


You can add experience reports for it at [https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index)


If you disagree with the dosage or duration information I listed, edit that here [https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Template:SubstanceBox/MXiPr](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Template:SubstanceBox/MXiPr)

After what seems like forever I finally have a sample of this. 

As a lover of MXE I have been looking forward to this for a while.


I’m going to go through and reread this thread

Read through the whole thread. Huh, not all that much information yet.

My MXiPr is chalky white and clumpy like others described. It did not have the potent odor many describe, leading me to believe it was washed at the source or that what ever it was was able to evaporate off. When I stuck my nose in the bag to smell it I did get a smell very faintly like a pair of new sneakers.


I did my fair share of MXE back in the day. I was entirely fascinated by my dissociative experiences, even my most uncomfortable ones. The feeling like I had discovered the secrets of existence, or a new mode of being, or even the moments of terror that my mind was forever separated to roam the the astral plane were indescribably profound for me. I remember feeling intangible things like "infinity" and "time". I remember being trapped in dimensional paradox that was like the universe was crystal glass ball around me that cracked and all the cracks centered on my perception and I could see different infinitely reflecting shards all leading into myself. I remember pushing my hand out and my reality unfolded like it had been turned into oragami.

I quite liked having movie nights. With just the right movie you could Live the movie. I watched dozens of movies while dissociating. And of course I loved to mix it with psychedelics, especially 4-AcO-DMT. The CEVs produced by that combo were deepest and most vibrant (and most comfortable) I have ever had. And the drug was so agreeble to me physically (as long as I had a good batch) I could push it as far as I liked with little negative symptoms. I knew many others who got plain sea sick off of it, but alcohol always reliably treated me worse than MXE ever did.


Long story short I have plenty of experiences going into deep dissociative states and I have been dearly waiting for anything that could even come close to the magic of MXE for years now. My main ROA was oral so I will definitely be starting there with MXiPr.


I have to admit I like the name. Sounds like some sort of mischievous norse dissociative spirit entity, Mixipr

I really like this drug alot its not as good as regular MXE but its nice, has its own vibe to it. Im opting to get the DMXE next because I havent had it before and its said to be even closer. But that being said I hope this stuff is still available down the road cuz I would deff wanna get more. Its à very warm disso and quite euphoric,  I like it alot the time I used around 150mgs was the best I did it in like three parts spread hours apart. I usually sniff my dissos but eating this or sublingual will probably work great also.

I second using MXiPr orally (same goes for MXPr). Has a very different vibe to it and for me it was much more enjoyable that way.

I mean sniff it kinda outta habit and impatience im sure it probably does work differently I mean I know that Xorky said that 2F-DCK is better when you take it orally for damn sure. That's another one im about to stock up on as im worried about it dissappearing, I have US source I can use. But something else just happened lastnight that all fonds need to be funneled towards im not gonna speak on it yet but its such an excellent development and im a happy mofo. But that being said some of the MXE analogs will be coming my way also soon and if not DMXE than surely MXiPr cuz this stuff is wonderful, im looking forward to your thoughts on it [@electronDegenerate](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/540686/).

I would agree with that statement as well. 2-FDCK is extremely smooth and very potent when taken orally. The come-up is still pretty short, the duration is a tiny bit longer and it's way easier to reach a hole. After trying both ROA's I don't see any reason why I would snort it over eating it, other than the act of snorting itself, which many K users are accustomed to and might find pleasurable.


DMXE I have only tried once (so far), but that one time was pretty impressive nonetheless. Never tried MXE, but that's what I always imagined it to be like.

I'll tell you what tho, it's stronger than DMXE. If im not mistaken it has the same kind of afterglow. However DMXE comes in more crystallized form and its easier to snort unlike MXiPr. I tried 20-25mg like 5 days ago and the experience was absolutely amazing for about 10 minutes, the drug opened the world to me, but unfortunately i was writing a trip report and came to the realization that over-analyzing the disso high ruins the magic.

In the spirit of the harm reduction, maybe we should be able to disclose which sources are selling heavy impure chemicals to avoid like the plague.


If not directly, at least lets give some tips : "It starts for the letter X and is located in Y, yellow typography logo"


Asking the admins is something like this could be tolerable.


In a different issue, green tea has totally heal my bladder pins. Take it the days you do a disso, especially in medium to high dosages. Metaphysical medicine, guys

Naming sources isn’t appropriate in this forum, even in the name of harm reduction. You can get away with alluding to them sometimes, but it’s a fine line.

Most likely all of this is coming from one main source, a reptile ![😉](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). Then distributed to retail RC vendors.


Thanks for the green tea tip. I’m a pretty heavy dissociative user (right now it’s weekly, it has been daily). I like to use them frequently but in low to medium doses. I also drink green tea almost every day, usually 2 cups, I do this instead of drinking coffee. I have never noticed any of the bladder pain that’s reported. Though those reports are almost entirely for Ketamine. 

For I while I thought that the theory was that since RC dissociatives are super portent and require a smaller dosage than ketamine that they were less harmful to your bladder. I don’t know if there is any truth to that theory.

Yeah we can't name sources, Delsyd's post is even borderline but doesn't really mean anything to anyone who doesn't already know something.  I get that it is kinda HR, but also we absolutely strictly have to enforce no sourcing or helping people find drugs.


But I can definitely say that all of the MXiPr, MXPr, DMXE and HXE on the market are all from one source and as far as I know, one synth each so far.  Various resellers sell them, but it all came from the same place.

I suppose I'm ready to try a full dose of this stuff.

Did a powdery fingerprint dose as an allergy test. Nothing. Ok good.

A different day I wieghed out 15mg and took it in 5 doses oral over an hour and a half. Nothing I can't prove wasn't a placebo.

Yesterday at noon I weighed out 30mg. I took 2/3 of it, and the rest 30 mins later. Also oral.

It took a while but I did notice some undeniable background effects. Hard to call "dissociation" though.

About 7 hours later I weighed out 40mg and took that too. I could feel this during the appropriate come-up window, and it did get a little heady, but that too faded pretty quickly. Never felt off balance, numb, or have problems with speech.

So I guess I'm done playing.

Time to get serious.


Note, I have zero aryl tolerance at the moment. I did a very small dose of 4-MeO-PCP many weeks ago, and 2 small bumps of 2F-DCK at the start of winter.

I did 58mg today followed by another 20mg thirty minutes later. Both doses oral..

This is about what I had originally expected from the 40mg dose I took which leads me to believe this stuff might be up to 50% subjectively less potent than MXE for me.

I felt a mild dissociative disconnect, a little bit of numbing in my face, slightly cold fingertips, and I definitely slurred my speech a little bit, but nothing I couldn't power through by concentrating.

This stuff may be a little more short lived compared to MXE, but I will need to take it further before I can decisively say that.

I finally felt it hinting at what it was capable of, but I have to say I did expect it to be more in my face at this dose.

I have a package of mxipr on the way. 

Just a question for those who have tried it.

Would you say mxipr is closer to a ketamine-type substance or a pcp/pce analog.

Thanks!

Its more similar to Methoxetamine or Ketamine.


But has a shorter duration than MXE and diff character, tho it has been a number of years since I've had MXE. It has a different vibe than 3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO/HO-PCE and you can deff hole on this stuff if you take enough and in my case mix it with a psychedelic...I find it to be more controllable as far as keeping it togther where with those PCP analogs I have to be careful about how much I have around. I feel like I could be pretty responsible with MXiPr.

I never got the chance to try MXE unfortunately.


What would be a good starting dose for someone with a 'medium' disso tolerance?

Also, is intranasal a good ROA with this stuff?

Thanks!

Hmm

Well I allowed myself to taste this stuff for the first time and I wash shocked at how bad it was. Like if burning rubber could somehow go rancid.


I think I am coming to the conclusion that this stuff has limited use for me.

Today I took 85mg orally, followed by 45mg 20 minutes later, and again another 20 minutes later, and again another 20 minutes later.

I felt a pleasant and bubbly numbing intoxication that I would almost call recreational. I think I could have gone on a hike even.

I honestly thought I would be couch locked and sucked into some good music or a trippy movie or something but I ended up 

shoveling snow. Physical activity felt pretty good, but I seriously thought this dose would have me skirting the rabbit hole or at 

least incapacitate me to some degree.

I don't think the redoses are worth much with this stuff. 

I guess my next test is going to be like 180mg all at once or something. I'm already running out of material to work with.

Have you tried snorted? I think I read somewhere that this one is not very active orally, and much more potent parenterally, but I can't say from first hand experience. It would be unfortunate though, as I vastly prefer dissos orally, and generally hate snorting stuff. I got some of this but don't know when I'll get around to trying it.

I have yet to try the other new "mxe analaogs" thanks to getting screwed over multiple times by the mail this winter.

I used a lot of mxe in the past so that is my benchmark, and I could enjoy anywhere between 50 and 150mg depending on my 

mood and how far down the rabbit hole I wanted to go. Other than that my experience with K, 3/4-MeO-PCP, and 2F-DCK is pretty

scattered.

I have yet to snort it and I have to say that after getting a taste of it yesterday I would be pretty afraid to do so! It was pretty bad.

Aside from that the reason I never could find the sweet spot with Ketamine was because my sinus passage tends to over react to 

large amounts of material being introduced. Snorting 150mg of K over like an hour only managed to produce threshold effects 

and i'm sure I just wasn't absorbing it. 

This may make it sound like I have an idiosyncratic response to dissos but I assure you that is not the case, with K it was just too much 

powder to go into my face. 


There is still a chance for me to receive MXPr, DMXE and HXE. I am most excited for DMXE because it seems to be the closest structurally to MXE.

Also I have read more reports about it that lead me to believe it could be a bit more powerful than MXiPr.

Well, my package of mxipr arrived earlier this week.


Mt first test was 20 mg intranasal. The stuff indeed has that 'plasticky' smell to it as others have reported.

The stuff didn't burn, but had a bit of a tickly sensation that I don't particularly like, but it goes away soon enough.


I was surprised that with 20 mg nasally, it has a really nice rushy feel. Nice body sensations and a good buzz.

Unfortunately, this rush only lasts a couple of minutes. Then it turns into a kind of a dreamy state which was nice enough, but not as nice as the initial buzz.

The dreamy state has a comfortable, happy vibe to it, although it is not particularly strong. 


I added another 20 mg orally after the initial nasal dose. I didn't feel it much and went on to doing a small amount of DCK, 2FDCK, 4-HO-MET. 

Then a blast of K which seemed to 'unlock' everything (K seems to unlock a lot of substances for me), and ended up having a really nice buzz for a few hours.


I felt the dreamy after effects the whole next day. In fact it made me feel quite happy throughout the day. 

I am finding the anti-depressive effects to be the best out of K, DCK, 2-FDCK, 3-HO-PCP, 3-MEO-PCE so far.


I did 20 mg nasally the next day as well. Same rush that turns into a dreamy state. 

Mixed it with a variety of other substances as well and had a great time.

The mxipr seems to mix very well with other dissos/psychs, and the feel of it is apparent even with other substances involved.


Overall, I like mxipr so far and will re-order. 

I just wish the 1st rushy stage had more legs to it.

Still nothing compares to good ol' K in my opinion.

Yeah I feel hat way too, the smell is so intense, like burned plastic or something, I find the smell very alarming and it's so strong that before I put it in an amber vial, I had the bag in my drug box, and I could smell it through the closed box down the hall.  My buddy has snorted it and said it was smooth and not problematic to snort.  But he also said he doesn't find it to smell that much.  We have the same batch (we ordered together to save money).  I don'[t get how he doesn't think the smell is intense.


Someone on here did an acetone wash and said they only lost like 2%, or maybe 5% or something, and that it pretty much got rid of the smell and the trip was better.  So it seems that it's due to an impurity.

Honestly mine doesn't smell too intense to me either. I had to stick my nose all up in the bag to get the smell of new shoes or something.

The taste was a different story. Like rubber vomit. I'm a little surprised that snorting it isn't proving utterly awful for people on here, but 

I guess it gives me some glimmer of hope. 

Other than that I'm still going to try like 200mg all at once orally and see what happens. This isn't a cost effective dissociative for me, 

but I just have to know what its capable of

Ok, then I would suggest trying it sublingually first and then try insufflation as your last resort.

MXPr and DMXE are both really nice in my experience. I don't understand why so many people hated on MXPr when it came out, probably because it was heavily marketed as the next MXE.

From a chemical standpoint MXPr and MXiPr are actually more similar to MXE than DMXE, contrary to what their names might suggest. Changing a 3-methoxy to a 3-methyl substitution is usually a more substantial change than a simple extension of the N-ethyl chain to a propy or isopropyl. Effect-wise DMXE is regarded to be the most similar to MXE though. If I were you I would definitely invest in some DMXE and MXPr (both are fantastic imo) once the prices go down. I was pretty excited about HXE, but the few reports don't sound all too promising.

Intranasally MXiPr is definitely more potent than DMXE. I don't know about oral DMXE as I have only insufflated it so far, but I will report back when I decide to do a decent oral dose. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

After tasting it I think there's very little chance of me trying it sublingual. I'll probably insufflate at some point just to see if it takes me further.

On its way hopefully! I have to know for myself what these have to offer.


Honestly my experience with MXiPr was fun. It just lacked that powerful dissociative deep end for me, and would be pretty expensive

for the kind of experience I got out of it. I'll be waiting a little bit before my next trial though just to make sure my tolerance isn't starting

to build up.

My buddy has snorted it and said it was smooth and not problematic to snort.  But he also said he doesn't find it to smell that much.  We have the same batch (we ordered together to save money).

I've snorted it a few times so and don't think it's bad at all, it does smell a little strange but I don't think it's THAT bad personally and the effect of the drug is well worth it IMO...

Snorting it is smooth. I get more of a sting from PCP analogues even tho the dose is much smaller.

Well if you put it under your tongue properly and it stays there till it is fully dissolved you wont taste anything ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'm looking forward to try MXiPr, MXPr and DMXE soon too. They should be coming in this week. I've enjoyed a lot of ketamine back in the day and recently went through a lot of 2F-DCK. Which in low doses is great to listen to music or watch a movie, especially to get my mind of opioids for a bit... High doses are great too although I find it less enjoyable to hole on than ketamine because of the longer residual dissociation/stimulation.


Sadly wasn't an active researcher when MXE was around but I'm excited to see how these other dissociatives will make me feel!

I guess I've never been that good at using things sublingual. I think there would be too much MXiPr powder for me to personally want to try that. It didn't bother me at all with the 2Cs. That was my usual route. 2C-C proved to be a bit much for me to do that with though.

Ugh the MXiPr tasted so bad. And I didn't even taste it on purpose. I did taste the DMXE, MXPr, and HXE on purpose and they were not nearly as wretched. Honesltly I'm excited for you to get some and try

I'm not sure how much, as in my infinite wisdom I wound up using mid size dish foolishly, with a big pile in the middle and a smaller pile right beside it. Not sure if I had some of the wrong pile by accident or just misjudged what I was doing (I definitely should have used my trusty scale but did not in a baffling display of poor judgement and impulsiveness) Stuff gets a bit fuzzy here. I wound up falling into something not quite a hole but more of a stupor. I blacked out. I'm not sure exactly how much I had, it was months ago on my birthday. I vaguely recall realizing I may have had more than intended just a moment before I started to feel a weird reeling sensation internally, and my vision started feeling squished sorta and went a little blurry. I tried to do some breathework to calm my anxiety, nothing much though more just suddenly became aware of my breathing. I guess I woke up my bf who I heard coming through the bathroom that connects our room to the kitchen where I was as I came up in something of a weird feeling. Not the comfy familiar enjoyable dissociative high feelings, sort of a welling up of clammy numbness. I think I said out loud as I was blacking out 'oh yup, guess we're doing this now' (I think coming to terms with accepting that I'd made this mistake... sort of a bewildered surrender, not as graceful as I'd have liked, but anyway) I was still standing, legs locked. My bf got really freaked out seeing how high I was, and that I'd become super pale and wasn't responding to him. He says my eyes rolled back in my head a bit. He got really worried about me, guided me towards the couch and took great care of me while asking some peers online for support. I guess I came around to functional memory mode again at some point, though I was now feeling calm and rested, as though something was slightly amusing but I wasn't sure what... only I could tell I'd messed up and it felt like there was a very slow reluctant apprehension in me that my partner was really upset. He knew I had this but not how much I'd taken or much of anything about it other than that it was a dissociative RC I was kinda annoyingly stoked about at one point.

> Things are much better now, but this was really hard on both of us in more ways than one, and happened at the end of a very hard year. In a way this was a good reality check for me. I was making reckless and impulsive choices and it nearly cost me more than I could have imagined when I first obtained this stuff. That said, it's caused me to face a lot of mental health issues I'd been avoiding for quite some time. I finally got back on medication and followed up for medical testing to try to diagnose some mystery chronic pain mobility stuff expecting another round of no real answers and found out I probably have ankylosing spondylitis (I'm going in tomorrow to follow up but the doc felt strongly enough based on history and tests that he told me he thought it likely over the phone and my very long awaited follow up to confirm some stuff and prlly to a rheumtologist)... which sounds like bad news but TBH I am just relieved to finally have diagnosis and a path for treating some of my health issues. I've also been taking a break for the most part from drugs, cannabis, one lsd trip and the occasional drink notwithstanding. It hardly feels real looking back, but it was also a scary experience. For me it was very upsetting and confusing, and for my partner he really thought I might die at one point. The weirdest thing is how tranquil things felt even after the high and distinct after-effects had worn off. I kept having to remind myself where I was at. I guess I've never been able to observe depersonalization from such a mellow and calm non anxiety filled perspective. Last time I felt that type of out of touch it was much stronger and from different dissos.

I hope anyone else using this or any other drugs is being more mindful and patient than I was in this incident, to the best of their abilities anyway ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I had a similar experience  with MXE. I mixed a couple etizolams with a large dose and when my girlfriend came home she found me in an unresponsive stupor and it freaked her out a little bit. The next day I woke up as if everything was normal and she was not in a good mood. She was even more annoyed that I had no real memory of the night and it wasn't until she said something that I remembered taking drugs at all. Luckily it wasn't too difficult to smooth over. Mixing benzos with MXE caused blackouts like 50% of the time so I stopped doing it.

My experience with MXiPr never got me that far, but I can actually imagine the higher doses putting you into a stupor before actually giving you a hole experience.

Guys I'm trying to think of a smell which perfectly describes the batch of MXiPR that I have in my selection. Let me know if you guys agree. Do you know that smell when you open a brand new DVD case? Like that absolutely fresh DVD case smell when you just RIP the plastic wrapping off? Yeah.  That is fucking it. Such a unique smell. I love the smell, I wish I grabbed more bags just so I could have them to smell when brain wants to smell that brand new dvd smell. Anywho. I have a half gram, and I've yet to try any of it yet for personal consumption. Very tempted.

Yep, that's it!  Smells like plastic chemicals.  I don't like it personally, and it's really strong, made my whole drug box reek until I put it in an amber vial.

looks like interest in this has largely died out.


I’ll take the torch. ![❤️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2764.png)


I just got 10 grams of MXiPR and it does NOT have a weird toxic smell.  Maybe that was just the batches going around the first year.


I started with 20 mgs sublingual and it was not going anywhere. Like nothing happened that I couldn’t call placebo in the first half hour. Sensing something was wrong I concluded it must be the ROA.


BTW it definitely made my tongue and mouth numb and had a strong but not disgusting chemical taste, similar to a Phen compound, as opposed to a Tryptamine.


Sure enough I sniffed 24 mgs and within 5 minutes I was feeling a real alert.  So I decided the first dose didn’t count and I sniffed another 40 mgs of MXiPR to equal a total of 60 mgs (or 80 mgs if you count the oral dose).


Within 15 minutes it starting building fast and came on like storm.


I am very familiar with all chemicals both endogenous and chemical and IMO there is an extreme SRI effect going on here, with practically zero dopamine release, along with the NMDA antagonism.


This coincides perfectly with what people are saying about MXiPR’s seeming lack of compulsive redosing, driving euphoria, tachycardia, etc.


Honestly it felt a lot like a mix between the boring Serotonin rush of MDAI (or that spacey feeling in your head from

 Harmala alkaloids) mixed with a  punch of mescaline psychedelia/visuals and heap of wonky/warpy dissociation more akin to MXE or spinning on alcohol then to 3-meo-pcp.  MXiPR was on the warm, empathogenic side, while simultaneously being quite chaotic and violent almost.

Like this compound is no joke.  Don’t expect it to lay out a blanket for you and ask you to lie down. It is a forceful and RUSHY chemical. Very strong and fast acting.


 I’ve never tried Ketamine.


3-meo-pcp at

small doses felt almost identical to Coca Tea for me (200 mgs cocaine orally with sedatives from the plant) Mild empathic stimulation.  Warm and euphoric.


If MXE was 2C-B

MXiPR is 2C-C

It’s not as different as say, 2C-B compared to 2C-E. 

So in that sense it’s more like the ketamine’s then the PCPs, if you catch my drift. 

It’s a less fun, less stimulating, less epic version that can only be called a “peripherally related” molecule. 

MXiPR rushes big and hard in a way that wants to be extremely euphoric/entactogenic, and is, but falls just short of delivering it in an amazing, classic way.  I didn’t feel like I “journeyed”. I just sat on my couch all stupid. 


It was decent and colorful and big and uncomfortable, that’s all I can say.  I agree with a previous poster that the come-up needs more “Legs”. It’s just NOT full enough and is missing something.   It’s physically quite forceful though not “run out of the house naked”…more like “I keep hearing voices and sounds that aren’t there and I’m looking around to see it was while rubbing my skin and staring at the wall and babbling”


I can handle a lack of good time but I have to be fully physically comfortable and I wasn’t at all.  but I also had a large dose of White Maeng Da Kratom (very potent) just before I dosed, and I’m almost certain that gave me a kind of Serontin Syndrome of sorts.   I had insanely strong jaw clenching and my skull was clenching in on itself.

I felt dizzy and the nystagmus was SO STRONG.  My eyes were darting back forth uncontrollably.


I’ve had similar bodily discomfort from dosing too much Syrian Rue with Trichocereus Bridgesii cactus  ![🌵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f335.png)

Highly NOT recommended. Insane jaw clenching and tachycardia from a shitty mixture of endogenous chemical release, on top of the Drugs regular stimulant effects on the nervous system.


I seriously couldn’t do anything on MXiPR.

I couldn’t focus on anything and was too uncomfortable to lie down into the trip and I wasn’t clear headed enough to follow any thought like AT ALL. I was a goldfish with perma 1 second memory for 3 hours.

It wasn’t horrible but it wasn’t fun.


Granted I use to drink strong alcohol ![🥃](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f943.png) when I holed on MXE so maybe that’s where some of the comfort came from but certainly I shouldnt have been that jittery ![😬](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f62c.png) on MXiPR alone.


Again probably the stimulating Kratom.

Don’t do that ![😊](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60a.png)


Next time I’ll try a slightly smaller dose all in one go and I won’t have Kratom before.  That should take away the serotonin syndrome type feelings. If not, this drug is shit and isn’t worth it.  My body was not comfortable until about 3 hours in (as it was subsiding after a Benzo and some NyQuil ![🥴](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f974.png)).


MXiPR seemed more chaotic then MXE though I can’t say for certain on one try.

MXE was a variable drug also and certainly played off of neurotransmitters enough to where every dose was a little bit different the the last.  But there was definitely a fierce tornado of effects breezing past my nerves chaotically.


The come down was a whole ‘nother story.


I’ve had the blessing of having tried 325 mgs of pure mescaline that I extracted myself (my most proud accomplishment!)

and I can say for sure that where MXiPR is unique from MXE is that an aspect of the experience actually feels a LOT like a 2Cx compound or one of any non psychedelic stimulants.


Pure mescaline feels like a clean, natural psychedelic version of MDMA in my mind and body.  There’s a crisp entheogenic and tactile ooze seeping out of the colorful visuals, the tripped out mind-state, and the goose-bumped entactogenic skin of the user. Mescaline is strange in that it’s seemingly gentle psychedelia creeps up on you. You think you’re having a great time. You think it’s really gentle. The you realize you are REALLY fucking high and it crushes you for 8 hours straight with a maelstrom of visions and Spaaaaaaaced out interstellar thoughts…..![🤯](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f92f.png)


As the wonkiness and body shakes of MXiPR subsided after a few hours in I was left with this incredibly reflective and clear mindset that was pleasant and quite a psychedelic glow.  It simultaneously had elements that were as clear as an LSD trip and others elements that were as foggy a drunk bender.


It’s worth another try.


I will report back as I proceed through different doses but yeah as of now:


MXiPR is not MXE at all though it manifested itself in the same way (though a lot quicker).


I don’t picture myself even being able to hole on this compound, sadly, and the intensity of the last dose was 75% body and 25% confused mind. There were strong colorful visuals but I couldn’t even look at anything longer then a millisecond because of the nystagmus.


 I can’t reiterate enough how physically jangly I was.  And I’m very experienced.


At 60 mgs nasal it was strong as a mutherfucker but my mind was boringly crystal clear the whole time and more focused on my jangly body and shallow thoughts to be immersed in anything euphoric or transcendental.


Alas the body brought the mind down for me.


Stay safe friends

All I remember from my MXE days was being able to dose a couple times and I’d end up being forced into closing my eyes and I’d travel through different scenery “rooms”. 


Then I’d go through another wall and end up in another taffy-cloud room with unique scenery.  Sometimes I’d be able to “see” my room perfectly even though my eyes were closed. Like X-ray vision. It was so real. 


When I closed my eyes on MXiPR my eyes would wiggle too forcefully too actually “see” anything. I could tell there were colors spinning but I couldn’t “look” at them. 


I started sweating and clamming up from

the serotonin syndrome feeling so I went to open the back door and it looked like the screen was closed but sure enough my girlfriend came out and got mad because our cat was in the house and I was oblivious that the door was wide open. I was just lying on the mat by the door with my eyes closed but just shaking and twitching in my body. 


My cat was just chilling he didn’t get up. And it’s not like I was in a total PCP style mania, I acknowledged my mistake and I got up and closed the door then went to the couch and later down. 


I was conscious and aware just long enough to do simple tasks but other then that I just was a complete wreck and all fucked up. 


MXIPR is NOT a party drug. 


Driving on it would be impossible. 


I wouldn’t even be able to be in public on the it. Not even my front lawn. Like if I stepped foot outside my house I would have gone into a full blown schizo mindset of paranoia. So don’t do that. 


You know that feeling when your stoned and you think people can tell you are high but then you realize that they can’t tell that you’re stoned? 


Well….


You DO look like that when you are on MXiPR. ![🥴](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f974.png)


Someone would immediately know you were a foaming schizophrenic mess if they laid one eye on you so don’t do that. 

Just be prepared to be a heaping dissociative mess for awhile at the higher end of the dose scale.

mXiPR seems to have a that really strong and drawn out SRI, antidepressant effect that others are reporting. 


No headache or hangover from the MXIPR and cannabis the next day was greatly trippy and enhanced. I like the effects the day after more then on the day I took it. 


Though I’m two days out and I’m still feeling the “serotonin brain” thing when I smoke weed. This drug definitely has strong, though not unpleasant, after effects.   


It you took this molecule every other day, you would basically be high 24/7. That’s how strong the residual is.

How much were you dosing?  I found it to last a pretty short time and not have much residual effect.  But it seems to be highly variable in people, moreso than most other dissos.

I dosed 80 mgs MXiPR total over the course of an hour. It as very short in immediate action, just a long afterglow. 


30 minute come up

1 hour peak 

5 hour tail 

1 day afterglow from cannabis. 


Not super high considering it’s about half as potent as MXE.  I have no immediate disso tolerance though having permanent-cross-tolerance wouldn’t surprise me. 


I blame my heavy cannabis intake for the lingering tail of effects.  Without cannabis I probably wouldn’t notice the dose lingering. I always feel higher the next couple days after a psychedelic from the cannabis synergy.

Since MXiPr tends towards a stimulating "colder" feel, and MXPr towards a sedating "warmer" feel, I thought maybe a combination would center the experience out?


I combined 25mg of both rectally. I did not particularly enjoy the experience. That I was still tired from using a couple of days in a row and came down quickly didn't help, nor that residue tinnitus quickly filled me with regret. But on the peak itself it just felt there was too much going on. The substances' respective character didn't cancel out as hoped, rather they were just layered on top, as could be reasonably expected I suppose.


Maybe it's because 25+25mg landed me in the dissociative uncanny valley. I doubt it though, considering tolerance. In any case, I will not be repeating the experiment.


(Alternating the substances was fine.)

I can concur. Back when i still had low disso tolerance i was messing around with MXiPR in order to create somekind of afterglow / antidepressant effect. I've also noticed it can change depending on which drugs you use afterwards. Even something as simple as benzo or diphenhydramine can affect it. With low tolerance and sporadic use these compounds can be just amazing and very surprisingly entactogenic, to the point i've tried psychedelics and emphatogens that can't compare.


 So i insufflated it 3 days in a row:

1st day (25mg) - sub-hole, entactogenic and mildly psychedelic experience (some acute tolerance from previous weeks present)

2nd day (25mg) - a lot stronger high than yesterday, but i didn't note much of the same entactogenic & psychedelic effects. Food did not taste good and watching TV was not as enjoyable as the 1st day.

3rd day (25mg) - Quickly started to close in like a heavy blanket. There were some short, mild entactogenic moments where i was thinking about people in my life. High became super intense and for a moment i closed my eyes and lied down on a couch and oh boy did i fucking hole and was transported into the world made out of colors. It felt like i had no body and/or i was being pulled and stretched across dimensions. Couple of times i thought i was dying and my heart was giving out (without worry). I speculate i lost awareness for 10 to 20 minutes, could have been less. Also the drug completely deconstructed my core, all the worries, all the overthinking, people, overanalyzing, every bad experience etc. etc. - all of which wanted to prevent this profound experience to happen just got demolished. Simply astounding.

Dammit, this MXiPr sounds awesome, and even though I momentarily cannot mess around with drugs, neither a disso nor anything else  (...I'm in rehab..., i.e., general supervision, regular drug testing, and whatnot...jeez!), I'm quite sure I have to get my '(sticky) fingers' on that stuff at sum time, afterwards!


So the general consensus is, that MXiPr is a somewhat more stimulating, while the MXPr is a sedative dissociative compound, or what?!


Would anyone probably take the time to describe the overall similarities/differences of both, and possibly even, which one is the preferable disso, especially regarding my preferences, which are/were MXE/MXM, 3-MeO-PCE/PCP.


Or wouldn't I regret giving both of these a try, at least? I mean they aren't super-expensive, so...


3-HO-PCP/PCE were ok, subjectively, but nowhere near as good as I've found said chemicals to be!


Thanks in advance...

Well I don't have frame of reference for MXM but I do have ungodly amounts of the holy MXE in my distant memory. I must have come across 3-MeO-PCP but have no recollection of anything special. I've recently had a dose of 3-MeO-PCE for serotonin-meddlin' purposes which is unforgiving on my tinnitus and all (my 5-HT blockers haven't shown up yet). But with having that frame in mind and that I've maimed my ears with 3-HO-PCP on an unfortunate not-even-that-pleasant binge, let's try and clarify the comparison.


I currently feel somewhat stoned on a 20mg of MXiPr even though I've used 20mg bumps of MXPr throughout the noon to do some gardening. It's a fresh kind of stoned, like a splash of water on a rock. It is not like the deep sedation of 3-HO-PCP, more of a hint or aroma if you want, of freshness, against the nice massages given by MXPr gardening. Feeling silly for having flipped attributes around, writing feels like MXiPr waves splashes on a MXPr shore. 3-MeO-PCE would have upset such balance. I'm combining with Vinpocetine which keeps the Na+channels closed for purposes of tinnitus reduction. But everything feels balanced and fine, and it's fun having substances around with a hot-cold dichotomy. This is not like 3-HO-PCP opiate-like not-caring-tuning-out, but balancing in the exact same way 3-MeO-PCE doesn't. 


Do take care of your set and setting even if they're dissociatives. Drugs can cause paranoia in other people. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Can you purify dmxe and mxipr with acetone? How many ml per gram?

Yes you can.  In general you want to use like maybe 15mL per gram.  Make sure it is anhydrous... buy 99% ACS grade anhydrous acetone, and then dehydrate it, as acetone absorbs water from the air.  To do that, get some epsom salt crystals, and bake them in the oven at 400 degrees for an hour.  Get a sheet of foil to lay them on, and cover it with another sheet of foil because they will pop sometimes and will fly all around if not covered.  Then when they're dry, let them cool and then open your acetone bottle and pour the salts in, as much as will fit.  Cap it and shake and swirl it around for a while.  Now you'll have dehydrated acetone, which will stay dehydrated for a long time, the excess crystals will settle at the bottom.


Get a shot glass and put the drug in, then pour the acetone over it, and stir it up for a couple of minutes, and pour it into another glass through a coffee filter.  The drug will stay on the filter.  Then do another wash the same way.  Then spread the drug out on the coffee filter and dry it out, a fan blowing on it helps.  And you'll be left with washed drug, and whatever impurities got cleaned will be in the acetone.

Yes, since it will have been slowly absorbing moisture, and even 1% of water will dissolve a lot of the drugs.  As a plus, it will remain dry for a very long time since the epsom salts will stay in there, just shake it up for a few minutes if you haven't used it in a while.

Yeah, well it's aluminum actually, they don't make tin foil anymore because tin is toxic.  You could use something else too, whatever it is, it just needs to be a layer of something to lay them on, and a cover.  I just say foil because it's readily available and works.

Mxipr is honestly some of the greatest stuff in the first half. Like putting your life on a filter of “nice glass of cab by a warm fire”


Once it hits the bland disso phase a bump of dmxe I’ve now found is just absolutely amazing. Mxipr, then dmxe when the “warmth” runs out. Game, set, match. It’s a winner.

The come-up is still pretty short, the duration is a tiny bit longer and it's way easier to reach a hole. After trying both ROA's I don't see any reason why I would snort it over eating it, other than the act of snorting itself, which many K users are accustomed to and might find pleasurable.

Interesting. I have only snorted 2-FDCK, and the only reason for snorting it was because it was attributed to be really similar ketamine, which I haven't tried yet.

Maybe I'll just test 2-FDCK out in the middle of the week. I'll hold sublingually for  30 minutes and than swallow it, like I did with MXE.

I find a good movie best sober.  When I want immersion, I download a 3D-SBS torrent and put on glasses. But what you said about DMXE really surprised me. While I did greatly enjoy dancing on 2-FDCK, the idea of it was suggested externally by ketamine's notoriety as a clubbing drug. But 4 times that I tried it above 40mg, MXE was perfect lying down. A true tripping substance.

Over last couple of years I've been reading about MDXE, MXiPr, FXE and wondering which one is the closest thing to MXE.

Just saw that FXE is not available anymore. Damn!

Anyone know if this has the same dosage as MXE???

I got a free 150mg sample and don't want to waste it.....when I did MXE I usually liked 100mg.

I haven't done dissos in a while but my usual dose of o-pce was around 40-50mg

I'm.not sure how that will translate to mxipr....

It's less potent than MXE for sure.  Maybe even only half as potent, but it's weird because it seems like it varies between uses... like for example, one night I took 120mg in 3x 40mg doses, and felt a light, enjoyable but very mild effect.  And then the next day I took 30mg one time and was very dissociated to the point it was uncomfortable and anxiety-producing.  Then the next time I took 40mg and had a profound experience where my girlfriend broke down and I somehow connected with her brain to brain and we had a therapy session and healed some stuff that was hugely bothering both of us, regarding my cat dying in her care due to her not paying enough attention because of being depressed (like 6 months earlier).  It has been all over the place for me.  Whereas once I got a feel for MXE, it was pretty consistent in effects.  It's also possible I just haven't gotten the feel for MXiPr yet... it seems that with every new disso, I have to do it enough times to "get it".

I did some tests on a new batch I received (crystal like appearance) in my lab and it didn't feel like mxipr at all. It was stimulating and even low doses app. 30mg gave an extreme increase in libido similar to the effect some people experience on cathiones or amfetamines. Do anyone have experience with a new crystal like batch or was it just mislabelled?

i... totally have been there.


dissociatives really open up the empathy channels. moreso than any serotonergic psychedelic, ime, or even mdma.


it just comes natural, the flow from human to human (or other animal)


i wonder what lsd + (disso of choice) + mdma (+ maybe weed) would be like... ah well, maybe when i'm 70.

This is the only derivatives of dissos I’ve missed. Trying to procure 2 grams of mxipr. I’ve beeen using 3-ho-pcp in low doses as a functional compound, but I want something more rectreational. How does it compare to mxe  and fxe. I’d like a shorter acting, warm, euphoric disso for occasional times when I wanna go deep. Totally got ripped off from this one vendor selling “MXE”. $170 a gram and multiple clients sent their samples in for analysis, and it came back as mostly FXE with some other compounds

I think this one checks those boxes. I never had the chance to go too deep with it, but I loved it at small and medium dosages. Pretty warm and lighthearted, physically euphoric, slightly stimulating and paired with weed it became somewhat psychedelic, so I feel it has great potential to go deep with it.

Wish I could use weed still, but ever since my doc put me on a diff ssri for the millionth time (lexapro) it completely ruined it for me. About 4 weeks into lexapro I eat 25mg edible which I can normally handle easily. What followed was a one of those worst panic attacks ever and it lasted for like 2 hours cause of course it had to be an edible and not a bing rip. Never before has my heart had such severe Tachycardia and palpitations and it lasted for what seemed an eternity. 


Even years after being off of lexapro I still get the same reaction. Sucks man. Are used to love to take dissociatives and then take a small hit off a vape pen because marijuana increases the effects of dissociatives exponentially, but now it would make me fly off the fucking handle and go insane which has happened.

But yeah I’m in the process of procuring 3 grams of mxipr. From all the research that I’ve gathered from reports and what not, it sounds like the perfect dissociative for me. Doesn’t last too long is more warm and fuzzy as opposed to cold and clinical. Hoping the transaction goes smoothly.

Is it still available? it seems out of stock everywhere. Hopefully it is not gone because the data obtained by this compound seems very promising ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Like no effects whatsoever?


That cant be right, this one is pretty potent and even with a hardhead i can feel a little something off a 50mg line. Could you imagine if dude just sent out Internet substance after this nonsense. Have you tried redosing, anything?

I'm a fan of it - though I prefer it most when combined with some DMXE and Ketamine.  Typically I'll make a nasal spray with like 2 parts K - 2 parts DMXE - 1 part MXiPr.


I find that MXiPr on it's own can be a bit unpredictable, the throttle can make it go from being a nice dose to overhwhelming and panicky, and by mixing it a bit, it seems to help to make things easier to dial in a bit.  I also think the DMXE adds some really nice warmth to the experience.  It's an all time favorite combo 'fishy spray'.

Besides knowing more about the 'overwhelming and panicky' bit, you recommend dmxe? I have the opportunity to get some and it sounds like it would be good with my mxipr, maybe take the edge off! Can you say good things about dmxe?

I call DMXE 'Warm K' - it behaves similarly to Ketamine, though tends to have a different level of intoxication (less impairing in some ways but can also be more slurry) - it's warmer feeling.  I feel like Ketamine is a 2am X-Files vibe whereas DMXE is a sunny hazy afternoon vibe.


Ketamine is Boards of Canada

DMXE is Khruangbin 


DMXE is an all-time favorite for me, but becareful with higher doses.  It can lead to panic attacks.


MXiPr has some of the warmth of DMXE, and some of the weird of Ketamine, but it can be more unpredictable.  I like it best mixed in so you don't overshoot too much as far as dose goes.

We tested it out 2 days ago, in a romantic setting.


Started with 20mg intranasal, which felt very serotonergic, stimulating, not really dissociating.

Euphoric, manic.


Then we redosed & layed in bed. First it was a bit hard to stay calm for me, after like 40-50mg. That went away as the doses got higher. Ventured into holing by consuming 30mg lines & some nitrous balloons.


All in all we took 150mg each from 9 PM to 7 AM. Also around 10-20 N2O balloons.


Time lost meaning, we had all kind of interesting thoughts & experiences.

I was stuck in a time loop once.


No anxiety. We reassured ourselves that it's allowed to experience this & that we're not dying right now.

The hole was less visual than with ketamine, very calm.


When we kissed, our bodies morphed into one blob.


Enjoyed it immensly.

In mid dose, there was something missing though.

The nitrous wasn't as good as when combined with ketamine.
