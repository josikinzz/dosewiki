**Dimethoxybromoamphetamine** (**DOB**), also known as **Brolamfetamine** and **Bromo-DMA**, is a psychedelic substituted alpha-methylated phenethylamine, a class of compounds commonly known as amphetamines. The phenethylamine equivalent of this substance (lacking the alpha-methyl group) is 2C-B.

This substance has no history of human usage prior to the 1991 publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in the book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved) by Alexander Shulgin. In modern times it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and described in his 1991 book.

In terms of its pharmacology, this substance acts as a selective 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist. Its psychedelic effects are thought to be mediated via its actions on the 5-HT2A receptor.

The DOB experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of DOB can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of DOB is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually static in its position and felt over every square inch of the skin as if it was coming from behind the users body. Occasionally however it manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, DOB is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming and are encouraged instead of forced. This results in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands at high dosages but encourages trippers to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. The level of stimulation varies between users however with some people reporting it to be somewhat similar to amphetamine in its intensity and others reporting that it is extremely subtle even at higher dosages. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **Enhancement of touch** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most DOB trips.
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Vasoconstriction** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages but can be particularly uncomfortable.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of DOB is described by many as one of mental stimulation and a powerful enhancement of a person’s current mental state. Many user report that it may not be as deep as other traditional psychedelics such as LSD or Psilocin and that it is comparatively empty in terms of its insightfulness.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is inconsistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

DOB presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colour**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

DOB presents a full and complete array of possible visual distortions which generally includes:

- **Drifting** (*Melting, Flowing, Breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of LSD, 25I-NBOME or 2C-B than that of Ayahuasca, Psilocin or 2C-E. They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, small in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a synthetic feel to them that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7A visual geometry over Level 7B.

*Hallucinatory states*

DOB is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - Although DOB is technically capable of producing of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, in comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, DOB will for most simply go straight into Level 7A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, LSD is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of DOB are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational DOB use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because DOB is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried DOC within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly but nothing can be completely guaranteed.

DOB is not physically addictive and many users experience a frequency self-regulating quality to the drug. Tolerance for DOC seems to be very mild and does not build up without repeated use over a short period of time.

**Legal Issues:**

- **International:** DOB is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
- **Australia:** DOB is schedule II
- **Canada:** Listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine.
- **New Zealand:** DOB is Schedule I (Class A) in New Zealand. DOB would also qualify as an “Analogue” under New Zealand’s catch-all Analogues section in Schedule 3 / Class C of their drug laws that would make 2C-I, 2C-E, DOI, DOB, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine Schedule 3 compounds in New Zealand.
- **Poland:** DOB is controlled in Poland.
- **UK:** DOB is Schedule I/Class A in the U.K., making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess without a license.

**Conclusion:**

Although DOB could be considered as bland and generic in comparison to DOC and other more traditional psychedelics, it is still a worthwhile experience and perfect for recreational events. This substance can be generally described as a less insightful version of LSD with a longer duration, generic visual and an emptier headspace.
