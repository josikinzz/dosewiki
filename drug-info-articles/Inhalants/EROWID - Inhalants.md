## Overview

Inhalants are chemicals in gaseous form or volatile solvents (liquids) that become gas at the time of use, which are inhaled for their psychoactive effects.

Common examples include:
- Gasoline
- Acetone
- Mineral spirits
- Freon
- Computer duster
- Glue

## Classification

- **Class:** Anaesthetic, Intoxicant, Dissociative

## Critical Health Warning

**There is no such thing as safe use of most volatile solvents, aerosols or other street inhalants: their psychoactive effects may be inseparable from nerve and organ damage.**

This caution indicates that the psychoactive effects cannot be separated from potential harm to the nervous system and organs. Documented cases exist of inhalant-related deaths and vision damage.
