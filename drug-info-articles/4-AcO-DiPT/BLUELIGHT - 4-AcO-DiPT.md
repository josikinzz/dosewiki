**Welcome to the main 4-AcO-DiPT thread!**


![200px-4-AcO-DiPT.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F6%2F64%2F4-AcO-DiPT.svg%2F200px-4-AcO-DiPT.svg.png&hash=054f0ebaa140c42acafda6ea70f9b74c)


​Up until now the 4-HO-DiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT thread has been a single one, to be found [HERE](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=57739)

It is now called the 4-HO-DiPT thread to prevent any further mixing, I will place links and the thread will be reorganized to

fill this one. Until then please refer to that other thread as your archive on 4-AcO-DiPT. Thanks! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


original post:


Well, I checked the Index and couldn't find this one so please forgive me if it was simply a vision/comprehension failure but have started a thread in the meantime.


Was recently gifted a sample of 4-AcO-DiPT (4-acetoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine - aka Ipracetin according to [its Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Acetoxy-DIPT)). There is also a minimal [Erowid Page](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_dipt/) and a [slightly more indepth personal introductory page by a user posted on Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_dipt/4_acetoxy_dipt_primer.shtml).


So far that is the extent of my findings. Any more info from the Good Folk of Swirlsville? My eyeball suggests I have around 250mg or so to play with but have yet to weigh it. Tasting it is being put off for now due to possible SS concerns with some of it's close relatives (5-AcO-DiPT specifically, I believe). Once I taper my daily tramadol dose to a level I can comfortably skip it for 24 hours testing will become possible, but till then any and all info would be greatly appreciated ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

yea in that 4-Acetoxy-DiPT Primer, by Toad you link to [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_dipt/4_acetoxy_dipt_primer.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_dipt/4_acetoxy_dipt_primer.shtml)...


Notice how many of the posts end up mentioning urgent irresistible skrocketing libido effects?


mmm hmmm.


Ever seen porn films where someone is given a potion and instantly everything starts to turn them on to the n-th degree and they cant stop themselves from doing it asap?  Alot like that only of course it does not hit instantly... but more like over a period of 15-25 minutes.

Oops yea thanks, edited a little... added some... yea the tremors actually feel GOOD imo... "orgasmic energy waves" imo.  VERY similar feel to the HO form, but a liittle slower in action.  A little.  Yes, less tremors.


Also, when it starts to wear off after 1 to 1.5 hrs you can redose the original amount and feel it just a well.  And again.  Even a 4th time to extend it out to 4 hrs if you want with little deleterious effect IMO.  Second time in a week still seems to work almost as good as the first.  But the third time in a week you get VERY strong tolerance, so that you need at least 1/3 more to get off the same.  If not more.

I wouldn'[t worry about SS. If anything the tramadol will SSRI aspect of the tramadol will weaken the trip.

I've only had the HO ester, but from what I gather they are very similar. I tried oral and IV routes with it, and I must say the oral route was far more preferable. IV administration didn't elicit very profound effects, but oral dosing did. I'm not sure if I injected the freebase or not actually, which would have been reckless and stupid.


I thought tramadol only caused serotonin syndrome with serotonin realeasers and MAOI? I gather it's a mild SSRI - I take venlafaxine daily and it has never clashed with these tryptamines (or phenethylamines, or ergolines).


Of the HO ester: The effects are magical. The visual field was shimmery, twinkly, sparkly. Warm saturation of lush colours. Very relaxed body and mind; I'd like to say sedating in a way. Or dreamy. A very friendly psychedelic headspace, lots of happiness. : )

I think it could possibly be a bad idea to take an SSRI with it's 5-methoxylated cousin (the infamous "foxy methoxy").


5-MeO subbed tryps are fair less benign than 4-subbed ones (as a rule).

I only tried this once a couple of years ago. Me and my girlfriend took 16 mg HCL each.


it was way too strong in the physical department. We were at a private party but had to leave and go home. Which was fortunately just across the street.


physical "energy" was really too much. I felt like I could not stand being inside my body. It´s very hard to describe, but I did not enjoy the sensation. My girlfriend felt the same, although she was more "mentaly" wasted in the begining, and the physical sensations came to her later. 


(Generaly she is more sensitive to tryptamines than me, and they always last longer for her aswell)


I have later tried DPT, and although similar, I found DPT´s energy to be much more pleasureable.


I have had plans to take 4-aco-dipt again, maybe just at a smaller dose, like 10 mg maybe. I have just never gotten around to it again. I guess it doesn´t have that high a priority to me anymore.

I too found the physical sensations uncomfortable. I took it once and would not take it again. Seems to have it's fans though!

Indeed, it does have its fans.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  In fact, I'm hoping this thread will fade quietly into obscurity before the cat jumps out of the bag and 


The OH- and Acetoxy- esters are quickly metabolized to the same compound (for both 4-substituted and 5-substituted variants), so there should be no difference except for slightly different dosage.  I can verify this experientially for the 5-x family.


The dose response curve is pretty steep for a lot of the tryptamines, and those with very short half-lives are particularly tricky.  You didn't mention the route of administration, but I assume that you were planning to take it orally.  When you're dealing with something that is cleared as fast as it is absorbed, the peak blood level may vary a lot depending on, for example, whether your stomach is empty or full.  


I found it much easier, therefore, to insufflate tiny bumps (2-5mg) at 5-10 minute intervals until an appropriate dose was achieved.  Insufflating tryptamines is not a joyous intranasal experience, but very small bumps aren't AS bad.  If that really bothers you, dissolving it in (preferably pH-buffered) saline just before insufflation helps.

I've actually enjoyed the physical sensations with the HO counterpart. It's got a slightly erotic flush to it. Is there any variance with the AcO ester (with the body-load)?

I never tried the HO counterpart, so I don´t know. But I would think the bodyload is the same.

I don't think I quite follow, Foxy is the 5-MeO counterpart so what is the boy component here? Is it because ester is a girls name?


For administrative clarity this link here is for the 4-HO-DiPT / 4-AcO-DiPT thread that combined the compounds for a long while before ever seeing that they are decidedly different. Thanks, mere suggestion as to the metabolism by Shulgin ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) .


Anyway I guess that we should start splitting this and reorganize the combined thread partially into this one. I'll put it on the to-do list.

The HO hits faster and harder but is over more quickly.  The ACO slows things down a bit, allowing a larger dose (I do 35-40mg, then again I am one of the "fans" who love the erotic physical energy... some folks find that uncomfortable) that comes on slower and lasts a little longer, up to 90mins instead of 45m - 1h with the HO.  One thing about both of these is you really need to CHANNEL the energy by either intensive concentration to focus it into the mental/psychedelic effects, OR sexual actiity to channel it into the physical which CAN feel really really good.  Both seem quite flexible and maleable.  BUT if you just sit or stand around or try to like just hang at a party or something, yes, the energy will build and build and make you uncomfortable.


With these, you MUST put the released energy to very deliberate use, either mentally or physically.  If not, it's just too intense.

I really did not need to channel 4-HO-DiPT whatsoever, not like a 5-MeO tryptamine - in fact it was one of the easiest psychedelics I have ever tried, period. Even when adding ketamine later on it all stayed well and fun, I saw shades melt and had an interesting synergy.


What other differences can you describe Dwayne or others, besides the time frame? Is it more deeply energetic in a way? More of a body high perhaps? What about the potential for euphoria?

The hydroxy is not an ester though - the hydroxy is necessarily an alcohol (an alcoholic indole actually, or 'indolol') the acetoxy is the acetyl or ethyl ester of that indolol.


Thanks for commenting on it anyway. But it's not more potent by weight is it?

Tramadol is an SNRI rather than an SSRI and it brought on SS in me when combined with LSD once which is why I'm very cautious in combining it with anything now. Even the slightest possibility of SS is too much for me. It really was a whole lotta no fun I can assure you ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

Wasn't the thread shared between hydroxy/acetoxy, because the analyses of the compound showed that it mostly was mitures of those? Due to synthesis and/or "degration"

My pal Randy tried 15mg of this, and the physical sensations were very, very uncomfortable. None of the pleasant tactile enhancement he'd heard about, only tension and restlessness. He tried to explore the erotic possibilities, and was able to perform (a couple times) but it was nothing special.


He also found it to be a little more visual and longer-lasting than expected: dosed around 7 PM and was still feeling some effects by midnight. Cannabis on the comedown may have contributed to that.

I had a decent amount of experience with this one. Some of the main points I remember about this drug is the warm glow during the come up. Crazy auditory hallucinations, mostly, everything sounded as if it were at least two octaves lower. Also, at higher doses, I remember getting brain zaps - which resulted in me not researching this compound further. Very interesting though!

What's a "brain zap"?  Describe in detail please.  Convulsions?  Siezure?

It's mostly associated with MDMA and SSRI use. There's a wiki page on it if you want to look up the details. They're no fun but not dangerous, as far as I know. Interesting that somebody would report having them from a tryptamine though cos they're not generally associated with them. Does fit with the SS possibility I've seen mentioned though. Possibly.

despite that I've never been on a long term regimen of SSRIs I've gotten these "brain zaps" (quick, electric like jolts in my head. More common to occur with eyes closed) on a variety of drugs - hydrocodone, 2ci, mescaline, and 2ce. I'm not sure what the deal is, they're always completely random and I have repeated zaps for about 15 minutes and then they usually go away.

This is a story of SWIM, I found this story in a box. 


23mg does. 

“I am coming off 4-aco-dipt. I dosed 4 hours ago and now I am coming down, but I see visuals on the white of the ms word doc behind the letters.  I am see reds, and fine details. Details that are probably always there but are never noticed. After all what is white anyway.


I think I speak for everyone when I say that the visuals that one gets off the psychedelics is always similar. But we always want to see more, to see if we can find out what the visuals really are. I believe that the visuals are always with us at all times of everyday reality. However the drugs make it easy to see what is already in front of us, or inside our mind. We can’t have the white of the screen or the black of the dark screen without visuals. 


In other words the visuals are nothing more than what you see. 


What you think are solid objects are nothing more than thoughts in your mind.  Sounds, noise etc. all the same. Just thoughts, we are just a thought that transfers to other thoughts. 

Without intelligence the universe will not exist in the form that we understand it. 


This is what I got from 4-aco-dipt. I noticed more OEV than CEV. 


I would like to add.. Swim was watching tv at one point and the visuals were strong. he could remember seeing faces start to distort and could also see faces on the back of there heads, like faces made out of hair. 


Swim has read that most people dont get OEV on this unless taking 35-40mg dose. Interesting swim had visuals at 23mg. swim noticed that 23 mg of this stuff due to the fact that its really fluffy looks like a larger dose. Maybe people who take 20mg are really just eyeing the dose and they are not taking as much as they think. I cant understand why the OEV at 23. 


“


So I thought I would share what I found in a box.

I didn't have many notable visual alterations until i got to the 35-40mg mark myself, YMMV i suppose.


Also, no need to SWIM here ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)  it offers no protection & makes posts difficult to read.

Good to know on the swim... 


Anyway I did note that when weighing this stuff out, what I would have thought to be 40mg was only 22-23mg on my scale. For the most part I think the scale is good to .002 but who knows. 


I have done 2c-i many times, 4-aco-det, LSD, ecstasy (similar perhaps mde or mda not sure if mdma) shrooms, salvia, 5-ho-mipt and a few others in the past 6 years. They all seem so similar. 


What was interesting to me was the ability to leave off from the last experience. In other words, I took 4-aco-dipt 7 years ago and it was the first of all drugs I have ever done and from that time I took many others and just a few days ago I took 4-aco-dipt again. And it was almost a continuation from the last time i took a substance and from just about any experience for that matter. 


I remember a time when I had 5-ho-mipt and I took the recommended dose only to find that I fell asleep without feeling much of anything. the next time I took more around 35mg to have a full blown trip, I remember the room morphing and changing as I was talking with my cousin on the phone and telling him this stuff, he said "I hope you didn’t take too much" of course this worried me but he said I’m sure you will be all right. The point is even though this was 4-aco-dipt at one point the room started to get weird (or I should say my mind or concept of room)... and the thought crossed my mind “i hope i dident take too much" the fear was the same as the time i took 5-ho-mipt. 


The peak was not as long and I was yearning for more. 


I have some 5-aco-mipt that I am excited to try next week. And I am also looking forward to 4-aco-dmt... but boy am i upset i never had a try at 5-meo-dmt. =( i really think i was ready for that. 


And last I always wondered if salvia experience is the same as 5-meo-dmt... because on salvia i lost my body as i understand happens with 5-meo-dmt.

I've tasted 4-aco-DIPT at 12mgs and had some racing thinking and audio distortion a bit. Had two other friends, taste this at 32mgs and one shat herself and was completely unaware of what was going on for a good 2 hours while we tried to get her to shower herself, and the other had very intense and uncomfortable tactile sensations and no visuals. This is the kind of thing that happens when you are tripping acid, and let your friends who don't know as much about RCs as you determine what their dose should be. I'm generally pretty good at determining the dose, but the friend that I let do this is a bit heavy-handed. Other friends tried this one at 20mgs and had a fabulous time, they even nicknamed it "shine."


EDIT: my friend who shat herself, later said she really enjoyed the experience and that her thoughts were racing superfast and having multiple streams of thought happen at once and was unable to discern from the things that were going on in her thoughts and what was actually happening. Although, feels she took took much. From an outsiders perspective, it seemed a bit like she was reliving a traumatic incident that had occured to her a few months prior while traveling abroad.


I'm really excited to see what these two who took 32MGs will think of 5-meo-dipt, because both individuals have also tried moxy. The girl who shat herself did not like moxy, but did like 4-aco-dipt, the boy who had adverse tactile sensations on 4-aco-dipt, did like 5-meo-mipt. My hypothesis is that what the like/dislike preference is is to the Diisopropyl group, either that or both have an aversion to the acetoxy, which is the only ACO compound my research crew and I have tasted in this range. 


I personally have tasted 5-meo-mipt, 4-aco-dipt, DiPT, and 5-meo-mipt. I enjoy 5-meo-dipt, DiPT was alright but not too spectacular, I don't think I had enough experiences with 4-aco-dipt to fully explore it's effects profile, and I have had one trip with Foxy at 8mg that gave me some intense body tremors. I have quite a bit of 5-meo-dipt left and need to explore it at lower doses (7mg) or in a different medium (I put some of the foxy in a solution of everclear, and I'm a bit of a pussy when it comes to alcohol where drinking 4mL (2mg/mL) of everclear still makes me want to vomit. heh.)

I am going to look into rectal admin.. As I did this with 12 mg of 2c-i and it was great. It seems you need less to get the same effect and the body load is much less. I have had a good deal of experience with 2c-i. I do fear for my sanity due to my research. I love my thoughts I get from this stuff however I do have crazy ideas. I sometimes think that we each will get to experience one another’s life at some point after our life. And not just each other but each blade of grass, the pigs, dogs, cats and down to ants and simple single cell organisms. In other words I get the trippy thought that not only is everything connected but experience is also connected. This all came after I started with the psychedelics.


do i really think that, not really but do i think it makes sense? kind of.. More so then religion. maybe its not so bad after all.

I keep saying this but I guess that's the way it goes... 4-aco-dipt is for the majority of people NOT psychedelic.  But it does have its use... for many it gives an intense body buzz that makes them extremely horny and strongly enhances tactile sensation and orgasm.  I suppose you could call that a "body hallucinogen."  Some like the sensation and some don't, just depends on the individual.   Personally I think it feels awesomely pleasurable, but I can see how if I did not "work off" the excitement that it could just feel aggravating.  I have tried it after 2C-I has kicked in and the same with Methylone, great in both cases.  While I can feel less, I need at least 35mg to get off to a degree that is really enjoyable, and sometimes go as high as 45mg.  I find I enjoy redosing 1-3 times at 1 hour intervals, using about 2/3 initial dose.  This works in one session, but next day a noticeable tolerance has ensued, and a third time in a week it is about 1/2 as potent at least for me, and at that point it seems like such a waste... better to only abuse this at most a couple times a month.  At most once a week or tolerance tends to increase over time.

Dwayne, I did the 4-aco-dipt the one time at 22mg and I really got some visuals. It started when I was looking at myself in the mirror and bam it was the typical visuals I would see on any of these substances. My face started to resemble interesting shapes of different sizes and color. Not like a mushroom trip to the extent of melting, troll looking but the out of place body parts and oddness.  At 30mg I would only think it would be more obvious. 

I did experience a tremors in my legs, a bit shaky but nothing that bad to not want to do this again, however a bit unsettling looking back.

I also was thinking that the visuals we get off this stuff might be due to memory of visual field being delayed. Think about it, if you forget what you are looking at the only thing your brain can do is try to replace it with something. That is why when you move your eyes to something else it comes into focus before the visuals start again.

Interesting... well I was just saying I never got visuals from it that I really noticed, but its a strong tryptamine so sure that's not too surprising.  But there are far better more effective tryptamines if you are pursuing visual or other psychedelic effects... I still say this one is better suited as an erotic body buzz type experience than as a trip generator.  12mg I can see being too low to create a significant physical buzz yet enough to cause a few mildly noticeable visual alterations, sure, but dont be expecting any sort of major trip from this... look elsewhere if that's what you want.

There were definitely physical effects at 12mg too, but they were uncomfortable. I wouldn't quite call it "agony", but I couldn't wait for it to end. Didn't find the body sensations from 5mg of 5-MeO-MiPT very pleasant either... maybe I'm dosing too low or maybe these effects just don't work for me. Might try combining the iprocetyl with methylone next time.

Alot of people find 8mg 5-meo-mipt pleasant and erotic, as well as anywhere from 25-35mg 4-aco-dipt.  It is an odd sensation, and if you just sit there and grit your teeth "waiting for it to end" yes I can see how the impression would be negative.  Especially if you do less than those amounts, it is just irritating instead of being a full-on proper "effect" if you know what I mean.  You kind of need to DO SOMETHING WITH the feeling (i.e., sex or masturbation), you need to EXPEND the extra energy not just try to "contain" it somehow or wait it out or whatever... THEN the "irritation" can rapidly be channeled into "pleasure."  *USE* the nerve-energy that is being generated.  If you just sit there and stew in it, yea, sensations like that are always going to seem uncomfortable. 


Some people find these kinds of "nerve-jangling" sensations intrinsically exciting and provocative and thus enjoy them, while a good percentage of people find them annoying and negative, I guess it just sort of depends how you are wired.

update. 

Last night i took 27 mg of 4-aco-dipt with a friend. The effects started 30 min after dose. The body load was there but not to out of control. I just sat in bed waiting. At the 1 hour mark the visuals were really good. At 1.3 hours the physical effects were just about none. 


I was looking at my friend in the eyes and the visuals were breath taking. His eyes were the only thing i saw, and the ripples on his sweat shirt blended in with the shadows under his eye lids, and smile etc.. The outline of his body was popping out and in the end he started to blend into the back ground. his face was unrecognizable and turned into other faces and dark looking evil creature and just as i though i would lose my mind and forget about the room i was in, his face came back into focus and to loop into the same above visuals again. 


At one point we turned on the TV and laughed at the ridiculousness of the actors and the news was also funny. the " and back to you" and the facial expressions were so exaggerated it was just insane. at one point i paused the TV using the DVR and the faces were morphing like unreal and the room with it. Everything turns into small pixels of light. 


We doses at 8:10PM and the effects were over at 1:00 leaving just physical effects, i was sleeping by 3:50 or so. 


27mg did it for me, and i will do this again for sure. 


I have 5-meo-mipt but i am not sure if i want to try it yet.

Is this stuff 4-aco-DiPT, and 4-HO-DiPT 'legal'?


The erowid 'law' page says only controlled in Japan and Sweden (as of 2005)?

OK no 'vendor' talk, how about legal talk, anyone, are the above substances 'scheduled' in the UK?

i think legality is every person's responsability. i mean, woudl you risk your freedom because some guy on the internet you never met tells you its ok to have something on you?


and if people havent tried psychedelics with inhalants it probably means you should read up a bit more as to why that is, than just jump streight in and do it yourself.

(personally i dont think people do it because of the limited effects of amyl, short effects and after effects that can taint a trip... but thats just me)

**A RANT forgive me**


Points taken Kingme,


I discovered on anther thread these chems are illegal ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)EVERYTHING IS FUCKING ILLEGAL,![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif) why? Who knows? 8) Probably because it's fun to visit another place and the fucks who own us hate the thought that other people might lose control doing that now and then. They live for power and control, after all. It's the drug they're on.


Yes, we're owned like battery hens. We have to just deal with it. WE let them tell us what to put in our bodies. WE kowtowed, now we scuttle about in the shadows tasting chems that have no business being scheduled in the first place.


Sorry that's not a rant at you, I've had a bad week with some big plans for a nice chemical time going sour thanks to where I live...


As for inhalants, some of the 'mixed' trip reports here beggar belief that the reporters are still alive! Why would inhalants necessarily be any worse?


There is, so far NO info on inhalants I can find (and I have virtually LIVED on BL for the past week)  apart from nitrous, but you're on to something when you suggest they may not be long lasting enough to warrant a try.

^ here's what erowid has to say about inhalants..


"Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of most volatile solvents, aerosols or other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects may be inseparable from nerve and organ damage."


on another note, had a dream about taking 4-AcO-DiPT last night....looks like it may be time to order more, this is one of my girlfriend's favorites. She loves sex though so what can you expect

Adequate doses of this substance seem to be accompanied by a very strange and uncomfortable emptiness in the stomach.. I dosed 15mg with powdered ginger to help avoid this but was unsuccessful. Has anybody any ideas how to counteract gastric disturbances with this substance??

I've never encountered that. When did you last eat before dosing?

Fresh ginger is supposed to be much better for nausea than powdered ginger but I've not heard of an "uncomfortable" emptiness with anything before.

It started when I was looking at myself in the mirror and bam it was the typical visuals I would see on any of these substances. My face started to resemble interesting shapes of different sizes and color. Not like a mushroom trip to the extent of melting, troll looking but the out of place body parts and oddness.  At 30mg I would only think it would be more obvious.

Think about it, if you forget what you are looking at the only thing your brain can do is try to replace it with something. That is why when you move your eyes to something else it comes into focus before the visuals start again.

I'm strongly considering trying 4-AcO-DiPT this weekend with aMT. My girlfriend is an extreme hard head when it comes to psychedelics ( from years of doing too much acid way too often in her younger days). She usually likes 60mg of most 4 subbed Tryptamines (4-aco-dmt, 4-aco-met, 4-ho-mipt etc) and even at that does she always totally composed and lucid. I was thinking about 40mg 4-aco-dipt for her. I have looked up dosages on erowid and read through this thread but I was hoping to hear from some other "hard heads" when it comes to this stuff.

Well, I'm no hardhead but I do like the occasional 50mg of 4HOMET. That said, 20mg 4ACODIPT is more than enough for me.

Since it's a HR forum, I'd recommend taking 20-30mg orally and maybe laying out a premeasured line or 2 to snort if it doesn't prove to be enough.

I'd definetly wait 3hours into the aMT before redosing anything.


Has your GF trouble with "letting go" (of the Ego)?

DON'T TAKE THE REFERENCED DOSES UNLESS YOU ARE EXPERIENCED AND READY FOR THEM.  THESE ARE NOT RECOMMENDED NOR STANDARD DOSES.


4-aco-dipt requires a larger dose in my experience.  More like 80-90 mg compared to her standard of 60.


My own experience with 4-ACO-DIPT involves the craziest visuals of my life (right there with 25C, less crazy but more beautiful) and a nasty ass comedown.  I took a combination of a massive dose of 4-AcO-DIPT, a medium dose of 2C-I, and a medium dose of 4-AcO-DMT.  Some of you will probably attribute the comedown to 2C-I, but I've never gotten this type of feeling from any 2C.  Ok, first of all the trip wasn't strong enough so after about an hour I redosed with an equal amount of 4-AcO-DIPT to what I did the first time ( I estimate 40 mg ) and over the next hour my brain started feeling dumbfounded.  I was decently energized, but not at all stimulated like with 4-HO-DET.  At this point I was still functional, and then the crazy visuals started developing... things warping in on themselves, patterns in the air, shapes not consistent... it was a whole lot less based around color than phenethylamines and much more based around weird wobbly effects (like tracers) and morphing and swirling.  At this point I was in awe of the visuals, not realizing how badly my brain felt fried.  Then, sometime later, the energy disappeared.  However, the visuals halfway remained and the fried feeling intensified... I was useless, couldn't do shit.  I started feeling depressed, even.  I realized I just needed to smoke some weed and go to sleep, so that I did.


So this was one of my best trips ever, however it left me with the opposite of an afterglow.  Upon waking the next day, I immediately started crying and was depressed the whole day.  Also, no effects on sound.

But there are far better more effective tryptamines if you are pursuing visual or other psychedelic effects... I still say this one is better suited as an erotic body buzz type experience than as a trip generator.  12mg I can see being too low to create a significant physical buzz yet enough to cause a few mildly noticeable visual alterations, sure, but dont be expecting any sort of major trip from this... look elsewhere if that's what you want.

Not for me, but then again my dose was massive.  My visuals from this are what I would expect from LSD... they're fucking insane.

Yeah I just had to go back and read my combo trip report.


4-HO-DiPT required 44mg after 2C-I and 4-AcO-MiPT to produce a strong +++ for me and I was very much a tryptamine hard head.


4-AcO-DiPT is significantly less potent... I'd say if 60mg is her normal, 80-90mg might be right for 4-AcO-DiPT by itself but it has a lot of side effects at higher dosages (including the tremor of 4-AcO-DET) that seem to be independent of tolerance. Its an insanely visual compound but it does have a pretty brutal crash as bloodshed pointed out.


I honestly don't think that 4-AcO-DiPT and AMT would be a very good combination but if it sucks, 4-AcO-DiPT doesn't last very long (it will likely gain an hour extension from the combo however). 40mg sounds like a reasonable dose of 4-AcO-DiPT but it also depends what your AMT dosage is.


The main concern would be the fact that 4-AcO-DiPT leaves you pretty tired when it has worn off and AMT doesn't generally have enough of a stimulated push to overpower a crash from another substance.

She truly doesn't, her and onne other comrade in our research group are the hardheaded of the bunch. They used to have an unlimited supply of just ultra potent WOW blotter and they probably abused that shit... This is before I ever met any of them in the early 90s. I met them just as that WOW blotter connection disappeared but I did get to sample it more than once. Anyhow, I don't think it's any coincidence that both of them now require the largest amounts of drugs to get where they want to be out of everyone in our group. Acid has a way of pushing boundaries if you survive (psychologically) "heavy" experiences with it. 

She is quite comfortable on 6-8 hits of strong acid and told me MANY tales of those early 90s WOW days about complete ego death (something I don't think I've experienced on any psychedelic yet despite some heavy Acid trips -6 hits).

I had it all wrong I guess, I really thought 4-aco-dipt had a much lower dosage than the rest of the 4 subbed tryps? I really appreciate that clarification everybody! The aMT I have is without a doubt degraded as she did 60mg last time and I did 40mg and we both found it pretty mild so we're thinking of going 60mg aMT for me and 80mg aMT for her. Very cool "tracer" or sort of "shutter" effect like visuals from the aMT though and last time after the 4-ho-dpt started to ware off we dropped some 4-aco-met with utter fantastic results! It's like the aMT allows you have 2 possible seperate trips if you take it first with something that last about 4-6 hours then drop something else. 

I think I'm more comfortable giving her just the 40mg first and see how it goes only because after I weighed out that 40mg gel cap she picked it up and said she got a nervous feeling about it and that's never happened with any drug ever with her. I'm very sure all will be fine I'm just a very cautious guy. I really appreciate all you fine people's wisdom! Thank you muchly!

**4 ACO DiPT /// just my thought.**


![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)my dogs not sure what to think of this chem. %)


mixed with ethyl , 4 aco dmt, it was some of the most beautiful things ive seen. 


but id say id save it for a club almost as for a mdma sub


unless used in a combo with such things like mdma. lsd, 4 aco dmt, 6apb.to name a few its a very unique took used for only the perefct situration 


tonight i chjill with a strong cup of yerba mate, ethyl bumps, kratom, and Flubromazepam and enjoy my night. 


alone its very stimulating and almost too much and not worth it. but ive come to enjoy with the right combo and dose,its a drug that seems to need another chem to snyrgize w to fully get the glwpgin full potential.


it has its place. but it takes time to really find it .


a good combo and benzos are needed atleast for me to get any enjoyment. 


im not sure what this is..not a trip report, ,,, just a genereal rant on what a person w much experiance thought of this chem.


garbage rant,,![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif) perhaps

Trip report & some questions - 


Dosed 15-18mg 45 min before going to a dance party which turned out to be really awkward. The intent was a practice run to see gauge its effects and see if it's worth dosing higher. Ultimately I'm not sure what to make of this substance.


 First alerts around T+0:20 including some nausea that peaked shortly before the drug's peak (~T +1:00) and never completely went away, even after taking both tums and alka-seltzer. I ate a light meal an hour or so beforehand - not sure if that made it worse or better (depends on the drug with me). There was definitely a nice body high and a heightening of tactile sensations, which came in waves - about the equivalent of 3-4mg of 5-MeO-MiPT though a bit shorter-lasting - the peak had passed by about T+1:40. 


It was classically "trippier" at this dose than I had expected from reading other reports. While in the bathroom of the club the graffiti started swirling and I experienced mild auditory hallucinations - a wah-wah sound effect in the music (soul & RnB) seemed to isolate itself from the rest of the song and enter reality, as if there were something emitting it in the next room. I also felt this effect to a much greater extent (music decomposing into separate tracks that then mutate independently of each other) on 4HO-MiPT. It was the only time during the trip that I noticed auditory effects; the music sounded great on the dance floor and visually everything stayed heightened throughout, as with a super-mild mushroom trip. Once the nausea passed I think dancing would have been fun, but the party was kind of wack and we left pretty fast. No euphoria, which might have been due to the low dose or the awkward setting. A bit dissociative, odd for such a body-loaded substance. Slightly dazed headspace, and mild jaw tightness even on 800mg of chelated magnesium. I was still a little high but ready to sleep by about T+3:30. 


As with 5-MeO-MiPT, this seems to be a substance that (for me) requires physical activity in order to avoid uncomfortable muscle tension. My pet theory is that my fast metabolism accelerates the body discomfort associated with MiPT and DiPT-related drugs, and the only way to keep it from settling in is to move constantly. I'm not sure if dosing higher would be worth it, since I'm worried that I'd be too disoriented to move enough. Can anyone with more experience with this stuff comment? Does the muscle tension ramp up enough to compete with the high as you increase the dose? How common are visual and auditory hallucinations? No one seems to say much about them except at what seem to me like insane doses (40+mg).

Hello,


I just received a sample of 30mg of 4-ACO-DiPT.


I plan to try 5mg since I'm sensitive to psychedelics, will it do the job ? Can I do an allergic test first and then drop the remaining? Will the tolerance be there allready with the allergy test?


My plan is to take 5mg, wait 30 - 45minutes and take 10mg more to test the water.


The next trial (if the first goes well) is to take 15mg at once.


Any insights?


Do you like 4-ACO-DiPT?


I heard the duration is short like 3 hours, is it true ?


Thank you and have a nice day !

I doubt 5mg will do much, that is an extremely low dose.  Still, it couldn't hurt to try as your first dose.  15mg might turn out to be perfect for you, or you might wish for more.  it's hard to say.  have you done any other 4-sub-tryptamines?  If so, what dosages did you like for those?

I like this compound a lot. It's not very visual, but the body high is great and the headspace is easygoing, yet still psychedelic. This compound is somewhat similar to psilocybin mushrooms, but its signature is very unique -- it's the most atypical of the commonly available 4-sub tryptamines. It's quite possible that you'll become extremely horny while under its influence, so make sure that you have a sex partner and/or time alone. Orgasms on this one are even better than on most other psychedelics. On the downside, some tremors and shakiness, particularly on the legs, might become annoying (I actually enjoy that aspect, though) -- this is energetic material. The comeup will almost certainly be quite fast -- fifteen to thirty minutes (at most) -- so keep that in mind. The duration of the experience should be four to five hours (with possibly another hour or two of residual stimulation). (4-HO-DiPT provides a somewhat shorter experience. It's also a little more "aggressive".)


You should do a 1mg allergy test -- put that horrible tasting thing in your mouth and wait for an hour or two. If everything is fine, then take 15mg orally (at once, rather 5mg + 10mg). You should cap it or parachute it... Otherwise, you will hate me forever -- it tastes *that* bad.


For the record, my doses have always been between 15mg and 30mg, with the upper range being my sweet spot.

Hi,


I only tried 10mg of 4-HO-MET which was a decent and strong trip.


What's wrong about trying 5mg then wait 50min and take 10mg ?


Thank you !

4-HO-MET is significantly more potent than 4-AcO-DiPT, Kishka. 15mg of the latter is roughly comparable to 10mg of the former. Don't waste your sample. If in doubt, take 12mg at once. You'll be fine, unless you're one of the folks that gets DiPT-related GI issues, and even then, it should be manageable at that dose. Don't worry. Just go and have a hedonistic night... That's mostly what this compound is for.

Well the reason it's better to take it all at once is because 5mg plus 10mg later will be significantly less effective than just taking it all at once, because psychedelics begin to cause short-term tolerance very quickly.  Since you only have 30mg I just think you want to use it as effectively as possible., and I can almost 100% guarantee that 5mg will be threshold at best.

Hi,


Yes I think I'm gonna do 10 first and maybe redose 5mg in 30 - 45minutes. Anyway I plan to try it next week because I took mushrooms 2 days ago ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also, I have a question, I've heard that 4-ACO-DiPT is uncomfortable physically, is it true? I won't be able to trip with someone unfortunately, I mostly trip by myself.


I have another question, after how long the psychedelic tolerance "reset"? Is 7 days enough to trip again? 


Let's say I take Mushrooms, will I be able to trip again on a tryptamine or lysergamides or even phenethylamines 7 days afterwards ?


Thanks so much to everyone ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Yeah 7 days is generally enough time fore tolerance to clear.

Thanks. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  And no problem.


Yeah in general psychedelics all cause short-term tolerance that lasts around 7 days.  Although if you trip every 7 days then gradually you'll acquire more tolerance so it's probably actually a bit longer than that before 100% of the tolerance build-up is gone.  But after 7 days you should be able to trip fine again.  The NBOMes, being full agonists, seem to produce tolerance for at least twice as long as other psychedelics.  Each drug family produces more tolerance for other members of its family - tryptamines produce the most tolerance to tryptamines, for example, but they also are all cross-tolerant, so taking a tryptamine will still produce some tolerance to phenethylamines and lysergamides.  Also of note is that smoked short-lasting psychedelics seem to produce a shorter period of tolerance, and less tolerance.  Smoked DMT doesn't seem to produce tolerance too much for other things, in my experience, or at least it doesn't last long.

Allrighty, all of my dose are oral. So I can fully take the 4-ACO-DiPT in 7 days? Will I be able again to take AL-LAD 7 days after?


I'm on vacation and I plan to do the 4-ACO-DiPT then 7 days later the AL-LAD ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes to both! Be aware that you should wait about ten days to reset after AL-LAD... Lysergamides cause a bit more tolerance than tryptamines and phenethylamines.

We're glad to be of help! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


BTW, you were worried about 4-AcO-DiPT's reputation for physical discomfort. Unfortunately, a fair number of people experience this, and it usually manifests in nausea and other GI problems, along with the tremors that I also mentioned earlier. I never experience the stomach issues with this compound (or with 5-MeO-DiPT, for that matter), but be prepared for that possibility.

I set my mind.


I will do 10mg first + 5mg as a reboost 40 min later.


Next trial will be 15mg at once.


Should be good ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'm excited, hope to tremors won't be a pain in the ass.


Also, does this compound make the heart pounding like 4-HO-MET? Sometimes I get very uncomfortable and get very hot with 4-HO-MET.


How is this with 4-ACO-DiPT?

Tremors are almost inevitable with this one, especially on the upper legs, but these are usually present during the first half of the experience only. Regarding the tendency of 4-HO-MET to (seemingly or in fact) elevate your heart rate more than what is normal for a psychedelic and to cause you to feel uncomfortably hot, I haven't encountered such problems. Ditto re. 4-AcO-DiPT. Nevertheless, in order to minimize potential discomfort, you should stay in an air-conditioned area (or at least a cool area) on the day that you take 4-AcO-DiPT. You should also avoid caffeine on that day, because that substance will not only increase your heart rate, but also function as a diuretic (it can dehydrate you).

I always thought it was interesting how the reports of this vs 4-HO-DiPT seem to vary moreso than most HO/AcO pairs.  DiPT in general devaites from the standard tryptamine (or indeed, psychedelic) effects profile.

Took 20mg a couple hours ago. Almost zero visuals to this. Headspace is there. Not boring but just feel like laying around in mental stillness. 


Did have some 2ce a couple days ago so tolerance could be at play.

Tolerance will have been a factor in that case.  But I find the -DiPTs to be decidedly nonvisual.  I find 4-HO-DiPT quite boring for a 4-sub.  I haven't had 4-AcO-DiPT, but DiPT itself is incredibly unique and worthwhile for its uniqueness with how it affects sound (nothing else even remotely like it).  But the 4-subs do not share this property and to me just seem like weak, rather transparent and uneventful tryptamines.

Laying around in mental stillness is exactly how I would describe most of my 4-HO-DiPT experiences. Funny thing is, it can apparently sneak up and give you an unexpected ++++ when you least expect it. It's never happened to me, though
