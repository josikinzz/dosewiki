## Subjective Experience

This is a strange trip report to write, not only because this is not the first time I have
sampled 1P-ETH-LAD, but because I have used it in combination with AL-LAD and
1P-LSD on several occasions. Although combinations are not something I usually
entertain, and certainly don’t encourage, I find that lysergamides are not particularly
taxing in terms of body load, at least when only mixed together.

The problem I have here is that through mixing these chemicals I have largely
forgotten the details of the prior individual 1P-ETH-LAD experience. Given that my
memory is flawed, I feel ill equipped to write a detailed report. Hence, this particular
log is not

**1-Propionyl-6-ethyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethyamide** (also known as **1P-ETH-LAD** ) is a semisynthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) chemical class. It is a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) analog and suspected [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) to [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) , which shares a close structural relationship with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) . Anecdotal reports suggest that this compound produces largely similar psychedelic effects comparable to [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) or [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) .

Like its parent compound ETH-LAD, this compound has been reported to be moderately to significantly more potent than LSD itself. It has also been reported as being subtly different in effect to LSD and is often described as being more visual and synaesthetic, with a deeper, less emotionally-charged headspace analogous to that of psychedelics like [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) . It has also been reported to be more likely to induce undesirable effects like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) in addition to pronounced [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and other [discomforting physical effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Discomforting_physical_effects) it displays relative to other lysergamides.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 1P-ETH-LAD, and it has little history of human usage before January 2016. It has recently become commonly marketed alongside other [designer psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) such as [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) and [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) as a legal alternative to LSD and is commercially distributed through online research chemical vendors.

## Chemistry

1P-ETH-LAD, or 1-propionyl-6-ethyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide, is a semi-synthetic alkaloid of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) family. 1P-ETH-LAD is a structural analog of lysergic acid, with an N, N-diethylamide functional group bound to R N of the chemical structure. This core polycyclic structure is an ergoline derivative and has [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) and [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) groups embedded within it.

1P-ETH-LAD's structure contains a bicyclic hexahydro indole fused to a bicyclic quinoline group (nor-lysergic acid). 1P-ETH-LAD does not contain a methyl group substituted at R 6 of its nor-lysergic acid skeleton; the nor- prefix represents this. Instead, 1P-ETH-LAD is substituted at R 6 with an ethyl group and at R 1 with a propionyl group. At carbon 8 of the quinoline, an N, N-diethyl carboxamide is bound.

1P-ETH-LAD is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R 5 and R 8 . 1P-ETH-LAD, also called (+)-D-1P-ETH-LAD, has an absolute configuration of (5 *R* , 8 *R* ). The three other stereoisomers of 1P-ETH-LAD have not been shown to possess psychoactive properties.

## Pharmacology

This compound likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from 1P-ETH-LAD's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

1P-ETH-LAD shares many common traits with its parent compound [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) ; it appears to be roughly equal in potency as well as similar in mechanism although the progression and duration of effects are compressed (while remaining qualitatively less intense and more manageable) due to suspected differences in how it is metabolized. Research has shown formation of [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) from 1P-ETH-LAD incubated in human serum, suggesting that it functions as a pro-drug.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , 1P-ETH-LAD is significantly more stimulating and fast-paced in its cognitive effects and general head space. In comparison to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , it is reported to be less [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) -provoking and more emotionally comfortable and forgiving.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 1P-ETH-LAD is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) are sedating and relaxing.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 1P-ETH-LAD can be described as proportionally intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a euphoric, fast-moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different, unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most, it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. In comparison to LSD, it is a little less sharp in its tingles, less likely to be uncomfortable but otherwise essentially identical.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes instantly once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most 1P-ETH-LAD trips.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon-like in appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance. This is nearly identical in appearance to the visual drifting which occurs under the influence of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD)
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
1P-ETH-LAD visual geometry can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, organic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, soft in its edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, either angular or round in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it consistently results in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
In comparison to LSD specifically, its geometry tends to be more rounded in its corners, slightly softer in its edges and a little less intricate in its form. Aside from this, it is otherwise identical in its appearance.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
1P-ETH-LAD is capable of producing a full range of low and high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is a little less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) but considerably more likely when to compared to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This can feel similar to the hallucinations which occur with [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) but tends to occur almost exclusively at [heavier](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) [dosages](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. The hallucinations can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and occasionally of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 1P-ETH-LAD use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 1P-ETH-LAD is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 1P-ETH-LAD suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

Independent research should always be conducted to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

1P-ETH-LAD is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. Like with most psychedelics, it is thought to be most often self-regulating rather than self-reinforcing.

Tolerance to the effects of 1P-ETH-LAD is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). It should be noted that this only applies to the physiological tolerance. Mental or psychological tolerance is thought by some to take two weeks or more for the full experience to re-manifest.

Due to its activity at the 5-HT 2A receptor, 1P-ETH-LAD presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 1P-ETH-LAD all psychedelics (particularly the tryptamines and other lysergamides) will display a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 1P-ETH-LAD. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1P-ETH-LAD*

1P-ETH-LAD, also known as 1-propionyl-6-ethyl-6-nor-LSD, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is the 1-propionyl derivative of ETH-LAD and is thought to act as a prodrug of ETH-LAD analogously to how 1P-LSD acts as a prodrug of LSD.

## Use and effects

Like ETH-LAD, this drug has been reported to be significantly more potent than LSD itself, and is reported to largely mimic ETH-LAD's psychedelic effects.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

Research has shown formation of ETH-LAD from 1P-ETH-LAD incubated in human serum, suggesting that it functions as a prodrug.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 1P-ETH-LAD include 1P-LSD and 1P-AL-LAD, among others.

## History

1P-ETH-LAD has little history of human usage before January 2016.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United Kingdom

It is illegal to produce, supply, or import 1P-ETH-LAD under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26, 2016.

#### United States

1P-ETH-LAD may be considered illegal in the United States for human consumption under the Federal Analogue Act.
