When I was trying different methods: water extracts made me sick and lethargic for the whole trip, acidic extracts made me sick and lethargic for a few hours, long (24hr) alcohol extracts made me sick for an hour and mentally clear and energetic, short (1hr) alcohol extracts made me slightly sick for 30 minutes and mentally clear and energetic. By 'sick' I mean 'feeling' sick, rather than 'vomiting' (most of the time). Washing the powder with lighter fluid did little/nothing to reduce the nausea. Maximum dose I tried was 15, but 10 had the best effects/side effects ratio for me.

Can one do a simple CWE as described above, and then dissolve excess water at low temp to yield something of a full spectrum tar or crystalline compound? I know I hear that oxidation is serious issue with pure LSAs, but i'm curious if this is doable with maybe a limited shelf life...? 


I eat whole plants generally, but have a few friends who are interested in a less nauseous route. And while liquids cwe is easily an option, I am curious about reduction without defatting if anyone has experience.

thoughtsUnThought :  I see no reason why an evaporation method might work.  That being said, I would expect the doses to be more useful right after the evap. is complete.  The sublingual route seems to get mixed reviews but that is an option as well for those interested in avoiding as much nausea as possible.  


fixingahole : Could you disclose your body weight to help me with your 10 seed dosage in comparison to other reports?

It's probably been about 8 years since I last did this but I used to advocate sublingual dosing of HBWR seeds. I found I would need 30-50% more seeds but it would be well worth it in terms of reduced side effects.


Chew them up extremely well and hold them under your tongue or at least in your lips as long as possible. I did it for 20 to 30 minutes and it always worked like a charm.

**mornig glory seeds**


okay so i have a ton of morning glories in my back yard and since its fall here in the midwest they have all started to seed.is it safe to try them?we grow a ton of vegetables in the yard so my guess is that the MGs are safe too.ive done acid so i know what to expect IF THEY WORK.what is the best way to extract the lsa out of them and how many should i take?


any reply is appreciated.

yeah what variety? They will work, you can expect an inner voyage with little outside visuals. Expect extreme nausea for at least 2 hours than an intense euphoria. The trip is amazing but the side effects suck. I used to take between 300-400 seeds at a time.

You don't need to leave them in for hours, that's way too long. 20 minutes max in my experience. If you leave them in any longer then some of the tannins and other junk from the seed coat will get into the water and will increase the nausea. The color of the water should be a pale yellowish-green, not brown.


Also if you put the ground-up seeds in an empty tea bag, then that makes it really easy to remove them once the LSA has been extracted.

I would shoot more for around an hour and use a closed container like a water bottle so it won't be exposed to air or light. Make sure you shake/mix the contents every so often and keep the water cold maybe in a the fridge. Also, absorbic acid helps the extraction I believe, so drop a vitamin c supplement in there if you've got one.

Have you tried doing them for less than an hour? In my experience 20 minutes is plenty of time for most of the LSA to get into the water. The one time I did a longer one, for 30 minutes, the water was starting to turn brown and after I drank it I got really bad nausea for most of the trip. With the 20 minute extractions I only got a little bit of nausea that went away pretty quickly. If you're using fresh seeds like the OP is doing then you probably don't have to worry as much about the extraction yield.

Use spring water for it too. This way, the chlorine present in tap water won't destroy your LSA. RobotRipping is correct, about 300-400 seeds, although you might find with a CWE that the potency is slightly less than if the seeds were chewed. Just make sure to grind them up really good to maximize the extraction.


There are ways to get a purer product without all the fats etc. in your final product, but this is a lengthier process and somewhat more complicated involving other solvents such as butane.

If they are Heavenly Blues, they should work fine. Just a word of warning: I tried LSA several times (4? It's been a few years) and only once did I have an enjoyable trip. Even then, the vasoconstriction was intense. Be prepared for feeling uncomfortable with nausea, leg pain, and other side effects. Also, don't expect this to be "LSD-lite". I noticed almost no similarities between LSD and LSA, really, compared to the other classic psychedelics.

This being your first experience with morning glories, I'd recommend just chewing and swallowing 50-100 seeds, see where that takes you. It's the only way you can experience all the effects the drug has on your body, so next time you can try to get rid of the bad ones and keep the pleasant ones. Extractions can eliminate most of the side effects while making the experience much weaker.

I don't really think it is that LSD-like, anyway if you identified the plants correctly I don't see how it would be unsafe. Just start low (don't listen to people who are already experienced with it) and take normal tripping precautions like keeping a close eye on ol' set & setting.


Also just do some homework reading up on Erowid.org and our own Big & Dandy morning glories thread. And review several preparation techniques to see if there are additional tips. Although that last bit might be considered optional since CWE is simple and straightforward. Limiting soaking time sounds like a smart plan, and before you do - be sure to wash the outsides of the seeds properly.


And be advised this may be merged into our central Big & Dandy thread for LSA's / HBWR / MGs.

With me, there's still a little nausea, but it's nowhere near as bad as chewing the seeds whole. I think a lot of the nausea comes from vasoconstriction and muscle cramping in the lower abdomen.

okay so i did the empty tea bag thing for about 35mins in the dark with aquafina water and im sitting here 3hrs later and im not feeling much.not even nausea.  just a real mellow buzz kinda like i just smoked some real good kush. im not sure if its me or i did something worng. i did about 350 seeds i figurd that would be more than enough.i did them on a empty stomach too.


not sure what im doing worng?its a nice and mellow buzz though.just not what i was expecting![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) what else can i do to feel the whole potential of these little guys.

How much did you grind up the seeds? Did you use a coffee grinder?


I don't think I've ever tripped really hard on LSA, but I did see brighter colors and mild CEVs when I used to do it. But it's more of a body high and mental thing than something with lots of visuals.

Are they real morning glories, with the heart-shaped leaves, or are they the wild blue bindweed that has three-lobed leaves, which grows prolifically throughout the midwest? 


Real morning glories do not survive the midwestern winter unless provided with some kind of protection, and generally they do not produce seed until their second year. 


So if these 'morning glories' just showed up in your yard, they aren't the right kind. But if someone planted them from a seed packet, they almost certainly are.


Also, some people find that adding a little crushed fresh peppermint leaf, or a few drops of peppermint essential oil to the seed/water mix, can help to enhance and potentiate the effects.

zn13bt-yes a coffee grinder was used.....


propyl power-yes they are morning glories.they are annuals in the midwest.in a warmer climate they can be perennials 

yes they have heart shaped leaves as well not 3 lobed ones at all.


after somemore research this is what they are.Morning Glory Vine ‘Grandpa Otts’ (Ipomoea)

these are the ones in my yard.so there are "real morning glories" in the midwest!

It's the only way you can experience all the effects the drug has on your body, so next time you can try to get rid of the bad ones and keep the pleasant ones. Extractions can eliminate most of the side effects while making the experience much weaker.

This is the best advice. In my experience extractions are unreliable... or at least it can take several attempts to find a reliable method. It's hard to tell but quick and crude extractions, especially anything water based, definitely reduce the potency.


Also in my experience they do little to reduce the side effects for Morning Glory seeds.


100 seeds chewed up is plenty strong for some people. I consider that a low-medium dose. Somewhere between 100 and 150 seeds generally seems relatively equivilant to 1.75 grams of cubensis mushrooms. In terms of how high I get and usually also visually.


It can be a fairly visual drug but it's not like some psychedelics where you can be barely tripping in your mind and seeing lots of visuals. If you are seeing lots of visuals on LSA it's because you're tripping balls! Morning Glory seeds make me see the whole world from a different perspective, like it's a fantasy land... yet if I had a sober mind at the time it really wouldn't be difficult to navigate.


But yeah, melting tapestries, glowing vehicles, swirling patterns and moving patterns on walls, as well as buildings looking really huge and lilliputian hallucinations.. are the kinds of things that can be expected from a moderate to high dose of Morning Glory seeds.


To experience this trip which is usually lovely and peaceful in the mind and full of wonder.. you have to endure some side effects including probably some nausea although the worst side effect for me is the muscle cramping. This happens especially in the backs of my legs and can make it difficult to walk in extreme cases. It helps to walk around and keep moving from time to time so that your muscles don't get too cramped.


And that last side effect is the main reason I suggest a dose of no more than 100 seeds, chewed and swallowed, for the first trip. Some people might find this side effect to be intolerable and upon encountering it, be glad they hadn't taken a more substantial dose. Others might find it to be a relatively minor annoyance and choose to up the dose next time.

**Need help Hawaiian baby woodrose, somebody respond thanks**


ok I tired Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds a month ago or something. The experience is good in the sense of the trip , but the side effects are horrible. I had something like 10-16 seeds around that range. And then it hit me. What I hated was that I felt like puking nearly constantly during the first 2-3 hours of my trip and I felt sick, nauseas and sedated The only thing I could do was lay in my bed in a fetal position curled up feeling Sedated ,waiting to puke, and tripping balls, I would fall asleep for 30 minutes and wake up still feeling very sedated, nauseaous and tripping balls later on though after 3 hours of nausea I was tripping and my trip was very good though thru the whole experience I was sedated I was only laying on my bed through the morning hours and trippin . Is there any way to avoid this sick nauseaous  sedated feeling??? 


Second off I want to mention what happened to me on my Hawaiian baby woodrose trip. I know there is a trip report but I will write down what happened to me here. I tripped on shrooms like 5 times though what happened on the seeds was different. Whilst I was laying there on the bed, I felt as though my soul got ripped out of me or my soul left my body and I started to fly my soul ( my body remained on the bed) mentally I was getting visuals of flying at least and I was visiting a place that I used to live at I moved away from that place since .It was night time at the place where I visited  and I was flying over the bridges and the water and I would see all the lights of the city , Basically I was revisiting the city I used to live in and flying above the city in the air my soul. My body was on the bed though feeling sedated . Then I had another crazy sensation during the trip my soul entered the body of my family members yes like my father and I was my dad at that instant I was lighting up a cigarette my dad is a heavy smoker then I could feel what he was thinking and I felt that we needed to get over our issues and crap and that they were insignificant, I could understand the feelings of other people . I felt a strong feeling of empathy whilst my body lay there on the bed. I felt connected to the whole Universe Crazy sensation I was laying on the bed yet it felt like the Universe was a puzzle in my mind or brain and connected, The world and everything so big yet so small and connected in my brain, Crazy sensation. I felt like all the continents ( America) even though so far away from Europe   where so close to me. At this time Hurricane Sandy was making landfall as well and I felt sorry for all the people in the pathway of the storm. Then I sort got out of this state. WOW I was tripping from like 7-8 in the evening till about 2 in the morning> I got a little paranoid ( in my brain I was thinking is this trip ever gonna end???) . I felt Euphoric  and I would burst into laughter at mere nothingness , insignificant would cause me to burst into laugh. I was tripping alone and I would feel a little paranoid due to the duration of the trip seems like it lasted forever yet I was able to come myself down telling myself it will be eventually over. I saw crazy visuals everything around me was melting taking Kaleidoscope shapes, Clocks would morph  into  Circles and morph into Squares then back into clocks and then into Circles. Like all these shapes kept morphing into different forms it was actually very pleasant everything was in motion, especially as I closed my eyes. The trip was very long from 7-8  when I ingested my material  in the evening till about 3-4 in the AM when I fell asleep.


What I just found crazy about this trip was that in my mushroom trips my body and my soul are connected never does my soul leave my body and drift to far and unimaginable places as with seeds, also on seeds my mind seems to be constantly in motion thinking about everything, all there is, all that exists , positive vibes/negative vibes thinking about other peoples feelings etc family members  and with seeds I can travel to places around the world( with my soul)  places that I used to be at back in the day I would also get vivid and detailed images of those places as if I was really there at that instant while tripping , awesome huh? . I did not experience this out of body soul traveling experience with mushrooms . With Shrooms, I would get the visuals, I would get Euphoria, a feeling of beauty and a feeling of Universal Connection a feeling of awe. I would get feelings good feelings sometimes a dark cloud, slight anxiety  or the atmosphere around me would change once on Shrooms the sky would constantly change colours and I would look up at the clouds and I could see them changes colours morphing . With Shrooms I enjoy being around people though and I dont feel sluggish and sedated also the effects are shorter the peak is like 2-3 hours away though residual effects last for like 6 hours. With Seeds it felt like I was tripping the whole night till sleep and intense. The Euphoria of Shrooms exceeds that of Seeds for me. Shrooms are mind blowing the Euphoria equal to that of Amphetamines though better as Shrooms have no Physical harm . The whole night on Shrooms is just so bliss. Who else felt like this?????

There's two problems here: firstly, 35 minutes is nowhere near long enough to extract the alkaloids you want. I know zn13bt, said 20 minutes is enough, but he also said he didn't trip very hard on them, with only brighter colours and mild CEVs. The seeds are full of oils and fats and the water cannot penetrate those globules of fat. So it takes time for a water extraction to get the desired alkaloids in to the water. 


The second thing is, you used tap water (aquafina is bottled tap water), which contains chlorine which in turn destroys your active compound(s). You need to use spring water like I originally suggested, or distilled water.


The dose of LSA from 350 seeds can easily have you tripping moderate to heavily with lots of visual distortion etc. Try doing the extraction again with spring water this time, and leave it in the dark overnight. Agitate it regularly to maximise the surface area of the seed particles in contact with the water. Some warmth may help, although you don't want to heat it too much or else you will destroy the LSA. I'm not sure if the compounds are freebase in the seeds, but you can add some kind of acid - lemon juice or vinegar - to help solubility. Filter it and store it in the dark. Forget about nausea, you are going to get nauseous no matter what so just accept that and do the extraction fully. Drinking this infusion will still be far preferable to chewing the seeds (in terms of ability to stomach it) because much of the nausea produced from chewing the seeds is actually the 'gag factor' of chewing them up in your mouth.


Of course, if you truly want to get the most out of your seeds, you will either need to eat them or do a complete extraction and purification on them, which involves using butane. You could of course grind them up and encapsulate them, and take them that way. This will guarantee you reliable results.

Man I really hate LSA (phycadelic in HBWS) there is no way to avoid those side effects but your lucky to get the effects you did it reacts horribly with some. I would suggest trying better drugs or drugs with a more constant nature LSA and all materials containing it are wild cards you never truly know what will happen.


BTW i never really saw anything too special with shrooms it is probably because it was like the 12th psychedelic i have tried. It always seemed really weak like i never consumed enough and I have tried four times. Every persons experience is different

man, mushrooms usually get me off like crazy, but usually i eat between a quarter to a half in one night, sometimes one sitting. although I've eaten and entire ounce that didn't do what an 1/8th of mushrooms did, both cubensis. lsa ive done twice and both times it was unpleasant for me. the very first time i was 17 and couldn't find any lsd so i harvested the seeds from my dads morning glory's. i ate about 250 of them grinded up and mixed with water and chugged them. an hour and a half later i had been so nauseated i locked myself in the bathroom and layed on the floor waiting to puke. when i did i puked i my parents sink and it was such an exorcist vomit, i looked up at myself in the mirror and everything was moving. my eyes were growing out of my face and my face was a purpule triangle with fuss radiating from it. i was gone and couldn't find myself anywhere. i spent the whole night in my room holding my dog and listening to music and puking and tripping. my dog for some reason knew how i felt and i knew he was there to make me comfortable. i wasnt having such a bad time after awhile but it wasnt what i was wanting from a trip.  it wasn't too bad either. the second time i ate lsa was pure extracted shit and it was not good at all. pure sickness for 5 hours straight. all i really remember from that was laying in bed puking onto my floor and everything spinning. i had to clean up my mess the next day too and i wasnt happy about that.. lsa is not my thing.. next time ill wait for real lsd..

Thanks for the response. Yea dude LSA side effects are f''' horrible. Nausea throwing up puking it sucks, Heavy sedation. The trip I experienced was a good one. Seems that I have a soft spot for Psychedelic I like them more than Marijuana to be honest. Marijuana to me its good but occasionally. I also found that low doses of weed and low doses of Psychedelics are good as it doesn't generate as much paranoia. With LSD you can always worry about going into a bad trip. With Shrooms your doses are controlled better. U know????

But yea I had a good LSA trip. Strong and it was Euphoric as well I just hated the fact that I was sedated as well and half asleep through the whole trip. 

Though the sedation associated with a LSA trip is kinda of good because with LSA I think there is a lower risk for Anxiety reactions and its easy to control when your trip goes bad. In general though another note when I had a tough trip on sh rooms I found the anxiety and slight paranoia more controlable than with Marijuana anxiety inducing effect. Who else agreees??


Btw what kind of class of Drug is Marijuana I cant consider it a true psychedelic.

I guess ile try eating alot of shrooms my next time. But yeah LSA gives me terrible muscle aches, mood swings, And Flu like symtoms its awful. And marijuana is a cannabanoiod it pretty much has its own class and acts as a mild phycadelic there are lots of cannabanoids but marajuana is the natural one the sythestics are things like jwh-18 and AM2201.

I find on internet a method extraction to avoid side effects. Anyone tried this? I've seen horrible stories on erowid involving serious side effects by 16 hours, pounding heart, sweating, strong nausea, tremors, etc, on only 9 hbwr seeds. I would like if is comfortable/pleausurable trip on hbwr with this method:


> Step 1 
> 
> The water should be boiled and left to cool down to room temperature. There is no specific measurement of water needed as the LSA will extract into it regardless but I would recommend a small glass so that the final product can be 1 part water, 2 parts fruit juice. 
>

> 
> Step 2
> 
> 4 to 12 seeds should be crushed using a mortar and pestle or a hammer and then put into the water. 
> 
> 
> 
> Step 3
> 
> The water should be then put into a fridge for at least 4 hours or more and covered in something such as tinfoil or a paper bag to avoid exposure to light when the fridge is opened.
> 
> 
> 
> Step 4
> 
> After the water has been refrigerated, a finely chopped up garlic clove should be added to the water for 30 minutes and stirred periodically to completely eliminate nausea and vomiting, this works because the sulphur in garlic eliminates all cyanogenic glycosides within the seed matter. These are the cause of discomfort not the LSA itself.

i've enjoyed morning glories several times; make no mistake, this is a totally legitimate legal trip. i don't recall the exact quantity that i would consume to feel effects but i know something like 10-15 packs of heavenly blue should do it for a ~140-160 lbs male. i tried extraction at first but i eventually gave that up because i was never certain how much LSA i was actually getting out... might as well just eat the seeds wholesale and get 100%. yes, you will puke, but usually it's just once and done and then you can get back to enjoying the trip, nothing like being spun out on too much booze or anything. kinetics of LSA feel very similar to LSD to me but as above the body load is a bit higher and the trip is milder. i always enjoyed it and i'd totally recommend it to someone as an introductory trip before they started with more potent compounds.

This was copied and pasted from another website (that has trolls all over it, so I am now switching over to BlueLight  ), written by me though. I am about to smoke a small hit of LSA so that changes the situation slightly. My next comment will include the effects of a small hit of morning glory made into LSA "hash", on top of a bowl of medical Cannabis 


 This was my original post on the old website. 

 "So, I may or may not have the ability to take LSA at any time, on a moments notice. I'm just not sure of the effects... On the internet everyone either has REALLY bad experiences, or REALLY good experiences. And while the good experience lack any real detail, other than "It was very euphoric" and "Similar to LSD", the BAD reports are pretty graphic in that there is TONS of stomach discomfort (but that only happens with seeds from the store I think, and this isn't from seeds from the store), headaches, and nausea like a motherfucker. So I want to know if anyone here has tried Morning Glory, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, or LSA itself. And I also want to know what happens when you smoke an extract, and what amount was smoked to bring on what effects. Once I get enough info from ya'll and other online sources to feel comfortable, I will make another thread to be a "trip report" of my own."


 I was unable to take the LSA for a period, because I came down with whooping cough. It has been going around town. I am getting over it now though 


 I will do reports about eating the substance as well. 


....


My roommate borrowed my scale and it's not in his room, so I am not going to be able to properly recount my dose.


 About 90g of seed was made into what I would guess is 2-4 grams of material. I loaded a small bowl of Marijuana and loaded a good sized "pinch" of LSA hash on top. It smells kinda earthy. Taste isn't too bad. Strange head feeling... Not sure if it is placebo or effects coming on. I will finish (or at least get further through) the bowl and post more.


 Tingles in my body... Again not sure if this is placebo or the LSA. About 4 hits in.


 I'm about half way through the bowl, and it feels like a very VERY strange high. But I don't think I'm going to trip unless I eat a good amount of it.


 The bowl is finished and I am just at a very strange level of high right now. I can feel something in the back of my eyes. I'm going to smoke more weed  


....

This method is interesting, if garlic really elimates the substances that cause nausea.


Some time ago i had read similar things for the extraction using water and lemon juice or vinegar and i tried it with 40 seeds, crushing them and following the same procedure as in this method.

I used bottled water and not distilled one.

Anyway i left the water + lemon juice and vinegar (i used them together)  with the crushed seeds covered with tin foil all the night, stirring them every now and then, for around 12 hours.

After that i just filtered the liquid and used it.


Well  the result was very disappointing, it didn't change anything, the nausea was still there and i felt shit for hours as usual, i didn't puke but it just because i have a good resistance to nausea, smoking a lot in the morning makes me used to it.

**Morning Glory (Ipomoea violacea) Preperation?**


Anyone ever messed with these? I've purchased about 3000 of these seeds for a little over three bucks and heard that it's pretty much a milder LSD trip. Now, judging by the fact that all the trip reports I've read mention eating anywhere from 100-400 seeds and me paying *a bargain price* for 3000 is making me really skeptical. The seeds do contain lysergic acid, of that i'm sure. Many of the trip reports also vary greatly as to how they prepare this stuff. Some people just say they ate the seeds while others seem to like making a sort of tea. Anyone taken these before and have a good way of doing it?


Transformedit: No specific prices, thanks.

At what kind of place dit you buy them? A lot of LSA-seeds have pesticides on them, which is dangerous to ingest.


Otherwise, you can go anywhere from A/B-extraction (to get close-to-pure LSA) to a simple cold water extraction. For the latter you grind the seeds, put it in a bit of water for a night or so and then filter it.


Just as a note, HBWR seeds have proven to be a lot more successful. Less seeds and easier to filter out the bad stuff that makes people nauseous.

you can grind the seeds then let them sit in water for like an hour away from light then sift out the chunks and drink the water... but i would recomend ingesting lsa its terrible and causes me to have awful mood swings. some find it recreational i do not.

Yeah LSA has been really hit and miss. Another tip would be to add pepermint oil to the water. According to some it changes LSA to LSH, though it's never been proven. Could change the trip positively though, no one really knows

My first and only time so far consisted of grinding up the seeds and mixing them into some yogurt as I read somewhere on erowid. I also did it early in the morning right when I woke up which supposedly improves the trip. Unfortunately I soon felt very nauseous within 45 minutes and soon after found myself puking all the seeds out (not at all pleasant seeing those crushed seeds) Anyway, I took a relatively low dose, about 200 seeds, of which I am unsure if I digested any LSA because I felt no discernable effects, unless it was due to the low dose. The nausea has stopped me from trying this again, but next time I will probably just make the tea with ~400 seeds and hope for the best.

**My Experience With Hawaian Baby Woodrose Seeds - Is this common?**


I've tried many psychedelics including lsd and morning glory but just recently i got some HBW seeds and at first I just tested a dose of 3 seeds which was enough to make my pupils dilated and to amplify colours. The second day I took 6 seeds and 2hrs later another 2 seeds, this time I felt the trip but after about 4hrs-5hrs I felt like laying down, eventually I fell asleep. I had also used cannabis, hash and some wine during that time and priod to tripping. 


What surprised me the most was the sedative effect...is this very common? Also it wasn't as visual as lsd but maybe b/c it was the second day (tolerence)?


p.s. no negative effects, vasoconstriction was noticable which is why i drank wine on it (vassodilator) and smoke weed.

Yes, Albert Hofmann noted that ergine from LSA is very much more sedating than LSD.

Yeah LSA is much less stimulating than LSD but that isn't necesarilly a bad thing IMO it just makes LSA less suited to partying, festivals etc. It is also less visual than LSD but can still produce full-blown visuals if you dose high enough. IME the visuals are about half as intense as LSD so you have to be tripping mentally about twice as hard on LSA to get the same visuals as you would on LSD.


Tolerance would also have reduced the strength of the trip quite a bit I would imagine. 


I think alcohol is initially a vasodilator but the becomes a vasoconstrictor after a while so its probably better to avoid alcohol. Also alcohol dulls psychedelic effects.


How did you take the seeds? The best results I have gotten from HBWR has been grinding them in a coffee grinder then putting the powder into gelcaps and swallowing them. This avoids the horrible taste of the seeds and makes the trip several times stronger than it would be if you just chewed them up really well. The first time I used a coffee grinder I took the same dose that I had taken previously (12 seeds) and it kicked my ass.

I took 4 hbw seeds grinded in a mortar and drank with orange juice. It was by far the worst "trip" i have ever had. Effects came very abruptly and I felt like being very drunk. After 2 hours I jumped from one physical state to another. One time I nearly fell unconscious when going zo the bed, 5 minutes later I was wandering around feeling completely normal. I fell asleep but woke up around 2-3 hours later and felt like my brain has been burnt away. I couldn't feel any emotions and i was wondering if this would stay forever. ;( It is more a poison than a drug, imo. I than actually tried masturbating just to see if there is any serotonin or dopamine etc. left in my brain but then again, no emotions

I wouldn't say it is a poison considering it is completely safe as long as you get an organic un treated seed, dying is sometimes associated with these trips, people use the same thing you are describing to tackle inner demons.


Some even put on terrifying music to expel the bad and be reborn.


Sedative effect is completely common. I like taking these with Kratom to wake up a little.

Everything you describe, from the limited visuals compared to LSD or the day before are common (LSA's are just different from LSD that way, plus yes: tolerance) to the sedative effects. I find the sedation and psychedelia to combine into something rather dreamy. Same thing for AMT.


Some opinions on this quality are welcome, but this thread is otherwise ready to be closed on account of the questions being answered. Oh let me just merge it - that solves it...

Don't know if anyone stays on top of this forum anymore, but I've just ground up 8 grams of Heavenly Blue morning glory seeds, and packaged them into gelcaps. I'm prepared to swallow these caps. Is 8 grams a good amount? I did not count the seeds.

You're not supposed to ingest anything but a liquid because the seed material irritates the G.I. tract.

Some people have no problem, but I personally experienced significant straining in my gut from very finely blended seeds. I believe anything other than a liquid-only preparation is unacceptable.

Well, I just now finished putting down my thirtieth-or-so and final capsule. I took a couple grams of powdered ginger with it to help with the nausea. And I can feel the cramping already. But I'm pretty good at fighting off nausea anyway, from my experience with shrooms and whatnot.


I have flickering going on in my peripheral vision already. And colors are already standing out. I have been laying down a lot, too. My back hurts a little. But it's coming on, and I'm going to greet this with a smile.


Will give a trip report tomorrow. Peace!

Morning Glory Seeds (Clarke's Heavenly Blue)


I took five 1.6g sachets of Plantation Products untreated Clarke's Heavenly Blue (8grams of total seeds)  and with my coffee grinder, ground the seeds into a powder. I had a container full of capsules of St. John's Wort that I never used, so I pulled those apart, dispensed the wort and refilled with the ground seeds.


It was tedious, but when I finished, I had about 30 gelcaps filled with ground morning glory seeds and the residue of the St. John's Wort powder that was originally inside them. It's important to mention the St. John's Wort because hyperforin (chemical in the Wort) is a reuptake inhibitor for all kinds of neurotransmitters, and there may have been enough residue in the gelcaps to have had an effect.


At approximately 1245, I began swallowing gelcaps, three at a time, with a chaser of strong ginger ale. (This is just regular commercial ginger ale that I've added a couple grams of ground ginger to.) Getting all those caps down took some time, and a lot of burping.


Effects became noticeable within twenty to thirty minutes. Very much bloated feeling. Lethargic. Tired. A little antsy. Not so much nauseated as just really heavy abdominally. I became aware of a flickering in the periphery of vision. I finished my last gelcap as these early effects were coming on. Yes, it took about half an hour to swallow all those caps.


Not knowing, really, what to expect, and both excited and a little apprehensive – I enjoy both the recreational and also introspective visionary aspects of psychedelics, but I've also heard the stories of terrible vomiting, muscle cramping, bruising, vasoconstriction, and generally undesirable effects – I smiled to myself and just let it come on.


Thirty minutes later and I'd stripped down to my boxers because I couldn't stand any more pressure around my waist. My eyes were beginning to dilate. My right eye for some reason always dilates noticeably more than my left, always. This was starting to feel a lot like the come up of 6-APB.


I let myself fall forward onto my bed, like collapsing into a dream, and the physical euphoria was coming on strong. Any thoughts I had were followed by a tangible echo of that same thought, kind of like how after you throw a rock in a pond the waves ripple out like an echo of that first action. I'd lift the blankets above me, and bring them down, and that physical action followed and repeated itself two or three times. Very much like being extremely inebriated on alcohol and everything spins or moves back and forth repeatedly.


By now tactile sensations were feeling really good. I was swimming on my bed like I do with other serotonergic chemicals. My fingertips on my skin felt like it was someone else touching me and not my own hand.


I was also feeling a little physically distressed. I hadn't had any nausea, per se, no dry heaving or anything like that, but the load had been increasing, and my joints were starting to hurt, especially in my hands. My knuckles were swelling up a little. Strangely, I decided to eat a slice of pizza that had been in my refrigerator. I chewed every mouthful of pizza into a superfine gel – I didn't want to upset my GI system any more, but I did want to nourish my starving body. Soon after eating this slice, the colors around me took on depth and hue, especially greens. (The ginger ale cans around the room were practically glowing like an alien metal.)


At this stage, and I was only about an hour and a half into it, I was feeling mentally stimmed out. My body was under seriously heavy load, though, and physically, tactile sensations were really euphoric. Naturally, I pleasured myself. (It happens.) Explosively. I had filled the bathtub with water for a soak, which I enjoy with most trips. But after I put my feet in the water, the defraction of light from the bathroom window made my feet, when I looked at them submerged in the water, look pallid and gray—colorless and corpselike. I got this weird premonition that I'd end up dead if I took that bath. I got out, pulled the plug on the tub, and jumped back into my bed.


I'd been listening to Emerson Lake and Palmer's Tarkus and Van der Graaf Generator's Godbluff. But after a while the music was just too loud, too present, too in my face, and I needed a little silence to collect myself.


But as soon as I turned off the sound system, my ears picked up on the sound of the air blowing through the ductwork, and could still hear the fizzing of escaped carbon dioxide in the several cans of ginger ale strewn about my workstation. The walls were pulsing with bubbles of some transparent energy causing every surface to ripple and melt. Fractal atterns became very obvious.


At this point I was coming up strong and with a fear of how powerful this was going to get I found myself wondering if I'd peaked or if I hadn't even arrived yet and that this trip was a still a long way from over.


I started to connect with BL personalities I've known and others I thought could teach me something. Admittedly, I was a little bit nervous. I wrote to my pal foolsgold, and just about shared my name, just in case something really bad happened, but held on to reason enough to resist that impulse. (Anonymity is too important.) 


I could hardly type. I could hardly keep myself focused on the screen. I was correcting typos left and right. I sent a message to jesusgreen, who, in my opinion, is a genuine philosopher, sharing that this morning glory experience was redefining what “bodyload” meant to me, sharing with him that I was trembling like a Parkinson's victim. I decided to watch my copy of Moonrise Kingdom, which I hadn't seen yet, and this movie has since topped my list of favorites, along with American Beauty, Donnie Darko, and a few others. I sent a message to morninggloryseed, who I had just reached out to for advice I made a few posts in different forums. I shared that “I feel like limbs could fall off.” He suggested I listen to a particular Bwiti initiation music from Gabon for Iboga shamanic journeying. I stopped the movie and listened. I noticed the animals who share my home reacted quite energetically to the music. They seemed slightly afraid, and I immediately responded by calming them. This action helped me relax, and sure enough, I felt good again. I connected with what I'm going to call an animal spirit that is present in this home. I feel that my daughter has a dog totem, but I have always had a strong affinity for felines. I became aware that I am very animalistic, and this interferes with my theological direction. That is a conundrum to solve another day. Right now it seems like I'm trying to walk a path perpendicular to my nature.


This, to steal from Morninggloryseed, ended the Mental Stage, and I was about to proceed into the Visionary Stage. One particular fractal pattern overlay everything I saw, eyes open, eyes closed. In fact it got to the point where I thought some kinetic energy had rearranged certain low-mass objects throughout my house to form the same fractal pattern (the dog hair on the carpets, for example). 


Four hours later, and a meal of bread, cheese, and cottage cheese, after having finally finished Moonrise Kingdom (again, fantastic movie), I found myself going outside for frequent tobacco breaks. I was in a situation where the fractal patterning was apparent everywhere I looked. I wondered if it would be permanently etched to the back of my eyelids. I wasn't scared of that. I am a poor illustrator, but I attempted to draw the fractal shapes that I saw. I mentioned to morninggloryseed that “the concept I drew was...this shape, and it was readily apparent that it goes on outward for infinity. But when I looks into the center, which at first appeared to be an empty white square, or rectangle, or triangle, or whatever polygon it was, then, if I let myself understand that it is inward that infinity goes and not outward and that to look into it is to look into myself...” That is the lesson I learned. I'll ponder it further, especially after this coming weekend when I enjoy 450ug of AL-LAD I have acquired.


All in all, I have to share that this has been a worthwhile experience. I won't be doing this again for a long time, though. The bodyload is so very taxing, but this next day, I have no hangover. I'm not depressed by any means. But I don't have the motivation to do anything but think about yesterday's events.


Enjoy the report, friends.

If you can get HBWR to sprout you need to buy some lottery tickets.  It usually requires human assistance (knife prick to open the shell).  And to my knowledge it will only flower in a tropical environment.

I ate about 10 g of straight morning glory seeds, store bought, common enough brand. I stupidly didn't wash them and felt a hideous nausea and vomited but after a few hours I felt really euphoric, couldn't wipe the smile off my face. Just really happy, mild pleasant visuals. Really fidgety though. Undertones of nausea throughout but all around excellent high. I'm looking forward to my HBWR showing up 3 times as much.

Are there any major differences between the strains of hawaiian baby woodrose? I've heard that the only one that is psychoactive is the hawaiian strain. I bought what was called the hawaiian strain on ebay but I'm not sure if it's the right strain or not.

Good luck with that! Morning Glory Seeds "Heavenly Blue" do the job, and you can buy them pretty much anywhere. Just make sure they aren't chemically treated.

Ive tried HBWR couples of time a couple of years ago

Very strong, but the nausea, sedation and the come up is too much for me to want to do it ever again.

the visual are outstanding though and strong as hell with beautiful colours and amazing warping of reality, but the side effect are way to problematic. The trip last long and the nausea was present in all my trips for at least 5 hours. the nausea is close to unbearable and very problematic.

is there any RC that ressemble the effect of LSA/HBWR?

Great report. It's always interesting to hear from someone who achieves complete psychedelia from ergot (morning glory seeds have been determined to be infected with ergot).


Nausea can be easily eliminated using ginger or anti-nausea medication. Chemical extraction gets rid of nausea as well, although all psychedelics can cause nausea as a result of the nervous system effects produced by the trip (see info below). Perhaps you're also talking about the irritation that results from the shells of the morning glory seeds scraping the G.I. tract. That can be eliminated by filtering the preparation.


I've recently come across information that instructs on how to achieve an end product of predominantly ergine; where vasoconstriction-contributing clavines are eliminated: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/entries/7584-how-to-remove-toxic-alkaloids-from-ergot](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/entries/7584-how-to-remove-toxic-alkaloids-from-ergot)

Hello, all! 

Just wanted to share a recent technique I used with some HBWR seeds that resulted in no nausea or stomach problems whatsoever. 

This was a light dose of only 3 seeds but I've taken one seed before and felt extremely sick from just that. The only preparation done to the seeds was crushing them up in a mortar and pestle and placing them in a "00" gel cap, no scraping or anything. 

Now I've read a lot about the use of peppermint oil on extracts and as an herbal medicine it is useful for stomach issues and maybe helps with the vascoconstriction (not 100% on that though). I took the peppermint oil and dropped 4 drops into the gel cap directly onto the seeds, let it sit for a minute, and then down the hatch. I followed that up with the occasional tiny piece of ginger and had none of the problems I've encountered before on low doses of HBWR seeds prepared the same way except without the peppermint.


I got a pretty nice buzz that complimented a moderate dose of MDA really, really well. In a few weeks I'm going to see how it turns out with a full dose on its own.

So I've been doing a little bit of messing around with some HBWR seeds. I first bought 50 online so I could have a few doses worth to test out some different methods. I have Chron's disease which gives me pretty regular stomach problems and therefore can make come-ups pretty harsh on psychadelics, so my overall goal was to see if I can get a good LSA trip without the nausuea/puking/stomach discomfort. The first time I took 10 seeds crushed them up and did a CWE for about 2  hours. It was the right hue of yellowish, with a fairly strong nutty smell. Drank it down and waited about 2 hours and I hadn't really felt anything except a very slight buzz, so I decided to do what we all know not to do, and redosed. This time I didn't want to wait for another cwe so I took a shot glass with a bit of water and lemon juice, crushed up 5 more seeds put it in the glass, and put the mush gunk in my mouth for about 25 minutes before spitting it out. Within 20-30 minutes I was feeling very nauseous and the stomach pressure was awful. I ended up laying in my shower for about 30 minutes being far too ill to even know if I was tripping or not. After I got out I was mentally a little different, but not much. Like being drunk. After another hour or so of sitting at my computer I gave up and just went to sleep to get rid of the nausea. Overall I considered my first attempt pretty much a failure and it scared me away from messing with the seeds again for about a month.


So the second time I've tried LSA is to do an extraction to try to get more of the pure lsa and get rid of a lot of the gunk that makes you sick. So I did a naptha/alcohol extraction of 30 seeds which took just over a week to fully evaporate the alcohol and be ready to ingest. The end product I was hoping would be a powder but it ended up being a brown gooey substance that i had to scrape off the bottom of the bowl. This time around a buddy and I split the yield of the 30 seeds and just ate the brownish gooey stuff. Within 45min to an hour we both started getting the nausea, but it was much more managable. Around 2 hours in I was feeling very sedated and mostly just dizzy. Still had the nausea, but it was still bearable, just very annoying. Unfortunately shortly after that the combination of it being near the end of my day and the sedation I layed down and immediately fell asleep. 


So overall my experience so far have been lacking I'd say. It seems I haven't really gotten a good test in yet. I bought 500 seeds online a few weeks back and have done the same naptha/alcohol extraction method for a good portion of the seeds and I now have a decent amount of yield, but I've been hesitant to try it again because of my past experiences. 


I'm thinking for my next attempt putting the gooey gunk into gelcaps and maybe try some peppermint oil inside them as well to help with nausea. In my 2nd attempt for the trip that I was awake for it felt like it was very weak like I didn't do nearly a large enough dose. I'm assuming during my extraction I am losing some of my yield so it would make sense to have to take a stronger dose than if I were to take the seeds straight. So i'm thinking about 20 seeds worth of brown gunk in gelcaps and doing it earlier in my day so I can see the full effects over a day. What do you guys think? Any suggestions for nausea or dosing? If I were to take a heavier dose will the downsides be stronger as well as the upsides? I just don't want to be tripping balls while being super sick at the same time.

If i suffer from high blood pressure to a small/moderate degree would it be safe for me to consume LSA with concerns towards vasoconstriction. Currently i am taking 5mg of amlodipine daily and have been for a couple years. I was thinking about increasing the dosage for 1 day prior to the trip bringing it to 10mgs following with the same dosage on the day of the experience. The seeds being used will be fresh HBWR.


I've used them extensively in the past and would really like to revisit this substance. The health concerns are worth noting but i think I'll be safe with 8 seeds crushed up and parachuted.

Really hard to say for sure, I doubt you'll get the "go ahead" from anyone here, but that's just due to everyone being unsure.  If you do go ahead with your experiment, remember that green tea and L-Arginine (available in most supplement aisles) are both vasodilators.  I always used both when I experimented with LSA.  L-Arginine dosages can go as high as 5 grams (10 capsules of most brands), but that much can cause gastric/bowel upset for some people, so try it out on it's own first to see how you react.


And drink plenty of H2O! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

L-arginine is recommended for sure, it's an amino acid and it produces vasodilation, I use it when I have it for any vasoconstricting, it really helps, but take it an hour before dosing.

Thank you guys.


L-arginine seems like the perfect thing to be taking for this, im gonna order some. What would you think about taking it daily leading up the experience, would that be more beneficial? Or should i just supplent the day of. Actually decidied on doing a solo trial run with 6 seeds to see what happens. Really wouldn't wanna get my girlfriend worried why she is tripping. I have a feeling this will work out if i only use them seldomly and with precautions.


When i had vasocontriction issues with HBWR years ago it was from eating them weekly for like 2 months. As time went by that side effect became more and more pronounced.

Decided to be more careful and just eat one seed as a test than move up in 2 weeks to 3 seeds in the CWE. Im just gonna split this my girl to be extra safe. I'll be hoping to get a +++ out of this batch eventually/safely. I've got a shitload of them so if this all doesn't work out i guess most will be gifted. Really appreciate your guys help. I'd really be fine if just my girl can go full depth with these. They had a really postive impact on my life years ago and i would like for her to experience it. The euphoria from HBWR rivaled MDMA for me, felt so clean and natural once i came up. It really is beautiful.

It doesn't work like that - you can't easily digest whole seeds. You'll just poop them out. They need to be ground up, or chewed, or preferably extracted (ground up, added to cold distilled water, stored in the fridge overnight, then passed through a coffee filter at the very least.) The more LSA that hits your intestines, trapped by undigested seed material, the worse the nausea and cramping will be. You want it to be absorbed as quickly as possible in the Steinbach

Yeah i know, usually i put them inside a piece of paper and smash them with a hammer, after that i would parachute them. This time i am going to perform a CWE with distilled water and leave it in the fridge over night. Filtered with cheese cloth in the morning and the remaining brew will be spilt between me and my girl.


I've eaten HBWR about 10 times crushing them with a hammer, ive been using LSA for quite awhile, i know i cant eat them whole. Sorry if i wrote something misleading

Hi im planning on taking some hbwr seeds for my first time soon and im planning on doing the Sublingual method (Under tongue) of administration to help avoid nausea. The only other psychedelic i have done is a 100ug dose of LSD once and i handled the trip fairly well but did become slightly overwhelming at times. I was just wondering what a recommended first time dose of hbwr seeds would be?

Had quite an interesting experience on 6 hbwr seeds taken sublingualy and one other taken orally crushed up, First off it took not long too kick in which is different from what ive heard from others but was probably from the sublingual administration which i would expect to be faster. The experience was much different than i was expecting and much less intense than i was expecting but also was probably because of the way i took them, the only real effects i felt was quite intense euphoria and laughing fits that would come out of no where and also felt like vertigo for legit one second then would go back to normal which i found very strange. Was an mild but enjoyable experience as i had the euphoria without any nausea but didnt have any visuals which was expected with such a low dose. Tomorrow I am trying 9 seeds all taken oralling as i want to actually experience the effects of this substance and compare it to my lsd experiences.

Sublingual does come on much faster, and it also seems subjectively weaker in the case of HBWR, for some reason.  Also a lot less bodyload.  When did you do your last experiment?  You should wait a week at least since then, or else it won't be as strong.

I've done HWBR seeds twice, both times sublingual, once 4 and once 6 seeds, but I felt no effects apart from being extremely weak.

Like almost not being able to walk around weak, never feeling comfortable, not being able to sleep.. terrible experience, maybe I'll try it once more in the future, but I'm not expecting too much. 


Maybe it was the seeds fault, no idea

Huh, that's odd.  Despite HBWR seeds being much easier to get down, since it's only a few, I have found morning glory seeds to be a superior trip, although there is more initial nausea.

Yeah i definetly noticed the difference between sublingual method and the traditional method of taking the seeds. I waited exactly 7 days and i took 9 seeds orally last night and was much much stronger experience and was very enjoyable as i didnt experience much nausea after about half an hour after taking the seeds. The only thing i didnt like was at about the 6 hour mark i got quite a lot of cramps and struggled sleeping even though i was extremely tired which is weird.

I ordered some HBWR over the summer and they never came. Guess i got ripped off. Which is odd, since they're legal. I wasn't super bummed about missing out on them, though. I was in the midst of a super dry psychedelic summer as my acid dealer quit. LSA was my "well, you're too dumb to go the DNM route, so this is the best you can do" option.


Nothing against HBWR, I just really hate puking.

Maybe this thread is just dead, but well, it's typical of some big n dandies,....

so,

I wanted to ask about the storage and potency of HBWR, I have a lot of them and I honestly don't know what to do,

maybe some extraction? I would like to grow some but I won't grow 50 grams... so then, I would like to do something but I guess are not going to be active?

I've had some of the most powerful psychedelic experiences on HBWR, like completely mind-blowing and incredibly euphoric. Sure the come-up can be a little ruff around the edges with some mild nausea and very confronting thoughts "not a bad thing in retrospect" the forced me to work thru inner issues. But at the three hour mark it shifts gears and becomes so pleasurable for me like on the level of MDMA but natural feeling and sedating. If the seeds are fresh it's a wonderful drug, I had a ++++ on ten seeds back in my early twenties.

I always assume putting stuff in the freezer works. Just like keeping acid i would keep HBW in the freezer.


I recommend doing a cold water extraction with mint oil (containing formaldehyde theorized to convert LSA into LSH). It seemed to cause less side effects overall, perhaps due to different solubility of various alkaloids. 


Potency might vary. I used doses between 10 and 18 seeds. 10 seeds would be a light to medium trip where i could explore my surroundings without debilitating fear of losing control. 18 would send me into "ego death" type sedentary states, especially if combined with harmala seeds. The synergy was great. Nausea and vasoconstriction are concerning especially with raw seeds or alcohol extract, and i don't plan to ever use HBW again but am very happy to have done it. 


HBW is the only drug that has elongated my hands in a cartoonish way and HBW is the drug that taught me how to chant, or made me learn how to chant. It also enabled me once to Explain Everything in a seemingly satisfying way.

Well, now it's a bit late, the seeds were in a dry place, but not in a cold place...

I knew about the mint oil stuff!! but never tried, maybe it could be a good experience, I also want to mix it with yohimbe, since I've read that it greatly improves the trip, in terms of energy and less vasoconstriction, which would be great!!


For me 7 seeds is ok, but I've tried with 10 too,  which I loved, but I don't feel like going as high as 18    ![:oops:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f633.png)![:stirpot:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/data/assets/smilies/796260540418752522.gif)   at least not at the moment, maybe when gaining more confidence about the substance again (2 years without using, but was one of my favourites). I never had nausea, just a bit of discomfort, but nothing serious, always did CWE.

Have you tried different methods? like sublingual or oral with all the seed matter?

Is tripping with harmalas similar to ayahuasca or not that much? I see HBWR as a very spiritual trip, very earthy and full of shamanic power/healing, more that shrooms even, I see it as a great plant ally, more than recreational, but you know the mdma-like euphoria is SO GREAT sometimes.


What do you mean by chant? in terms of mantras or something like it? I tend to sing on LSA, it's very good for that, try to sing in duet or trio, it's fucking amazing (almost more than sex, that it's in fact awesome on this plant...)

Maybe it allready mentined in the thread. But afaik, do this with all my Seeds, Nuts [Hazelnuts the exception], Lentils,

Beans [Mung/ Katjang Beans again shorter soak] and Peas. There soaking charts on internet with times.

All these are for normal food use btw. But all share one thing they are seeds and there for contain Enzyme-Inhibitor s [E-I s].

And HBWR and MGS most lightly too.


These are present to prevent hatching under wrong conditions. Not all seeds are so strict on hatching,

don t know if that is a indication they have no/ less E-I s. These substances are heavy on our digestive system,

as the body needs to use extra enzymes just to digest em. Enzymes are costly substances you rather save .


The E-I s depending on the plant the stuff came of have different soaking times. Imagine a artificial long rain washing out the E-I s.

And then the Seed can hatch. Off course thats the reason you should soak Poppy Seed very short, to wash the Morhine residue of.

But without letting the E-I s in the solution as they will cause ao gastric distress. And deplete the body s own enzymes.


As the acive alkaloid is within the seed i cant t see a reason not to do a good soak first. 

Ecxept if someone knows if the Alkaloid s, would was out too. 

Which seems unlightly, but can t give a yes/ no answer i just don t know.


After that there is a nice extraction TEK you could perform on the dried seeds.


Still have to do this, no exprerience with LSA.

Semisynthetic ergoamides identified in a natural product for the first time:


“On the other hand, methylergometrine, methysergide, and lysergylalanine were detected, which have not yet been reported as compounds of *Argyreia nervosa* seeds.”


[Paulke, A., Kremer, C., Wunder, C., Wurglics, M., Schubert-Zsilavecz, M., & Toennes, S. W. (2015). Studies on the alkaloid composition of the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Argyreia nervosa, a common legal high. Forensic science international, 249, 281–293. DOI: 10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.02.011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25747328/). 3. Results and Discussion, p. 283


[Methylergometrine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Methylergonovine) is lysergic acid butanolamide and lysergic acid hydroxymethylpropylamide. It is a methylated analog of ergometrine (lysergic acid propanolamide/lysergic acid hydroxymethylethylamide/ergonovine), a subject of interest in The Road to Eleusis (Wasson, Hofmann, Ruck, 1978), in chapter 2 (written by Hofmann). Methylergometrine was created by Hofmann, like LSD. “I used the method developed for the synthesis of ergonovine for the preparation of many chemical modifications of ergonovine. One of these partly synthetic derivatives of ergonovine was lysergic acid butanolamide. This is used today in obstetrics, replacing to a major extent ergonovine, under the brand name ‘Methergine’ to stop postpartum haemorrhage.”[1] Hofmann includes a trip report for ergometrine[2] and Owsley even said that Hofmann told him that it is “nearly identical to LSD in effect”, although that's a questionable claim, especially since Owsley also describes ergot as having “many highly psychedelic alkaloids.”[3]


Several others have also tried ergometrine in “higher-than-therapeutic” doses and also reported a psychedelic high. I added these references to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergometrine#Pharmacology) (2nd par. under Pharmacology).


Some individuals also tried methylergometrine and published their comments in an article called ‘Entheogenic (Hallucinogenic) Effects of Methylergonovine’.[4]


[Methysergide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/9681) is methylated methylergometrine, i.e., methylmethylergometrine and lysergic acid hydroxymethylpropylmethylamide.


Lysergylalanine is a biosynthetic intermediate between the simpler ergoclavine alkaloids and the more complex ergoamides and ergopeptines. The study in question did not quantify their findings (e.g., mg per gm of seed material), but I suspect it was only found in trace amounts. I don’t know if it's an ergoamide.


There's also another trace ergoamide: 8-hydroxyergine.[5][6] So in total, assuming the above study is true, there are 6 natural ergoamides: ergine (“LSA”), 8-hydroxyergine, ergonovine, methylergonovine, methylmethylergonovine, and lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide.

A Challenging Question and my Answer, p. 38


2. Same as above. “This was an experiment performed without attention to ‘set and setting’ but it proves that ergonovine possesses a psychotropic, mood-changing, slightly hallucinogenic activity when taken in the same amount [as an] effective dose of lysergic acid amide, the main constituent of ololiuhqui. Its potency is about one twentieth of the potency of LSD and about five times that of psilocybin.” p. 41


3. Bruce Eisner: Well, people could say the same thing about LSD, they could say there’s sassafras and there’s nutmeg in nature, and there is morning glories and ergot in nature, but you have to do the chemistry in order to make something that’s effective.


Owsley: No, that’s not true. Ergot contains many natural, highly psychedelic alkaloids. [Isoergine] is one of them; hydroxy-methyl-lysergamide is another one, and in fact, is considered nearly identical to LSD in effect. Albert [Hofmann] told me so himself. They believe that it was this derivative contained in extracts of [C. paspali] that was used in the [Eleusinian] Mysteries.

“Unlike LSD, however, both methylergonovine and ergonovine evoke lassitude and a dreamy semi-narcotic state, effects previously ascribed by Hofmann to d-lysergic acid amide (also known as ergine or LA-111), the active principle of the Mexican entheogenic drug *ololiuhqui* (*Rivea* [*Turbina*] *corymbosa*), also found in some strains of ergot (Hofmann 1964). In profound contrast to LSD, the somatic effects of methylergonovine and ergonovine overshadow the psychic effects, with uncomfortable somatic side effects likely to supervene at doses sufficient to elicit profound entheogenic effects. Accordingly, neither drug seems at all likely to displace LSD in the recreational drug scene.”

I made some big changes to the [Wikipedia LSA article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergine). I added a 'Psychedelic Effects' section and expanded the 'Occurrence in Nature' section.

Would someone mind contacting one of the authors of [Sacred Mushrooms of the Goddess](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sacred_Mushrooms/XTzlCgAAQBAJ) to ask him where this Jonathan Ott quote came from (or Jonathan Ott):

Looks like I found the source of the myth that HBWR hairs contain a poison and should be scraped or burned away:


“The standard procedure is to scrape or singe the white layer from the seed coat before grinding. This layer is believed to contain a strychnine-like alkaloid which may cause undesirable symptoms.”


[The First Book of Sacraments of the Church of the Tree of Life: A Guide for the Religious Use of Legal Mind Alterants. John Mann (ed.), 1972, San Francisco: Tree of Life Press](https://archive.org/details/firstbookofsacra00unse) (OLOLUIQUE and related sacraments in the Morning Glory (Bindweed) family, p. 13)


The person who wrote that probably just got the seeds mixed up with peyote, also the victim of a similar rumor:


*To put one persistent myth to rest, there is no strychnine in peyote. The white fuzz that is usually removed from the buttons before ingestion can be a gastroirritant, but it does not contain strychnine. However, lophophorine, accounting for about 0.18% of the dry weight of the buttons, can cause some symptoms similar to strychnine poisoning, such as a sickening feeling in the back of the head, and hotness and blushing of the face. Lophophorine causes violent convulsions when injected into rabbits at concentrations of 12 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.*


Pharmako/Gnosis: Plant Teachers and the Poison Path. Dale Pendell, 2005, 2009. Peyote: Lophophora williamsii, page 106


And then someone twisted it even more out of shape and added this to UseNet:


“Note: the fuzzy coating on the outside contains cyanogenic glycosides which can make you really sick if you eat enough (same kind of stuff in apple seeds).”


Peter Jordan. Re: Woodrose vs Ipomoea. alt.drugs, UseNet, 10/1/1994 [https://erowid.org/plants/hbw/hbw_info1.shtml](https://erowid.org/plants/hbw/hbw_info1.shtml)


...Which Erowid archived and thus the myth that all these seeds contain cyanogenic glycosides came to be.


*There is nothing in the seed coat that makes you sick. That is a myth. The sickness is caused by glycosides found inside the seed. I've eaten seeds scraped and not scraped and there is no difference what-so-ever in the degree of sickness produced.*

I. tricolor seeds do contain resin glycosides, however, which are a problem:


“Among the most striking characteristics of the family is the occurrence of rows of secretory cells with milky, resinous contents. Resin glycosides are among the most important chemical characteristics of the family. The occurrence of tropine alkaloids in Convolvulus species and lysergic acid type alkaloids in Ipomoea and Rivea species as well as a wide distribution of cinnamic acid derivatives and coumarins are also noteworthy. The last two groups of compounds are common to both the Convolvulaceae and Solanaceae families.”

“Resin glycosides are well known as purgative ingredients,”


Ono M (October 2017). "Resin glycosides from Convolvulaceae plants". Journal of Natural Medicines. 71 (4): 591–604. doi:10.1007/s11418-017-1114-5


Someone who wrote a textbook about Convolvulaceae says that cyanogenic glycosides are probably only found in a few species:


Eich E (January 12, 2008). Solanaceae and convolvulaceae - secondary metabolites: biosynthesis, chemotaxonomy, biological and economic significance: a handbook. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag. doi:10.1007/978-3-540-74541-9. ISBN 978-3-540-74540-2. OCLC 195613136

Glycoside


"a naturally occurring chemical compound found in many plants, most notably in the seeds (kernels, pips or stones)"


"amygdalin and the enzymes necessary to hydrolyze it are stored in separate locations" so eating it would get em to gether.

And form the repellent. Or grinding them.


Amigdalin is a example, not necessary in HBWR, Claviceps or MGS.

A cyanogenic glycoside, like in Apple seed s. Cyano gets toxic btw.

As the Glycoside is cut off. By the body enzyme/ or the seeds ?

that is used up. Body enzymes are precious, don t wanna waste em.


β-Glucosidase, same goes for all the other predator/ germination preventors. Either you wash em out first, otherwise you will have to deplete your own precious enzymes. And suffer gastronic distress.


So Same for all seeds,

not that they necessary contain Amigdalin.

But they do contain Glycosides, maybe just not Cyanogenic ones


1. protection to predators

2. preventing germinating at the wrong time.


¨In some plants they control germination"


Any reason to believe LSA will wash out.

Along with the substance and the enzym, 

responsabele for enzymatic-ally,  converting it ?


First the enzyme inhibitor seemed the problem.

A second one presented. The Glycoside.

> Jonathan Ott lives in México on a ranch in the mountains of the state of Veracruz. His ranch bears the name “*Ololiuhqui*.” This name has its special significance. That is, *Ololiuhqui* is the Aztec name for one of the ancient Mexican magic drugs, the seeds of plants from the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae). *Ololiuhqui* has a connection to my friendship with Jonathan. My chemical investigations of *Ololiuhqui* seeds led to the unexpected discovery that the entheogenic principles of *Ololiuhqui* are alkaloids, especially lysergic acid amide, which exhibits a very close relationship to lysergic acid diethylamide (=ʟsᴅ). It follows therefrom that ʟsᴅ, which hitherto had been considered to be a synthetic product of the laboratory, actually belongs to the group of sacred Mexican drugs.

A post so dumb it deserves to be archived:


*There are many... probably hundreds to thousands of ergaloids and lysergimides, and most of the effects of these seeds comes from different molecules than actual LSA, as when experimented with pure labratory produced LSA from another skeleton that is workable, did not produce the effects of the seeds of these kind. Remember how potent LSD is, just 10-200MICROgrams is an active dose, so it makes sense that many ergaloids and lysergimides within ergot and the seeds have different active dose ranges. But now beyond speculational and scientific wordages,


I can, from experience, confirm that you can definitely get clean effects from smoking morning glory seeds weather it's on weed or not, and something else that works that seems to pick up some of the cleanest effects into the lungs is grinding seeds and putting the powder in your bong water, no matter if you are smoking tobacco weed or other plants, having the ground seed material in your bong water as you smoke actually let's the smoke pick up some sort of lysergimides and or ergaloids as it passes through the water, so here you have inhaleable lysergi without having to combust or heat the seed material at all. And trust me or try yourself, this has some of the cleanest LSD like effects I have experienced. You welcome, feel free to ask me anything pertaining to the topic and or my experiences*

> For the most part I agree Red. I was 19 when I did that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But there is a difference from seeds I just plucked off a vine and seeds sitting around for months. Something changes. Fresh Morning Glories and HBWS can be very strong and have little side effects and give a great trip. But I think somewhere in your post is the reason as maybe time changes the content. I have had fresh seeds that were as potent and nice as good LSD. Then again I have had stale seeds that all they did was give a slight effect and nausea. On the fresh I never got nausea. So I learned to only use fresh. Morning Glories thrive and grow like crazy. The vines always gave way more seeds than I could get to.. Honestly just once every few years to remind myself.

And even when I had great acid some years in the late Fall I would take some fresh seeds. They remind me of LSD with a natural spirit. I had some very strong visuals that felt great on some of those trips. Organic.

Sure the come-up can be a little ruff around the edges with some mild nausea and very confronting thoughts "not a bad thing in retrospect" the forced me to work thru inner issues. But at the three hour mark it shifts gears and becomes so pleasurable for me like on the level of MDMA but natural feeling and sedating.

For me hbwr euphoria it's on par with mdma, perhaps not the rushes of mdma or 3mmc but generally speaking, the "average feeling" of hbwr is more euphoric than any other drug I've tried, except for the "rushy" parts (let's not compare it with pyros, please, it's another type of euphoria).

Has anybody here worked to try cleaning up an extraction, or have they sampled the output of their extraction through a mass spec yet? I'm working with a large amount of super old seeds to try to get a bulk quantity of LSA out, if so possible. I was reading the comments mentioning LSA as having a degradation product, or being a degradation product, honestly I couldn't tell.

Copy of a post I just made on The Shroomery. Does anyone think they can get their hands on this stuff?


> Albert Hofmann created a substance called lysergic acid hydroxybutylamide, which is used in obstetric medicine.[1] It is more commonly known as methylergonovine. It is very similar to ergonovine, which is a constituent of morning glory seeds. Jonathan Ott said that the effect of methylergonovine is "nearly identical" to the effect of ergonovine.[2] Albert Hofmann stated that ergonovine is the most LSD-like chemical in nature;[3] in fact, research shows that ergonovine is present in amounts one-third to one-tenth of LSA in morning glory seeds,[4] which explains why experiments with these seeds are so variable.

It is extracted from special cultures of ergot and could also be prepared today by total synthesis if this procedure were not too expensive. I used the method developed for the synthesis of ergonovine for the preparation of many chemical modifications of ergonovine. One of these partly synthetic derivatives of ergonovine was lysergic acid butanolamide. This is used today in obstetrics, replacing to a major extent ergonovine, under the brand name ‘Methergine’ to stop postpartum haemorrhage."

Decades ago when I was living in Hawaii I ate an small handful of fresh morning glory seeds and, to my surprise, the effects were like a hit of LSD (maybe 75 mcg). I’d taken a lot of LSD to that point so I could tell. I was really surprised; I didn’t expect anything to happen. Cramping and nausea was minimal compared to my subsequent attempts with dried seeds. HWBR was so painfully vasoconstrictive I couldn’t enjoy the effects, though they were very active and my pupils were blown. LSDish minus any visuals, but I could barely walk my legs cramped up so much. I think I water extracted 8 seeds.

I’m pretty fascinated with the acetaldehyde extraction of morning glory seeds, though I haven’t attempted it yet (so many things to try). I’ll probably pick up some sherry and extract some Rivea corymbosa seeds I have at some point for the sake of curiosity.

This summary was made by [Grok](https://grok.com) after giving it this document:


[Separation of four isomers of lysergic acid α-hydroxyethylamide by liquid chromatography and their spectroscopic identification. Flieger, M., Sedmera, P., Vokoun, J., R̆ic̄icovā, A., R̆ehác̆ek, Z. 1982. Journal of Chromatography A, 236(2), p. 441, doi: 10.1016/S0021-9673(00)84895-5](https://open-slum.org) 


**1. Spontaneous Decomposition**


• The introduction notes that LAH "decomposes spontaneously" during fermentation production, resulting in a mixture containing ergine and erginine. This indicates that LAH is chemically unstable under typical fermentation conditions, leading to breakdown products.


**2. Formation of Isomerization Products**


• LAH undergoes isomerization, producing C(8) and C(9') epimers. The document mentions that these isomerization products are also formed when heating ergotamine or other cyclol alkaloids with dilute acid, suggesting that LAH's instability is exacerbated by heat and acidic conditions.


**3. Complex Isomerization**


• In the discussion section, the study explains that LAH isomerization is more complex than simple lysergic acid derivatives due to epimerization at both the C(8) position and the asymmetric carbon atoms in the side-chain. This results in four isomers (I, II, III, IV), which are hemiacetals derived from acetaldehyde and ergine or erginine.


• The reversible aldolization reaction contributes to LAH's instability, as evidenced by the mutual transformation of isomers (e.g., I to IV) observed during a 15-hour ¹³C NMR measurement, where signals of both C₁ atoms appeared.


**4. Equilibrium in Fermentation**


• The relative proportions of LAH isomers (I, II, III, IV), ergine (V), and erginine (VI) in the fermentation medium are described as the result of chemical equilibrium reactions, further highlighting LAH's tendency to interconvert and decompose under fermentation conditions.


**5. Experimental Precautions**


• Due to LAH's instability, the study took specific measures during extraction and chromatography to minimize structural changes:


• Extraction was performed at low temperatures (below 15°C) under reduced pressure.


• Chromatographic fractions were immediately evaporated to dryness at 5–10°C to prevent isomerization or degradation.


• These precautions underscore the need to handle LAH carefully to preserve its structure during analysis.


**6. Artifact Formation**


• The study confirms that ergine and erginine are likely "artifacts" arising from LAH decomposition, as observed during isomerization experiments. This supports the notion that LAH's instability leads to the formation of these compounds under various conditions.


In summary, the document details LAH's instability by describing its spontaneous decomposition into ergine and erginine, its complex isomerization involving C(8) and side-chain epimerization, and the equilibrium-driven transformations observed in fermentation and experimental conditions. The study also highlights practical measures to mitigate instability during analysis, emphasizing the compound's sensitivity to temperature, pH, and time.

Just for context, morning glory seeds contain several alkaloids. Fresh seeds contain high levels of LSH (lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide) which breaks down into LSA and acetaldehyde over time. So in older seeds the LSH has mostly become LSA.


There's also other potentially active alkaloids including penniclavine, elymoclavine & chanoclavine.


> In this study, three extraction methods utilizing MAE, UAE-S, and UAE-B were assessed for identification and determination of ergot alkaloids in Morning Glory seeds. The analysis of seeds revealed that only three out of five kinds of seeds contained ergot alkaloids, all from Heavenly Blue cultivar, although from both Ipomoea purpurea and Ipomoea tricolor species. **Every time, ergine, ergometrine, LSH, penniclavine, chanoclavine, and their isomers were identified together with a compound that may be lysergol **or one of its isobars. Concentration of ergometrine in samples representative for a given seed pack was comparable with results from literature, but concentration in single seeds varied substantially. A similar situation was observed for ergometrine concentration, but there is no data in the literature concerning mean concentration of this compound.

LSH is most stable in acidic conditions (this is partly implied in this paper [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01335a085](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01335a085))


> LSH being a labile adduct also breaks down to LSA if not extracted into acidic solution like wine or lemon juice or peppermint oils or teas. **Plain water will break it down to LSA. **LSH is labile (unstable) and requires care to extract it or reform it, same with LSI. Like tregar recited on post #1 with pic, the Ancient Mayan and Aztec always extracted into balche, a wine or alcohol they made themselves.

Indeed, see my DMT-Nexus post where I mentioned clavines: 


> I'm way more interested in the ergolines, themselves, which can come from any of numerous sources, including synthesis from tryptophan. After recent MG seed experimentation, I was impressed at just how smooth and LSD-like the experiences were, but I was irritated by the effect on the body. According to Nowak 2016[1], penniclavine is the predominant chemical in these seeds. Ergoclavines have been associated with ergotism[2] and furthermore have never been associated with psychedelic effects. Someone who performed home chromatography on these seeds ingested the ergoclavine section and said, "Clavine caused hard vasoconstrion, nausea and pupil dilation but lacked psychedelic value. I could understand its medicinal value due to its vaso properties without altering consciousness but as a mind expanding compound I don't see its place."[3] So, naturally, I'd really like to see what the effect is like without the clavines; it should be noted that penniclavine is not necessarily found in substantial amounts in all batches of seeds,[4] just as lysergic acid propanolamide was found in one-tenth to one-third the amount of LAA.[1]

"Clavines are thought to contribute substantially to convulsive ergotism, since C. fusiformis ergots, which possess clavines, but no [lysergic acid] or lysergyl amides, cause convulsive symptoms (26).

The occurrence of convulsive ergotism without dry gangrene suggests that other clavine or lysergyl alkaloids are involved, or that individual effects of specific ergopeptines may give clinically different syndromes (6)."

It should be quite easy to get the lysergamide/clavine alkaloids out. Any LSA adducts that are present (usually just LSH) will degrade into LSA and acetaldehyde in non-acidic conditions. Essentially the reverse conditions used to form amide-aldehyde adducts in the first place, as detailed in this paper.

**LSA...OR NOT?**


> Alkaloid extracts should not be referred to as LSA, unless one has purified LSA and eliminated all other alkaloids found in the seeds etc. Shulgin and many others who researched this stated they did not think that LSA was the active alkaloid in these seeds, but that other alkaloids were. LSA is the majority alkaloid, but there are others present that are much more likely candidates for psychedelic effects.

Rebuttal to the claim that occaisonally pops up on forums that the clavines in these seeds contribute a desirable effect:


"Clavines are thought to contribute substantially to convulsive ergotism, since C. fusiformis ergots, which possess clavines, but no [lysergic acid] or lysergyl amides, cause convulsive symptoms (26). However, the ergopeptines are known to produce similar symptoms, and are also thought to cause gangrenous ergotism (6). The occurrence of convulsive ergotism without dry gangrene suggests that other clavine or lysergyl alkaloids are involved, or that individual effects of specific ergopeptines may give clinically different syndromes (6)."


Schardl CL, Panaccione DG, Tudzynski P. 2006. Chapter 2. Ergot Alkaloids – Biology and Molecular Biology. doi:10.1016/s1099-4831(06)63002-2. [[The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Biology vol. 63. pages 45–86. ISBN 978-0-12-469563-4](https://open-slum.org)] II. Through the Ages: A History of Ergot Alkaloid Use, Abuse, and Poisoning, p. 50


"Clavine caused hard vasoconstrion, nausea and pupil dilation but lacked psychedelic value. I could understand its medicinal value due to its vaso properties without altering consciousness but as a mind expanding compound I don't see its place." –comment from someone who performed home chromatography on I. tricolor seeds [mrsnesbitsteaparty, 2023-10-13, [reddit.com/r/LSA](https://old.reddit.com/r/LSA/comments/1759wrs/deleted_by_user/k4ptn3a/)]


Additional comment from him:


"When isolating through chromatography you will notice 2 bands. First the thickest being Lsa the second being a small amount of lsh, the amount of which is dependent on how long ago the seeds where harvested from the vine. I person collect both lsa and lsh when fractioning the lysergaminde as lsh radically converts to lsa no matter what you do." [mrsnesbitsteaparty, 2023-10-13, [reddit.com/r/LSA](https://old.reddit.com/r/LSA/comments/1759wrs/deleted_by_user/k4pqi3q/)] 


"Even the seldom faulted Merck Index lists chanoclavine as a possible active principle of ololiuhqui, a lysergic acid related alkaloid present in minor quantities in some samples of ololiuhqui and ergot as well, although no reports of its psychoactive nature have ever been reported. And indeed, if we believe the testimony of those who have told us how the Central American shamans prepare ololiuhqui, namely by cold water extraction of finely powdered seeds, then chanoclavine must be ruled out as it is almost totally insoluble in water. Chanoclavine is not even an amide. Nor has anyone shown any other chemical species in ololiuhqui to be suitably psychoactive."

"And I really doubt chanoclavine would be active. Of all the 4 isomers of LSD, only 1 is active. It seems to rely quite heavily on the optical specificity. With chanoclavine, the carbon (8 on LSD) is unsaturated and achiral. If it has any biological activity, I'm betting it would be well into the milligram range." [[i_was_the_walrus](https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showprofile.php?User=101908). 2015-03-22. personal correspondance.]


A recent study* identified between 3–5 ergoclavines in these seeds. It's a range because it wasn't able to distinguish between lysergol, setoclavine, and elymoclavine.


"The term "isobars" refers to molecules with the same nominal mass (integer mass) but potentially different chemical structures or elemental compositions." –[Grok](https://grok.com)


"In Table 1, the compound at RT 6.49 minutes is noted as 'lysergol or its isobars (setoclavine or elymoclavine).' This suggests that the mass spectrometry detected a compound with a precursor ion m/z of 255.149, which could correspond to lysergol or other compounds with the same nominal mass, specifically setoclavine or elymoclavine." –[Grok](https://grok.com)


All of these clavines were found in much lower amounts than ergine, the predominant ergoamide (syn. *lysergamide*), except for penniclavine, which was actually predominant over all.


These are averages between three batches of seeds for all the ergolines, compared to ergine:


Ergonovine22.1 ± 2.9%LSH46.8 ± 4.5%Lysergol/Isobars5.9 ± 0.7%Chanoclavine24.1 ± 2.6%Penniclavine201.2 ± 22.2%


This data re-affirms what another person who looked at various older studies said:


"But only 2 clavines really are in the seeds in relevant amounts: Elymoclavine and Chanoclavine.

Usually there is only a quite small amount of Elymoclavine. Most is usually Chanoclavine.

I read many times in papers that Chanoclavine."

Blocked by [shulginfoundation](https://www.instagram.com/shulginfoundation/) for posting this on one of their posts:


"Over 200 compounds synthesized and tested." 


One compound he didn't synthesize or test is lysergic acid amide. He actually published one of the stupidest things that has ever been published in psychedelic literature about this compound. He says lysergic acid amide does not contribute to the psychedelic effects of morning glory seeds. He actually read a description of the effect of LAA that was published by Albert Hofmann and included a butchered paraphrasing of Hofmann's description in TiHKAL, which is much more popular than any of the few publications that contain descriptions of pure LAA. 


"This is an active compound and has been established as a major component in morning glory seeds. […] The epimer, inverted at C-8, is isoergine or d-isolysergamide, and is also a component of morning glory seeds. […] Both compounds are probably correctly dismissed as not being a contributor to the action of these seeds." 


Some quotes from Hofmann, for the record: 


"… tiredness, apathy, a feeling of mental emptiness and of the unreality and complete meaninglessness of the outside world."[1] 


"Already at that stage we had, in experiments on ourselves, ascertained a psychotomimetic activity with a marked narcotic component with dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg."[1] 


"The experience had some strong narcotic effect, but at the same time there was a very strange sense of voidness. In this void, everything loses its meaning. It is a very mystical experience."[2] 


 

"Not a contributor to the action of these seeds." ![🤣](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png) 


Thanks a lot, Shulgin. As if LAA didn't have a bad enough reputation to begin with. You have discouraged an untold number of people from experimenting with something that is readily available…unlike those 200 compounds. 


"Im actually pretty suprised LSA doesnt get more attention as it is a truely great substance. I can actually admitt I like it evenly with LSD. All you hear about is people eating Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds or Morning glories or sometimes Ololiuhqui. Some people even make crude alcohol extractions. I made a purified extract, with staggering results." (Kash, 2012-03-05, DMT-Nexus: Pure LSA Extraction (324044))

This is from TiHKAL entry #26 on LSA causing a tired, dreamy state with an inability to maintain clear thoughts. The implication is that psychedelic effects are due to other alkaloids in MG/HBWR seeds including LSH and the clavine-type alkaloids.

> Alkaloid extracts should not be referred to as LSA, unless one has purified LSA and eliminated all other alkaloids found in the seeds etc. Shulgin and many others who researched this stated they did not think that LSA was the active alkaloid in these seeds, but that other alkaloids were. LSA is the majority alkaloid, but there are others present that are much more likely candidates for psychedelic effects.

I did HBWR as my first psychedelic.


When I was 14 (started w drugs really early), I acquired 17 HBWR seeds from my friend. Eager to throw myself headfirst into the world of psychedelic drugs, I decided to make a tea with all 17 of them. I was aware this was a big dose, but really didn't want to half the dose and then have to wait until I could acquire psychedelics again.


When I drank the tea, it didn't work. I must have suspected this might happen, and ate the remains inside the tea-bag. This worked! Within an hour or two I was tripping. The effect to my young mind was remarkable. I called my friend who I got them from and made some sort of comment about everything that could happen will happen because the universe is- and then I threw up very suddenly, no warning, all over the floor. I was completely mortified. I figured I had poisoned myself.


I laid on the ground for the rest of the night, confused and sad that my life turned out to be a tragic story where I died as a young teen from taking too many drug-seeds. and then I slowly realized over the next couple hours that I wasn't actually dead, or going to die.


I'd try them again, honestly. I haven't done much research on them since or encountered them. I will say, they felt nothing like LSD to me. Very sedating honestly. At this dose, they were much more visual than I would expect from LSA (according to anecdotes I read around that time) if my memory serves me right.

Tea as in, you put them in hot water? Lysergamides experience noticeable degradation from heat, not complete degradation but definitely a significant and noticeable amount. For future reference, cold water extraction (as long as the water is acidic and not basic) is a much more effective way to not accidentally waste LSA containing seeds.

I am not the person you're quoting here, but I actually feel identically about my LSA/HBWR experiences and if I were to attempt to describe this, I would say that while the visuals are noticeably intense and carry a more mushroom-like character with LSD's sharpness attached, the cognitive feeling was much more like ayahuasca or mushrooms. The headspace was pretty hazy and foggy, with a strongly noticeable note of profundity and the capacity to induce mystical/transformative experiences that I would likely need to spend hours integrating, whereas LSD induced mystical/transformative experiences that I would only need to spend 15-30 minutes meditating to meaningfully integrate. I often describe LSA as being like LSD's cousin that ended up on the hazier side of things, standing closer to ayahuasca and mushrooms than LSD or mescaline which are significantly more clear headed for me.

It's possible that any psychedelic effects you are describing are due to the other alkaloids in MG/HBWR seeds including LSH and the clavine-type alkaloids.

But there is a habit (tradition?) of referring to HBWR/MG extracts as "LSA" which further confuses things.

This would almost certainly explain the difference in sedation/hazy qualities present between cold water extracts, ethanolic extracts, and eating the seeds straight. I always found CWEs to be the shittiest as far as being super sedative and cloudy, whereas ethanolic extracts were maybe a 4/5 improvement, and eating the seeds straight (only for HBWR, not MG/Christmas vine) was a 5/5 improvement, making my body feel great with less nausea than mushrooms would induce, and significantly brighter visuals with a more clear headspace.

Didn't you see [my post about clavines](https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/the-big-dandy-hbwr-mgs-lsa-thread-part-3-fluffy-dreams-continued.652830/post-16313166)? One thing I forgot to add to that post was info from Heim 1968[1]—the only study that administered pure lysergol to volunteers, by itself: 


"Lysergol showed the least pronounced subjective changes." 


"Changes occurred only with a dosage of 8 mg," 


Lysergol is a clavine. 


That 8 milligram figure needs strong emphasis… 


Based on the average of the data from a 2016 study of I. tricolor seeds,[2] I. tricolor seeds contain approximately 17 micrograms of lysergol per gram. For comparison, I. tricolor seeds contain an average of 136 micrograms of LAH per gram. 


Let's also try to establish a benchmark of psychoactivity. Although Hofmann never ingested pure LAH, he did ingest pure LAA and pure lysergic acid hydroxyisopropylamide (a.k.a. [ergonovine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/443884#section=Depositor-Supplied-Synonyms&fullscreen=true)). In The Road to Eleusis, he states, "The effective dose of lysergic acid amide is 1 to 2 mg by oral application." He adds to this, "ergonovine possesses a psychotropic, mood-changing, slightly hallucinogenic activity when taken in the same amount [as] an effective dose of lysergic acid amide,".[3] 


I asked Grok to search numerous databases that contain I. tricolor trip reports (this site, Erowid, The Shroomery, et. al.) and the highest reported dose it found was 30 grams of seeds, which is roughly 1,000 seeds,[4] which confirmed what I have gathered from looking at comments over the years (i.e., 1,000 is approximately the limit). So, even if you consumed 1,000 seeds, you wouldn't even get a single milligram of lysergol.

Nice 7 page thread, read most of it.


p.s. I am a lab chemist, 30 years experience, made a ground breaking discovery on how to make LSI from LSA in less than 1.5 hour, the experience with 25 HBWR seeds is even beyond that of 100ug of ALD-52


The 8 hour long experience is like a combination of ALD-52 and mescaline, hits way more brain receptors than LSD.


Book will be released end of December 2025: "LSI, ancient LSD, secret of the Eleusis Kykeon" and will appear on McKenna Academy podcast, the Brainforest Café in January of 2026, view on you tube.

Chapter 4 question:


When you performed these experiments, why didn’t you go above the equivalent of 120ug of LSD?

I did not feel the need to exceed the equivalent dosage of 120ug LSD (subsequent experiments) as I found the resulting psychedelic experiences to go above and beyond anything I could have ever hoped for. I give a trip report after each experiment forming a combo of LSI, LSV and LSCr.


1) The experience lasts 8 strong anxiety free hours with a 10 hour duration

2) There is a pleasant stimulation all night long into the wee hours of the morning, just like ALD-52 or mescaline exerts

3) The strength becomes stronger and stronger until she reaches a peak 3.5 hours in

4) There are profound Spiritual revelations, insights and intense healing, she is a feminine teaching spirit.

5) A brilliant diamond like shimmering of all visuals, infinitely fascinating

6) Tracers with open eyes as powerful as lightning strikes, none of the choppiness of LSD visuals, rather the visuals are flowing.

7) Intense, bold neon-like colors are seen all night, just like a combo of ALD-52 + mescaline, far, far more colorful than LSD. I have seen neon colors like purple-yellows, red-greens, and orange-blues that don't belong on this earth

8) Infinite way over the top euphoria felt all night (just like a combo of ALD-52 + mescaline). Anyone who has ever had cactus understands the mescaline euphoria I am talking about.

9) The beauty seen with open eyes is infinite and divine, no words to describe. This was one of the main reasons I took this psychedelic, the enhancement of beauty is just so over the top, extreme and heavenly.

10) The closed eye-colored geometrics seen which progress to real visions the longer the eyes are kept closed are just like what you see on a combination of LSD + mescaline, hundreds and hundreds of way beyond 4k visions many of them playing as if in a movie.

11) The music enhancement is just incredible and heavenly. I've felt more with this LSI, LSV and LSCr combo than with any traditional psychedelic except for mescaline that I was an extraterrestrial being, immersing myself in new sensory phenomena for the first time. Where LSD heightens and clarifies the sense of hearing, this Eleusis kykeon brew simulation produces auditory hallucinations, heightening the hearing sense but also causing sounds to be quite different than normal. I am a music lover and always listened to house music most of the night during the experiences, as on LSI, LSV & LSCr combo, every instrument and beautiful voice stands out on its own, every song is "epic". Like hearing a song for the very first time.

12) As for aphrodisiacal use of LSI, LSV & LSCr combo, wow! it brought energies out of me that I never knew I had.

13) There is zero or no anxiety with this potent 3 psychedelic combo, just like with ALD-52. This would explain why there were no bad trips reported in the Eleusis Kykeon literature.

14) There are no physical side effects: no body load, no nausea, no vasoconstriction, no cramping, just pure psychedelic bliss.

15) The next morning (I would typically get 6 hours sleep after the experience) I felt re-born with a massive serotonin "reset". I would go walking in nature with my shih tzus the following morning and all of nature looked as if brand new with a curiosity of nature's divinity.


Note: I do not recommend using morning glory seeds, only HBWR seeds...my results with up to 150 morning glory seeds were extremely disappointing (even below threshold effects), I believe the mg seeds are mainly 75% clavine alkaloids with less than 25% LSA, the levels of LSA in mg seeds being probably around .001mg per seed vs HBWR seeds at .04mg per seed. The morning glory seeds resulted in zero entheogenic effects, no euphoria, no stimulation, no visuals, and even no physical symptoms like dilated pupils...do not use. Stick only with HBWR seeds.


--> The few easy steps from Chapter 3 are in the book, drawn as black and white sketches, most of the time is spent waiting 20 minutes between the 3 basic steps. <-- LSI is forming internally (in vitro) in the liver, this is all explained in book.

I think the rather impolite nature of your correction is the reason for you being blocked.


Sasha was often wrong and would always enjoy a discussion and being corrected.


Why he did say that LSA/LAA was not responsible for the action of the seeds is an interesting conjecture. Unfortunate he is not around to further discuss the premise of that idea.

I think this is because it has a mostly uninteresting sedative-type effect. Shulgin was correct.


Kash enjoyed botanicals which produce lysergamides as he was well-aware of the creation of LSA adducts with aldehydes. Kash used sources of aldehydes in his extractions with great results.

Quote:


In this 1998 interview, psychologist and psychedelic pioneer James Fadiman, PhD, recalls one of his most transformative psychedelic visions.


During a session with morning glory seeds (which contain lysergic acid amide, or LSA, a close analog of LSD) Fadiman describes seeing himself at an enormous blackboard, meticulously mapping a sophisticated theory of reality as illuminated by psychedelics.


Then, in the vision, God appears, praises the work, and calmly erases it all.


When Fadiman protests, God replies with gentle amusement: the analysis was beautiful, but ultimately beside the point.


The deeper message, Fadiman realizes, is that the odds of fully grasping reality in this body, this lifetime, and this civilization are essentially zero. And yet, the attempt itself is joyful and nourishing.


What followed was not nihilism, but liberation. Fadiman describes how this vision untethered him from rigid certainty, loosening his attachment to “core beliefs” he once assumed were fixed.


This story reminds us of a central paradox of the psychedelic experience: it may not give us the final answer to the universe, but it can soften our need for one.


In letting go of the illusion of ultimate knowing, Fadiman discovered something more profound and enduring: the freedom to explore reality with reverence, humor, and lightness.

Rebuttal to [@tregar](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/56624/)'s [lysergic acid isovaleraldemide hypothesis](https://drugs-forum.com/threads/how-to-make-lsi-or-lysergic-acid-isovaleraldemide-from-lsa-in-morning-glory-seeds-ancient-lsd.358402/) from [@xdrc](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/570167/):


The adducts between **indoles** with **aldehydes + alcohols** are of course structurally different from your proposed LSI formation - and requires some alcohol in the mixture too, alongside the experiments being conducted at a pH of 3. The literature on the synthesis of adducts of **amides** with **aldehydes** starts from anhydrous consitions (with water as solvent as you propose in your method would drive the equilibrium in the wrong direction), the yields are low and require high temperatures. The product - if it formed in the first place - would not be LSI but a dimeric adduct. For both of these reactions way longer reaction times than 20 min are needed to get any appreciable yields. If these referenced reactions happened it is quite unclear to me if these compounds would perhaps act as some sort of pro-drug, but I have my doubts for many reasons.


I think you are mainly having yourself fooled with these experiments. You seem very convinced that this actually works (either in vitro or in vivo, but I'm doubtful of both, would like to see the suggested reading for in vivo though). Psychedelics are very amendable to expectations via the placebo and nocebo effect. I would recommend doing a couple of self-blinding studies (easier together with a friend). I would be surprised if you could distinguish the effects of the extract from one with added aldehydes (of course you need to ensure the successful blinding over the whole trials, say at least 3 experiences with each before unblinding -> verifying).


I'm surprised that as a lab chemist of 30 years, you fail to see the need for analysis and found no way to arrange such. Isn't there a company precisely called "Kykeon" which seems befitting of such a task - among a couple other options? Of course if you're shifting gears to an in vivo activation everything will be a bit harder, but I do recommend the blind test for a first evaluation. It is puzzling to me that any different effects with psychedelics are always first attributed to entourage effects, side products, etc. when it's been clear for many many many years that mind, soul and body are perhaps the most important contributors to the psychedelic experience.


I'd be curious how you address these concerns. I'm sorry if I missed it in the texts, it was frankly quite unstructured and rambling. I'd recommend some touch up before an eventual release of the book. There are other inaccuracies too - for instance with HWBR as a natural product the amount of LSA will anything but be constant, unlike you assert.


I find this case very curious. Because even if the effects are just simply mediated by LSA and a placebo effect, there is much to learn here, don't you think? But regarding your proposed formation of LSI, I don't see how this would happen at all. It should be clear that the burden of proof lies on the person trying to sell a book, especially with being so out of the scope of published works from what I am aware.


PS: I must also admit I'm quite suspicious of Allylbenzene being more than just a "chemist associate" to you.

*This stuff DOES work... if you take enough of it... Respect it though. I had a profound spiritual experience on these seeds, I couldn't believe it when it was happening, that it actually worked. The power in these little granules is immense, trust me. It's worth it.*

"The two amazing trips that I did have on LSA was really nice because it had a very relaxing, narcotic/sedative-like cerebral clear high to it. It's perfect because at no point at all did I experience anxiety or any negative feelings. (When it went well). If I could replicate that feeling, I'd take it all the time."


"LSD gives me huge bits of anxiety on the comeup and is very stimulating (which is great for exercising, like bike rides, walking, dancing, etc) but the extra energy can defitely lead to some nervous energy on the come up. That all goes away when it starts to peak, but the comeup can be a lil rough for me."

She is an "ultimate psychedelic". In the distant past over a decade ago, took Ayahuasca over 140 times, zero nausea bridgesii cactus tea over 120 times, and LSD over a hundred times, and yet find this LSI + LSV + LSC combo to be my absolute favorite.

Chapter 5 question:


When you performed these experiments, why didn’t you go above the equivalent of 120ug of LSD?

I did not feel the need to exceed the equivalent dosage of 120ug LSD (subsequent experiments) as I found the resulting psychedelic experiences to go above and beyond anything I could have ever hoped for. I give a trip report after each experiment forming a combo of LSI, LSV and LSCr.


1) The experience lasts 8 strong anxiety free hours with a 10 hour duration

2) There is a pleasant stimulation all night long into the wee hours of the morning, just like ALD-52 or mescaline exerts

3) The strength becomes stronger and stronger until she reaches a peak 3.5 hours in

4) There are profound Spiritual revelations, insights and intense healing, she is a feminine teaching spirit.

5) A brilliant diamond like shimmering of all visuals, infinitely fascinating

6) Tracers with open eyes as powerful as lightning strikes, none of the choppiness of LSD visuals, rather the visuals are flowing.

7) Intense, bold neon-like colors are seen all night, just like a combo of ALD-52 + mescaline, far, far more colorful than LSD. I have seen neon colors like purple-yellows, red-greens, and orange-blues that don't belong on this earth

8) Infinite way over the top euphoria felt all night (just like a combo of ALD-52 + mescaline). Anyone who has ever had cactus understands the mescaline euphoria I am talking about.

9) The beauty seen with open eyes is infinite and divine, no words to describe. This was one of the main reasons I took this psychedelic, the enhancement of beauty is just so over the top, extreme and heavenly.

10) The closed eye-colored geometrics seen which progress to real visions the longer the eyes are kept closed are just like what you see on a combination of LSD + mescaline, hundreds and hundreds of way beyond 4k visions many of them playing as if in a movie.

11) The music enhancement is just incredible and heavenly. I've felt more with this LSI, LSV and LSCr combo than with any traditional psychedelic except for mescaline that I was an extraterrestrial being, immersing myself in new sensory phenomena for the first time. Where LSD heightens and clarifies the sense of hearing, this Eleusis kykeon brew simulation produces auditory hallucinations, heightening the hearing sense but also causing sounds to be quite different than normal. I am a music lover and always listened to house music most of the night during the experiences, as on LSI, LSV & LSCr combo, every instrument and beautiful voice stands out on its own, every song is "epic". Like hearing a song for the very first time.

12) As for aphrodisiacal use of LSI, LSV & LSCr combo, wow! it brought energies out of me that I never knew I had.

13) There is zero or no anxiety with this potent 3 psychedelic combo, just like with ALD-52. This would explain why there were no bad trips reported in the Eleusis Kykeon literature.

14) There are no physical side effects: no body load, no nausea, no vasoconstriction, no cramping, just pure psychedelic bliss.

15) The next morning (I would typically get 6 hours sleep after the experience) I felt re-born with a massive serotonin "reset". I would go walking in nature with my shih tzus the following morning and all of nature looked as if brand new with a curiosity of nature's divinity.


Note: I do not recommend using morning glory seeds, only HBWR seeds...my results with up to 150 morning glory seeds were extremely disappointing (even below threshold effects), I believe the mg seeds are mainly 75% clavine alkaloids with less than 25% LSA, the levels of LSA in mg seeds being probably around .001mg per seed vs HBWR seeds at .04mg per seed. The morning glory seeds resulted in zero entheogenic effects, no euphoria, no stimulation, no visuals, and even no physical symptoms like dilated pupils...do not use. Stick only with HBWR seeds.


Eleusis Kykeon theoretical simulation Materials list:


1) 25 HBWR seeds, approximately .04mg LSA per seed.

2) 0.001g scale

3) One oversized shot glass for the spinning of the seed dust, and one regular shot glass for the fridge, and a 6 ounce half pint tall canning jar 4" tall x 2.75" wide.

4) magnetic stirrer with 3/8" x 1" long stir bar that can spin easily and fast inside the shot glass or canning jar.

5) everclear (95% grain alcohol or similar high proof alcohol)

6) coffee grinder

7) mortar and pestal

8) long pyrex brownie dish (9" wide x 15" long)

9) 2 razor blades

10) a fan, and a hair dryer to use for last 5 minutes of water evaporation from the pyrex dish (optional)

11) 3 grams of the secret herbal substance very high in isovaleraldehyde, valeraldehyde & crotonaldehyde.

12) distilled or spring water

13) DL tartaric acid powder is preferred or 100% pure citric acid powder can be used, if using citric acid powder, simply use more of it to get the ph to ph=4. I give amounts of DL tartaric acid powder to use, 30mg in beginning on step #7 and 10mg later at very last step #15 end spin.


--> The few easy steps from Chapter 5 are in the book, drawn as black and white sketches, most of the time is spent waiting 20 minutes between the 3 basic steps. <-- LSI is forming internally (in vitro) in the liver, this is all explained in book.
