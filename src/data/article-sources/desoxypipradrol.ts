**Desoxypipradrol may lead to states of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [addiction](/w/index.php?title=Addiction&action=edit&redlink=1) at a significantly higher rate than other stimulants.**
 
Due to its unusually long half-life and extreme potency, it is strongly discouraged to abuse this substance in high doses, multiple days in a row, or in combination with other substances known to increase the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Please see [this section](/w/index.php?title=Desoxypipradol&action=edit&redlink=1) for more details.
**Desoxypipradrol** (also known as **2-DPMP** , **2-diphenylmethylpiperidine** , or **Ivory Wave** ) is a [benzylpiperidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzylpiperidine) -based [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) drug which is closely related to [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) and pipradol.

Developed by Ciba in the 1950s and researched for applications such as the treatment of narcolepsy and ADHD; it was dropped from development after the related drug methylphenidate was developed by the same company. Methylphenidate was felt to be the superior drug for treating ADHD due to its shorter duration of action and more predictable pharmacokinetics, and while desoxypipradrol was researched for other applications (such as facilitation of rapid recovery from anesthesia), its development was not continued. However, the hydroxylated derivative pipradrol was introduced as a clinical drug indicated for depression, narcolepsy and cognitive enhancement in organic dementia.

As with [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) and pipradol, it is thought to act as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). Of these three piperidines, it is noteworthy that desoxypipradrol has the longest elimination half-life, as it is a highly lipophilic molecule lacking polar functional groups that are typically targeted by metabolic enzymes, giving it an unusually long duration of action when compared to most [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) . This property combined with its ultra-high potency (starting at 2mg) has given this compound a reputation for being extremely dangerous when abused or mishandled.

Desoxypipradrol is rarely if ever found on the streets, but instead typically sold as a gray market [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) through online vendors.

## Chemistry

Desoxypipradrol is a synthetic [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) of the substituted benzylpiperidine class. It contains a [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) skeleton with an additional phenyl ring bound to R β . The terminal amino group of the phenethylamine chain is incorporated into a [piperidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piperidine) ring. As a result of lacking polar functional groups it is a highly lipophilic molecule, giving it an extremely long-lasting multi-day duration of action that is rarely observed in stimulant drugs -- notably with the exception of [MDPV](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDPV) .

## Pharmacology

Desoxypipradrol primarily acts as a [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (NDRI) , but one with an unusually high potency, extreme duration and unpredictable dose-response for a stimulant drug. These risks likely owe themselves to its abnormally high lipophilicity and long elimination half-life, which among other things likely increases the relative risk it has in triggering states of stimulant [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) when abused, with which it has been demonstrated in humans to be an uncommonly low threshold.

## Subjective effects

Desoxypipradrol possesses an unusually high potency, extreme duration and unpredictable dose-response for a stimulant drug. However, due to the relative "cleanness" or subtleness of the stimulation some reports indicate a tendency in users to redose it compulsively until dangerous amounts end up becoming consumed, which can lead to [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) , hospitalizations, and even fatalities. Those who wish to experiment with this compound are advised to use proper harm-reduction practices and approach with this substance with extreme caution (such as not redosing, and [using volumetric dosing techniques](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) ).

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, desoxypipradrol is usually considered to be energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is stronger but much subtler than that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) and [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) . At lower to moderate doses, it encourages general productivity but at higher dosages may encourages physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation which desoxypipradrol presents is not forced, however, but clean and lucid with manic undertones.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Early reports suggest that the effects of desoxypipradrol on heart rate and blood pressure are unusually weak.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)** - Compared to classical stimulants, desoxypipradrol seems to involve less peripheral nervous system stimulation which can make it feel "cleaner" or more lucid and involve less bodily effects like sweating or cramping.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - Compared to [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) and other stimulants, this component is largely absent due to the subtleness of desoxypipradrol's style of stimulation.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - This component is minimal compared to many other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) and stimulating drugs.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement)** - This effect is unpredictable and typically seen at moderate to high doses, though it can randomly happen at the lower doses as well. When it does occur, it tends to be subtler than some other visual acuity enhancing stimulants like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) .
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - This effect is unpredictable and typically seen at moderate to high doses, though it can randomly happen at the lower doses as well. When it does occur, it tends to be subtler than some other visual brightness altering stimulants like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) .
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** - This effect is unpredictable and typically seen at moderate to high doses, though it can randomly happen at the lower doses as well. When it does occur, it tends to be subtler than some other vision-altering stimulants like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - In comparison to other stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , this effect feels far less forced and more unintrusive.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate dosages as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**

- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - This effect is typically seen at medium to high doses, and is similar to the emotion suppression that can be exhibited by use of [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) .
- **[Information processing suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Information_processing_suppression)**
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - This effect is occasionally seen, typically at lower doses, and tends to decrease as one increases the dose.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - This effect is typically seen with higher doses, but can happen at lower doses as well in an unpredictable manner. At lower to medium doses, it is more common to see [thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) in effect.
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)** - This effect is typically seen with higher doses, but can happen at lower doses as well in an unpredictable manner. At lower to medium doses, it is more common to see [thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization) in effect.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)**
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)**

- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Desoxypipradrol](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Desoxypipradrol.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

### Toxicity

Desoxypipradrol may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma desoxypipradrol concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/L in intoxicated patients and >600 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

In terms of its tolerance, desoxypipradrol can be used for multiple days in a row for extended periods of time. Acute tolerance to many of the effects of desoxypipradrol develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). desoxypipradrol presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of desoxypipradrol all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of desoxypipradrol can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

User reports suggest that compared to many other stimulants, desoxypipradrol has some unique and atypical hazards that can accompany its misuse -- especially when it is eye-balled, not dosed volumetrically, or otherwise handled without the proper degree of caution. Desoxypipradrol, like other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , increases [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) levels in the brain which can lead to severe manic psychosis in the short-term in addition to persisting dopamine receptor down regulation in the long-term.

### Psychosis

User reports indicate that chronic abuse or single exposure overdose of desoxypipradrol can potentially lead to [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) more readily than the vast majority of stimulants. Psychotic symptoms from desoxypipradrol can include [hearing voices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations) , [visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , urges to harm oneself, severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , grandiosity, [paranoid delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , increased [aggression](/w/index.php?title=Aggression&action=edit&redlink=1) , and [irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability) .

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Desoxypipradrol should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.).

## Legal status

- **China** : As of October 2015, 2-DPMP is a controlled substance in China.
- **Germany** : Desoxypipradrol is controlled under Anlage II BtMG ( *Narcotics Act, Schedule II* ) as of December 13, 2014. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Russia** : Deoxypipradol is entered in the Schedule I prohibited substance as (Пиперидин-2-ил)дифенилметан.
- **Switzerland** : Desoxypipradol is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United Kingdom** : As of November 4, 2010, the UK Home Office announced a ban on the importation of 2-DPMP, following a recommendation from the ACMD. Prior to the import ban, desoxypipradrol was sold as a 'legal high' in several products. Its use lead to several Emergency Department visits which prompted the UK government to commission a review from the ACMD. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs stated in their report that: " *there are serious harms associated with 2-DPMP... typically prolonged agitation (lasting up to 5 days after drug use which is sometimes severe, requiring physical restraint), paranoia, hallucinations and myoclonus (muscle spasms/twitches).* " 2-DPMP was due to become a class B drug on March 28, 2012, but the bill was scrapped as two steroids deemed not to be abusable were included in the bill but were later recommended to remain uncontrolled. There was a new discussion about its fate on April 23, 2012, where it was decided that the bill would be rewritten and 2-DPMP would still be banned. It was also decided that the bill would be a blanket ban of related chemicals. Desoxypipradrol was eventually made a class B drug and placed in Schedule I on June 13, 2012. There were no recorded deaths from the drug between the banning of its import and the banning of its possession. "Esters and ethers of pipradrol" were controlled with the same amendment as class C drugs.
- **United States** : Desoxypipradrol is unscheduled in the United States, and thus legal to possess and import. However, it is an analog of pipradol which is a Schedule IV Controlled Substance. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

  "thedrugclassroom": `# 2-DPMP (Desoxypipradrol)
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2-dpmp-desoxypipradrol/*

2-DPMP is a stimulant that was created in the 1950s by Ciba-Geigy (Novartis) and used for a brief time before leaving the market. It was originally used for ADHD and narcolepsy, but shorter-acting drugs ended up replacing it. Ciba-Geigy also tested it to speed up recovery from anesthesia and it was known as Weckamine in Germany. 2-DPMP reappeared in the mid to late-2000s.

The substance functions as an NDRI (norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) and it appears to promote dopamine release in some parts of the brain. It has structural and functional similarities with pipradrol and methylphenidate.

Users report relatively standard stimulant effects, but it stands apart from similar drugs because of its long duration. 2-DPMP usually lasts for at least 24 hours and it’s not uncommon for it to work up to 48 hours. In overdoses, effects have even lasted for 3-4+ days.

Its long duration is seen as both a positive and negative aspect by users. Due to various factors (including its potency and method of sale), effects like anxiety, chest pain, and tachycardia have been reported at relatively high rates.

There are some fatalities on record associated with 2-DPMP. Fatalities and hospitalizations seem to be more common when a product containing the drug (e.g. Ivory Wave or Whack) is administered, likely due to dosing issues.

  "wikipedia": `# Desoxypipradrol
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desoxypipradrol*

Desoxypipradrol, also known as 2-⁠diphenylmethylpiperidine (2-DPMP), is a drug developed by Ciba in the 1950s which acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).

## Chemistry

Desoxypipradrol is closely related on a structural level to the compounds methylphenidate and pipradrol, all three of which share a similar pharmacological action. Of these three piperidines, desoxypipradrol has the longest elimination half-life, as it is a highly lipophilic molecule lacking polar functional groups that are typically targeted by metabolic enzymes, giving it an extremely long duration of action when compared to most psychostimulants. Methylphenidate, on the other hand, is a short-acting compound, as it possesses a methyl-ester moiety that is easily cleaved, forming a highly polar acid group, while pipradrol (desoxypipradrol's intermediate) has shorter duration due to a hydroxyl group which can be conjugated (e.g. with glucuronide) to increase its hydrophilicity and facilitate excretion, but pipradrol itself has no easily metabolizable groups.

## History

Desoxypipradrol was developed by the pharmaceutical company CIBA (now called Novartis) in the 1950s, and researched for applications such as the treatment of narcolepsy and ADHD; however, it was dropped from development after the related drug methylphenidate was developed by the same company. Methylphenidate was felt to be the superior drug for treating ADHD due to its shorter duration of action and more predictable pharmacokinetics, and while desoxypipradrol was researched for other applications (such as facilitation of rapid recovery from anaesthesia), its development was not continued. The hydroxylated derivative pipradrol was, however, introduced as a clinical drug indicated for depression, narcolepsy and cognitive enhancement in organic dementia.

## Detection in biological specimens

Desoxypipradrol may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma desoxypipradrol concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/L in intoxicated patients and >600 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage.

## Legal status

Desoxypipradrol's structural similarity to pipradrol makes it possible that it would be considered a controlled substance analogue in several countries such as Australia and New Zealand.

### China

As of October 2015 2-DPMP is a controlled substance in China.

### United Kingdom

As of 4 November 2010, the UK Home Office announced a ban on the importation of 2-DPMP, following a recommendation from the ACMD.
Prior to the import ban, desoxypipradrol was sold as a 'legal high' in several products, most notably "Ivory wave". Its use lead to several Emergency Department visits which prompted the UK government to commission a review from the ACMD. One man had ingested nearly 1 gram of the drug which may have been fatal without sedation with an anaesthetic dose of a benzodiazepine administered in accident and emergency.
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs stated in their report  that:

"there are serious harms associated with 2-DPMP... typically prolonged agitation (lasting up to 5 days after drug use which is sometimes severe, requiring physical restraint), paranoia, hallucinations and myoclonus (muscle spasms/twitches)."
2-DPMP was due to become a class B drug on 28 March 2012, but the bill was scrapped as two steroids deemed not to be abusable were included in the bill but were later recommended to remain uncontrolled. There was a new discussion about its fate on April 23, 2012, where it was decided that the bill would be rewritten and 2-DPMP would still be banned. It was also decided that the bill would be a blanket ban of related chemicals.
Desoxypipradrol was eventually made a class B drug and placed in Schedule I on 13 June 2012. There were no recorded deaths from the drug between the banning of its import and the banning of its possession. "Esters and ethers of pipradrol" were controlled with the same amendment as class C drugs.
