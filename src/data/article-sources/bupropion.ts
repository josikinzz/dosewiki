## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkyl-phenylketones. These are aromatic compounds containing a ketone substituted by one alkyl group, and a phenyl group.

### Background

Bupropion (also known as the brand name product Wellbutrin®) is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) used most commonly for the management of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and as an aid for smoking cessation. Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).

12
Bupropion was originally classified as an "atypical" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,
9
,
10
bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.
8
,
16
Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.
10
,
11
When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.
15
,
1
,
14
A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as
nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT).
13
Bupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response.
7
Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD.
28
When used in combination with
naltrexone
in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.
24
Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and
naltrexone
increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.
24
,
20
,
22
The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo.
21

### Indication

Bupropion is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and as an aid to smoking cessation.
When used in combination with
naltrexone
as the marketed product ContraveⓇ, bupropion is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of: 30 kg/m^2 or greater (obese) or 27 kg/m^2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia).
Bupropion is also used off-label as a first-line treatment in patients with ADHD and comorbid bipolar disorder when used as an adjunct to mood stabilizers.
28

### Pharmacodynamics

Bupropion is chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or other known antidepressant agents. Compared to classical tricyclic antidepressants, Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. In addition, Bupropion does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Bupropion has been found to be essentially inactive at the serotonin transporter (SERT)(IC50 >10 000 nM),
12
however both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion have been found to block the function of cation-selective serotonin type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs).
Bupropion produces dose-related central nervous system (CNS) stimulant effects in animals, as evidenced by increased locomotor activity, increased rates of responding in various schedule-controlled operant behaviour tasks, and, at high doses, induction of mild stereotyped behaviour
Label
. Due to these stimulant effects and selective activity at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, bupropion has been identified as having an abuse potential.
Label
,
17
Bupropion has a similar structure to the controlled substance
Cathinone
, and has been identified as having mild amphetamine-like activity, particularly when inhaled or injected.
17
Bupropion is also known to lower the seizure threshold, making any pre-existing seizure conditions a contraindication to its use. This risk is exacerbated when bupropion is combined with other drugs or substances that lower the seizure threshold, such as
cocaine
, or in clinical situations that would increase the risk of a seizure such as abrupt alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.
Label
As norepinephrine has been shown to have anticonvulsant properties, bupropion's inhibitory effects on NET are thought to contribute to its pro-convulsant activity.
17
Bupropion has been shown to increase blood pressure and pose a risk for exacerbation of unmanaged or pre-existing hypertension,
18
,
Label
however, clinical trials of bupropion in smokers with CVD have not identified an increased incidence of CV events including stroke or heart attack.
19
In clinical trials, the mean increase in systolic blood pressure associated with the use of bupropion was found to be 1.3 mmHg.

### Absorption

Bupropion is currently available in 3 distinct, but bioequivalent formulations: immediate release (IR), sustained-release (SR), and extended-release (XL).
Immediate Release Formulation
In humans, following oral administration of bupropion hydrochloride tablets, peak plasma bupropion concentrations are usually achieved within 2 hours. IR formulations provide a short duration of action and are therefore generally dosed three times per day.
Sustained Release Formulation
In humans, following oral administration of bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release tablets (SR), peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of bupropion is usually achieved within 3 hours. SR formulations provide a 12-hour extended release of medication and are therefore generally dosed twice per day.
Extended Release Formulation
Following single oral administration of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) to healthy volunteers, the median time to peak plasma concentrations for bupropion was approximately 5 hours. The presence of food did not affect the peak concentration or area under the curve of bupropion. XL formulations provide a 24-hour extended release of medication and are therefore generally dosed once per day/
In a trial comparing chronic dosing with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) 150 mg twice daily to bupropion immediate-release formulation 100 mg 3 times daily, the steady state Cmax for bupropion after bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release tablets (SR) administration was approximately 85% of those achieved after bupropion immediate-release formulation administration. Exposure (AUC) to bupropion was equivalent for both formulations. Bioequivalence was also demonstrated for all three major active metabolites (i.e., hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion) for both Cmax and AUC. Thus, at steady state, bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release tablets (SR) given twice daily, and the immediate-release formulation of bupropion given 3 times daily, are essentially bioequivalent for both bupropion and the 3 quantitatively important metabolites.
Label
Furthermore, in a study comparing 14-day dosing with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL), 300 mg once-daily to the immediate-release formulation of bupropion at 100 mg 3 times daily, equivalence was demonstrated for peak plasma concentration and area under the curve for bupropion and the three metabolites (hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion). Additionally, in a study comparing 14-day dosing with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) 300 mg once daily to the sustained-release formulation of bupropion at 150 mg 2 times daily, equivalence was demonstrated for peak plasma concentration and area under the curve for bupropion and the three metabolites.
Label
Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) can be taken with or without food. Bupropion Cmax and AUC were increased by 11% to 35% and 16% to 19%, respectively, when bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) was administered with food to healthy volunteers in three trials. The food effect is not considered clinically significant.
Label
Following a single-dose administration of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) in humans, Cmax of bupropion's metabolite hydroxybupropion occurs approximately 6 hours post-dose and is approximately 10 times the peak level of the parent drug at steady state. The elimination half-life of hydroxybupropion is approximately 20 (±5) hours and its AUC at steady state is about 17 times that of bupropion. The times to peak concentrations for the erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites are similar to that of the hydroxybupropion metabolite. However, their elimination half-lives are longer, 33(±10) and 37 (±13) hours, respectively, and steady-state AUCs are 1.5 and 7 times that of bupropion, respectively.
Label

### Metabolism

Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. Three metabolites are active: hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the tert-butyl group of bupropion, and the amino-alcohol isomers, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via reduction of the carbonyl group. In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 enzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion. Hydroxybupropion has been shown to have the same affinity as bupropion for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) but approximately 50% of its antidepressant activity despite reaching concentrations of ~10-fold higher than that of the parent drug.
23
Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of meta-chlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been fully characterized. However, it has been demonstrated in an antidepressant screening test in mice that hydroxybupropion is one-half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion are 5-fold less potent than bupropion. This may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high as or higher than those of bupropion.
Label
Bupropion and its metabolites exhibit linear kinetics following chronic administration of 300 to 450 mg per day.

### Protein binding

In vitro tests show that bupropion is 84% bound to human plasma proteins at concentrations up to 200 mcg per mL. The extent of protein binding of the hydroxybupropion metabolite is similar to that for bupropion, whereas the extent of protein binding of the threohydrobupropion metabolite is about half that seen with bupropion.
Label

### Route of elimination

Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of metachlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. Following oral administration of 200 mg of 14C-bupropion in humans, 87% and 10% of the radioactive dose were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. However, the fraction of the oral dose of bupropion excreted unchanged was only 0.5%, a finding consistent with the extensive metabolism of bupropion.

### General Function

Electrogenic voltage-dependent transporter that mediates the transport of a variety of organic cations such as endogenous bioactive amines, cationic drugs and xenobiotics (PubMed:9260930, PubMed:9687576). Functions as a Na(+)-independent, bidirectional uniporter (PubMed:21128598, PubMed:9687576). Cation cellular uptake or release is driven by the electrochemical potential, i.e. membrane potential and concentration gradient (PubMed:15212162, PubMed:9260930, PubMed:9687576). However, may also engage electroneutral cation exchange when saturating concentrations of cation substrates are reached (By similarity). Predominantly expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and proximal tubules and involved in the uptake and disposition of cationic compounds by hepatic and renal clearance from the blood flow (PubMed:15783073). Implicated in monoamine neurotransmitters uptake such as histamine, dopamine, adrenaline/epinephrine, noradrenaline/norepinephrine, serotonin and tyramine, thereby supporting a physiological role in the central nervous system by regulating interstitial concentrations of neurotransmitters (PubMed:16581093, PubMed:17460754, PubMed:9687576). Also capable of transporting dopaminergic neuromodulators cyclo(his-pro), salsolinol and N-methyl-salsolinol, thereby involved in the maintenance of dopaminergic cell integrity in the central nervous system (PubMed:17460754). Mediates the bidirectional transport of acetylcholine (ACh) at the apical membrane of ciliated cell in airway epithelium, thereby playing a role in luminal release of ACh from bronchial epithelium (PubMed:15817714). Also transports guanidine and endogenous monoamines such as vitamin B1/thiamine, creatinine and N-1-methylnicotinamide (NMN) (PubMed:12089365, PubMed:15212162, PubMed:17072098, PubMed:24961373, PubMed:9260930). Mediates the uptake and efflux of quaternary ammonium compound choline (PubMed:9260930). Mediates the bidirectional transport of polyamine agmatine and the uptake of polyamines putrescine and spermidine (PubMed:12538837, PubMed:21128598). Able to transport non-amine endogenous compounds such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2-alpha) (PubMed:11907186). Also involved in the uptake of xenobiotic 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP) (PubMed:12395288, PubMed:16394027). May contribute to regulate the transport of organic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable)

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/bupropion/*

Bupropion is an antidepressant and a smoking cessation aid. The drug has been tested in many other conditions, including ADHD, obesity, and seasonal affective disorder.

It has multiple pharmacological mechanisms and it’s still not entirely clear how bupropion works.

Some recreational use has been reported, though the substance usually isn’t very pleasant and it can be dangerous.

Bupropion = Amfebutamone; Wellbutrin; Zyban; Quomen; Zyntabac; Budeprion

PubChem: 444

Molecular formula: C13H18ClNO

Molecular weight: 239.743 g/mol

IUPAC: 2-(tert-butylamino)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)propan-1-one

---

## Dose

#### Oral (medical)

**Forms**

Instant-release (IR): 75 and 100 mg

Sustained-release (SR): 100, 150, and 200 mg

Extended-release (XR/XL): 150 and 300 mg

The dose usually begins low (such as 100 mg) and is increased over a period of weeks. The final chronic dose depends on the patient’s response and what condition is being treated.

**Maximum dose (total daily exposure)**

SR: 400 mg

IR and XR/XL: 450 mg

**Recreational**

No reasonably safe dose is going to provide much in the way of recreational effects.

The same maximum dose should be observed. Also, the maximum dose is for an entire day’s administration. This means even 300-400 mg IR at once isn’t wise.

---

## Timeline

#### Oral (medical)

Total: Depends on the form being used

Onset: Under 60 minutes

It’s used 1-3x per day depending on the form used and the patient’s response. The instant release form may be taken 3x per day, while the extended-release form can be taken just once.

## Effects

#### Positive

- Stimulation
- Mood lift
- Depression reduction
- Increased focus

#### Negative

- Tachycardia
- Anxiety
- Paranoia
- Hallucinations
- Seizures
- Dry mouth
- Nausea
- Insomnia

#### Medical

It’s primarily used for depression and smoking cessation. Some use also exists for ADHD, seasonal affective disorder, and other conditions.

**Depression**

Efficacy

Studies indicate it is superior to placebo and may take up to 4 weeks for the maximal effect to appear. Treatment usually continues at least for several months.

Some 8-week trials have yielded a 35-40% remission rate, but this will depend on the treatment population.

Not all studies are in agreement about its efficacy. For example, in one review of six studies, only two reported bupropion XR to significantly outperform placebo on the core outcome measure (depression).

When it’s effective, the drug may lead to positive changes on ratings of energy, pleasure, and interest. There can be some accompanying decline in anxiety for some users, but it’s not reliable.

VS other antidepressants

A study looking at patients who didn’t tolerate citalopram or didn’t respond to it found bupropion had a 25% remission rate during a 14-week trial.

Most research suggests its overall efficacy is similar to SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine), TCAs (nortriptyline, amitriptyline, doxepin), and trazodone.

Three studies comparing bupropion to venlafaxine (SNRI) didn’t find any significant differences.

A meta-analysis of bupropion vs SSRIs found similar response rates for depression. Bupropion was often superior on measures of drowsiness and fatigue.

Bupropion produces less sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and sedation relative to SSRIs and TCAs. Bupropion has a higher incidence of dry mouth and may also produce more insomnia.

While weight gain sometimes occurs, it’s not as common (relative to SRIs and TCAs) and weight loss is more common.

Compared to trazodone, bupropion caused less drowsiness, less increase in appetite, and a lower chance of edema. It was more likely to have an anorexic effect and to increase anxiety.

**Smoking cessation**

Bupropion is more effective than placebo at raising the chance of quitting. It’s equally as effective as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The effect rate drops once a patient stops taking bupropion. Longer treatment periods (e.g. 6 months vs 7-12 weeks) might be useful in raising the long-term efficacy.

It’s sometimes preferred by tobacco users who dislike the idea of continuing nicotine or who have failed with NRT in the past.

One study found it was superior to minimal counseling but not more effective than intensive psychological counseling.

Bupropion is less effective than varenicline overall and may be less effective than combinations of NRT.

The drug seems to reliably alleviate withdrawal symptoms and reduce craving during abstinence.

Dose-dependency does exist, with 300 mg appearing to be superior to 100 mg.

Treatment continues for a period of months and a nicotine quit attempt is usually made in the second week.

**ADHD**

It is sometimes used in cases of ADHD. Studies suggest it’s effective for some, though the overall efficacy is lower than what’s seen with methylphenidate and other typical treatments.

Controlled clinical trial

It reduced ADHD symptoms relative to baseline significantly more than placebo.

There was a 52% response rate, which is significant yet lower than what’s typically seen with traditional ADHD drugs.

A 42% reduction in ADHD scores was noted at Week 6, compared to 24% for placebo.

**Seasonal affective disorder**

Efficacy has been demonstrated in multiple placebo-controlled trials. It outperformed placebo in 3/3 studies examined in a review.

Treatment begins prior to the onset of depressive episodes with the intention of reducing the occurrence of depression.

#### Addictive behaviors

Studies have looked at its impact on cocaine dependence, pathological gambling, methamphetamine dependence, and even video game addiction.

For cocaine, a possible benefit was seen and a study suggested there was a greater effect in those with higher comorbid depression. Some research has found it doesn’t reliably lead to reduced craving and isn’t very effective at reducing use.

Video game addiction

Bupropion SR was examined in a group of patients with an addiction to video games. In those individuals, a rise in activity in certain parts of the brain, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), is seen in the presence of gaming-related stimuli.

Bupropion reduced the DLPFC activity and was associated with reduced maladaptive behavior patterns pertaining to gaming.

**Other**

Obesity

One study with 50 women found it might be useful relative to placebo in cases of obesity. The efficacy may have at least partly come from better diet compliance in the bupropion group.

Treating SRI-induced sexual dysfunction

It’s sometimes used in clinical practice when sexual dysfunction is present during SSRI or SNRI therapy. There is evidence that it can reduce measures of sexual dysfunction, thereby resulting in a rise in sexual desire and related measures.

Altering SRI therapy

Studies have provided contradictory efficacy levels for bupropion combined with SSRIs. However, the combination tends to be better than continued monotherapy in those who lack an adequate response to their SSRI or SNRI.

Combining them does appear to raise the chance of seizure and serotonin syndrome.

TNF-a activity

There’s some evidence from humans and animals that it inhibits TNF-a and could therefore be useful in some inflammatory conditions. Reports exist of it helping with Crohn’s disease and aphthous ulceration.

#### Negatives

The primary negatives in medical settings are dry mouth, insomnia, agitation, and dizziness. Some patients find it leads to a jittery, overstimulated, or otherwise uncomfortable feeling, which is a common reason for treatment to be stopped.

It’s not associated with a significance rise in neuropsychiatric or cardiac problems.

Seizures are the primary severe medical concern and they’re dose-dependent. 450 – 600 mg is much riskier than 300 – 450 mg, for example.

Many overdoses include seizures and they’ve even been reported in medical settings. The risk is low in patients with no risk factors if they begin at a sub-maximum dose and don’t exceed the max dose during treatment.

#### Recreational

The most popular claim about its effects is that it’s reminiscent of a very weak cocaine-like effect when take intranasally. Some recreational effects have been reported at high oral doses as well.

A lot of people find it never becomes recreational, however. It often just produces a state filled with tachycardia, anxiety, and tremor.

It’s primarily taken due to accessibility. People may be prescribed the drug and have it on hand or know someone who has a prescription. Many chronic users have a prior substance use disorder.

At most, bupropion offers a light form of stimulation and mood lift for about an hour (intranasal). The maximum daily dose should never be exceeded nor should it be reached with a single administration.

2002 study

It was found that in patients with a substance abuse history, 400 mg oral could yield some mild amphetamine-like effects.

Case reports

Case 1

- 13-year-old female
- Took 600 mg oral
- Told it would be better than amphetamine
- No adverse effects noted

Case 2

- 16-year-old male
- 900 mg of bupropion SR intranasally

- Reported a brief “buzz” from taking the crushed tablets on prior occasions 
- Friends also used it

Case 3

- 15-year-old female
- Prescribed for ADHD, but ended up using it recreationally and diverting tablets to friends.
- She reported a “buzz” that only lasted a matter of seconds.

Case 4

- 44-year-old male
- History of polysubstance dependence
- Learned about intranasal bupropion use during a single night in jail.

- The use led to a “high” that lasted up to 30 minutes. 
- Reported to be “only about 20% of cocaine’s high.”
- He would use up to seven 300 mg bupropion tablets. 
- Only the first one or two got him “high.”

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Bupropion is a monocyclic aminoketone that’s structurally distinct from SSRIs and TCAs.

Some of its structure is shared with phenethylamines and amfepramone.

#### Pharmacology

The mechanisms of action aren’t fully understood. Two key components appear to be dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and antagonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

Its metabolism plays a role as well, as multiple active drugs are produced, in particular hydroxybupropion. Some of the research has been complicated by significant differences in bupropion metabolism between rats and humans. Mice and guinea pigs appear to be better test subjects for this reason.

**Monoamine reuptake inhibition**

Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. It may also affect the release of both.

- IC50 values 
- NET: 1.37 uM
- DAT: 1.64 uM
- SERT: 28.69 uM

**Nicotinic antagonism**

Bupropion antagonizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, including a3b2, a4b2, and a7. It’s most potent at a3b2 and least potent at a7.

The antagonism is affecting receptor subtypes associated with dopamine and norepinephrine release. Bupropion may also antagonize nicotine-evoked dopamine activity.

**Nitric oxide & cGMP**

Some research suggests a connection between antidepressant activity and modulation of nitric oxide.

One study found nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, including methylene blue, could raise extracellular levels of serotonin and dopamine in rats.

Bupropion study

Bupropion in mice can dose-dependently reduce the immobility period in depression tests with an ED50 of 18.5 mg/kg (IP). It also increases locomotor activity.

A rise in dopamine and its metabolite, homovanillic acid, was noted in mouse brain. Over 20 mg/kg raises norepinephrine.

Pretreatment with l-arginine, a nitric oxide precursor, reversed the beneficial effect of bupropion on the immobility period. While 7-nitroindazole, a NOS inhibitor, boosted the beneficial effect of lower-dose bupropion. Methylene blue had the same effect as 7-nitroindazole.

It was hypothesized bupropion was ultimately helpful due to it decreasing cGMP levels. This is due to its effect also being antagonized by sildenafil, a PDE5 inhibitor. PDE5 plays a role in intracellular cGMP concentrations.

**Altering nicotine tolerance and withdrawal**

Multiple actions may contribute to bupropion’s ability to reduce nicotine use. A study in mice shed light on some of its nicotine-related activities.

Bupropion reversed chronic tolerance to nicotine-induced antinociception (tail flick test) at 20 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg. Hydroxybupropion achieved the same with 5 mg/kg, though not 1 mg/kg.

A dose-dependent reversal of tolerance to nicotine-induced hypothermia was also recorded with both drugs.

Mechanisms

Two core mechanisms were proposed.

First, it may reverse tolerance via nicotinic antagonism. Bupropion and hydroxybupropion antagonize nACh receptors that mediate nicotine-induced antinociception and hypothermia. Those receptors also play a role in the reward mechanisms of nicotine and may be connected to withdrawal symptoms.

Second, nicotine may cause adaptive pre or post-synaptic noradrenergic changes. If so, greater norepinephrine activity from bupropion and hydroxybupropion could combat some aspects of withdrawal that are dependent on noradrenergic adaptations.

**CYP2D6**

It inhibits CYP2D6, leading to interactions with certain other drugs. Interactions caused by this activity have shown up in the literature.

The inhibition is significant enough to raise the chance of adverse effects or alter the efficacy of other drugs.

**Metabolites**

Hydroxybupropion is significantly more biased towards norepinephrine overall. S,S-Hydroxybupropion is similar to bupropion with its monoamine reuptake inhibition, however.

S,S-Hydroxybupropion is also more potent as an a4b2 nACh antagonist and it alleviates nicotine withdrawal in mice with a greater potency than bupropion.

Hydroxybupropion can decrease the firing rate of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. The action is inhibited by yohimbine, an a2 adrenergic antagonist. Animal studies have found the dose required for this dampened noradrenergic activity is correlated with antidepressant action.

#### Pharmacokinetics

IR Tmax: 1.5 to 2 hours

SR Tmax: 3 hours

XR Tmax: 5 hours

Half-life: Around 21 hours with chronic use

The core metabolites are hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion. Their half-lives are around 20-30 hours or greater and they accumulate more with chronic use.

Hydroxybupropion’s steady-state concentration is 7 to 10 times higher than bupropion’s.

Its primary metabolic route is through CYP2B6, which leads to hydroxybupropion. Other mechanisms lead to the other metabolites.

## History

#### 1969

Nariman Mehta, a chemist who was working for Burroughs Wellcome, synthesized the drug. They were looking for a new antidepressant.

#### 1970s

Testing began in the 1970s and the in vivo effects were reported to be different from amphetamine in 1977.

#### 1980s

The FDA granted approval to bupropion for depression in late 1985. It was quickly withdrawn from the market due to concerns about its seizure potential.

A notable seizure risk appeared in a study involving bulimic patients. When further research occurred, it was clear the drug could be used safely if more care was taken.

It reentered the US market in 1989 as an antidepressant. The dosing was adjusted downward due to the realization than under 450 mg only had a small connection to seizures.

#### 1980 – 1990s

Dr. Linda Ferry (and others) noticed that depressed patients given bupropion would sometimes spontaneously reduce or quit tobacco.

Controlled trials in non-depressed people supported its efficacy as a smoking cessation aid.

It was approved for smoking cessation in 1997 under the name Zyban, a sustained-release form of the drug. This made it the first pharmacotherapy for tobacco addiction other than nicotine in the US.

#### 1998 – 1999

Bupropion accounted for 5% of all antidepressant medication exposures reported to the US’ Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS).

#### Early 2000s

A bit of attention was given to the drug’s use in tobacco addiction as well as its use in ADHD. Prescribing was taking place for ADHD in minors.

#### 2000s

More reports of recreational use showed up, often with it being used intranasally. Some of the cases involved people who had been prescribed the drug, including adolescents given the drug for ADHD.

One location where it’s been used to a notable degree is in some prisons.

The XL formulation was approved in 2003 and entered the market in 2004.

A warning about possible severe neuropsychiatric problems with antidepressants including Bupropion was issued by the FDA in 2004. The FDA extended its warning to cover its use in smoking cessation in 2009.

The warning followed a few dozen reports of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior between 1997 and 2007. Though, it wasn’t (and isn’t) clear that there’s a particularly concerning connection between bupropion and suicidal activity.

#### 2007

It was reported to be the top smoking cessation aid in the US. An estimated 8.7 million prescriptions were being dispensed annually.

#### Mid 2000s – 2010s

A rise in recreational use seemed to be recorded, including a number of reports of intravenous (IV) administration. IV use was connected to a few cases of tissue damage.

Most of the chronic use reports have involved people who previously had another substance use disorder. It’s still not a particularly common recreational drug.

---

## Legal Status

#### US (as of January 2017)

Unscheduled, though it’s only available with a prescription.

#### Other countries

It tends to be unscheduled. It might be prescription-only depending on the country.

---

## Safety

Typical medical doses aren’t associated with severe medical concerns in otherwise healthy people. But the drug does have a narrow safety range given its seizure risk.

#### Overdose

The most common overdose symptoms are agitation, stimulation, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, seizures, hallucinations, and tremor. Tachycardia is typically the only cardiac problem, though cardiac conduction delays have been noted on a few occasions.

One review found tremor occurred in 7.1 to 24% of overdoses.

Over 1 gram produces the most severe effects, but overdose symptoms can appear in the hundreds of milligrams.

#### Seizures

Seizures are the most common severe medical problem associated with bupropion overdose. The risk is fairly low at common therapeutic doses, yet it becomes quite high in overdose. Seizures are more likely when the drug is combined with stimulants.

The onset can be delayed up to 12+ hours, though the onset is almost always under 12 hours (often under 6) with IR use.

Even 150 to 450 mg may lower the seizure threshold, which is a problem for susceptible individuals. The median seizure dose is over 1-2 grams.

Reports

Report 1

- US Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (1998 – 1999)
- Found 6% of accidental/intentional overdoses led to seizures.
- IR use had a greater correlation to seizures than SR.

Report 2

- Analysis of 385 intentional overdoses reported between 1998 and 1998.
- Seizures occurred in 11% of cases.
- The rate increased to 41% when only looking at cases with other clinical effects.
- Onset: Mostly under 6 hours.
- Dose: More common over 2.5 grams

Report 3

- Analysis of dozens of overdose cases
- Mean dose for seizures: 3078 mg 
- Range: 575 – 6000 mg

Report 4

- Found to mainly occur with monodrug use and over 600 mg.
- Occurred in 37 patients (31.6%)
- Onset: Ranged from 0.5 to 24 hours 
- It was under 8 hours in 25/37 patients
- Tachycardia, agitation, and tremor were more common in those with seizures.

Report 5

- Australian review
- Found 37% of overdoses resulted in seizure
- Mean dose for seizures: 4.8 grams

Report 6

- Analysis of 385 cases of intentional overdose
- Seizures in 41 (11%) of cases
- Dose range: 600 mg to 18 grams
- Most common in those who took over 2.5 grams or those who used other stimulants.
- Nearly all those who had seizures also had a prodrome of neurological symptoms 
- Agitation, tremor, and hallucinations
- There was one atypical case of delayed onset 
- First seizure at 9 hours
- No prodrome
- Took 6.75 grams of bupropion XR

#### Psychosis and hallucinations

Both psychosis and hallucinations have occasionally been reported in medical settings. Hallucinations are fairly often seen with significant overdoses.

The symptoms include visual hallucinations (e.g. figures walking around), auditory hallucinations (e.g. voices), severe agitation, and disorientation to time. There’s at least one report where the hallucinated voices were suggesting self-harm.

These problems may be more common when over 400 mg/d is used. Some patients have encountered issues after a dose increase and reported a resolution of symptoms when their dose was lowered.

#### Problems in clinical settings

There’s a very low rate of serious adverse reactions (SARs) and death with the therapeutic use of bupropion.

When SARs develop, they usually occur within the first 14 days of treatment. That timeline fits with the time it would take for steady state to appear after a dose increase early in the second week.

The most common SARs are seizures, angiodema, and serum thickness-like reactions.

A few rare cases of bullous eruption have been recorded.

- One review 
- 9 cases 
- 6 cases of erythema multiforme
- 3 cases of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome

Hepatotoxicity

This has only been reported on a few occasions in patients and at very high doses in animals with prolonged administration. It’s been nearly absent from clinical tests.

One review found at least 3 instances of hepatotoxicity, one of which led to death. All cases developed within the first 6 months of treatment.

*Case report (2005)*

- 55-year-old male
- Prescribed bupropion for smoking cessation
- Also taking warfarin and paroxetine.
- Taking 150 mg/d for 6 months
- Reported easy bruising, jaundice, fever, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.
- He ended up dying from acute liver failure. 
- There was extensive necrosis and shrunken liver.
- Bupropion was blamed, not the warfarin or paroxetine, both of which were being used before bupropion.

Bupropion, formerly called amfebutamone, and sold under the brand name Wellbutrin among others, is an atypical antidepressant that is indicated in the treatment of major depressive disorder and seasonal affective disorder and to support smoking cessation. A norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), it is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of "incomplete response" to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: It does not usually cause sexual dysfunction, it is not associated with weight gain and sleepiness, and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue. Bupropion, particularly the immediate-release formulation, carries a higher risk of seizure than many other antidepressants; hence, caution is recommended in patients with a history of seizure disorder. The medication is taken by mouth.
Common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. Raised blood pressure is notable. Rare but serious side effects include seizures, liver toxicity, psychosis, and risk of overdose. Bupropion use during pregnancy may be associated with increased likelihood of congenital heart defects.
Bupropion acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and a nicotinic receptor antagonist. However, its effects on dopamine are weak and clinical significance is contentious. Chemically, bupropion is an aminoketone that belongs to the class of substituted cathinones and more generally that of substituted amphetamines and substituted phenethylamines.
Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta, who worked at Burroughs Wellcome, in 1969. It was first approved for medical use in the United States in 1985. Bupropion was originally called by the generic name amfebutamone, before being renamed in 2000. In 2023, it was the seventeenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States and the third most common antidepressant, with more than 30 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination dextromethorphan/bupropion to serve as a rapid-acting antidepressant in patients with major depressive disorder.

## Medical uses

### Depression

The evidence overall supports the effectiveness of bupropion over placebo for the treatment of depression. Some peer-reviewed studies suggest the quality of evidence is low. Some meta-analyses report that bupropion has an at-most small effect size for depression. One meta-analysis reported a large effect size. However, there were methodological limitations with this meta-analysis, including using a subset of only five trials for the effect size calculation, substantial variability in effect sizes between the selected trials—which led the authors to state that their findings in this area should be interpreted with "extreme caution"—and general lack of inclusion of unpublished trials in the meta-analysis. Unpublished trials are more likely to be negative in findings, and other meta-analyses have included unpublished trials. Evidence suggests that the effectiveness of bupropion for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants.
Over the autumn and winter months, bupropion can prevent the development of depression in those who have recurring seasonal affective disorder: 15% of participants on bupropion experienced a major depressive episode vs. 27% of those on placebo. Bupropion also improves depression in bipolar disorder, with the efficacy and risk of an affective switch being similar to other antidepressants.
Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction, and the occurrence of sexual side effects is not different from placebo. Bupropion treatment is not associated with weight gain; on the contrary, the majority of studies observed significant weight loss in bupropion-treated participants. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness that may be produced by other antidepressants. Bupropion is more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue in depressed patients. Bupropion is effective in the treatment of anxious depression and, contrary to common belief, does not exacerbate anxiety in this context. The effectiveness of bupropion for anxious depression is equivalent to that of SSRIs in the case of depression with low or moderate anxiety, whereas SSRIs show a modest effectiveness advantage in terms of response rates for depression with high anxiety.
The addition of bupropion to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people do not respond to the SSRI, and it is supported by clinical trials. However, it appears to be inferior to the addition of atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole.

### Smoking cessation

Prescribed as an aid for smoking cessation, bupropion reduces the severity of craving for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms such as depressed mood, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and increased appetite. Initially, bupropion slows the weight gain that often occurs in the first weeks after quitting smoking. With time, however, this effect becomes negligible.
The bupropion treatment course lasts for seven to twelve weeks, with the patient halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. After the course, the effectiveness of bupropion for maintaining abstinence from smoking declines over time, from 37% of tobacco abstinence at three months to 20% at one year. It is unclear whether extending bupropion treatment helps to prevent relapse of smoking.
Overall, six months after the therapy, bupropion increases the likelihood of quitting smoking approximately 1.6-fold as compared to placebo. In this respect, bupropion is as effective as nicotine replacement therapy but inferior to varenicline. Combining bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy does not improve the quitting rate.
In children and adolescents, the use of bupropion for smoking cessation does not appear to offer any significant benefits. The evidence for its use to aid smoking cessation in pregnant women is insufficient.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

In the United States, the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not an approved indication of bupropion, and it is not mentioned in the 2019 guideline on ADHD treatment from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Systematic reviews of bupropion for the treatment of ADHD in both adults and children note that bupropion may be effective for ADHD but warn that this conclusion has to be interpreted with caution, because clinical trials were of low quality due to small sizes and risk of bias. Similarly to atomoxetine, bupropion has a delayed onset of action for ADHD, and several weeks of treatment are required for therapeutic effects. This is in contrast to stimulants, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate, which have an immediate onset of effect in the condition.

### Sexual dysfunction

Bupropion is less likely than other antidepressants to cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies indicate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction including sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI antidepressants. There have also been small studies suggesting that bupropion or a bupropion/trazodone combination may improve some measures of sexual function in women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) and are not depressed. According to an expert consensus recommendation from the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, bupropion can be considered as an off-label treatment for HSDD despite limited safety and efficacy data. Likewise, a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of bupropion for sexual desire disorder in women reported that although data were limited, bupropion appeared to be dose-dependently effective for the condition.

### Weight loss

Bupropion, when used for treating long-term weight gain over six to twelve months, results in an average weight loss of 2.7 kilograms (6.0 lb) compared to a placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other weight-loss medications such as sibutramine or orlistat. The combination drug naltrexone/bupropion has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity.

### Other uses

Bupropion is not effective in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but it is showing promise in reducing drug use in treating amphetamine-type stimulant use and cravings. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion is not proven to be effective in treating chronic low back pain. The drug may be useful in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and narcolepsy.
Bupropion has been used to treat disorders of diminished motivation, like apathy, abulia, and akinetic mutism. Accordingly, the drug has been found to increase effort expenditure and improve motivational deficits in animal models. However, only limited benefits of bupropion in the treatment of apathy have been observed in clinical trials in various conditions.
Bupropion has been used in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).

### Available forms

Bupropion is available as an oral tablet in several different formulations. It is mainly formulated as the hydrochloride salt but also as the hydrobromide salt. In addition to single-drug formulations, bupropion is formulated in combinations including naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) for obesity and dextromethorphan/bupropion (Auvelity) for depression.

## Contraindications

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescription label advises that bupropion should not be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents, and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.

## Side effects

The common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. Bupropion has the highest incidence of insomnia of all second-generation antidepressants, apart from desvenlafaxine. It is also associated with about 20% increased risk of headache.
Bupropion raises blood pressure in some people. One study showed an average rise of 6 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure in 10% of patients. The prescribing information notes that hypertension, sometimes severe, is observed in some people taking bupropion, both with and without pre-existing hypertension. The safety of bupropion in people with cardiovascular conditions and its general cardiovascular safety profile remains unclear due to the lack of data.
Seizure is a rare but serious adverse effect of bupropion. It is strongly dose-dependent: for the immediate release preparation, the seizure incidence is 0.4% at the dose 300–450 mg per day; the incidence climbs almost ten-fold for the higher than recommended dose of 600 mg. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07–0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally 0–0.5% at the recommended doses.
Cases of liver toxicity leading to death or liver transplantation have been reported for bupropion. It is considered to be one of several antidepressants with a greater risk of hepatotoxicity.
The prescribing information warns about bupropion triggering an angle-closure glaucoma attack. On the other hand, bupropion may decrease the risk of development of open angle glaucoma.
Bupropion use by mothers in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a 23% increase in the odds of congenital heart defects in their children.
Bupropion has rarely been associated with instances of Stevens–Johnson syndrome.
Bupropion has not been associated with QT prolongation at therapeutic doses but has been associated with QT prolongation in overdose.

### Psychiatric

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in people younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA, which found a two-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.
Bupropion prescribed for smoking cessation results in a 25% increase in the risk of psychiatric side effects, in particular, anxiety (about 40% increase) and insomnia (about 80% increase). The evidence is insufficient to determine whether bupropion is associated with suicides or suicidal behavior.
In rare cases, bupropion-induced psychosis may develop. It is associated with higher doses of bupropion; many cases described are at higher than recommended doses. Concurrent antipsychotic medication appears to be protective. In most cases, the psychotic symptoms are eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment, or adding antipsychotic medication.
Although studies are lacking, a handful of case reports suggest that abrupt discontinuation of bupropion may cause antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.

## Overdose

Bupropion is considered moderately dangerous in overdose. According to an analysis of US National Poison Data System, adjusted for the number of prescriptions, bupropion and venlafaxine are the two new-generation antidepressants (i.e., non-tricyclic antidepressants) that result in the highest mortality and morbidity. For significant overdoses, seizures have been reported in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, having had multiple uncontrolled seizures and myocardial infarction.

## Interactions

Since bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the enzyme CYP2B6, drug interactions with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: This includes such medications as paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine (active metabolite of fluoxetine), diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected result is an increase in bupropion and a decrease in hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, and phenobarbital. Indeed, carbamazepine decreases exposure to bupropion by 90% and increases exposure to hydroxybupropion by 94%. Ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and efavirenz have been shown to decrease levels of bupropion and/or its metabolites. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel, both potent CYP2B6 inhibitors, have been found to considerably increase bupropion levels as well as decrease levels of its metabolite hydroxybupropion.
Bupropion and its metabolites are inhibitors of CYP2D6, with hydroxybupropion responsible for most of the inhibition. Additionally, bupropion and its metabolites may decrease the expression of CYP2D6 in the liver. The end effect is a significant slowing of the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. For instance, bupropion has been found to increase area-under-the-curve of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, five-fold. Bupropion has also been found to increase levels of atomoxetine 5.1-fold, while decreasing the exposure to its main metabolite 1.5-fold. As another example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300 mg/day bupropion. When people on bupropion are given MDMA, about 30% increase of exposure to both drugs is observed, with enhanced mood but decreased heart rate effects of MDMA. Interactions with other CYP2D6 substrates, such as metoprolol, imipramine, nortriptyline, venlafaxine, and nebivolol have also been reported. However, in a notable exception, bupropion does not seem to affect the concentrations of CYP2D6 substrates fluoxetine and paroxetine. Bupropion prevents norepinephrine and dopamine release induced by methamphetamine and has been found to reduce the subjective and sympathomimetic effects of methamphetamine in humans.
Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold, and therefore can potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids. The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance.
Caution should be observed when combining bupropion with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it may result in hypertensive crisis.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The mechanism of action of bupropion in the treatment of depression and for other indications is unclear. However, it is thought to be related to the fact that bupropion is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and negative allosteric modulator of several nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Bupropion does not act as a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent. Pharmacological actions of bupropion, to a substantial degree, are due to its active metabolites hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion, and erythro-hydrobupropion that are present in the blood plasma at comparable or much higher levels. In fact, bupropion could accurately be conceptualized as a prodrug of these metabolites. Overall action of these metabolites, and particularly one enantiomer, S,S-hydroxybupropion, is also characterized by inhibition of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake and nicotinic inhibition (see the chart on the right). Bupropion has no meaningful direct activity at a variety of receptors, including α- and β-adrenergic, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
The occupancy of dopamine transporter (DAT) by bupropion (300 mg/day) and its metabolites in the human brain as measured by several positron emission tomography (PET) studies is approximately 20%, with a mean occupancy range of about 14 to 26%. For comparison, the NDRI methylphenidate at therapeutic doses is thought to occupy greater than 50% of DAT sites. In accordance with its low DAT occupancy, no measurable dopamine release in the human brain was detected with bupropion (one 150 mg dose) in a PET study. Bupropion has also been shown to increase reuptake of dopamine by striatal VMAT2, though it is unknown if this effect is more pronounced than other DRIs. These findings raise questions about the role of dopamine reuptake inhibition in the pharmacology of bupropion, and suggest that other actions may be responsible for its therapeutic effects.
No data are available on occupancy of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) by bupropion and its metabolites. However, due to the increased exposure of hydroxybupropion over bupropion itself, which has higher affinity for the NET than the DAT, bupropion's overall pharmacological profile in humans may end up making it effectively more of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor than a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Accordingly, the clinical effects of bupropion are more consistent with noradrenergic activity than with dopaminergic actions. 
Bupropion has a particularly odd pattern of inducing DAT inhibition, since it displays markedly enhanced binding affinity towards the DAT-(NET S1) mutant (DAT with NET primary binding site) over normal (wild-type) DAT, and noticeably diminished binding affinity towards the NET-(DAT S1) mutant (NET with DAT primary binding site) over regular (wild-type) NET. In spite of clear preference for NET binding site by itself, bupropion retains overall preference for complete DAT, implying that bupropion may make use of non-binding sites on the DAT molecule to exert its own binding, as well as the potential of augmented affinity for NET if its binding site is otherwise conformationally exposed.
Bupropion has been claimed to be a sigma σ1 receptor agonist. Its antidepressant-like effects in rodents depend on σ1 receptor activation. They are enhanced and inhibited by σ1 receptor agonists and antagonists, respectively. However, no data on the binding or functional effects of bupropion at the human sigma receptors seem to be available. In any case, bupropion has been reported to bind to rodent σ1 receptors with IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 580 to 2,100 nM. In contrast to many other phenethylamines and amphetamines, bupropion is not an agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).
Bupropion has been found to have a mixture of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory activity through modulation of the immune system. One such mechanism underlying these effects may be reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The catecholaminergic actions of bupropion may be involved in its immunomodulatory effects.

### Pharmacokinetics

After oral administration, bupropion is rapidly and completely absorbed, reaching the peak blood plasma concentration after 1.5 hours (tmax). Sustained-release (SR) and extended-release (XL) formulations have been designed to slow down absorption, resulting in tmax of 3 hours and 5 hours, respectively. Absolute bioavailability of bupropion is unknown but is presumed to be low, at 5–20%, due to the first-pass metabolism. As for the relative bioavailability of the formulations, the XL formulation has lower bioavailability (68%) compared to the SR formulation and immediate release bupropion.
Bupropion is metabolized in the body by a variety of pathways. The oxidative pathways are by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2B6 leading to R,R- and S,S-hydroxybupropion and, to a lesser degree, CYP2C19 leading to 4'-hydroxybupropion. The reductive pathways are by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in the liver and AKR7A2/AKR7A3 in the intestine leading to threo-hydrobupropion and by yet unknown enzyme leading to erythro-hydrobupropion.
The metabolism of bupropion is highly variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest the same amount of the drug may differ by as much as 5.5 times (with a half-life of 12–30 hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7.5 times (with a half-life of 15–25 hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion.
The metabolism of bupropion also seems to follow biphasic pharmacokinetics: the redistribution alpha phase with half-life of about 1 hour precedes the metabolism beta phase of about 12–30 hours. This might explain why abuse is unfeasible due to a short "high", as well as support the use of extended-release formulas to maintain a consistent concentration of bupropion.
The metabolism of bupropion is highly species-dependent. As an example, oral bupropion results in hydroxybupropion levels that are 16-fold higher than those of bupropion itself in humans, whereas in rats, oral bupropion results in levels of bupropion that are 3.4-fold higher than those of hydroxybupropion. The species-dependent metabolism of bupropion is thought to be involved in species differences in its pharmacodynamic effects. For example, bupropion produces psychostimulant-like and reinforcing effects in rodents, whereas oral bupropion at therapeutic doses seems to have much less or no potential for such effects in humans.

## Chemistry

Bupropion is an aminoketone that belongs to the class of substituted cathinones and the more general class of substituted phenethylamines. It is also known structurally as 3-chloro-N-tert-butyl-β-keto-α-methylphenethylamine, 3-chloro-N-tert-butyl-β-ketoamphetamine, or 3-chloro-N-tert-butylcathinone. The clinically used bupropion is racemic, which is a mixture of two enantiomers: S-bupropion and R-bupropion. Although the optical isomers of bupropion can be separated, they rapidly racemize under physiological conditions.
Bupropion is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C13H18ClNO and a molecular weight of 239.74 g/mol. It is a highly lipophilic compound, with an experimental log P of 3.6. Pharmaceutically, bupropion is used mainly as the hydrochloride salt but also to a lesser extent as the hydrobromide salt.
A number of analogues of bupropion exist, such as hydroxybupropion, radafaxine, and manifaxine, among others. These compounds are norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) similarly to bupropion. The analogues of bupropion with the N-tert-butyl group removed or replaced with an N-methyl group, 3-chlorocathinone (3-CC) and 3-chloromethcathinone (3-CMC; clophedrone), respectively, are potent serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agents (SNDRAs). They have been encountered as cathinone designer and recreational drugs. The analogue of bupropion with the N-tert-butyl group replaced with an N-cyclopropyl group is 3-chloro-N-cyclopropylcathinone (3Cl-CpC; PAL-433, RTI-6037-39). It is a hybrid serotonin releasing agent (SRA) and serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI) and was being investigated for potential treatment of cocaine dependence.
There have been reported cases of false-positive urine amphetamine tests in persons taking bupropion.

### Synthesis

It is synthesized in two chemical steps starting from the phenone 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position adjacent to the ketone group is first brominated followed by 1. nucleophilic displacement at resulting alpha-bromoketone group of the

## History

Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the US patent for it was granted in 1974. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of seizures at the originally recommended dosage (400–600 mg/day) caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and bupropion was reintroduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose of 450 mg/day.
In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a sustained-release formulation of alcohol-resistant bupropion called Wellbutrin SR, a tablet intended to be taken twice a day (as compared with three times a day for immediate-release Wellbutrin). In 2003, the FDA approved another sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, a hard-shelled tablet intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada. In 1997, bupropion was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder.
In October 2007, two providers of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements, ConsumerLab.com and The People's Pharmacy, released the results of comparative tests of different brands of bupropion. The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that "one of a few generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, sold as Budeprion XL 300 mg, didn't perform the same as the brand-name pill in the lab." The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that Budeprion XL is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL regarding bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL. On 3 October 2012, however, the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that "Budeprion XL 300 mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300 mg." The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. As of October 2013 the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent.
In April 2008, the FDA approved a formulation of bupropion as a hydrobromide salt instead of a hydrochloride salt, to be sold under the name Aplenzin by Sanofi-Aventis. It is an extended-release tablet intended for once-daily use. It was approved on the basis of bioequivalence with Wellbutrin XL.
In 2009, the FDA issued a health advisory warning that the prescription of bupropion for smoking cessation has been associated with reports of unusual behavior changes, agitation, and hostility. Some people, according to the advisory, have become depressed or have had their depression worsen, have had thoughts about suicide or dying, or have attempted suicide. This advisory was based on a review of anti-smoking products that identified 75 reports of "suicidal adverse events" for bupropion over ten years. Based on the results of follow-up trials this warning was removed in 2016.
In 2012, the US Justice Department announced that GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a \$3 billion fine, in part for promoting the unapproved use of Wellbutrin for weight loss and sexual dysfunction.
In 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended suspending a number of nationally approved medicines due to misrepresentation of bioequivalence study data by Micro Therapeutic Research Labs in India. The products recommended for suspension included several 300 mg modified-release bupropion tablets.
Following EMA's call for an industry-wide review of medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines, GlaxoSmithKline paused batch release and distribution of bupropion 150 mg tablets in November 2022. In July 2023, EMA raised the acceptable daily intake of nitrosamine impurities, leading GlaxoSmithKline to announce that distribution of bupropion 150 mg tablets would resume "across the EU and Europe" by the end of 2023.

## Society and culture

### Recreational use

Recreational use of bupropion is uncommon. While bupropion demonstrates some potential for recreational use, this potential is less than that of other commonly used stimulants, being limited by features of its pharmacology. Case reports describe the recreational use of bupropion as producing a "high" similar to cocaine or amphetamine usage but with less intensity. There have been some anecdotal and case-study reports of bupropion abuse, but the bulk of evidence indicates that the subjective effects of bupropion when taken orally are markedly different from those of addictive stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamine. However, bupropion, by non-conventional routes of administration like injection or insufflation, has been reported to be used recreationally in the United States and Canada, notably in prisons.

### Legal status

In Russia bupropion is banned as a narcotic drug, due to it being a derivative of methcathinone. In Australia, France, and the UK, smoking cessation is the only licensed use of bupropion, and no generics are marketed.

### Brand names

Brand names include Wellbutrin, Aplenzin, and Zyban.

## Research

A meta-analysis concluded that it was effective and well-tolerated, especially for avoiding weight gain or sexual side effects.
Bupropion has been studied limitedly in the treatment of social anxiety disorder.
