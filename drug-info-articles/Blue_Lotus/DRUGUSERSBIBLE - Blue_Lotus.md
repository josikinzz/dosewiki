## Subjective Experience

Given that it is so clearly embedded in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs as a
psychoactive sacrament, blue lotus’s place in history is hugely impressive. Only
recently, however, have historians provided the focus this strange plant deserves.

Whilst it is often suggested that the plant material is best experienced via a
concoction created with wine, I have always sampled it stand-alone. This is
invariably my practice, with both botanicals and chemicals.

My first forays were conducted exclusively via the brewing of tea. I experimented
using varying strengths, and with material obtained from a variety of sources. This
approach was largely undertaken on the basis that with so many historical
references, oral consumption must surely produce the required outcome.

I found that this route tended to provide a calming or sedating effect: nothing
exciting but definitely there. The frequently claimed euphoric and aphrodisiacal
qualities were also present, but at a very low level. Accordingly, I marked it at the
time as +*, meaning that I felt its effects, but these were not particularly noteworthy.

Some time later, whilst background researching a different but related species, I
noticed that smoking was occasionally cited as an alternative RoA. As a number of
users claimed that this was more effective, I decided to test this method as well.

Using this approach I found that the qualities referred to above were more
pronounced, and the onset was predictably instant. I gave it a rating of +** to reflect
this. It provided, at least if smoked rarely, a definite relaxing and anxiolytic feel,
without a lingering intoxication or hangover. Again though, there was little evidence
of a psychedelic edge.

I feel that there is significantly more to explore with this plant, but I can state with
absolute certainty that it is psychoactive, although a little temperamental. I fully
intend to return to this at some future date.

NYMPHAEA NUCIFERA & NYMPHAEA RUBRA
Subsequent to this investigation, I discovered that two other members of the same
genus (nymphaea) were purported to be psychoactive. Accordingly, when the
opportunity arose, I obtained samples and tested them.

PINK LOTUS

Given that I found far fewer references to this during research, it wasn’t a surprise to
discover that it was weaker than its more famous sister. Comments like the following
(from the Shroomery forum) confirmed my own experience:

```
“Nymphaea Caerulea is better. They contain similar alkaloids, but Blue Lily,
Nymphaea Caerulea, has more.” ~ rdnp2035
```
I tested it both brewed as a tea (5g) and by smoking it from a bong. The
psychoactivity was there, and presented itself as a mild heady feeling with a degree of
sedation, but it was relatively weak.

RED LILY

Binomial / Botanical Name Nymphaea Rubra
Street Names Red Water Lily
Major Active Compound Unknown
Indigenous Source Temperate & Tropical Asia; Australia;
Papua New Guinea
Form Flowers

I purchased this from a head shop in its native Australia, in a desperate attempt to
overcome jet lag. Sadly, this was to no avail, as I continued to struggle.

There was some psychoactivity in play, or perhaps more accurately, a hint of
psychoactivity. However, to be fair, given my condition, this was always going to be
difficult to distinguish from the general lassitude and tiredness.

This was the weakest of this trio, and has the fewest online references to historical
psychoactive use.
