## SYNTHESIS
The solids that remained following the above decantations were thoroughly triturated under 25 mL methylene chloride and the remaining white powder removed by filtration, washed generously with methylene chloride and air-dried to constant weight. The white solid weight (3.74 g) had an infra-red spectrum consistent with the quaternary salt N,N,N-triallyltryptammonium iodide (cm-1): 753, 950, 980, 991, 1011, 1090, 1100. LCMS indicated a cation with a molecular weight of 281. Removal of the solvent from the mother liquors provided 5.10 g of a yellow-tan solid that had an infra-red spectrum identical to that of a reference sample of diisopropylethylamine hydroiodide.

To a solution of 1.1 g phenylmercaptan (10 mM) in 20 mL acetone, there was added 0.4 g 50% W/W NaOH (5 mM) followed by 2.04 g of N,N,N-triallyltryptammonium iodide (5 mM) and the mixture held at reflux on a steam bath for 12 hr. After removal of all volatiles on the rotary evaporator, the residue was suspended in 75 mL water and made acidic with the addition of aq. HCl. This was washed with 2Ã40 mL methylene chloride (the washings were saved), made basic with 5% NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã40 mL methylene chloride. The combined extracts were stripped of solvent on the rotary evaporator yielding 0.354 g of a pale yellow oil which crystallized. Distillation at the KugelRohr yielded 0.13 g of a white oil which as converted to the DALT hydrochloride salt (as above) weighing 0.10 g. The methylene chloride washings above, on removal of the solvent, yielded a small amount of a brown oil (additional diallyltryptamine) and a clear colorless fluid that set to a spectacular crystalline mass of diphenyldisulfide.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Most listed potencies are based on the generalization that the activity of DALT was similar to that of DMT. Thus when DMT is listed at 60 milligrams, this number appears as the potency of DALT. And if the range of 60â100 milligrams is given for DMT, then DALT is often stated to be at the mid-point, or 80 milligrams. I must apologize in that I am equally guilty of just this kind of sloppy bookkeeping. All this is somewhat supported superficially by the numbers in a chapter that Szara published in 1970 in Efronâs âPsychotomimetic Drugs.â In Figure I, there is stated that a psychotropic dose of diallyltryptamine was â60 mg i.m. or p.o.â but the drug is not mentioned in the text or the discussion. The yet earlier (and first) text mention of DALT is in a paper by Szara and Hearst in 1962 (Annals of the New York Academy of Science, 96 pp 134â142). There it is stated: âAs reported by Szara in Milan in 1957, administration of diethyltryptamine (DET) and dimethyltryptamine (DMT) lead to rapidly developing sympathomimetic effects, as well as to perceptual, emotional and thinking disturbances similar to those that result after administration of LSD or mescaline. However the psychological effects persist for only 1 hour in the case of DMT and for about 2.5 hours in the case of DET; in contrast LSD and mescaline have a much longer (6 to 8 hour) duration.â There is then added the short phrase, âThe dipropyl and diallyl derivatives have similar activities in man, as we found recently.â I finally found the Milan report of Szara: it is in âPsychotropic Drugs,â edited by Garattini and Ghetti (Elsevier, 1957). There, he describes four personal experiences: Three are with DMT at 60, 60 and 75 milligrams, all i.m. and one was with DET (also called T-9) at 60 milligrams, i.m. No mention is made of diallyltryptamine.

So, the early and only discovery report of DALT mentioned neither the synthetic preparation, the dosage taken, the route of administration, nor the effects observed. It merely stated that the activity had been found. I have explored it up to 42 milligrams, I was to a +1 in an hour, back to baseline at the fourth hour, and there was nothing that caught my fancy.
