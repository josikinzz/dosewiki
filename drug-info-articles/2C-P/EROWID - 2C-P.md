DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 Although it shares some qualities with 2C-E and other related phenethylamines, 2C-P appears to have unique and divergent characteristics that some people have found to be intense or challenging, particularly when taken in high doses. Reported effects include out-of-body experiences; confusing, dream-like realities and strong auditory and visual hallucinations. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 2C-P is not known to be associated with compulsive use and physical dependence is extremely unlikely. Because its use is so uncommon, no definitive statements about its use can be made.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[8 mg, oral] "The trees around me and above me were frightening, taking on the characteristics of demons and giant dinosaur- like creatures. The sounds of creatures feasting and writhing in the distance became more pronounced, and closer. I imagined them charging towards me and I felt them breathing down my neck. My back ached and my feet burned from ant bites and splinters. After standing up, I stayed in place for a while staring up at the sky being utterly silent. A wave of fear and anguish came over me wondering if I would ever be sane again." -- [Exp 84690](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=84690)
 
[6 mg, oral] "The experience was not fun. It was far from pleasant. I experienced no severe emotional distress while on the drug. However, around the 9th hour, I started getting bummed out about the duration. I just wanted to sleep. I was exhausted. This drug is physically and psychologically very draining. Regardless, I see incredible therapeutic potential in this drug. Even at my low dose (6 mg), I realized how intense and unforgiving 2C-P could be." -- [Exp 84868](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=84868)
 
[8 mg, oral] "2c-p is a very inspiring drug artistically, affecting both my music and visual work. It could be helpful to writers, and probably anyone who can deal with the length and intensity of the trip." -- [Exp 34277](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=34277)
 
[9 mg, oral] "Visuals are insane." -- [Exp 34341](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=34341)
 
[10 mg, oral] "...some initial stomach discomfort and nausea--nothing too bad. 2cp was more relaxed than 2ci, deeper than 2cb, not as clinical or freaky as 2ce. I felt some jaw and back tension that was a bit painful at times. Visuals were not overwhelming but were pleasant," -- [Exp 83626](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83626)
 
[10 mg, oral] "pretty overwhelmed. Visuals and swirling hitting hard, discomfort comes in waves and is mainly due to the intensity. I noticed stronger colourings in peripheral vision and movement in shadows, a slight trembling like on acid." -- [Exp 76011](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=76011)
 
[10 mg, oral] "I chatted on and on, happily energised, on how magick and nanotechnology and the like were really pretty much the same thing despite many pagan types mistrusting science and, more humorously, how there weren't enough performance enhancing drugs in sport since people try and enhance their performance every other way." -- [Exp 51687](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=51687)
 
[14 mg, oral] "My face and the top of my chest are still electrified. Still getting occasional body rushes. This drug is overstaying its welcome. For the next 4 hours I have an annoying tension in my face as though it's the last place for the drug to leave my body." -- [Exp 83066](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83066)
 
[14 mg, oral] "I have never been so overwhelmed by a drug. I attribute the intensity of the experience to the bodily sensations as much as the hallucinations. I am almost constantly hit with intense rushes of trippiness. At one point the hallucinations were pretty scary and I found myself thinking I was going to fall into a 'bad trip'." -- [Exp 83066](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83066)
 
[16 mg, oral] "Visuals were exceptionally intense, things would appear in mid-air, and not only that, but even my hallucinations would warp. There was a space of.. I would estimate.. an hour or so, where I left my body. My conciousness and spirit went away for a while, I was able to see into, and even explore different dimensions, each with their own laws of physics, and order. I think I almost had a heart attack about 5 times. [...] As far as the near heart attacks, it is not clear whether it was an actual severe problem, or if it was simply because I could feel each individual chamber doing its work. [...] There was certainly a marked increase in heart rate, whether this was related to the effects of the drug, or anxiety from seeing existence unravel in front of me, I do not know." -- [Exp 49785](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=49785)
 
[16 mg, oral] "I am getting a feeling through my body, very pleasant. Like rushes of energy. It is almost like an orgasm through the whole body." -- [Exp 44553](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=44553)
