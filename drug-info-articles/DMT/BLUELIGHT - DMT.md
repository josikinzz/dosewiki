Mantis root bark is a great source.  That's right, I said the root BARK, not just the root.  It isn't that bad of an extraction, either.  If your interested in some good extraction methods and flowcharts drop me an email.

Peace,

mantis root is Desmanthus species... alkaloid concentration ~ 0.3% ...

nice if you can grow it or get a good price on it from herb vebdor...

some mimosa species & acacia species may be better souces, but may be difficult to grow in most of USA... (M hostilis root bark can have up to 1% dmt; pound of mhrb can go from less that$US 150 to over $300...)

if you are interested in extraction info, visit dmtworld or ayahuasca.com to start...

(can be done with vinegar, lye, distilled water, naphtha...)

oh, and preparing any extract containing dmt (tea, goo, or crystals) is illegal in most countries; & we don't wanna break any laws, now, right?)

This is the drug that I am most interested in trying having tried quite a few psychedelics.  I am currently experiementing with Phenethylamines, but some day, I want to experience DMT for sure.  The problem is, I would never be able to get DMT anywhere on the street.  I want to order a plant source and possibly do an extraction.  My question is, what is the best plant source with the highest alkaloid content?  Also, I don't want a mixture of 5-MeO-DMT and DMT.  I just want DMT.  I can order 5-MeO-DMT online, and I plan to do that sometime as well.

Mimosa hostilis is the best plant to use.  Few, if any, alkaloids other than DMT are present, and little plant waxes in the bark which must be cleaned up to get crystals.  And yes, go to erowid as your questions and 'how to's' will all be answered there.

Becareful and start low as DMT is like no other psychedelic you will be blown away for what seems like an enternity of complete ego death and visual hallucinations so extreme that no words could ever describe them, i wish i starting out low instead of jumping right in but i learned my lesson. My first experience was what seemed like a million years of being in my own personal hell filled with demonic creatures that tore me from limb to limb although i was completely catatonic and i was destroyed, my whole life was ended on that day and i feel i have experienced true death however this same thing has happened to me on several different experiences with DMT and i can say never even approach 80mg unless you are ready to accept comlete death and rebirth of the universe.

I will second MGS's comments, Mimosa hostilis is probably your best bet.  If your search the internet you should find a good number of procedures for extraction - I seem to remember one floating around the internet very recently which was in the vein of "DMT for dummies".

I haven't personally tried actual DMT, only its 5-meo cousin. These aren't toys, thats all i can tell you. Trying to descibe it would be like describing sex to a virgin.

Dexter666, that is exactly what I want.  I feel like I have too much control with psychedelics anymore.  I need something to put me back in my place.  I read something about an experience on DMT of being reborn through flesh, blood, and spirit.  The only hallucinogen I have done that could remotely stand up to DMT is Salvia extract.  However, those experiences were of a dreamlike, fantasy nature.  I want something straightforward to launch me into a beautiful nothingness.

The most beautiful thing about DMT is coming down and reliezing what you've lived through and that in itself is a +4 experience, i've never once liked being oblivious to reality as there's something about life that i wish not to let go of but we must all go sometime and this is what DMT is most useful for as you are forced to accept death and although you come back on DMT it still prepares you for what lies ahead and makes you a little less scared of things to come as you feel almost god like after such visions and enternal death.

I personally don't reccommend using Phalaris... unless you have a lawn bag full of the stuff and a vessel large enough to put it all in. Having tried extracting the essence of the grass myself, I can tell you the yeild is low and very weak. And de-fatting the shit is a pain in the ass...

If one developed a strain of Phalaris grass that was high in DMT and had little or no 5-MeO-DMT and 5-Ho-DMT, it would serve as a great plant for pharmahausca.  But to the best of my knowledge, all strains of active Phalaris species are quite high in 5-Ho-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT in addition to their DMT content and are therefore not suitable for being an ayahuasca analogue.

Its just a warning to prepare yourself for the experience as it can be so real and so powerful one might question there own mind and its ability to handle such things and if such questions arise DO NOT partake in this chemical until you feel you are ready to die and thats no joke!

**DMT: "bad trips" or just overly intense experiences?**


I have had quite some experiences with psychedelic drugs but almost al this is more than 2 to 3 years ago. I had 2 pretty severe bad trips and had to endure flashbacks after that. I still have those occasionaly and thats why I got pretty frightend of all psychedelics. I the near future I may have the possibility to do DMT. I've searched the web for DMT experiences but I can't seem to find reports of real bad trips. if anything resembles it, it are experiences that where merely to intense for the user and not close to the extreme fear experienced with a bad trip. I believe that because DMT is short-acting and extremely intense (and euphoric) psychedelic the chances of going bad are minimal. the intensity of this drugs will put you so far from reality that you're totally disconnected from you ego and your fears. i've never done DMT and their for I would like to know if you agree with the above. the theorem above is based on my experiences with salvia extracts.

DMT is far from euphoric except for when you come done and you relieze how much you miss reality and as for its ability to produce panic and fear, DMT feels as though it takes you fear receptors and juices them up to unbelievable levels its as though DMT is a fear inducing chemical but under its influence the fear is as different as reality is and except for the first few seconds of your million year journey you will most likely be still and silent except for maybe some mumbling and twiching but this i remind you is all in high doses although i'd prefer to not beable to think my own thoughts under DMT as they go bad quick. If you are worrying about it you are not ready and even then you'll never realy be ready as i thought i was and i thought i knew what it was going to feel like, wrong i was blown so far away i thought i was never coming back and the first few seconds was abosolute terror and panic but after ego loss i just experienced it and when i finally came done after what seemed like millions of years i kissed the floor and promised never to tough a psychedelic again but i quickly got over it and did it again but i knew what to expect although it was no different and each time i don't touch another psychedelic for atleast 3 months sometimes longer.

The way to do DMT, in my opinion, is to load up 40-50 mgs in a good, clean, glass pipe, empty your lungs, then slowly smoke it in until the world disintegrates, then try and hold it in as long as possible. You should be in DMT-space before you exhale.


I have never had a bad DMT trip, but DMT seems to have a greater potential to be unnerving, for me anyway, at sub-flash levels, particularly at the level falling just short of "break through". I have never experienced anything negative or unnerving when I have smoked enough to "break through", though there have been times when I did not take in quite enough for a full dissolution that I became a bit confused (still loved it though). 


There is always a degree of shock associated with the warp, but DMT is so much smoother compared to 5MEO that I find DMT take-off relatively tame by comparison- and the place you end up at is so much more interesting![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).


I used 5MEO and DPT many times before I experienced DMT for the first time, and found DMT to be so superior to the other two that I lost interest in them; given a choice between DMT, 5MEO and DPT, I cannot imagine ever not choosing DMT.

Not much to add to all above, just that DMT is not a recreational thing by any means...It is always scary and wonderful, and very intense...maybe something someone would call scary, somebody else could find enlightening...I guess it varies from person to person, some love it, some hate it. 


I like DMT but don't plan to do it in the near future....

**DMT and the Near Death Experience**


I am aware of many people comparing the DMT experience to the near death experience.  How valid is this connection, both subjectively and in terms of chemistry?  Any personal insights would be much appreciated.

i've read this several times but have a hard time imagining what it's like.

i would understand the notion of being out of time but not of such a lenght.

do you realize that it seems so "long"?

do you "feel yourself waiting"?

doesn't the fact that there are visuals help see the time pass?

are you self conscious enough to suffer from this lenght of time?

or is it only when you come down that it seems that you're coming out of a long period?

This hypothesis stems from the book *DMT: The Spirit Molecule* by Rick Strassman.  I loaned the book to a friend, so I can't check it, but I'm pretty sure it's just hypothesis.  He's not claiming similarity, he's claiming cause.  DMT can be produced endogenously, and he guesses that the high stress levels associated with NDE's cause DMT to be released which produces the actual NDE.

Yes i've been inside my own personal hell for millions of years on several different occasions and although it is different being comletely warped out of reality i've still waited and waited being different things leading different lives and all so complex i wonder how my brain thinks and imagianes such things but to answer your question the time passes differently but yes when i came down i thought it had been millions of years and i remember each day so vividly i guess you could say my memory is long and complex from such an experience but it was all the same shit over and over again but i remember being in that space for atleast a million years if not more.

dexter666 umm hi.

umm that sounds like bullshit.

consitering uve spent 1 million yrs in dmt world than uve lived there more than u have on earth...

maybe u are an alian from dmt & smoked some earth. & maybe after 80 or so yrs u'll come down & wake back up in dmt world & only 10 mins have passed.

I think u may be overexadurating.. just a tad.

Okay.  First of all, when on DMT it is very difficult to gauge time, for many many reasons.  The sense of 'this will wear off soon' is not there at all.  It's not like you can clock watch on a real DMT trip.  So if the idea of a long trip scares you, steer clear of DMT, because even though the actual trip is only a couple of hours, it SEEMS much much longer than the longest acid trip.


That being said, I do not find DMT as unnerving as LSD, except at the very beginning of the trip.  Now bear in mind I have only done DMT four times, and one was a dud.


First good one, I thought I had poisoned myself and died.  I was simultaneously on a couch and on the floor and in an alternate space difficult to pin down.  


Point is, I was absolutely terrified, but the sheer size of the trip actually dwarfed my terror and I acquiesced from the standpoint of there being no alternative.


DMT will push you around and strip you down to size right now.  Not like LSD, where you can argue with yourself about certain aspects of tripping and drug use, etc...all the self trials that generally lead to a bad trip.  DMT is FAST.  You take in the smoke (tough to hold because it is dense and putrid), and just a few seconds later you are elsewhere, and I mean elsewhere.


Can you remember taking a drug?  Yes.  But you might not think of it as that when you are under the influence.  You will most likely think of it as something else entirely.


It sounds like your primary condern is bad tripping.  All I can say is that for me, a bad acid trip is WAY worse than than my most frightening times on DMT, and I cannot really give you a reason for that.


I can tell you that after around 200 LSD trips I am terrified of that drug, but after only 4 DMT experiences I am astonished and truly impressed.


I would say that where LSD might cause fear, DMT results in pure and simple AWE.  The size might intimidate you at first, but the comedown from DMT is truly a rebirthing woth experiencing.


I recommend trying it if you get the chance, just be sure to have an experienced sitter there.


As far as wigging out and doing something stupid--like LSD freakout stuff--I don't really see that as a big possibility.  You will be astonished into stillness rather than pure horror.


After you acclimate to the intensity, you will certainly enjoy yourself, I would think.

If you say you want to be launched into beautiful nothingness, I would recommend 5-meo-dmt, which for me has worked wonders in getting down to the most important thoughts in my head. I like the way it locks down my thinking, only leaving me with the voice of my subconscious talking to me. I have very little control over the experience, but it does not matter. I am going to try smoked dmt once, but I want to do ayahuasca first, I want to see how the MAOI`s influence the trip.

I'm busy with this book and fragbait is absolutely right how catecholamine (adreline and noradreline) are the stress hormones that are concerned in near death experiences. But it is a hypothesis like fragbait said. because Rick Strassman is saying that we know little about death itself, but if the pineal gland were producing DMT, however, that would certainly warrant its strategic location. A DMT release directly onto the visual, auditory, and emotional centers the pineal nearly touches would profoundly affect our inner experience. Would we see, hear, feel, and think things in a way unimaginable to consider for melatonin. 


Because of its extraordinarily short life span of just a few minutes, DMT would also benefit from small distance, only millimetres wide, between the pineal and important brain structures. it could diffuse directly onto these brain sites by way of the cerebrospinal fluid, without first having to enter the blood circulation. If DMT first entered the blood, MAO enzymes would destroy it long before it returned to the brain to exert its profound mental effect.


These considerations also effectively dispense with one of the major objections to the DMT theory of psychosis: the lack of differences between DMT blood levels in normal volunteers and in patients with psychosis. We now see that DMT concentrations in forearm vein blood may have little to do with its effects at discrete brain sites, sites at which DMT is broken down nearly as quickly as it produced. 


This reasoning further develops the idea that decomposing pineal tissue affects residual awareness after death. If this postmortem DMT emptied directly into the pineal fluid, simple diffusion is all it would take for it to attach to those sensory and emotional centers. A pumping heart would not be necessary. 


He hypothesize that pineal DMT opens our sense of profound psychedelic experiences. 


So fragbait is right about the hypothesis. But he isn't right that Rick Strassman isn't claiming similarity, because in his book are some reports from volunteers that are describing DMT as a birth and death experience, so I think that he isn't claiming cause. But for the people how are interested in this you can read his book 'DMT the spirit molecule'. I think it's really interesting and we can learn a lot from it.

and don't you suffer from the lenght?

because i understand that someone will try again a difficult, but interesting experience again if he knows it's not going to last. but i've read several reports (mainly about 5-meo-dmt) talking about being in "hell" during an eternity. how doesn't this make you want to never try again?

"Eternity" or "a million years" is an exaggeration of the experience.  Most people here have no idea what it is like to experience a million years in real time, much less 50 or 60.  My experiences with DMT time have shown me how 10 minutes can FEEL like it takes forever (and by forever I mean a few hours), but it still only takes 10 minutes.

Perhaps 'the eternal afterlife' is a result of extreme time dialation due to a site specific DMT release in ones final moments.

Eternal life in your final moments!

I tried smoking DMT this weekend.

I had about 80mg, I had read in numerous places that this dose was sufficient to breakthrough, but unfortunately, I didn't reach that level.

After the second inhalation, I experienced an intense buzzy feeling in my body that built up, and as it built, the world turned into the most amazing sight I have ever seen, it was still the forest, but the trees were cartoon-like and bright purple and seemed is if they were all part of the same organism, everything was just so strange looking, if I could only paint what I saw...

My friends faces were so strange too, but even though everything was so amazingly strange looking, and even though they were the most amazing visuals I have ever seen by a longshot, they were still just a (very) different version of what as actually there, no journey to hyperspace..

Still, it was extremely awe inspiring, utterly amazing.

But I want to break through.

Any tips on making sure my next experience is a breakthrough?

I'm thinking perhaps I'll just up the dosage to 100mg.

^^^


It is a real pain in the ass to breakthrough on standard DMT.  I have only done this a few times, and it came as a result of the of the following:


1) Purify and re-crystallize your product, as it takes about 50-70 mg of PURE dmt to warrent a good breakthrough.  If it is less than pure, you are only going to need more.  You wont get it pure, but as long as you eliminate the color and it comes out as crystals and not goo or paste (if you use acid base extractions, usually the best you will get it will be light yellow crystals that form a light paste once scraped together).  Remember, no goo or paste, you need clean crystals (otherwise you are looking at smoking 100+ mg of material).


2) smoking technique.  I learned to smoke dmt from practicing with 5meoDMT for a year, it took me a while even with that to breakthrough.  Get a good oil pipe with a large bubble (since you are smoking a lot) and heat the bottom with a *low flame bic*.  Smoking dmt outdoors will almost certainly guaruntee against a break through, although it is still lots of fun.  Remember to slowly twirl the pipe back and forth to evenly distribute the heat.  Once you see the the vapor, exhale all the air you have and SLOWLY inhale the smoke whilst keeping the flame underneath the bubble and slowly twirling the pipe.  Having a partner makes this a lot easier, as they can see where the liquid inside the pipe is and can adjust the flame accordingly.  If you inhale anything harder than what it takes for the smoke to pull into your lungs, you are only cooling the chamber and making it more difficult to vaporize everything.  Plus you are inhaling more regular air, wasting valuable lung space.  Hopefully you can kill the bubble in one hit (if you're good), as this is the best way to get a breakthrough.  However, if you cannot (as most people can't), try holding it in for only a little before blowing it out.  The flame still needs to be on the bubble, otherwise you are gonna have to wait for the chamber to heat up again and by that time it will probably be too late.  You need to finish the bubble by the second hit, and the whole smoking process can't take more than about a minute.  Once you have a fat lungful of it all, hold it in as long as possible.  If you did everything right, you should dissolve into dmt hyperspace in no time.


Oh and I forgot, close your eyes.  That is where all the crazy shit is, if you keep them open you are only going to send signals from the real world to your occipital lobe and as a result you are gonna keep yourself stuck here in reality.

I'm not familiar with your prior drug use, but if you haven't already I would highly reccomend you try breaking through on 5meoDMT first (kinda late now, but better sooner than later).  Not only is it readily available, but it is always fairly pure and it has a much higher potency per weight.  This makes it much more ideal to experiment with, and better prepares you for DMT (which you and I both know is a pain in the ass to procure, thus making any waste that much more wasteful).  I'm not talking about preparing for the actual experience by any means, but simply the technique needed to ensure a proper dose.

As others have pointed out, 80 mg should have been MORE than suffucient for a full breakthrough.  I know there are hard heads, but I still think 80 mg should have done more.  What you got sounds like what I got from 20 mg.


As others have pointed out, either the purity of this DMT is not good or your smoking techniques are not good.  You mentioned you took several hits.  DMT needs to be taken one hit (very hard to do, but it must be done), which you need to hold in as long as you can...hold it in until there is nothing left of the world as you know it.


30 to 60 mg should be sufficient for a full breakthrough with most folks.


I wish I had access to pure pharmie quality DMT fumurate or some other salt of it for injection.  I hate smoking it.  I'd rather inject the stuff, avoid the terrible smoke, and know exactly how much got in me.

You know, it isn't terribly difficult to convert a freebase back to a salt.  If you recrystallize it well, there shouldn't be any problem converting it into a salt and injecting it.  I've been toying with the idea for a while now, only I'm a lazy fuck and I don't know anybody that knows how to IV something (lord knows I dont).


As for converting it to a salt, I *think* the method you use is the opposite of basification.  Dissolved the material in your clean, nonpolar solvent and add water/hcl acid solution with a ph of 1 (or 2, I suppose).  I'm guessing this would work, but I've never tried it...so ask a real chemist before trying it.

You would then need to raise the solution's PH back up to at least 6.  I'd be scared to do this myself and then put it in my veins.  But maybe one day the gods will bless me with some well made DMT salt.

see the thing is, you gotta vaporize and inhale as much of the DMT as quickly as possible, or else smoking even 200mg won't give you a breakthrough if you're taking little p*ssy hits. 


DMT is metabolized by MAO very, very quickly.

SteveElektro,were you using acacia maidenii extract??That seems to be the most common plant used in Aus for extraction(actually it's the only thing i've seen used)Anyway my point was,if you are using A.maidenii extract you have to take into account the fact that your DMT is about 30% Methyltryptamine,80 mg is still more than enough for me to breakthrough,but like MGS said it has to be done in one toke.I hope it works for you next time,it'sone of the few psychedelics that hasn't dissapointed me.....words don't do DMT justice.

I wouldn't mind getting an injectable salt, but I certainly don't trust my skills to convert it to something safe enough to administer this way. 

If 30-60 is enough for a breakthrough, and what I had is around 20mg as MGS suggested, it shouldn't be too hard to brush up on my smoking technique to achieve a breakthrough. I've had it suggested to me by someone that has broke through before to use a lightbulb, that way I can get the bulb full of smoke before I inhale.

I'll make sure I up the dose a little too, to account for impurities.

I red a lot about DMT. I'm familiar with DPT (my thread: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?threadid=109203&goto=newpost](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?threadid=109203&goto=newpost)), 5meoDMT, psylocibin/psylocin, salvia (I had a couple 'out of body' experiences) and other tryptamines/drugs (I don't like the word 'drugs', but now everyone knows what I mean). I mentioned this type of drugs, because I think these compounds are the most related to DMT. In chemical structure and effects. 


I never tried DMT, but one day I will. I'm preparing myself to that day (I know you can't really preparing yourself for this mystical experience, but I'll do my best). I'm looking forward to it. And when I'm older, more growing up, I will choose a beautiful day to explore DMT. The reason why I want to do DMT in this way, is because of the respect I have. The respect for DMT. 


I hope one of you can help me findig the best route of using DMT. I red 'DMT the spirit molecule', written by Rick Strassman. They are using the IV route in their sessions. I think this is the best way to do it, but there is a chance I can't find someone who wants to inject (IV or IM) DMT. So does someone knows the best route (except IV and IM) to use DMT? Why does acidfiend (on the second page) heat the bottom of his pipe with DMT and not from the top of the pipe with a flame that directly touches the DMT?


I hope someone can help me with the best route of using DMT.

Thanks

^^ I'd IV it if I could get hold of lab grade stuff, but home made extractions aren't going into my veins in a hurry, smoking will have to do.

I suggest you  use the same route unless you have access to lab grade material, if you value your health.

> . I think this is the best way to do it, but there is a chance I can't find someone who wants to inject (IV or IM) DMT. So does someone know the best route (except IV and IM) to use DMT? Why does acidfiend (on the second page) heat the bottom of his pipe with DMT and not from the top of the pipe with a flame that directly touches the DMT?

yes, smoke it. acidfiend did that because dmt is easily destroyed by heat, a flame right on top of a pile of dmt is going to waste more than you want to. holding it beneath the pipe will gradually let the dmt heat up instead of burning most of the substance right away. you will try to get the most out of your dmt badge. smoking out of a dmt pipe is the best way to smoke dmt, using a lightbulb is also a good method. this will waste the least, using a regular pipe is a plain waste.

Thanks.

the way you said this makes me thinks that it's a lot easier to smoke DMT in a vaporizer. Am I right?

No.  The easiest way to smoke DMT is out of an oil pipe.  Otherwise known as crack pipes, tweek dicks, etc.  Lightbulbs are ghetto oil pipes, but they serve the same basic function.  It is a a simple pipe with a strait tube attached to a little glass bubble with a hole in it.  There is no carb.


Vaporizers are meant specifically for thc consumption.  Additionally, much of the vaporized dmt (if it even gets hot enough to vaporize it) will get stuck in the long plastic tube you smoke out of, losing a lot of the product.

^^ A crack pipe and a 'tweek dick' (I assume you're referring to a meth pipe) are two different things, a crack pipe allows direct contact with a flame, a meth pipe doesn't. Which is more desirable?

 is it true for 5-meo-dmt too?

cause i didn't breakthrough with 8mg and i have little left (1 try). so should i try again the same amount, paying attention not to put the flame too close? or should i risk an experience too strong with say 10mg?

yeah, it also applies to 5-meo-dmt. put a little weed on top of it, that will do. or try to use another way to smoke it. what counts for dmt also counts for 5-meo-dmt, so the pipes acidfiend and stevelektro mentioned will get better results. ofcourse a dmt pipe is best (hence the name), but not many have this lying around. personally i don't have much trouble with breaking through on 8 mg and using a regular pipe, works absolutely fine (for me). i hope you will get better results next time, if it still isn't enough, then smoke what's left over (quickly)..![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

DMT and 5-meo-DMT needs a low temprature to subluminate (from solid to gas). That is why you will probably get better result if you use the pipes stevelektro and acidfriend metioned. But also like blowmonkey said, I don't have any trouble with breaking through when I use a normal pipe filled with 5-meo-DMT. I never tried DMT, so I don't know how it works with this compound. But I'm almost sure that it will be the same.

after reading on erowid reports advising this method, i smoked it (5-meo-dmt) like heroin, shaping the tinfoil like a funnel to be sure not to waste some smoke.

i got results, but no breakthrough

it happens that i have a tolerance to almost every drug i have tried.

has anyone here broken through with this method (and the normal amount of 5-meo)? or is it a waste?

I think it would be a lot easier if you'll do it with a dmt-pipe or crack pipe. But that's my opinion. I don't know what your experiences are with smoking dmt/5meodmt with a dmt pipe, crack pipe, lightbulbs, tinfoil. So I won't write any conclusions obout this subject in this post. But I do know that the best way to smoke DMT is the 'non-touching' route. And if you learned useing the tinfoil, that's fine if it works ok for you.

I totally agree with blowmonkey on this one. There is no possibility to relate cannabis to DMT. They're both obviously not comparable. 


And you can better ask yourself where you can't find DMT then were you will find it. DMT exists everywhere: in your brain,in animals and in a LOT of plants (it exists almost in every plant, also in mushrooms)

or you can buy the book: ''plants of the gods'' from Richard Evans Schultes, Albert Hofmann and Christian Ratsch. They have written a lot about ayahuasca and the book contains an 'ayahuasca ingredients' 'chapter' and an ayahuasca analogs: 'plants that contain DMT'. 


Another good book is 'Ayahuasca'. I don't know the name of writer.

Mimosa Hostilis root bark extraction, I've heard it's got comparatively high yields and is easy to preform.

Once done whats a good dose to start with? Maybe 40-50mg? And is it hard to let go and let the DMT trip take over? The first few times with 5-meo-dmt time seemed to slow down to such a point that my normal breathes seemed way to far apart. Is this something I'll have to worry about with DMT or is the experience disassociative in that respect?

I guess I shouldn't be comparing the two for from what I've heard they can be very very different.

Also, I was wondering if a normal pipe fitted with a fine screen would be suitable for smoking DMT. I've only had experience with 5-meo-dmt in the past and for that a lightbulb rig was quite suitable. Any help or info you can give would be appreciated.

Well I tried dmt again, through a home made lightbulb device.  We used it by burning the stuff until the bulb was full of thick dmt vapour, inhaling, then while holding it in we were cooking it again so that when we breathed out the dmt there was another full thicklly filled bulb ready, the process is very quick if you do it right, after the first burn the DMT is already hot so it fills up again very quickly.  You don't need to slowly inhale or anything, you get the whole hit in one quick go, but its real gross and harsh on the lungs like this, it can be a struggle not to cough, but it's certainly not impossible, I didn't cough.


I didn't breakthrough again but this time it was by choice, I knew that if I inhaled the bulb again i would break through. 

I looked down at my hand, about to smoke another full chamber which had been readied within seconds of the last inhalation, I realised I was hesitating and that it was now or never (well not for this ride), it was charging up and that last bulb would have completed the process.  The world was as if it was electrically charged, and it was building to a climax. I knew this, though I don't know how or why. I just did. I didn't inhale though. 


Geometrical lines were on absolutely everything around me they were cracks, like the world was cracked in a very special way.

Hyperfast dots ran along these fractuated slits, and as it built up they started whispering to me, crawling all over me because I was just as cracked as everthing else, yet they talked too fast and high pitched for me to understand, at least it seemed that way.  


My hand started to break apart,  fractured pieces of the world were beginning to  do the same, it seemed to last so long but it slowed there.  The things running across me were on the other side, trying to talk to me, excited that I was about to let the wall of  my fractured space-time completely shatter and meet them in their world.  I didn't see the other side though, and I'm glad I didn't because I think the fact that I hesitated was a good enough reason to have done it in itself. (If that makes any sense)


I think I had to completely disintegrate along with the universe to visit the dmt-space, If I still had a body, even a fractured one that had started to come apart, I would not be able to exist in the other realm. I didn't actually think this, I *knew* it. It makes perfect sense to me given the experience.


I did however remain in this state for some time, it felt like hours, looking at a partially decomposing universe, completely awestruck. I knew I hadn't broken through because I somehow knew in my heart that I had to shatter completely apart yet it had slowed, but that didn't matter at the time because what I was experiencing was so dumbfoundedly amazing anyway.  It was much more intense than my first failed attempt at a breakthrough, which was also incredibly amazing.  


But that was beautiful amazing, this time it was too strange to be beautiful in any normal sense, it was just so damned weird, much more intense, and I understood something about it inside of me.

It's really in a different league to the traditional psychedelics, even on this sub-breakthrough dose it was more profound than can be imagined by one who hasn't been there.  


What strikes me as strange was the fact that I had some sort of contact with entities, they were buzzing around the cracks and trying to talk to me. I've never heard of entity contact on what I know in my heart to be a sub breakthrough dose, albeit about as far as you can possibly go without completely breaking through.  Yet they were there, waiting for me, exited over me, and all over me.


I don't know why I had hesitated, I think it was a combination of the fact that what had so quickly started going on was so intense, and the fact that I was functioning on little sleep, and probably a healthy dose of fear.


I know that this method is a definite for breaking through as long as you have a good technique.

I know I could have broken through, even if I hadn't known this, I could have done it all even faster.

It comes on very quickly though. 

If you have trouble, you could even make a couple of bulbs and fill them all at once so you can do as much as you want to, insanely quickly.  I'd reccommend this if you aren't experienced with using them.


I'm still amazed over that experience, it hasn't left my mind all day.  I will use the substance again, likely sometime soon providing nothing stressful pops up in my life before I have the chance to gather my thoughts.  That was an ordeal. An amazing ordeal.

I am completely confident in being able to break through next time, which I think contributed to the anxiety or whatever it was that made me hesitate. 

The idea of going further than what I have already seen is too full on for me to put into words, as what I have already experienced defies my imagination.

But I want to know what lies behind those damned cracks when all the pieces fall away, and I plan to find out. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

If during the second or third extraction phase from mimosa hostilis root bark the middle layer(which usually appears a dark red) is changed in color slightly to a deep brick red after heating could this mean a loss in DMT if a temp too high was reached during the heating? And if so would this cause any problems with purity of the remaining DMT at the end of the process?

I did a fast before my first DMT experience. Definetly recommended. Any food in the stomach really adds a heaviness and unpleasentness to the experience. Plus after a DMT experience you really work up an apetite. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Good luck and stay safe peeps. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i finally tried it last week.

over a few days, 13 persons tried it and i think everyone either burpped hard or had vomit spasms.

so, to really diet i don't know, but not to eat for 2-3 hours before is probably better

I really wonder if dopamine has a lot to do with how DMT works besides serotonin..


I noticed that taking GHB almost completely blocks the effects (if dose high enough) of DMT, besides some minor things (probably serotonin agonist related) like trails or colors.  GHB usually doesn't block the effects quite like this with most other psychedelics..


Also the fluid movement/consciousness and extreme ease in coordinated movements (dancing, multitasking, catching objects thrown at you, very calm feeling) would seem to 'support' extra dopamine floating around somewhere.  GHB blocks DA release (not sure exactly where) until it is worn off/wearing off.


I think DMT, psilocin/cybin, and 5-MeO-DMT all have this dopamine thing in common.  After smoking some 5meo, I can also dance like crazy.  On mushrooms I have a fluidness and things even look similar on the surface as a lowish dose of DMT (i've taken it mostly orally w/maoi).  I always wondered why these natural psychedelics always felt to me "better" than any of the synthetics (no matter what it is, or how close to mushrooms, like 4-ho-det/4-ho-mipt).  The fluidness just isn't there with any of the shulgin tryptamines.  Also I have only heard "voices" on mushrooms or DMT, almost want to say like a skitzophrenic type thing.. hearing a voice, clearly, especially out of white noise.


The 'fluid' thing on either of the three -DMT's is similar to MDMA also (including the very coordinated movements, dancing ability, etc.).  Just thinking here.. (i just love to know, WHY this and that! hehe)

Edit - found some stuff about this DA release:

(from [http://www.humboldt.edu/~morgan/psil_s04.htm](http://www.humboldt.edu/~morgan/psil_s04.htm)

And from [http://www.biopsychiatry.com/psilocybin.htm:](https://www.biopsychiatry.com/psilocybin.htm:)


> Psilocybin is a potent indoleamine hallucinogen and a mixed 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Psilocybin administration (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) produced changes in mood, disturbances in thinking, illusions, elementary and complex visual hallucinations and impaired ego-functioning. Psilocybin significantly decreased [11C]raclopride receptor binding potential (BP) bilaterally in the caudate nucleus (19%) and putamen (20%) consistent with an increase in endogenous dopamine. Changes in [11C]raclopride BP in the ventral striatum correlated with depersonalization associated with euphoria. Together with previous reports of 5-HT receptor involvement in striatal dopamine release, it is concluded that stimulation of both 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors may be important for the modulation of striatal dopamine release in acute psychoses.

Then DMT from [http://www.biopsychiatry.com/dmt.htm](https://www.biopsychiatry.com/dmt.htm)


> To assess the role of the 5-HT1A site in mediating DMT's effects, a pindolol pre-treatment study was performed. Pindolol significantly increased psychological responses to DMT, suggesting a buffering effect of 5-HT1A agonism on 5-HT2-mediated psychedelic effects.

Then this site just has a shiiitload of studies on all sorts of stuff, mostly on 5-meo-dmt but also some involving DMT:

Yeah i'm being a nerd here, i get the biggest hard on reading about this stuff, hehe.

Someone was doing  research into Harmine HCL coupled with DMT HCL pharmahuasca and just for the hell of it tried smoking the DMT HCL and it was just as active as the freebase.

You'll find the HCl salt undergoes some pyrolysis when being vapourized as it requires much more heat to vapourize compared with freebase. If it was the same, why would anybody bother with the freebasing in the first place?

i've heard several reports of people smoking dmt hcl and i heard it actually works great.  i'll have to ask those people some more details.  i myself think the freebase would still work better.  dmt hcl + naoh and wash it out.  zophen you wasted 500mg of it?  what type of maoi did you use?  was it extracted or close to pure dmt hcl?  dosages?  thanks!

hmmmmmmmm, so if its best to get it all in one hit, do you think a grav bong set up with a special chamber to vaporize the dmt would be best then? i could easily see how you would get probably the bigest hit of any other thing with this method, unles the watter would cool it down too much. would it?

Does anyone here find the effects of DMT to be incredibly fun and enjoyable, as well as cleansing? Personally a high dose of smoked DMT is the most dreamy, realaxing and pleasurable drug experience I could imagine, and I find i feel safe doing it in any context, such as at a party, by myself, immediately before trancedancing, etc. I felt threatened the first few times I smoked, but after a mental orgasm breakthrough of such crisp clarity, DMT is my greatest comrade and ally. I enter the space weekly, usually several times, and have indeed used it daily in large quantities with ever more enjorment and peace.


Probably one day it should turn on me, and indeed, Ive tried to 'darken' my trips with black metal and thoughts of sadness, but all I achieve is a lens-like ability to see beautiful and affirming visions, not struck with even a vein of negativity- truly cleansed doors of perception, maybe even unhinged or kicked down the cosmic corridor.... I can't see anything but the truth with DMT and the truth is safe and calming if you don't run.....


I hear and read in this thread people saying it is not recreational, but I totally disagree- smoking this chemical is one of my favorite activities, one of the cleanest and safest. I understand the intensity and alarmeddness of the initial experience, but once thats conquered, you may grow to feel truly comfortable navigating that space....


Who else feels somewhat like this?

^I'm not sure how you can find a high dose of DMT relaxing unless youve done it some hundred odd times. Its more like a comsic smack in the face. What do you call a high dose 50mg, 80mg, 100mg?


Before I had a mg scale I remember I just piled doses into my pipe in wishes of breaking through. What dissapointed me though is I never met aliens, or journeyed to foreign lands, even though from judging how much I used on my highest dose, since I have a mg scale now, must have been greater than 150mg. My trips just seem to consist of complete loss of self if I dose high enough and the splintering of my vision in thousands of little prisms and geometric shapes of different colors with different things going on in each one. But never any coherent beings or different places.


I thoroughly like it though. Too bad Im running out.

Ismene: I assume you've tried oral DMT with harmala alkaloids and the reversable (competitive MAOI), moclobemide? If that's a yes is there much difference in the subjective feel, it's just that I know harmine on it's own is a mild but weird experience , but can't imagine a clinical MAOI like meclobemide has similar effects as harmine if taken on it's own.


Zophen has def convinced me to try it orally, it;s just I wan't to have the DMT/MAOI combo that causes least gastric distress (I'm a martyr to my guts!)

As to doses, I have no idea- every dose is of extract on passionflower or similar herb, and i just stuff it in. I guess subjectively I mean smoking to the 'blackout' or unconcious/amnesiac point- that experience is my most positive rebirth and mental rewiring point. I would estimate over 200mg or more, but that couldf be over judging. Either way the peak visions are not really the most important, for me, as is the brain-stop mechanism of DMT.

> It is what it is- subjectivity is the essence of DMT. Alien trips are such an ingrained meme, expecting it and not receiving it is disappointing. I've had these sort of trips, though nothing as cognizant as a Terence Mckenna smoke- which i think he partially invented and induced in himself. As well as entity experiences etc. I've had some totally weird almopst salvia like experiences of being other objects, people, other lives.... Its just not that frightening or dangerous- I would equate DMT flash to rollercoaster riding. Adrenal, intense, uncommon- but relatively safe and impermanent. I guess the difference lies in the after effects of DMT which I think is elicited more strongly  from high doses. Small amounts can also settle akathasia after worn off.... For me at least.

The DMT afterglow is relaxing, for sure!  I haven't smoked it too many times, but after an initial intense rush, for me DMT becomes very laid back and euphoric.  4-AcO-DMT is also very relaxing and euphoric for me.  Curiously, 4-HO-DMT is about as far from relaxing as it can get (until the peak has passed, anyway).

Me too. Moclobemide has zero nausea but I do find when I throw the DMT down my neck it can cause some fairly heavy vomiting. BUT...there is a way around it. Eat a peice of buttered toast and drink 500ml of coca-cola at the same time as you eat the DMT and it magically gets rid of the nausea. Not sure whether it's because freebase DMT is so alkaline it irritates your stomach lining unless you dilute it with a little food and cola. 


BUT..eating and drinking does seem to dilute the effects slightly. So, try both ways and see which you prefer. Although I normally hate vomiting it's not so bad when you're on DMT for some reason.

I've mentioned this to zophen and I think the fact that you opt for a couple of hundred mg of DMT might have a bit of an influence! I only want about 60mg as DMT does frighten me a little (that's why I needed convincing rather than just saying 'yes' automatically).

by reading you poor babies too afraid to upset your stomach, you make me laugh. the purge of dmt is what it is about. if you're afraid of it don't do it. if you want a pleasant feeling smoke some weed, but not oral dmt!

I understand one doesn't want to feel nauseous, but come on!

**putting freebase in cocacola which has a ph of 2.? or 3.? should convert the base into hcl...

**


But putting it into your stomach that contains hydrochloric acid should convert it to hcl anyway. 


**the purge of dmt is what it is about**


I'm not so sure. I think the purge is sometimes valuable, but most of the time it just gets in the way of a good trip.

I don't profess to know, since I've not yet taken ayahuasca, but consider that the traditional view that the purge is necessary could simply have come about because the tribal people who developed that idea were only able to consume the whole plants, as they didn't know about the compounds locked within.  Since that's the only way they were ever able to experience DMT, it would make sense that their view of the experience would have grown to include the purge.


I mean, it makes sense.  You feel nauseous, and then you puke, and you feel much better!  Who's to say that if you never felt bad in the first place, you'd have a less profound or healing trip?

Although im all for having a comfortable trip IME the trips that left the most long lasting impression upon me have been the ones that werent so comfortable.


Thus i have decided to take ayahuasca in its traditional form and in its traditional setting.

I feel that i will learn more from the experience if i did it the right way as opposed to just dropping it at home and having another purely hedonistic experience.


I highly suggest some of you look into one of those south amercan excursions where you take huasca with a shaman.

This was recomended to me by (of all people) my drug abuse councelor (he is an old time head. Took acid with psychiatrists way back when and has met shulgin a number of times).


just my 0.02

Why would you want to take ayahuasca with a bunch of strangers who are only in it for the money? I can't think of anything worse. If they were caring people who were doing it out of the kindness of their hearts then maybe I'd be interested but not these fuckers charging a fortune for poorly prepared ayahuasca. They must be laughing all the way to the bank.

the nausea is connected to dmt not ayahuasca (the wine)....though I have never taken dmt in it's pure form and can't attest that personally. Probably I never will, maybe once with caapi.

It's not masochist, it is a relief when it comes, it's a clensing thing... getting the bad toxins out of you. 

Before a session you can also take some other purgative plants, that make you sweat and so on...but that is more for people wanting to desintoxicate from them drug abuse, as to lessen the craving.

maybe but dmt is also a factor. I don't see the link between dpt and dmt. I'm no chemist but I guess they don't operate on exactly the same receptors...

the brew I took without dmt was almost nausealess, but those containing dmt, there was far more nausea

Ayahuasca is used as a purgative by traditional folks- its a dewormer, so they had good reason to do this. I'd suggest the physically medicinal side of ayahuasca brew has been mistakenly linked to its other use.....


I would like to have a true shamanic experience, but I don't know what that means, and I can't see why I have to go to the amazon to do it. If i did it, my scepticism would likely lead me to difficulty. I don't like how western psychedlic users revere old religions (well, how old are they?) and shamanism as this absolut pinnacle of thought.... Most shamans would freely admit they have no idea how they are doing they are doing, they may suggest they are communicating with ancestrors because these plants are ancient, but thats just an educated guess on their behalf.


What is a shaman? In everything I've read, I still can't define it. If its ritual, I'd call it stagnant, because rituals are unchanging due to doubt and mistrust of further, different examination. I don't think the context for DMT should be old and ingrained, though that could help to ground one. DMT is very spontaneous which is why I don't tend to use it with other people who almost tie me down through social etiquette and demands.

The theory I've heard is that MAOI's increase the amount of serotonin floating around your gut which stimulates the vagus nerve and makes you vomit. 


BUT..moclobemide by itself doesn't make you vomit. Moclobemide with DMT and food/coca-cola doesn't make you vomit, just moclobemide and DMT with nothing else in your stomach makes me vomit so I'm not sure what's going on. And it doesn't make everyone vomit either. 


Incidentally, you arn't putting the DMT into the cola before you take it - that does no good whatsoever - you'd still vomit your guts up. You're taking the DMT and THEN drinking 500ml of cola on top of it once it's in your stomach.

True. For me going to see a shaman would be like going to see a Bishop to find out about God. The whole point of psychedelics is that it's YOUR direct experience with the entheogen. No bishops required ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

they know the ways of the plants. They can see in what state you are, they can make the trip go in a opposite direction just by singing an icaros, they can see your problems. It's not just a show. The center Takiwasi uses shamans in conjunctions with traditional occidental medicines to cure addicted patients. If you ever do a session with a shaman you will see that they know exactly what they are doing, and it is to help and cure you.

ayahuasca is not a fun experience, but neither are heavy doses of other psychedelics...until which point it can heal will depend on you, but from my experience it is amazing

I get where you're coming from.  Shaman's are guys who are experienced with the plants and can offer bits of advice, but it still isn't something that appeals to me. The shamans experience of ayahusca is HIS experience of ayahuasca, I want my own experence. And I'm not entirely sure how much I value the opinion of shamans to be honest. When you read what they say they often start dredging bits of bullshit they've heard catholic missionaries say about "Jesus" and "Mother Mary". To me that's just contaminating the whole experience with superstitious garbage.


As for the "healing" your problems side of it - I think a lot of that is just taking advantage of primitive people. Like in Africa when the Witchdoctor puts on a skull mask and says someone is going to die and the next day they die because they're so clueless they believe what he tells them. The shaman will give you ayahuasca and say "You've got bad guts but they'll be better in a week" and they will be simply because of the placebo effect.


I think ayahausca and heavy doses of psychedelics are fun, and I think the fun is probably the vital component of any "healing" for me. As Shulgin once said "Euphoria is good for you".

^^^To call people primitive is somewhat wrong, i would think a society of terrorism, George Bush and nuclear warheads is more primitive then withdoctery. In this case, the psychsomatic power of the brain, and the respect and reverence tribespeople may have for their shaman, probably contributes more to the healing then the drugs- but the fact that these guys can exploit the 'placebo' effect so masterfully as to wreak tangible change, is rather amazing. 


In a sense, shamen certainly wouldn't be the safest people to tripwith, they take (usually) very large doses and utilise datura's/etc in their rituals for further derangement of the senses- their aim, it would seem, is complete dislocation to cleanse perception- not many sheltered and socialised western psyches seem to be able to handle that sort of stuff very well. The shamen simply know which plants wreak what effect, not how or why. Thats what i want to know.

Good point. Lets just say that the healing that the shaman does with fellow indians might not work on westerners with a different view of medicine.

The acid that cleans copper coins & rots yor teeth is phosphoric acid; it's listed in the ingredients on the side of the can. Also proton pump inhibitors are used to treat peptic ulcers and oesophogeal reflux (heartburn from hell) - I suffered for years from the latter (could have cured it by twatting my boss at work, but not really an option if I wanted to keep my job), to the point that my gullet (oesophegeus) might be scarred with the stomach acid. If I vomit it can only make the scarring worse & possibly induce an ulcer there (which is incredibly difficult to treat, they generally just surgically resection the gullet instead).


That's why I don't want to puke, going into a ayahuasca/pharmahuasce experience with heartburn from hell, it doesn't seem like it would be too pleasant to say the least.

I'm of the opinion that the shaman works well for the people for that culture, but because westerners are from a different culture they lack so many points of reference that what the shaman has to say has little impact on them. A bit like people from that society taking a psychedelic of western origin (like LSD) with a psychologist leading the group - they're going to lose out on so many cultural references etc

My experience on purging is that it acts as a physical metaphor that expels bad thoughts. Usually when I take ayahuasca, it starts to hit in 30 mins. The come up is quick the speed of the come up, negative thoughts, and nausea all combine. At about the 50 to 60 minute mark, I puked and feel wonderful, mentally very powerful,and free of any negativity. On lower doses I don't puke. I consider myself sensitive to puking. I take a syrian rue extract and dmt citrate.

This may not be absolute.  My girlfriend has tried pharmahuasca now three times, and has been unable to elicit an experience. She doses with syrian rue, which lends a small amount of nausea but nothing too serious, waits an hour, doses with the DMT, and within ten minutes of the DMT hitting her gut the puking starts. Redosing with more DMT later brings on a new wave of nausea and puking.  So, perhaps DMT also causes nausea, perhaps it is the combo, but my instincts tell me there are no absolute rules. Everyone reacts differently to such things.


It is interesting that the discussion moved from predominantly smoked DMT to oral DMT. I'm happy about it, because I think the oral DMT route is too often overlooked. Smoking is amazing in it's own right, but I 'liked' the oral route (I've done it once) because I found it to be far more engaging mentally. By engaging, I mean it was therapeutic, thought provoking, deep, introspective. Smoking has yielded some therapeutic effects for me no doubt, but nothing even close to the oral route.  Oral DMT was the single most intense therapeutic trip I have ever had, far deeper than anything else, rivaled only by a 10g mushroom ++++ experience I once had. In fact, those two are the only ++++ I've had period.


My dose was 3 g ground rue seeds, swallowed raw, followed 45 minutes later by 50 mg DMT crystals. It rocked my world, tore my brain apart, scattered it all over the floor to look at and analyze, then put it all back together. Bloody intense, bloody difficult, and highly rewarding. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to understand the nature of DMT more fully. It is the sort of experience I would only take on once a year at most, and I wouldn't dream of doing it by myself.  After it was over I thought I'd never waste my time smoking DMT again, which has turned out not to be the case. I do enjoy smoking now because it is a lower-level committment to revisit that space again, but it just demonstrates the level to which it effected me at the time.  


I'd love to hear from someone else that has tried this combo. I can only find a handful of similar experiences online.


By the way,


Dose to peak about 2 hours.

Peak lasted about 1-1.5 hours.

Come down was rapid, about 15 minutes to a half hour.

What I meant is that it's the beta carboline alkaloids that initiate the nausea, the DMT may increase it but it's increased harmala nausea. If it was dur to the DMT there should be frequent vomiting from smoking/injecting DMT on it's own, but there isn't. Considering caapi/harmala alkaloids on their own produce nausea it seems the logical  conclusion to come to

What I think would definatley get rid of all nausea is taking the DMT rectally - but freebase DMT is very alkaline and burns mucous membranes so whether you'd be screaming in pain 30 seconds after throwing it up there I'm not sure...

I'll try making a soln of DMT in tartaric acid (form DMT tartrate) and get it to pH7 before using rectally. If I predose with a small amount of MAOI rectally an hour beforehand it might be enough to knock out all of the loval gut MAO. That way I can swallow a bottle of gavescon brefore the rectal DMT so that if I do puke it'll not scar my oesophegus any further (mind you I'd rather not puke full stop!)

As I said, it's harmala alkaloid nausea, but the DMT amplifies it. Use a non harmala MAOI & there wont be any (or less) nausea to potentiate

**DMT HCl (IM administration)**


Needed to test the batch (synthesized DMT HCl):


T+0  IM inject ~25mg DMT HCl (mild burning at injection site in upper thigh)

T+2  First alerts

T+4  The build is slower than I expected but continuous.  My face is tingling. 

T+8  Mild visual…augmentation

T+13 “If this is going to amount to anything, I’d better finish it”.  I IM inject the remaining ~25mg.

T+27  I’d call it a high +1.  I see why Shulgin recommends 60 to 100mgs IM.  I've certainly heard of lower doses doing a lot, but not for me and Shulgin I guess. At this level it just feels like a tryptamine. There are no DMT signatures. 

T+35  Take a hit of nuggets.  Just a mildly trippy high now.  I’m hungry. 

T+45  The pot is masking whatever’s left of the DMT—I think.  I’m up and down in 1 hr with ayahuasca (I use at least 16g of Mimosa Hostilis (fine "Mimohuasca"));it wouldn’t surprise me if the DMT were gone already. 


I used 12mg of 4-AcO-DMT just two days ago so there could be some cross-tolerance. Hell, tolerance could have started developing in the 13 minutes between injections, I don’t know. I also snorted a small, unknown amount about 0.5hrs prior to see if DMT HCl burns.  It does, but not terribly.  I’m not sure if sub-threshold doses have tolerance affects or not.   Next time I will not hesitate to do 90mg, and all at once (I’m pretty comfortable with DMT from ayahuasca use).  Conversion to freebase or IV are also possibilities.

I got reasonable effects from 35-40mg IM, but then I'm somewhat sensitive to tryptamines

Thanks for the report Psoodonym.  Did it go into solution easily?  Keep us updated.  I really hate smoking this stuff, so the idea of IM or IV admin with the HCl salt is very intriguing.

I had to heat it to go into solution.  You'll want to crush it up as much as possible before dousing it, and filter it.   My batch is also a bit gooey in saline before dissolution, which is closer to the description of it I've heard before.  This stuff almost has the texture of wax.  Weird.  Maybe something was done differently to it to keep it from becoming the yellow goo DMT HCl has been described as before?

I wish someone could test these new batches of DMT hcl that have been synth'd. I'm a little nervous as there have been a couple of recent failed attempts at this certain synthesis right before the chemical was going to hit the internet.


Everyone should filter if they are going to IM.

150mg of harmaline HCl and 50 mg of DMT freebase(a sort of pharamahuasca) put into a gel cap seems to be very effective. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

me neither.


i was just curious about the purity of synthetic dmt compared to peoples own extracted DMT (from mimosa)


as u mentioned....

does the trip differ if something is made in a lab rather than from a plant.


my brother thinks it does...thats why he eats only shrooms and doesnt like "rc's"


i tend to think...a chemical is a chemical.

I used to think that, but smoke some DMT and look at the world behind the wolrd, these things arnt what we make them out to be, things have energy in which is unmessurable by any sceince.


I personaly ahve stoped all my obscure psychedelic chemicals using (fuck the term RC, ITS FUCKING COLA, AND DAMN DELISIOS!!!!LIKE COKE WITHOUT THE SYRUP!)


that is untill someone can get me hooked up with 2c-b again, all these damn people talking about 2c-b has had my tooth aching for months now!!! I honestly have more sorces for LSD then I know how to hook other up with, and DMT has always been something there, but it hasnt been till my ?psychedelic? maturity of now (I dont realy ask why, I just "ket it be") that Iv found GREAT use in, as hell, an anytime drug just to get an idea of a situation, take a DMT a blast befor you buy an apart, see what it has to tell you and if its true to what the realitor has said lol I dont know, Im fucked.


edit, so yeah, having LSD and DMT out the ying yang realy doesnt have me "searching" for that mr. right, Im aso sure that alot of those things Iv done havent been very good to the psyche, the 4aco DMT was NOICE but that shit lasted what? 2 1/2 weeks in my hands.


edit, also, from the mouth of my man who lays his own crystal

well i will have a DMT or DPT trip this week and the next.

maybe both.


as for 2cb it isnt that great, personally. i pefer 2ce. 

 you can find 2cb if you looked hard enough.


the thing i like about mushrooms(and other plants)

is that each plant has a unique spirit and different one...so each mushroom has something different to teach you.

the universe is also different at different times...tap into it at the right time and ASK and ye shall recieve...right?


i am excited either way for this weekend...maybe i will wrie a trip report...but i dont like explaining things as it seems words can be misleading and tangible.


but i might share my DPT/DMT trip this week....we will see

I was just thinking about that.  It's very interesting to me how it seems that at different times, especially on a large scale, the psychedelic state seems to be different, to contain a different energy/message/feeling/etc for all of us.  This seems especially true with DMT.


I often wonder what it would have been like to trip in the late 60s.  Of course some people here know.  But I'm a bit too young for that personally.

i like to believe that some psychedelics allow us to open up and learn about ourselves (phensthylamines)

while other psychedelics allow us to not only tap into our own mind but also the universe (Gaian Mind). The universe is always changing, the only constant in the universe is change.

So we must periodically tap in, tune in and listen to what the universe has to tell us.

Considering we came from the universe, are a part of it, and are ONE withn everything, its makes sense to listen to it and stay balanced.


I will open my third eye this weekend and see what the universe has to offer.

sometimes you get a glimpse of the harmony and sometimes the chaos.

Research has shown that it has some useful activities which support the traditional uses. The bark is rich in tannins, saponins, alkaloids, lipids, phytosterols, glucosides, xylose, rhamnose, arabinose, lupeol, methoxychalcones, and kukulkanins. In vitro studies on bacterial cultures have shown it is three times more effective as a bacteriocide than streptomycin, although in vivo studies have not been as positive.

Are there any other alkaloids in this popular source, mimosa hostilis, or any other commonly used plants? I understand that impurities of acid-base extracts are often the yellow/green tannins, but would other alkaloids be present to commonly play a role in the smoked effects?


Here's erowid, though the question does not exist anymore:


> One substantial difference between these two plants is that MHRB has been reported by Ott and others (Ott 2000; Ott et al. 1999) to be orally active without the addition of a MAO inhibitor. Indeed, vinho da jurema, an entheogenic beverage traditionally used in Brazil, is prepared from MHRB without the inclusion of an additional known MAOI-containing constituent2. Ott has conjectured (Ott 2000; Ott et al. 1999) that MHRB may contain an unknown non-ß-carboline MAOI or some other as yet undetermined psychoactive substance(s).

It is somewhat strange that the researchers analyzed M. tenuiflora stem bark, since their paper acknowledges that jurema is traditionally prepared from the plant's root bark, and different plant parts frequently have differing chemistry. For example, Mimosa tenuiflora stem bark, which is used medicinally in Mexico to treat burns and skin ailments, has been reported to contain merely 0.03% DMT (Meckes-Lozoya et al. 1990), which makes it a pretty weak source for this tryptamine.

One early "report" of the pink synthed DMT HCl in different forum indicates it is "the best DMT you will ever smoke".  They report needing to smoke only 30mg, as opposed to 50mg of the freebase extract, and that the smoke is much smoother.  It may be a week or so before I can confirm this.

What can I expect from a prepared bottle of Ayahuasca Pisco?

I've experienced DPT many many times and 5-meo-dmt several times.

For some reason I've had this bottle of Ayahuasca in my fridge for

almost a year... I am thinking it is almost time for it.

how did it compare to extract?


15mg is a very small dose for extract. if you got any activity at all it means the stuff must be quite potent.

Yeah I was just testing it. I've never smoked extract so I can't compare.  The poster from another forum I quoted earlier indicates it's about 40% more potent by weight and not as harsh though.   Naturally he reported the experience as the same.  It might be that having less pain in the lungs going into it could make for a better experience overall though.

Not all extracts are born equal though.  I bet some are >90% pure while others are < 60% pure.  With this stuff though, I bet you've got >99% purity minimum.

You're right.  The poster said it was the same for him though.  Of course then--as was brought up earlier--there's all the other possibly active chemicals that end up in extracts besides DMT as well.

this stands to reason also supports the evidence that people are having a difficult time getting into solution.

There was no bruising at the injection site when I IM'd it, not that that means anything.  I mixed the solution in a dark green vial and I think a lot of the DMT ended up clinging to the sides as an oily residue, so the dose was probably a lot smaller than I intended also.  If possible, sesame seed oil would probably be a better vehicle for IM injection, but I've never heard of it being used with DMT freebase.  I'd definitely like to know more about the safety of DMT freebase injection too.

I tried injection as well before we made the conclusions here ... thought I dissolved 15 mg, but actually there were little blobs of oil that got stuck to the sides, so I actually had practically nothing to inject.  The fluid I injected was perfectly clear.  


Psoodonym, I don't think you injected much at all if you tried to dissolve the freebase.  First of all it really won't dissolve.  Then running it through a micron filter probably soaks up most of the oil.  I tried IV 15 mg, but it felt like maybe 2-3 mg max (basically nothing).  


Tried smoking again.  I might have been a little ahead of myself when saying that this is less harsh.  It's just as harsh as any DMT freebase, but it works.  Oh, does it work.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**Dmt**


So the pink DMT from china is actually freebase? Frankly, I'm excited, I'd much rather have freebase it still works orally, allthough I won't be doing any IM now. I was gonna have to convert that bitch, and I really don't have time/space/privacy to be doing that.

DMT is the greatest hing ever.


end of story, some buddies of mine and me all took some rips tonight, great hing, we all experienced "IT" at the same time and it was very very very very bonding. I love it, but I also saw my first person completely wig out... but it only lasted 15min and then she was OK.

I tried vaporizing it again last night.  DMT is a convenient length if you have a busy schedule, but I don't think it's all that useful as a psychedelic.  It's nice to catch a glimpse of the "other world" and come back quickly, but it makes it impossible to do much exploring of the headspace.  


For me, vaporized DMT is going to be saved as an adjunct to other psychedelics or to be taken with an MAOI.

I got to the point where I was hovering over a void, looking down into oblivion, and nearly 100% separated from my sense of body.  I even saw the "elves".  But I still don't find this useful.  


It's fun as hell (aside from the acrid smoke), but it's too short.  It's like being strapped for a rocket.  You have about 1-2 minutes of free-floating in space at the peak of the trajectory, then it's over.  It's the same reason I don't find insufflating or rectal admin of 2C-x or tryptamines useful.  There's no plateau.

A lot of people find DMT ineffective or useless in terms of it's ability to take the user into deeper psychological realms.  I wonder sometimes if it is not more of an issue with the manner in which it is used, rather than a limitation of the material or the method (smoked).


I find most people are very set on extreme experiences, having to reach a 'breakthrough' dose to make things worthwhile.  I've discovered a treasure trove of effects from low dose DMT smoking.  Small repeated hits can lend much in the way of deep introspection.  By small repeated hits, I mean taking yourself to a point of good solid effects, while still being able to keep your eyes open and integrate the world around you. The most useful point for me is where keeping my eyes open is just a little difficult. 


I use DMT in this manner to reach a sort of meditative, reflective state, and it is tremendously beneficial to me.  Not nearly as beneficial as taking it orally, but much less of a committment than that required for oral dosing.  It can be a sort of "Ayahuasca lite" as it were.  Perfect for Saturday afternoon hiking trips.


I have a friend who had smoked DMT several times at various dose levels in indoor settings.  We went to a beautiful natural area this past weekend, sat looking over the water, and we traded small drags off the DMT pipe, sitting together gazing over the landscape. It was so thoroughly breathtaking to take in beauty of this magnitude. When my friend came back down, we just sat in silence, because there was nothing to say that could be captured by words.  He was close to tears having just seen the most beautiful visions of his life. He told me afterwards that the 34 years he has lived on this earth seemed only for the purpose of leading up to that very moment.  He said that one experience thoroughly laid to waste any of his previous DMT experiences.


To anyone not finding deeper meaning in smoked DMT, I humbly recommend taking it to nature, cutting back the dose, and taking time to really meditate on the substace and it's effects over various settings and mental sets.  I truly believe there is more to DMT smoking than sucking in a lungfull of vapour. Just like any psychedelic, the real rewards come from patient, reflective experimentation.


However, this is not to say high dose DMT journeys don't have their benefits.  These too, I enjoy in their own right. I only want to offer some alternatives .... peace.

I've tried DMT by itself on at least 3 occasions and during a trip another 3 or 4 times (each occasion had multiple peaks).  Aside from the time mentioned here, all the other experiences were with extracts.  I did not notice any differences.  I think I just have an extreme aversion to inhaling hot vapor ... it just feels unhealthy.  


I am really looking forward to one day trying ayahuasca, but vaporizing DMT by itself is just not my idea of a great psychedelic experience.  It's too fast and too uncontrollable.  I agree that many small vaporized hits spaced out could provide a light experience, but still, if you're going for a longer trip why not just take something orally.  It is fun, and I'm sure I'll introduce some people to vaporized DMT and try it again myself, but it's not a priority by any means.

I'm sure you're right.  I tasted the solution before injection to make sure there was something in there--as the solution in the syringe was clear, as you said--and it did taste bitter.  It had some activity also, it was just very weak.

whatever is discoloring the solution could be what you are tasting (along with a bit of the ole N,N).

From my few experiences with DMT, it's all too fast to get a lot from it. DPT on the other hand is similar but allows for much more as it's not gone by the 30 minute mark

I think the only way to really get the "message" is to take in conjuntion with an MAOI. Five or ten minutes is just to short a visit.

On a nearly perfect Friday morning small smoked samples of the "pink stuff" yielded the familar, but almost forgotten hyperspace headspace.  This manifests itself for me starting from a undulating square weave CEV pattern that soon engulfs my entire visual field.  This journey, the part that that was moving the most turned into what I perceived as the long hair billowing from a female entity as she moved.   Breathtaking.  


DMT hyperspace reminds me of what I thought "heaven" would be like when I was a young child getting indoctrinated with American Judeo-Christian beliefs.


Side note/question:  Of course I've heard of MAOIs and oral DMT.  But not too many reports on MAOI and smoked route.  I would venture to guess that duration of effects would lengthen considerably.  I'm hoping that it does not increase the "height" of the effects too much other than perhaps reduce the amount of the precious spice needed to get there.  DMT is powerful enough just by itself, I'd hate to turn the volume up even more, although having perhaps an hour to explore instead of a few minutes w/o the MAOI might be worth it.

The "pink stuff" has almost the same look and especially the mothball (naphthalene) smell and taste (smoke).  MHRB is reported to contain some other alkaloids besides n,n but none of cousin 5-meo as in some other plants.  Thus MHRB is the definitive plant to extract from because of this as well as a good ratio and not much, if any defatting required.


Bottom line, in a double blind survey, 9 out of 10 Bluelighters were unable to tell when we substitute their normal extracted DMT with the pink stuff. (joking.... the results vs amount required for both where very similar.)

How would one go about doing "pharmahuasca" with the pink stuff?


I would need to convert it to a water soluble salt to be absorbed in the stomach, right?  What's the easiest way to do this?  I would only want to convert enough for one big dose.


I'm thinking of taking like 50mg DMT HCl with an MAOI orally.  Is 50mg enough for an oral experience?  What would be the best dosage?


What would be the best/most accessible MAOI to use?  Syrian Rue?

Would adding a drop/few drops of HCl (to convert to hcl) or lemon juice (is there a hydrocitrate?) and then heating slowly on a stove to dissolve the excess liquid once it's reacted work to convert a small amount?

At the start of this , I didnt know a single thing about DMT , now after reading almost every page I feel I have a good idea of what it is, and it's effects and whatnot. The only thing I seemed to have missed , is this pink stuff you guys are talking about? Can someone explain , oh and is it so that people often say that it seems to last for ages when it really only lasts a half an hour at most, if smoked. Whats the real durration?

I searched, didn't turn up anything that I don't already know about cleaning a marijuana pipe (as for why it was in PD, I don't know, lol).. 


Anyway, so I'm wondering what would the best way to clean out an oil pipe to get rid of DMT/5-Meo-DMT residue?  Would the isopropyl alcohol and salt work just as with a cannabis pipe?  Or is there another method?  They are cheap enough I could just go buy a couple, but I would prefer not to.


I don't know if I scorched it a little, or if it's some impurities, but there's a little black stuff inside that I would prefer not to keep smoking each time.  I would also like to minimize the chance of smoking a little DMT when trying 5-Meo-DMT or vice versa.


Any tips?

Smoked the stuff only last 5-15 minutes, but that could seem like an eternity. Oral HCL or a brew of MHRB + syrian rue last about 3 hours the effect could be light to exteremly heavy depending on the dose. I don't reccomend more than 3.5 g of syrian rue. Also if you care to redose that night on the AYA make sure to take a little more rue ahead of time.

after a few disappointing and mild smoked DMT trips i have decided to try an oral dose.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

I am considering 2.5-3 grams of crushed syrain rue. along with 50mg of DMT.

or i might try 2.5 grams of rue with 25 mg of DMT + 25 mg of DPT.

Or try a DPT IM and then smoke some DMT.


mainly i am interested in pharmahusca as i loved all my ayahusca trips


how long do i wait to consume the DMT after consuming the syrain rue. 15 minutes? or should i wait 30-45 minutes.


also would smoking DMT while on a MAOI be significantly more potent?


basically want some more feedback, especially from people who have tried oral DMT.


I have done mimosa hostilis/syrain rue combo many times.

as well as mushroom/syrain rue combo many times.

So i am familar with oral dmt and syrain rue itself.

I have never tried pharmahusca though and was thinking 5mg would be a good dose.

I usually consume 8-13grams of mimosa with 3 grams of rue for my ayahusca.

also 4-7 grams of dry shroom with 2-3 grams of rue in a combo .


that is about my level of tolerance...just any info would be nice!

Illusion25:


My one oral experience was 3 g crushed rue and 50 mg DMT 45 minutes after. It thoroughly kicked my ass. I was very glad I didn't do more. That said, it was a very important trip and I learned a lot, and it was life changing. I wouldn't want to repeat an experience like it any more than once a year and even then, I'd be really nervous going back in. But ... that's just me. I highly recommend it, despite the challenge.


My girlfriend took 3 g of rue, then an oral DMT dose which did nothing to her, although she puked a lot and might have lost a lot of the dose. Frustrated, she took out the pipe and smoked some, maybe 30-40 mg.  She was only semi-concsious for 50 minutes and she endured what she described as unadulterated hell. More of an intense moody semi-blackout, with few of the usual DMT visuals. It scared her off smoking DMT for quite a while. So, I am assuming the MAOI had a significant effect.


From my experience, 8-13 grams of mimosa should yield roughly 40-70 mg, but of course that is highly variable, just a really rough shot. So, it seems to me you are spot on track. 3 g rue and 50 mg would be a great starting dose IMHO, and I'd give it 45 minutes.


I would do that first before I started mixing in DPT personally. I always find it more helpful to learn one substance alone first, then mix later.

By the way, I'm adding this in for harm reduction reasons. a previous poster (JRARMZ13) suggested 200-300 mg DMT with an MAOI for an oral dose. I'd advise strongly against that. In fact, I think that suggestion is a bit irresponsible with all due respect to the poster.  I'm going to assume he has done it and is just a hard head, and has made the incorrect assumption that most others would react the same way.  Many people have had overwhelming trips at much less than 100 mg.

For some reason I haven't been able to break through on DMT. I've used some fairly large amounts, but haven't gotten there yet. I've come close, where I got to the point where speech was impaired and I felt like I was in a jungle while listening to DMT, but I haven't broken through. My last attempt (I've been vaping with a big fat lightbulb) I took one large hit, and a smaller one and my lungs just gave out, I couldn't get any more in. Any advice on smoking technique? 


Additionally, a few of the times (not the last one) I've been on DPT at the same time, do you think this would help or hurt the cause?

thanks for the helpfulinformation drug geek.

I planed on trying the DMT/rue combo first before throwing in DPT into the mix.

I usually try chemicals alone first as well to get well aquainted with them.,

andymac08- i know you as ezmc, right? hehe


anyone else try pharmahusca? and if so what was your dose?

after a couple attempts smoking it i think i will enjoy oral much better.

I would prefer a strong IM dose , but unfortunately i have freebase, not HCL.

was this with extracted DMT or the synthetic "pink stuff" thats going around?


how much did you smoke at a time?


how did you smoke it? did you hold it in?


are you on any medications?


if you are getting dissappointing and mild trips from DMT, something is wrong.

it is the pink stuff.

I loaded 30 mg in a glass dick and took 3 hits and held it in for 30 secs then exhaled.

no meds.

I was only disappointed because it lasted 1-3 minutes and was not very powerful.


I find it too hard to inhale even 30mg of the harsh smoke at once.

I just dont know how i would be able to breakthru smoking 70-100mg, when 30mg is too much smoke.

thats why i am going to try an oral dose. 50 mg of an oral dose seems like it will go a lot further than smoking would. better bang for the buck i guess. plus the length is ALOT longer

thats weird. From what I've been reading about the pink stuff 30mg sounded like a strong dose. can you describe what the effects were like beyond not that powerful?


personally I've only had extract and with that, 30mg is a weak dose. it only starts to get fun above 50mg.


did it burn or vaporize properly? at least with extract, its easy to burn it using a glass dick.


one suggestion is to try a larger dose, say 50mg. and instead of using a glass dick, use a regular weed pipe and put the DMT between two thin layers of parsely (or inert herb of your choice). at first keep the flame away to melt the stuff without burning it and gradually bring it in closer to vaporize. its ok if the top layer cherries, but dont torch it. this way is usually much less harsh.

ya i have smoked alot of meth out of glass pipes. 

i also have smoked alot of 5 meo dmt out of glass pipes.

so basically i know how to hit the pipe very well, that wasnt the problem.


effects- well initially slightly blurry vision, then a tryptamine buzz. but DMT gave me a very calm soothing high. I also felt clean.

Closed my eyes and saw a orange energy pattern.

then everything went away. total high=2 mins


I actually could not tell the difference between this and DPT. very very similar.


DMT seemed to make my vision clearer. And also i felt like wind was blowing thru my brain /skull. like air was moving throughout my body.

The only other time i felt this feeling was whn i tried ayahusca.


i think i might need a larger dose, but i just dont see how i could fill my lungs with anymore. the smoke is really harsh, and makes me cough. 


i will have to get more practice i guess


update- just smoked 50mg in 3 consecutive hits. smoke easier to inhale, i guess i am getting used to.

the room turns greenish and i feel slighty high + or a mellow ++.


I guess i should wait a while for my tolernace to go down. I hear that DMT tolernce rapidly goes away but i seem to have one afer somking it 3 times in 2 days.

i will wait a  week or two, 

IM 40-70mg of DPT is about 10 times more powerful than smoking 50mg of DMT.........for me

Its almost surely DMT. If not it is a VERY similar homologue which I cannot tell apart. 30mg of it left my world exploded into fractals and diamonds which formed the central image of One Holy Woman.

Pure DMT is colourless. Extracted DMT ranges from colourless to white to yellow to orange to brown. 


So what is the "pink stuff"? If it was "synthetic" you'd expect it to be pure which would be colourless.

Peace and hopefully someone will run a test on this batch of pink.

Huh ... I've never found DMT vapour to be overly harsh. It makes me wonder what others might be smoking.  The pipe does make a difference though. I used to use a glass dick, but have since graduated to a Hennesy bottle (airline mini) with a hole punched through the bottom, and a wad of steel wool in the neck. Load DMT onto steel wool, and pull a flame gently into the opening.  It is so smooth that I can't even feel it. I have to watch the pipe to discern how much I am getting.


By the way Samadhi_smiles, you are sure correct, that just because it is white it does not mean that it is pure, but pure DMT is colourless, so having a white or clear crystal surely is preferable to brown, yellow or pink. It might not mean it is pure, but it at least lacks whatever causes those other colours, and I have always found experiencially, the whiter/clearer the smoother going down.


Peace ...

I have worked with compounds that were verified to have a purity of >98% (2C-T-2, DPT, bk-MDMA, and ethocin) which were all off color (tan for T2, M1, pink for DPT, and grey for ethocin.)  Even an impurity of less than 1% can color the compound.

I have seen perfectly white MDMA powder that was only about 80% pure (lab-tested). So while even a small impurity may colour a batch, it is also possible that a major impurity will not give off any colour. Bottom line: you just can't tell from what it looks like.

Are you sure you're taking the counter-ion into account? Because I too have about 80% pure MDMA however the maximum classically measured purity is about 83-85% because it is in salt form. You could calculate the relative purity by disregarding the salt mass and come up with something that has a maximum of 100% but I doubt that's what labs would tell you.


In addition, various syntheses use various reagents... some are very strong in color emission even though it's a trace amount. And some are very hard to separate from your product because of chemical similarity of properties, especially without throwing out precious product.

MDMA syntheses are done in bulk processes, so dirty product can be put back a step in the process - it's often just a tiny bit off-white and can be even when the purity is in the 80% area.


Having added this, it's absolutely true that you can't tell anything from appearance for sure! :D

I'd be really suspicious if I got my hands on MDMA or amphetamine that's definitely colored though, that stuff should be pretty clean. (not that i use amphetamine by the way)

Ok, so yo answer my own question.  I'm sure isopropyl alcohol and salt would work.  However, neither was at my disposal, only fingernail polish remover (acetone).  I poured a little in, swooshed it around, and the bulk of the residue came right off.  A little scrubbing with a q-tip removed almost everything.  But there was some really stubborn stuff that wouldn't come off.  


My only concern is that the acetone might have soaked into the remaining residue, but you can't smell acetone, or really even mothballs coming from the pipe anymore.  So I take it that's a good sign, and that it's ready for use again.

Counter-ion? Shit! That sounds too techno for me.


Roundbouts where I come from our MDMA was naturallll, straight from the sassafrass plant, its tan with flecks and was the most potent I'd ever seen (130mg would get you in a puddle quickly).

**Snorting DMT**


I found this website, and it gives an interesting account of snorting DMT:


[http://peyote.com/jonstef/dmt.htm](https://peyote.com/jonstef/dmt.htm)


It takes an MAOI and lasts about 2-3 hours. Anyone have experience with this route of administration?

I snorted about 8mg the other night and it worked without a MAOI. I did it right before smoking 10-15mg and it lengthened the trip quite a bit (right before I smoked, I checked my eyes and they were surely dilated wide open already from the DMT).

A friend of mine tried this with a pretty hefty dose, definitely over 40mg, but no MAOI, and suffered a lot of pain and only a very light experience

I have snorted DMT before without any MAOI. It most definetly worked, actually, it worked too well. I snorted roughly 150mg of *extracted DMT freebase*. It was **painfull**. Ive always equated the pain of that experience to what I imagine it would feel like to snort crushed hot coals.


The trip started less than a minute after I railed the DMT. First, the world took on a cell shaded cartoon look. Then I became very uncomfortable, I knew I was gonna puke. I had turned the lights out, so I had to navigate down the hall and into the bathroom in the dark, but I dont think having the lights on would have helped me at this point anyways. There were so many fractals and interweving patterns in front of my eyes. I couldnt see past them.


Somehow, I managed to make it to the bathroom. I puked violently into the toilet. Puked again and again and again. Harder and harder. Dry heaved again and again and again. Not only was my nose and throat burning, but my chest and stomach hurt from puking. I thought I was going to die from the pain, or atleast go into shock. I am amazed I didnt atleast pass out.


The visuals were amazing, but I was only able to concentrate on them whenever I wasnt puking. I spent the rest of the trip with my head on the toilet seat, starring into infinity. The visuals were insane, but I was fairly clear headed. This was my first breakthrough experience with DMT, I had tried smoking it a few times without any luck.


The pain from snorting lasted several hours longer than the experience, which I estimated at around 20 to 30 minutes in length. I do not know if something that shouldn't have, like lye for example, made it through the extraction process. I had recyrstallized the DMT in fresh naptha in the freezer 3 times before trying this experience.


Ive heard that converting the DMT from freebase, not to DMT HCL something else... mabye citrate?, can make the experience much less painfull. Hopefully somebody else has some experience. I would love to repeat this again, but I won't if I can't make it less painfull.

I too insufflated 100mg of DMT freebase and it was as painful as it was beautiful. Would I do it again? Yes (if spice ever sounds appealing again).


With no MAOi the experience took roughly 5 minutes to come on and lasted about 1 hour (after effects and sinus burn lasting much longer). It also affected my dreams for several days and dispelled any depression that may have existed prior, leaving the mood elevated for several weeks.


It burns.

Yeah, it burns like a motherfucker! I've done up to 100mg at a time and I find the burn to last around 10-20mins although my perception of time is always way off so who the hell knows.  Still though the high lasts for about an hour and is fucking awesome.  Worth a try in my opinion.

DMT freebase is very strongly alkaline and will give you alkali burns. Find some way of neutralising it before snorting it.

suggestions to neutralize it?


I would guess if one wants an extended DMT trip, oral would be the way to go.

It's gonna be tricky to neutralise it for snorting. You can neutralise it to an extent if you hold it in an acidic solution in your mouth but DMT HCL salt is a sticky, treacle like substance so if you bunged DMT freebase into some strong acid you'd just end up with treacle...![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

i was wondering about extracting dmt from Acacia mearnsii or more commonly known as black wattle, because its quite common in the area ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


unfortunatly ive been unabe to figure out how much dmt is in it and which parts of the tree is most concentrated ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


considering there are 1600ish Acacia plants would this extracion method be the the best for blackwattle?

**DMT Stink Breath!**


I'm wondering if anyone has had this problem.  I smoke DMT perhaps once every two of three weeks or so, and not a lot, maybe 30-40 mg each event.


I have this resident DMT taste that comes into my mouth every once in a while, mostly in my throat, more of an aroma.  It is subtle, but awful, and it worries me, because it indicates DMT is still in my system, which from a health perspective is not an exciting prospect.


Anyone else have this problem or have any comments?![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Well, if there is a single sense that can be said to be the most evocative of past memories it is the olfactory sense (smell).  With this kind of robust psychological connection in place, it would not surprise me if in some people smells could be fed back from memories too, especially intense memories like those from DMT experiences.  If that isn't the case, perhaps some of the vaporized oil was absorbed into your mucus membranes and was only later exposed to olfactory receptors.  You may be able to test this latter suggestion by exhaling DMT vapor through your nose--thereby inundating the mucus membranes with the oil--and observing whether or not the "smell" occurs more often or not compare to exhalation through the mouth.  In any case, if I were you I wouldn't be concerned for my health from these experiences alone.

Haha, I remember once when a roommate walked in on me smoking DMT, and was like, "Good Christ, what the fuck is that smell?"


It's indolic so your nose and taste buds are very sensitive to it and can probably detect very minute amounts, I wouldn't worry about it

Why do you think that? I'm perhaps the biggest (most sensitive) baby of them all when it comes to psychedelics and DMT loves it!

Have you done mushrooms before? Mushrooms are probably 10x times as scary as vaporized DMT is (for me at least).


The great thing about smoking DMT is it is in and out so quickly and leaves such a PROFOUND impression on you. THe peak can be a little bizarre at first but its over so quickly its all good. The afterglow truly is where the deep magic of DMT unfolds. Afterwards you end up feeling bright and full of love for days. Its also the healthiest feeling psychedelic I've ever done (they are zero negative effects as far as I can tell). Its magic.


I would say if you can handle a good dose mushroom trip then you can definitely handle a DMT trip (smoked, oral DMT is a COMPLETELY different animal, which is hands down my scariest psychedelic experience).


But, you know yourself the best...so always proceed with caution (and love for yourself).


P and L,

SS

ah very good persuasion sir!  im almost feeling confident enough to seek it out.  im pretty sure im lucky enough to know a guy who knows a guy too.


yes i've done mushrooms, never a real good dose.  maybe around 1-2 grams but DAMN am i ever sensitive to psychedelics and I love it.  (e.g. roof turning into a magic carpet, entire room turning black with a glowing blue outline around everything on half a tab of acid) it's a blessing, not a curse!

there's always the option to do a low dose of dmt. on low dose spice trips you feel the warmth and love of the dmt, have a hightened perception, maybe some visual distortions and the afterglow still lasts a few days (at least for me). such an experience is what i would recommend to anyone wanting to try their first psychedelic

yeah true, you can titrate upwards from around 10mg (which definitely give an effect).


You can smoke a dose, wait 90 mins, smoke another larger dose, wait 90 mins, smoke some more...and keep creeping it up.


Alternately you can space out doses for days or weeks in between for a different type of trip.


The DMT trip is both very short and very long (in the sense that the real work keeps going for days afterwards integrating things). Such a positive space.

If anyone has any ideas of how to convert DMT into a better snortable substance i'd be interested in hearing ideas.  I am currently snorting the freebase but i feel i'm doing irreparable damage to my nose.  Smoking it seems worse to me for some reason and i have never been able to achieve the effects i have smoking that i have snorting.

out of curiousity how many mgs do you snort and what type of intensity do you get? I would also be curious about conversion, it might be hard to do without it turning gooey.

usually 80-100mg.  full on +++++.  I first enter a "place" where i am surrounded by 3d neon patterns and feel as if i am in a full on meditative state, then i start to feel as though i am dying.  and do indeed die.  i spend some time in the cosmos before returning to my body, not as myself, but as a growing fetus.  My cells replicate and I begin to develop into an adult again.  It is one of the most humbling experiences i had and every time i've done it i've felt i've been given "another chance".  mentally the exact opposite of ketamine.  Ketamine makes me wish i were dead so i can be in a "K-hole" forever while DMT makes me embrace life and be thankful that I am here.

If you don't mind I'd like to add to your question by asking the following:


If an extraction was obtained using lye from Mimosa hostilis, resulting in a yellowish white crystal, is this DMT HCL or DMT Freebase?


Also, if you can provide some more commentary Walked on the Moon, it would be appreciated; for example, how to you prepare the freebase for snorting, what duration results from the doses you are using, and what are the negative effects experienced from insufflation?


Thanks.

Yeah I'm trying to prepare for a DMT experience.  Trying to see if I want to wade in or dive in.  I've heard so many mixed things about it that I'm glad to see some positive things being said about it. I just kind of had a night of reading horrific trip-reports last night so I was all sketched today.  Looking for the best mimosa provider... Anyone offer up some advice in that area?  PM me if you'd like to donate some thought, or post it here.   Been checking eBay, keep re-reading the erowid guide entitled "QT's Extraction Method for Students."  Thanks so much for any help.  Any other really spelled out guides or alternative solutions would be great, but this guide seems really well put together.

the lye unhooks the DMT hcl and turns it into the freebase. Then you extract it with the solvent and evap the solvent and you have DMT freebase. You probably should wash it once to get it purer if its yellow.

duration from insufflation lasts from 45min-2hours.  i do not know what the duration difference is caused by.  negative effects are extreme extreme pain in the nose, possible vomiting (i have never experienced this), and you smell dmt for the next few days.  i find that keeping my head forward or completely upside down after insufflation rids the drip of me

Thanks SS, it actually is beautifully clear white/clear crystal, I just thought if I said that it might confuse the issue, because most home extracted material I've seen is yellowish ... :D 


I still can't believe you like the smell of DMT!  I had a teacher back when I was in Grade 6, and she had a terrible problem with tooth decay. DMT brings me back to Grade 6 with shocking clarity ... 8(


Thanks for the info Walked! Sounds rough.

Walked on Moon, you have me extremely curious about insufflating DMT now. So, 100mg would be a good dose then for a strong trip?


Again, does anybody know if theres a way to neutralize the freebase to make it less painful to snort (and perhaps more efficient at absorbing?)? Would the HCL absorb faster/better?


Please answer as my curiousity is piqued to an all time high!!!!! (I did not realize the peak could last over an hour!!!).

twoci -- by "wash" do you want to remove dust from off the outside of crystals? Or do you really want to recrystalize it? This can refine off-colored DMT crystals themselves to much purer form. If the latter, then you want to dissolve the crystal in warm heptane or hexane (use Bestine brand) and then slowly bring the temperature down to freezing to re-precipitate the crystals. Search for a recrystalization tek to find the exact steps involved.

I've done about 10 or 15 low doses of DMT in the last couple weeks and its been GREAT! The last time I did it I was graced with a very pure and real contentment and peacefulness. I had the urge to become more familiar with a tree next to me (that I sit next to and drink my morning coffee everyday). I felt it breathing!


Anyways, I think DMT is telling me to reconnect more deeply with the natural world.


ps morning coffee + low dose DMT = miracle!

The material you end up with is hard to work with oily. I think the picrate salt (which is a form of hcl if I'm correct) is easier to work with. Or I believe you can convert it to citrate salt (with vinegar I think).


I don't know the steps behind that though, but you might be able to research something with those keywords.

my thoughts

dmt allows you to percieve the spirit more.

And trees have alot of spirit life. 

rivers are also quite powerful with energy/spirit.


I too find music distracting on DMT and also DPT....all other states of mind i enjoy music to enhance the trip.

But with DMT it is just an instant shift in consciousness. 

I like to be by myself and have no thoughts and no distractions.....then inhale some dmt and see what unfolds

my thoughts exactly. yes rivers are also on my mind. I also like swimming/bathing in river water after a psychedelic experience. It is so CLEANSING.


horses also are very powerful on DMT (I remember my oral DMT trip was centered partially around horse (it was in a horse pasture) - nested paranthesis what a dork!).

Not if your trying to get DMT HCl crystals.  If your thinking of leaving it in solution for IM/IV injection, I recommend using citric or ascorbic acid to dissolve the freebase.  It goes into solution more easily with a weak acid.  Dilute acetic acid (or white vinegar) is another option.  Do not use lemon juice as a source of citric acid!  I found that you can dissolve up to 400 mg/mL DMT freebase with 200 mg pure citric acid.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)  Oh, and I don't know if this helped or not, but I added some sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acidity.

^I've seen a few other posts saying this on Bluelight so I might as well confirm it.  I've successfully converted the (pure) freebase to DMT acetate for IM injection by heating 50mg in 1cc of 2.5% acetic acid solution.  Citric acid (lab grade or better of course) may work better, though I can't personally comment on the concentration used.  The experience is similar to but not quite the same as ayahuasca, its greatest comparative advantage being logistical. For me it has a 5 minute onset, a 15 minute peak, and a fairly quick decline with visuals disappearing at around the 40 minute mark.  Syrian Rue or other MAOIs may potentiate it, change it qualitatively, and lengthen its duration.  Subcutaneous administration may also increase duration.  All of the usual considerations and precautions for preparing and administering injections should be observed.

as far as intensity, how many mgs of smoked DMT does it roughly equate to?

It's tough for me to make a direct comparison because of the differing lengths of action and my lack of experience at this point.  My initial trial with 40 mg DMT citrate (actually 40 mg DMT freebase) seemed to be roughly equivalent to 30 mg smoked, but each phase (come-up, plateau, and back to baseline) was about twice as long.  This trial was performed at a Modest Mouse concert right as the show kicked off.  As I made my way back up through the crowd it was kicking in pretty hard.  The effects were building significantly in under 2 min and the plateau lasted somewhere around 5-10 min.  I was close to baseline after about 20-30 min and whaddya know, my lungs felt great!  They don't take kindly to harsh chemical vapors.  The show was amazing as well ... bathed in a DMT afterglow! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I want to know if there's 'plateaus' that are reached for DMT.


I want to know what the dosage is for smoking and orally correllate to each 'plateau'.

Anyone have any idea how much for each?

I haven't ever seen anything written out about "plateaus" in the way that dxm/ket/salvia have been.  


Search for "breakthroughs"  at about 50mgs pure.

I was reading a text on brain damage before that post and my head was full of jumbled jargon .  I meant to say intraepidermal and it came out "intraparietal"; but really it makes more sense to say subcutaneous so it was all just stupid.  I've edited it.  No one go injecting DMT directly into your brain!  Or if you do at least write a trip report afterwards if you still retain that ability.

What would some of you more experienced heads reccomend for a first time dose? I've smoked DMT-plant matter before and just gotten intricate visuals, nothing too overwhelming though. I want to break through, and am thinking about 20-30mg smoked?

Depending on your sensitivity 20-30mg will probably not be enough for a full 'breakthrough' but you can definitely have a very profound experience on that amount. You will defnitely see visuals!


I started by smoking little hits (like 10mg) and then waiting a couple hours then smoking another slightly bigger hit (15), then stepping it up from there. I finally broke through for the first time on around 42mg (it was my fourth trip that night).


I'm going to experiment soon with 5-MeO-DMT as an adjunct to the DMT trip. I believe I can breakthrough FULLY on 6mg of 5-MeO-DMT and 25mg of DMT.


peace and love

oh I'll also be using a 55mg rectal dose of bk-MDMA as a springboard! I will try to immerse myself in the Love that permeates reality, sitting in the sunshine next to my favorite tree and let myself go, fully, as I exhale the 5-MeO-DMT and DMT.

bk-MDMA (aka M1) and I have not personally mixed these but have it from a few different sources that the combo is fantastic.


I'm thinking about an even lower dose of Methylone than 55mg, since 103mg sent me into a fullblown +3 experience. So, I guess 45-55mg will suffice to project me into the Love and Warmth of reality without any sort of major comedownish period.

Samadhi Smiles gives a good idea. There is no need to go full bore right off if you don't feel comfortable with it.  Put a bunch in your pipe, and take small repeated drags, and get to know the substance for a while.  Then when you are ready hit it real long and hard.


Tolerance does seem to build up though when smoking, so as he suggested, you might take breaks in between sessions, like 1-2 hours.


I've found talking exact dose with DMT kind of pointless, because there are too many factors of loss during smoking.  There are just small hits, moderate hits and big hits. If you suck in enough vapor so that you see a huge vapor cloud upon exhaling, that will probably be the last thing you see for a few minutes. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I only need 30mgs to have a full break though when I lie on my back. I have smoked 45mgs sitting up and not broke though and never broke though sitting up. You guys that have problems breaking though should try laying on you backs in a quite place, might work. If not the 5-meo-dmt combo I’m sure will, I lay on my stomach with 5-meo-dmt just because it is so powerful and some people puke so I just do it to be safe so I will never choke on puke but I have never puked but its good to be safe. A 5-meo-dmt combo break though is different then a DMT, more intense, like a spiritual jump start.

i tried 5mg of 5meodmt+30mg of DMT last week....very good combo...much better than a high dose of either.

the 5meo added the power to the DMT, while the DMT added more colors to the 5meo.

both were complementary of each other

I know it's way off topic in here, but could you private message me or post that trip report? I've been very curious about that combo. I quite enjoy the immeasurable depths of a salvia experience, but my instinctive fear can sometimes kick in. I would think that MDMA would alleviate that.

^ Yeah one time I took about half a hit off my pipe and knew I had to get shot of it quickly. I was pretty much catapulted into the centre of the room as a bunch of orbiting electrons.


All this at at least only one sixth of a dose which wouldn't even of itself necessarily produce breakthrough.

 I never figured that one out! ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

45mg of bk-MDMA (rectal) and 45mg of DMT (insufflated) produced a beautiful and prolonged DMT peak (45mins writhing on the forest floor immersed in visuals).

I've been slowly working myself up to trying DMT in the near future. Is there any kind of body load associated with it? Or is it similar to Salvia in the post-experience time, whereas your head just feels a bit tweaked and trying to grasp what happened to you during the trip.

bk-MDMA is the beta ketone of MDMA (otherwise known as Methylone, M1, or MDMC). Its chemical name is: 2-methylamino-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propan-1-one).


In my experience there is little negative body load with smoking DMT. Perhaps some nausea (especially if you are not used to inhaling large hits of thick vapor and some tingling/twitching of muscles. But most of the physical effects are quite nice (rushes of energy down your body, warmth, tingling head, etc).


Peace!

MDMC is already taken by 3,4-ETHYLENEDIOXY-N-METHYLAMPHETAMINE...which is a shame as it could have been called EDMA instead.  MDMC makes much more sense for "methylone" but since that name is taken we have to call it MDMCAT.

what was your timing with the 5-MeO-DMT and MDA and DMT and MDMA and MDMA/2CB?


I felt like I should of waited a bit longer to do the DMT on the bk-MDMA because the DMT totally overpowered the bk-MDMA. It was nice coming back out of the DMT to be welcomed to a warm slightly (less powerful) buzzing of the bk-MDMA, though.

with 5 meo-dmt+MDA.

~8mg of 5 meo dmt was smoked on top of the tail end of an MDA trip (i estimate around 120mg-150mg, it was in ecstasy pills so i dont know for sure). This produced the most blissfull 5 meo dmt trip i ever had. Before that experience 5 meo always scared me royally. Since that experience everytime i smoke 5 meo dmt it fills me with joy and love that feels like it will just burst out of me at any second.


DMT with LSD:

DMT was smoked about 4 hours after ingesting LSD. This was my first DMT experience and my only time combining the two. This trip is too hard to put into words.  Regardless i highly recomend it.


DMT with MDMA:

The DMT was smoked ~3-4 hours after ingesting the mdma. The DMT was a lowish dose (~30mg). Let me tell you, the DMT visuals mixed with the nystagmus of the MDMA provides for a mind blowing 10 min.


i tend to enjoy DMT as my trip starts nearing the end of the peak. This tends to bring the trip back for another hour or so aswell as color the DMT in a positive way.


Although IMO DMT is still best enjoyed on its own. (the 5 meo dmt + dmt combo does intrigue me tho.)

**mass doses, easy way with DMT.**


ever had a few grams of DMT in your pocket and pulled it out to find you now have a big glob of yellow/orange/red waxy goo? well here is an easy way to mass  produce those grams into indevidual doses.


all you need is some rolling paper, large piece of thin galvanized steal, a drill bit about the size of a pencil eraser and a spray bottle of water with a mist setting and dont forget teh spice.


first, put about 200 holes in the steal with the drill pit, second completey cover the steal with rolling paper, next spray them gentaly with water so they stick to the steal, turn the steal over and let dry.


finaly freeze your dmt crystals so they are nice and solid, then on the unpapered side of the piece of steal rub the DMT across so it fills in all of the holes you just created with a piece of rolling paper acting as a catch net.


by this time you should have a piece of steal with ~200 off white disks of DMT ontop of rolling papers, on the side without rolling papers add a layer and spray it gentaly as to only wet the paper.


on the dry side use the back of teh drill bit to push through each disk of DMT wedged between rolling papers. These pucks can easily be smoked without any sort of screen or plant material, and the dose is close enough to 30-40mgs that its pretty easy to guestimate how much you are taking.


believe me, this method takes ~15min to make 200 seperated DMT doses, it takes ~1 hour to do the same by hand.

Have I ever!  In fact just this morning I woke up several grams of gooey DMT in my pocket.  Whenever that happens, though, I prefer to use the goo as a spread on my morning toast.

OK...


Last night I tried about 10 mg to start with. Maybe a little less. That yielded a nice body buzz and a bit of a visual haze.


I then waited about 90 mins and had about 15-18mg. I got a varied purple landscape of closed eye visuals, almost in a fluer d lys (spelling) shape. That and sensed a sort of otherwordly "interest" in me...if you know what I mean.


I then went to bed. I just had about 20-24 or so mg. I really need scales. Anyway this was more intense than last night, lovely green and blue flowing patterns on my ceiling and behind closed eyelids. Everything in my room took on a fake, plastic appearance...I remember this from my other smoked DMT experiences. 


Good overall, I think it has been a good few preperation doses. I want to take it to the next step. I'm going to smoke about 40mg at once in a week or so...and see how it goes.

what do you mean by 'fake plastic appearance'? I cannot relate at all to that unless we're just interpreting that phrase differently.


On low doses, open eyed, objects take on a very real and organic quality (wet/fluid/shifting) and take on more entity properties than inert properties. Trees especially do very very special things when one is under the influence of dimethyltryptamine.

Hmm. Well let me take a couple of guesses first most people who aren’t gay don’t like to stick things in their but. Second most people who use psychedelics consider them sacred and most non-gay people don’t like to stick things that are sacred to them in a hole that is full of shit. I don’t know Shulgin personally but those would be my first two guesses.

First off to the poster above STFU. 


Ok I have been smokign my 5meo-DMT with little to no real profound effects. Exept shortness of breat and time slowing and mild visual perception changes and alot of breathing patterns and color change. WHY HAVEN'T I broke through into the real deal. I have used alumnium foil,glass pipe,and light bulb. I have a ACCULAB vic-123. Which will be for sale soon on ebay!! and I measured out 15 mg and lightly toasted it and nothing but a mild visual change and shifting time and huge erotic sensations! Am I not getting the whole DMT thing but maybe I am not getting the entire hit. I want to experience pure terror. Liek I did with my 27 mg of 2cb-fly Whos looking over my shoulder......![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Anal absorption is meant to be the most efficient way to take drugs aside from I.V. I don't think it's a homsexual thing, more like a cost-efficient thing. I haven't done it but plan to soon (mdma). So ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png).


And Mr. Smiles, by "fake" I mean that objects in my room, and my room itself..appeared to be platic, surreal. Like true reality is hiding behind my perceptions. I've yet to try it outside, would like to though!

Rrrrrreally?


Well, I and others have found that taking psychedelics (for me phenethylamines in particular) alters the subjective effects, which include: taking time off the comeup which can be a period of anxiety/tension for some, decreasing nausea and other peripheral effects, and shortening the entire trip's duration which can be a benefit for longlasters, decreasing amount of material needed to reach the same intensity (often half as much material is needed as oral, sometimes as much as a third of an oral dosage can be used).


And, its really fun to stick a baby syringe (the kind w/o the needle of couse) up your butt and squirt some chemical up there (it tickles sometimes).


Peace and love!

Oh, and if the psychedelic experience has taught me anything, its taught me to look objectively at my own thoughts and judgements and perceive them as such; constructions of the mind that could easily be manipulated to have a drastically different profile.


It is the case that if our society traditionally administered medicines rectally and I, for some reason, used them orally, we might be in reverse positions and you would be making fun of me for taking psychedelics orally (perhaps saying I have a 'baby fetish' or something like that).


Peace!

**sensitivity**


Well maybe you should try to learn some sensitivity, a lot of people don’t like to hear about people sticking things up there but and it drives people away that might other wise enjoy these threads or contribute to them. You have a whole thread on rectal administration and you still troll all these threads in to rectal stuff, not everyone enjoys that, try to have a little sensitivity, not every find rectums attractive or fun to talk about and you are ruining these threads for those people. It is one world try to be a little considerate to you fellow human beings who share it with you. Peace, love and sensitivity.

For all the people in the world that are sensitive when I bring up discussion of rectal administration, I am deeply sorry for the emotional turmoil I have put you through.


I would politefully suggest seeing a professional therapist as it seems (to my untrained eye) that there is something deeper going on there than just a superficial aversion to rectums.

I’m not homophobic like you guys think I am and I am not against peoples sexual preferences. I have a lot of friends that are gay and they are good people I would say better then average people, I think this kind of rectum trolling behavior gives the gay community a bad name a lot of people aren’t as open minded and will start to think that all gay people just troll around and talk about putting things in their ass all day long. It doesn’t bother me when people say I going to take this drug rectaly it just bothers me when people troll 2 pages of a thread about cleaning feces out of their rectum and sticking things in their ass. I just don’t enjoy reading about people playing with their assholes, just like I don’t enjoy watching people pick up dog shit or change a diaper at a nursing home it seems like a lot of people don’t that’s why they have bathroom stalls and people say excuse me while I use the bathroom instead of saying I’m going to take a shit and wipe my ass. But no I’m not homophobic yes I don’t like reading about feces and assholes, and yes I think samadi is a rectum troll. I just wanted to say sorry to anyone I offended and let you guys know that I am not against gay people.  Sorry to get so far away from the subject of DMT.

I agree with you luckytaak, I may have gotten a little out of control with talking about rectal administration. I'm sorry if I offended you and will try to stay more on-topic in the future (and generally try to keep discussion of rectal administration to a minimum). My apologies.


I would say though in the 2CT7 thread we have had some very good discussion of the merits of rectal administration (Dondante brought up some very good and thoughtful counterpoints replete with graphs and such).


I don't know if this is the right time or not to add this, but I just wanted to note that DMT freebase doesn't need to be dissolved in milk or anything for it to be active rectally. I just finished plugged 22mg of it and it is quite active just tossed in a gel cap and plugged (+2 peak for 20 mins).

Sorry but I'm too stupid to keep my mouth shut.


I very much appreciate honest and open drug discussion and I feel it is absolutely essential that practices of drug administration be discussed without sensitivity if this board is to maintain it's aim of HARM REDUCTION.  


If some folks are pushed away from contributing to a thread as a result of their sensitivities , so be it, at least those who may be risking their own and others health and welfare will have access to uncensored and accurate information.


EDIT:


Thanks also to samadhi_smiles for the info about rectal admin of DMT , I was particularly curious about that . Also thanks for his mention that Infected Mushroom will be right here in my hometown, Atlanta, next month![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) .

Rectal administration is a common method of dosing these drugs if you don't want to read about it then don't.But bitching at people for posting about it is just childish.

You have a whole thread on rectal administration and you still troll all these threads in to rectal stuff, not everyone enjoys that, try to have a little sensitivity, not every find rectums attractive or fun to talk about and you are ruining these threads for those people. It is one world try to be a little considerate to you fellow human beings who share it with you. Peace, love and sensitivity.

Luckytaak, I appreciate your honest and civil explanation.  However, it does seem to me that you have some sort of deep discomfort with things anus-related.  Why should it bother you to read someone's report about the way they took a drug?  Why should that give the gay community a bad name?  I very much doubt that most people would read through this and end up thinking "Oh man, all those damn gay people!  All they do is shove drugs in their ass and tell everyone about it!".  Not to mention, why do you seem to assume that the people discussing rectal administration are gay?  It's not fun, it just works a lot better for some things, and hence the small price to pay (discomfort) is outweighed by the benefits.


The thing is, it's a valid form of administration.  Pharmaceutical companies make suppositories because rectal administration is way that doctors use for certain things and which some people are required to do daily for various conditions.  May I suggest that you consider the possibility that the discomfort you obviously feel over the thought of it is brought on by your being brought up in a society begun on puritan ideals, which has resulted (as long as you're an American anyway - which I'm pretty sure you are) in our society having this strange taboo regarding sexuality/body parts/etc.  My point is that feeling uncomfortable at the mere discussion of it, not to mention actually expecting everyone to censor themselves for you and feeling like you're right in asking that, is the result a neurotic thought process in your mind put there by the way you were raised, and unless you can honestly live your life in such a way as to accomodate everyone's neurotic desires about any little thing they are repulsed by, well, you should be able to realize that it's a silly fear/disgust/repulsion.  That's beyond fine if you don't want to use rectal administration.  Hell, it's not comfortable, I can understand.  But how can you request that everyone stop talking about it and make some wild assertions as to its reflection on the gay community with a straight face?  I'm repulsed by only a few things, and those are needless violence and cruelty, oppression, and eyeballs.  So I'd like to ask that you please keep ANY and ALL discussion of eyeballs and touching eyeballs, such as putting in eyedrops and contacts, out of the forums.  It reflects badly on the optometry field, and we need to keep Bluelight image neutral!


![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Sounds silly, yes.  But some people ARE disgusted by eyeballs and discussion thereof (like my friend ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)).  But more importantly, I hope you can realize that the rectal thing is primarily a societal thing imprinted on you for no good reason.  Although of course we are all affected strongly by our cultures in many, many ways, once you realize you've been behaving in some way that is illogical and neurotic (being so disgusted with the concept of rectal administration - not "playing with your asshole" by the way - that you expect that everyone else should stop discussing that drug taking method), well, it would be just plain silly to keep acting that way.  It's just your ass.  it has no connection whatsoever to homosexuality, except that homosexuals use it sexually in many cases.  Correlation does not equal causation.

And, as MorningGlorySeed has stressed many a time just because you find anal stimulation pleasing, it does not mean you are gay. In fact, males are hardwired (the p-spot) to find stimulation of the anus very arousing/erotic.


I would say that if you are against a finger or tongue in the butt, then you must not have tried it yet because once you do there's no going back!!! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

A few more trials with DMT last night:


A friend came over and was interested in trying it since I'd told him about my one experience with IM.  It's posted in this thread already ... 40 mg IM in the deltoid.  It was suggested that I try the thigh as an injection site to lengthen the experience.  Also, note that the dosages are for DMT freebase, but the solution was actually DMT citrate.  


**50 mg DMT, IM, thigh**

I loaded 50 mg (using sterile technique), swabbed the injection site with an alcohol prep pad, and injected the viscous DMT citrate into his thigh.  He said the burn was fairly significant, come-up took about 4-5 minutes (much longer than my deltoid IM injection).  Peak at about 6-8 minutes and steady decline ... not quite baseline after 30 min.  


**15 mg DMT, IV**

I decided I needed to try it as well, but IV instead, just to break into new territory.  I actually did this as he was getting the first effects and beat him to the peak!  After injecting 15 mg, the alerts were instantaneous.  I made my way to the couch just in time to collapse and let the DMT world take over.  It was surprisingly intense ... room was vibrating, I could see my feet out in front of me, but as far as I was concerned they weren't mine.  Thoughts raced and a strong sense of love and euphoria seemed to emanate from within.  Peak was reached in 1 min (+++) and I was back to a + after about 8 minutes, and back to baseline at about 20-30 min.  There was absolutely no burn and the experience felt very clean overall.  I found it somewhat similar to my IM dose, except the set and setting were much different.  The 15 mg IV was much more intense than 40 mg IM, however.  


**15 mg DMT, IV**

My friend decided to try IV since he wasn't terribly impressed with 50 mg IM.  Same dose, I let him inject.  We later found out that he'd missed at least a portion of the dose because he had a big histamine reaction around it right by the vein.  He must have gotten most of it though because he was peaking in about 1-2 min.  He said it was worlds better than the IM dose ... and "it felt like a different drug."  So 15 mg IV (despite partially missed injection) was more intense than 50 mg IM.  


**22 mg DMT IV**

After he got back to baseline, I offered to let him try again if he wanted.  He asked for a small amount more this time (at this point we didn't know about the missed portion of the first dose).  I gave him 22 mg, thinking about the fact that Shulgin's range went up to 30 mg and Strassman's was similar.  I think Shulgin's reports are with DMT HCl so his 30 mg report is equal to about 25 mg of freebase.  Strassman's are with DMT fumarate so his highest level, which is somewhere around 30 mg DMT fumarate, is equal to about 23 mg fb.  


Moving on ... about 30 sec after I administered the injection, he turned to me and said, "is there anything I can do to make this stop?!!"  ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)   I told him no, you just gotta ride it out.  Let your mind take you and it will be over soon. Conclusion: 22 mg is an incredibly intense dose!  If I'd noticed the first botched injection I wouldn't have given him so much.  I put on a song called "Banshee Beat" by Animal Collective.  Just as it ended (about T+0:06), he sat up and said, "Okay, I'm back."  I asked him if he met any elves, to which he replied no.  The closest thing I've seen to entities is described in detail in my MET + 2C-T-21 report.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)   I didn't close my eyes for much of the trip this time, and maybe 15 mg wasn't quite enough to get me there.  Anyway, according to my test subject ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) , 22 mg felt like "a rollercoaster going too fast" or like "being strapped to a rocket."  Once he started the descent he said he could finally enjoy the experience.  He said he was glad that he'd had the experience, but didn't know if he'd ever repeat it at that dose.  


Both of us agreed, *DMT is psychedelic cotton candy*.  It's incredible stuff, but lacks all the true benefits of the longer acting psychedelics.  The racing thoughts makes the experience too disorienting to gain much from it.  It is instant euphoria, and an amazing visual display, but I don't find it to be useful in the way that mushrooms, 2C-E, or LSD are.

Have you combined DMT with an MAOi? And if you have, is it the entire DMT experience that you're referring to as lacking? I agree that smoking DMT is almost a waste of such a beautiful compound. I found this compound in combination with an MAOi to be so rich and beneficial that more than a year after an intense experience I am still integrating aspects of the voyage.

No, I haven't tried DMT + MAOI ... and I do have high expectations.  I assume it's a different beast altogether.  The psychedelic cotton candy comment refers to DMT only.  And that doesn't imply that DMT can't blow your mind to pieces, I'm just saying that, for me, vaporized/injected DMT is rather innocuous when it comes to evoking a state of enlightenment.  I even consider DMT + long-acting psychedelic also to be more useful than unaided DMT, because you drop back into a psychedelic state that allows more analytical depth.  Not to mention, the experience itself can be quite drastically changed.


Oh, and one more thing ... the peak of 15 mg IV was roughly equivalent to 50-60 mg vaporized DMT.

I did not mean to slander the good name of solo DMT. Vaporized DMT has its place (and I by no means think that my preferences apply to other people). I do however, in my person opinion, reached through experiential means, find vaporized DMT to be a coin operated plastic grocery isle horse, as compared to oral DMT with an MAOi, which is akin to a wind wild undomesticated four legged and maned god; one that may let you get on, but not let you break it.


I guess one appeared more recreational than the other; yet again, that may be a particular response by my nervous system.


It would be sweel to locate a psychedelic plant compound that produced the same subjective experience in all people, making it safe to theorize that the metabolization of the mystery compound evoked an entity that borrowed the nervous system of the end user. (Edit. That make no sense, did it?)

I even consider DMT + long-acting psychedelic also to be more useful than unaided DMT, because you drop back into a psychedelic state that allows more analytical depth.  Not to mention, the experience itself can be quite drastically changed.

I didn’t expect IV DMT to be so much more efficient v. the smoking route.  Good to know.  I’ve never IV’d anything but this sounds like the way to go, especially considering that it doesn’t seem to be that much shorter in duration than IM.  


I’ve had a recent overpowering IM DMT experience at 50mg that involved syrian rue and small portions of other psychedelics that I’ve mixed with DMT and syrian rue (but not all with both) in the past without incident.  I even used 25mg and waited 8 minutes (plenty of time with IM) to see how strongly it would affect me--not much--before finishing the remaining 25.  The DMT trip lasted an hour and a half and involved limp-limbed, involuntary body contortions (including grinding my face into the bathroom floor), a complete shattering of proprioception that made purposeful movement nearly impossible, vomit, and an unrelenting torrent of tears and snot I assume was some kind of histemic reaction to the DMT (I’ve gotten this before but never at that level).  DMT with a MAOI: a different animal indeed.

I smoked a little of this one again last night.


I weighed out 30mg, and there was probably ~3-4mg left over from the last attempt.  I was kind of apprehensive about smoking it again, but I really thought it was time..  So anyway, I convince myself to smoke it again, and start to, but can't get myself to go back for the last hit.


It was an interesting experience, thats for sure.  I closed my eyes, and saw the same exact room.  However, empty where there was people (my friends) expect for these 4 figures, that start coming up and crowding me, but I was never able to see their head, but a spiraling fractal universe in their bodies.  When I try to look up, the rooms perspective shifted, and I was looking at them the same exact way still!  Like I could turn my head 90 degrees to any direction, and was still seeing the room the same way I saw it as I took the last couple hits of DMT.


That was the last of it, so now I have to move on to 5-Meo-DMT and see where that one can take me.

IV DMT was quite interesting, but if it sounds like I'm promoting IV drug use, well, I'm not.  I actually had nightmares last night afterwards about IVing DMT in which I found myself going into septic shock instead of DMT hyperspace ... actually there was something about me losing an eye too, but not sure how that tied in! ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)  Maybe it's my micro/infectious disease course, but either way, there are significant risks to IV drug use that one must be extremely careful about.  


Just to give a fun example, bacterial endocarditis can be caused by introducing bacteria into the bloodstream, which can adhere your heart valves and form dense antibiotic-resistant vegetation.  If you're not careful, there's risk for quite a few bacterial infections, many of which are associated with significant mortality.  


I never re-use (or share!) a needle.  I always use iodine or an alcohol pad to prep the injection site, and I always sterilize the drug prior to use with a micron filter.  Don't think about IVing anything if you can't follow these simple precautions.  In the name of harm reduction, you have my 2 cents.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I tried some form of DMT today. It was a herb mix which seems to have a high concentration of DMT in it. I didn't break through but after 1 bowl of it(smoked through bong with direct flame) I got a huge rush not unlike that of nitrous then my hearing dimmed a bit and I started seeing fractals in everything including the hair on my arms. Anything 2D also appeared to have a lot more depth and paintings looked very 3D. Whenever I shut my eyes I saw beautiful fractals and shapes in my vision. Are these sort of effects achievable just from smoking 1 bowl of plant material or could it have some how had DMT extract soaked into it like fortified salvia leaves?

smoked about 25mg of DMT llast night on 2 strong blotters of LSD.

I have to admit that DMT is exponentially better when it is smoked while on another tryptamine. THE DMT seemed to influence the lsd trip more profound and left me in a state of awe. this was my first trial smoking dmt while on another tryptamine. I think smoking some DMT while on a strong dose of shrooms(5-7g) would be better though (than lsd)


anyone have any other combos they enjoy smoking DMT with other tryptamines?

250 mics LSD + 25 mg IV DMT @ T+8:00 = mind blown and then blown again


IV DMT admin. while listening to "Angels of the Universe" by Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson and Sigur Ros.  I order you all to listen to this album.  The DMT is optional. 


Wow ... this one is going to take a while to process!


DMT is much, much more than cotton candy!!!  ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Isn’t it a great feeling to know that at this late point in your psychedelic career, after years of psychological desensitization, you’ve been able to achieve a more expansive and vital state of sublimity than even back when the experience was almost completely unknown to you?  It lets you know you haven’t seen it all, that this isn't just a phase and that progress is possible.  That despite having had experiences beyond your ability to pre-conceive or re-conceive, and having reveled in a degree of deep ecstasy few will ever be fortunate enough to experience, even greater possibilities really may still lie ahead.


I know this is probably part of what you can’t put into words, but what about the LSD do you think made such a synergy with DMT possible?  I would imagine that given their chemical and experiential kinship with DMT, psilocin or 4-AcO-DMT might synergize even more completely; or do you feel that LSD’s significant differences with DMT are integral to the gestalt experience in a way that is unlikely to be recreated or surpassed with different combinations? If you can comment, in what way?  Next on my combo list are aMT and DMT (IM or IV) and aMT, 4-AcO-DMT (this combo produced the most important psychedelic experience of my life), and DMT.

I am going to definitely have to try the psilocin + DMT thing though!

I'm not sure what it was about LSD that made for such amazing synergy, but it undoubtedly changed the character of the DMT.  I'm going to try and write a report, but the LSD was so incredibly intense that my memories of the entire experience are quite incomplete.  They come back to me slowly ... naturally and with the help of my tripmates.  I will see if I can recover enough for a report.  The DMT experience, OTOH, is fresh in my memory, but extremely difficult to describe.  One thing that immediately comes to mind is the serenity of the experience.  After a tumultuous LSD experience, DMT put me in a state of egolessness that was so amazingly peaceful.  


I'm serious about the aformentioned album.  It's a soundtrack from an Icelandic film, and it is stunningly beautiful.

Dondante, serenity is a very good word to describe my recent DMT trips. All of a sudden, as if in a dream, I found myself flat on my back, staring at a field of geometric diamonds, interlocking and forming my thoughts. I was struck with the profound beauty of it all.

This chemical is a powerful testament to the human mind's capabilities of creative manifestion. There is unfolding of thought in intricate visual diamonds, interlocking together to form faces, masks, life forms. The brain is pumping dimethyltryptamine, it is hungry for more.


You're on your hands and knees, tears springing from your eyes, wondering what else there is to reality.


Now you're on your back, with the stars above you zoom zoom zinging around and you have no idea who you are.

ya two serpent coiling is a symbol used by gnositcs as well.


I think LSD + DMT is would be better than Psilocin+DMT, because LSD tends to add more creativity/imagination whereas Psilocin is more chaos.


I havent done psilocin+DMT, but i have done LSD+DMT and the LSD allows me to have alot more creative thought process while in the DMT headspace. It also made the DMT flash ast about 10-20min longer than what dmt does alone

just some thoughts

Archetypal imagery, I've seen shit like that before while tripping. It is a medical symbol...?

it's the symbol for pharmacy around here…


and now for something completely different:

ive recently smoked some dmt on the tail end of a mdma experience. the dmt lasted a good deal longer, but was less spiritual and more 'fun'. also the colors seen with closed eyes were more rainbow colored and brighter than what i usually see with dmt alone. altogether a nice experience but the true potential of dmt lies elsewhere. i'm looking forward to trying dmt together with lsd.

**DMT "Surges" an Affect of MAOIs?**


Up until a few weeks ago when I intramuscularly injected DMT in combination with an MAOI, I believed the surges I experienced with ayahuasca—where the trip suddenly increases in intensity for a few minutes before receding again (and repeats)—were due to the liquid ayahuasca mixture rounding a new corner of the intestines and being more quickly absorbed by an “unsaturated” tract of the gut (or random gallbladder excretion). This was corroborated by two telling observations.  Firstly I noticed surges occurring when I turned over and lay on my opposite side while tripping, an act that I guessed to coat a new length of intestinal tract with DMT by force of gravity.  And secondly, in my non-MAOI trials with DMT intramuscularly, the experience was very even and predictable, suggesting that the smoother trip was indeed due to the more constant and predictable DMT blood concentration one would expect more from IM administration over oral/MAOI.  


This conclusion was contradicted however by a recent, difficult and physically taxing, trial with DMT (IM) in conjunction with syrian rue where the surging was so powerful it was fully incapacitating (hope to have a report soon).  I suspect that the surging phenomenon is due to an interaction with an MAOI, but I can’t really say for sure from one experience.  Do most of you who consume DMT orally with an MAOI experience these surges?  If yes, have you noticed differences in the intensity of the surging between different MAOIs?  Have any of you experienced intense surges from insufflated or injected doses or used MAOIs in conjunction with these routes of administration?  What were the differences if any?

I have some questions regarding smoking techniques peops..

I have tried smoking out of a lightbulb so far however there is a problem

the smoke is always really harsh to the point that I can barely hold it in my lungs

is it supposed to be this hot or is there something i might wanna do to help me be able to hold it in better

or do i just need to get used to the harshness and hold it in somehow

Pure DMT vapor is not harsh **at all**. It is actually quite smooth (I don't feel it going down or out.


You may need to purify your DMT, as there is likely a bit of naptha remaining in it (assuming you extracted it). What color is it?

these pictures look pretty much exactly like mine did

dont got a camera though


I got the idea that it should be harsh from erowid...but i suppose erowid is not always right....

do these pictures look about like it should?

Neither is necessary. A wash with cold DH20 over a coffee filter is probably all that is needed. That should clean up the DMT (the DMT is of course not soluble in the H20, and some of the impurities are).

You could alternately make a solution of H20 and DMT, then add a layer of naptha, and remove that layer and evaporate it.

oh ok thanks alot s_s

I've finally gotten a successful extraction so I can't wait for a full dose!

all I've gotten to do so far is very low doses...which were actually amazing in and of themselves

but I shall soon enough i suppose


haha and this may be a stupid question but....is dh20 just another way to say h20?...or am i confused

alright thanks


ok just to double check since after a few tries and a few failed extractions...

this is what I am about to do to clean up the crystals a bit:

1. put the crystals into coffee filter

2. run chilled distilled water over filter


this is what I need to do, correct?


yea it probably is just as simple is you made it sound i just wanna make sure cause I am eager but not willing to much a bad move cause i couldnt wait to be sure

recrystalizations are great after your first big expereince, cuz then your not in a rush to get your extraction done so you can finaly smoke some... and recrystalizations become kinda fun haha.

haha well I would love to do a recrystallization...but I don't have easy access to naphtha at the moment...but I do have plenty of bark

so I am plenty willing to wait to do another extraction where I can (attempt to) make some nice needle point crystals

but for this one since it will be a bit till I get more naphtha I think I will just do a wash with dh20 (feel smarter using  that abbreviation now ha..not really)


but really this whole operation preparing these crystals has been extremely fun

I love chemistry..I just need to learn a bit more

hey nofx, I did not do a wash with that. I find it to be not too bad. It probably could be improved though (I've stored it away for a day when injection is an intriguing idea).


Please let me know if you wash it and it improves.

hey guys, i don't really want to read through this whole thread, and i did a search since i assumed this would have been answered....but what would you suggest as the *easiest *DMT tek? the easiest extraction to do...i have been reading the Loki's tek over at dmt nexus and have a few questions...will post them later after seeing what else is suggested. tryign to just read everything i can right now to get a hold on it, but figured advice on which one to focus is a good move.

get the bark, crush it to powder... add the lye to water... mix with bark. 


let it sit for however long u feel like then add some realy hot bestine or vm&p naptha. swish it around in there and let it separate. once its separated use a syringe or turkey baster to get all your naptha. 


evaporate it. recrystalize it like this:

warm bestine and use just enough to make the dmt desolve in it. make sure its allll desolved though. then just let it sit at room temp. after huge crystals form u could put it in the fridge for another 12 hours or something then move it to the freezer after that. 


thats the easiest there is. everything is pritty much just a variation of that.


that right there should give you nice big clear crystals depending on your recrystalization. 


if your on the nexus im sure youve already found the right ammount of lye to make your solution 13.5 ph. as well as the recrystalizations... nexus has pritty much everything....

that is so cool that you saw that in such detail!...yes, perhaps a hidden memory, but neat nonetheless. it is the sign of my favorite god, sage and father of hermetics hermes/hermes trismegestus/thoth ultimately the sign of wisdom, which can be boiled down to your DNA double helix. to me it is the metaphor/archetypal signal that you have reached true wisdom, but then again, i am not exactly a master of magick and metaphor, just a neophyte when it comes to that. but to me, just as myths are a metaphor, language just isn't enough when it comes to the psychedelic experience, metaphor and imagery is the best way to communicate.

thanks for that...i spent a few hours reading through this thread finally and am getting a better handle on it. i have spent years just being an armchair psychonaut and reading the fun trip reports, figured i may as well learn how you guys are getting this neat little spice. so much freaking info/info overload


i have been so excited since discovering dmt some years ago. the usual psychs (lsd, shrooms) just weren't enough, it was too simple so to speak/kinda like coming  home, but i want my ass kicked

I have some synthetic DMT coming, maybe it's from the same place you guys got it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Is it necessary to do the wash on this product, or is it just to more likely look and smoke better? Maybe I'll do a wash on a little bit of it, and see how that goes.

DarthMom, the most popular and easy to follow tek seems t be the marsofold tek.


Not sure if its the best but it does give excellent results.

a simple base water polar solvant extraction is all thats needed. and no funnals are needed, just use a turkey baster to pull the naphtha. and there are various teks for cleaning the yellow crystal, the ebst Iv done is put your yellow crystals in some naphtha (or rather naphtha on your yellow crystals) slowly untill all you have is just one BIG cloud of dmt in napptha (you'll see) and then put the container in a plastic glass filled with water and throw it in teh freezer, when the water is frozen the naptha has droped the crystals and you'll see a bunch of white jizz looking stuff in the naptha (alost liek teh toplayer of pudding) just pour the whole thing over some fine linnon and bam, you got some clean DMT freebase.


I ahve run into problems with naphtha never evaping fully, but I think this is from 

1. inferior bark

2. old naptha thats been sitting in the woods for weeks

3. bad karma on my part

In my, most humble, opinion, the defatting and washing steps that are included in some of the available teks are, most definitely, worthwhile.  Even doing something as simple as one defatting by dripping through heated naptha (i.e. Loki) will substantially improve the quality of your final product.  True, you can smoke nasty, waxy, oily crud and still trip.  But, the properly refined and purified n,n-dmt freebase is so much smoother and sweeter and more ounce-for-ounce potent that to skip the additional 30 to 45 minutes required to adequately defat and/or wash, seems like an impatient foolishness of the highest order, to me at least.  YMMV.

Hey smart and knowledgeable chemical wizards! I have big question....


I've been reading about the "hummingbird tek" for ayahuasca prep and the tek states that it will produce a *very strong* brew with just 8 grams of root bark. The kicker of the tek is the use of phosphoric acid to get the alkaloids out of the bark and into the brew. I've read of previous researchers theorizing that rootbark extractions suffer on account of tannins binding with alkaloids (perhaps the base teks get higher yields by breaking these bonds),  Is it possible that phosphoric acid can increase yields beyond what we are currently experienceing with a/b?

Anyone tried activated carbon for cleanup?  Works fantastic.  I realize alot of teks yield white right from the first precipitation but,...  If you have yellow, add about 20ml non-polar per gram of dmt and 33% by weight activated carbon.  You might have to heat to get the dmt into solution.  Mix it well, and leave overnight.  If the dmt goes out of solution heat it back up and filter out the activated carbon.  Pour heated non-polar over the activated carbon in the filter as many times as you feel like to attempt to save the dmt that is still in the carbon.  1 equal portion to the amount used to make the original solution should be fine.  Your solution should go from yellow to clear.  It might not get 100% of the yellow out but there should be a significant improvement.  When looking for activated carbon, choose a sample with a bunch of little chunks, not powder.


This has turned yellow oil to white crystals upon evaporation. 


There is great thread at the Nook by the "inventor" of this method.

at the moment im listening to this youtube video of Terence Mckenna describing his first smoked DMT experience, during it he mentions that there were being that told him "not to give into astonishment."  which seems odd to me, because didn't Joe Rogan say the same thing?  almost word for word aswell.  and then i got to thinking, it seems like theres a lot of distinct similarities in DMT trips, like machines, elves and probably a lot more that im not aware of.  so my question is -  why are there such distinct similarities in DMT trips?

The last breakthrough experience on DMT I was asked (mockingly) what answer do you think you are looking for using psychedelics?


Afterwards, as I was coming out of the experience, I was laying in the leaves, staring at bushes, in an awkward position with my mouth open and flies buzzing and landing on me and for a moment I thought I had 'overdosed' and was dead and now my family would feel much sorrow and pain.


And plus it would be awhile until anybody found me as I was quite alone in a quite remote area.


No entities, no other worlds, no mysteries, just my brain being blasted with 51mg of n,n-DMT.

do any of you think this is a good idea for dificult emulsion layers/ reeeellly thick sludgy solutions? 


take your bark and soak in the base water for hella long. then add that to more distilled water. all the salts are already unhooked right? so it would just make it more fluid and easier for the naptha to work around... 


tell me if im wrong cuz im considering alot of new ideas for my next batch.

^^^I wouldn't say "opiated" but absolute bliss could be more approriate...? 


Joe Rogan was a firend of Terences BTW, and would have been paraphrasing him. I've got the Joe Rogan and Terence sample, I'm sure T. McKenna said the "astonishment" statemnt first for what its worth. Though indeed, DMT does tap into simlar realms of the mind for most individuals, though there are many detrimental or different accounts to. Many times, breaking-through, I havent seen the "elves', but been smothered with the beauty of crystaline energylove matter. Though it seems that when these other beings are 'contacted' or perceived, the end result seems more vital and long lasting and imbued with meaning.

Could that just be an aspect of human psychology? ie trying to make sense of somethinng as complex/mysteriious as the DMT state. And when something is contacted that can be anthropomorphized (and is) it makes a longer lasting impression than simply beautiful geometric patterns and diamonds, and layers of intersecting color?


I'm pretty sure there is no message to the DMT state (other than what you want to assign or apply to it which can be useful).


The blessing is its ability to change your biochemistry after using it.

Sounds like an opportunity for some learning and tek improvement. Perhaps adding more water but maintaining a high ph will free more salts from tannins and increase yield.

would you consider the chemical more or less profound by vaporizing it rather than insufflating it?


My one medium dose snorted made me wonder about the usefulness of high doses, as it was very profound (42mg snorted). I bet 100+mg would be wonderfully profound, but also wonderfully painful.

There don't appear to be any hdpe containers in a desirable shape above 1 gallon capacity.  1 gallon milk jugs per pound of bark...  Start with hot water, add the basified mixture while hot.  Heat the nampha...Just be prepared for yellow oil contaminating the spice that may not be easy to remove.


Snorting does seem to add a different character to the trip.  I haven't gone very high given the burn though.

I think nasal is slightly better as you have more time peaking.  although i dont think i'll ever do nasal again because doing around 120mg up the nose ruins my nose for days.

So I received some DMT a few days ago. This is synthetic DMT freebase* supposedly the freebase. It's a tan powder, maybe with a tint of orange/pink. Now, I've extracted DMT from MHRB before and yielded very little due to poor technique, but very worth it! This DMT doesn't seem to produce the same effects as my extracted product did. 


The extracted product produced OEV, kalideoscopic patterning, and VERY colorful. This synthetic DMT only seems to produce CEV, nothing with eyes open. No patterning, no colors. Everything is with eyes closed, and yes it's nice. The reason I bought this was to experience what I did with that one dose that was extracted. That was magical, and this just reminds me of 5-meo-dmt, just with closed eye colors. 


Maybe I should up the dosage? I have a proper freebase pipe. I've tried smoking it at 15mg, 30mg, and this last time an unknown amount, probably 50mg. I'm going to attempt to clean it up, get some nice white powder, or attempt to recrystallize. 


About recrystallization, is it possible to crystallize from powder? There are no base crystals to form off of. I would dissolve some amount of DMT into naptha, hopefully there would be a layer of pure DMT, and some unwanted material below it. Can anyone give me some tips on how to proceed with this? I've got lye, vinegar, and naptha if needed ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^^ Are you sure it's synthetic DMT?  The synthetic DMT going around is pinkish, not tan.  You may have 5-MeO-DMT or something... the effects you describe are very different-sounding than what people are reporting for the DMT.

How long has it been between the extracted DMT and this synthetic DMT? It is possible your brain has changed a bit and experiences DMT differently now...I know with DMT over the course of a few months the subjective effects have shifted quite a lot...so much so that if I could experience back to back my first DMT trip and my DMT trips these days, it would probably seem like two different drugs.


DMT changes your biochemistry...gradually, but definitely there changing things in your brain.

well, its like a tannish pinkish orange. I've smoked it and an extracted version back to back in one session and noticed no differences at all (the synthetic was smoother on the lungs though since the last extraction left some residue apparently).

I would assume this DMT came from the mainstream supplier, like everyone else's.  I believe it to be DMT, but the company was never too *sure* if it was freebase or the hydrochloride. I am led to believe it's the freebase, as that is what is was advertised as, but it's also possible it could be the hcl. 


I will up the dosage in the next days. For now though, this item seems useless to me. I would like to breakthrough and bring back the experience. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The more I do DMT the more it changes for me. Every time my brain can comprehend a little more of the experience and I wake up a little more and gain a little more awareness in the realm of DMT. Sometimes it happens with only time and not so much usage, maybe someday I will see the whole picture and be able to comprehend it. That’s when the aliens kill you because you know too much! LOL Also my mindset makes a difference for me a while back I was reading a book about India before a DMT trip and my whole trip I saw India patterns and deities, it was rather nice.A lot of times I hear people complain about poor roots that give out poor extract with less colors and such but I think it is set and setting and n,nDMT is always the same.

Any tips on how I should clean this up? Should I just do an ammonia wash/Dh2o? Should I dissolve in naptha and see if impurities come out and freeze it? Or both?


What I would do, without anyone aiding and experimenting possibly wasting this precious material![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)  is dissolve 200mg DMT into 5mL of naptha. If impurities show, suck up the clear and put into a petri dish (with syran wrap?) and let it hopefully crystallize. Or, let it evaporate in the open. 


I really would not know what I was doing, but I guess experimentation has it's lessons to be taught. I would certainly appreciate any help on how to clean and/or recrystallize this synthetic DMT freebase powder.

There was more than one batch from that supplier...I got the earlier pink DMT, and then more of a pale tan/peach coloured batch. The pink stuff seems slightly more potent, but the other batch is still good

It seems stronger than clear shards of plant extracted.  I'd clean it up with my lungs personally.  Although colored synthetics tend to make one worry.  Recrystalize if anything, there won't be any lye for the ammonia to clean.

anybody have any ideas about why I can't seem to get my yields cleaned up enough to be a manageable smoke, cause even after doing freeze precips and then ammonia washes the product is still way to harsh for me to hold in the smoke longer than a second or too.


should I possibly just do more than one freezeprecips? Idk, i'm getting the crystals but am still not being able to smoke them successfully.

any helps appreciated

I don't know why your DMT is so harsh even after recrystalization and a wash...when you dissolve the crystals in warm naptha before doing the fridge-freezer cycles are you looking for a small layer of oils at the bottom of the jar? If not, look for that.


I remove it by using a small jar for the naptha then titling it on its side and sticking a syringe in there. Even if you pull in some naptha just let it sit in the barrel for a second then push out the oil and put the rest of the naptha back in your jar.


If you are removing that layer and still getting dirty crystals then I don't know what to tell you. What kind of extraction did you use? Acid-base or just straight to base?


How are you smoking it? It might just be your reaction to DMT, it is very harsh unlike anything else. Have you smoked crystals before that weren't so harsh?

Smoked about 350 mg over the course of a few hours after consuming 2 grams mushrooms.  Caught the midwest leg of the wippet tour directly after setting down the dmt pipe, this became a little compulsive, but seeing wippets live tends to do that...Great combination, conveyor belts of multicolored rocks flowing in opposite directions, covering everything no matter where I looked.


The mushrooms seem to lengthen the dmt, as well as make it slightly more potent.  Wippets did exactly what I expected them to do.  They're fairly predictable, but effective never the less.

Well if your sure you didn't suck up any lye and all your crystals are close to white or slightly tan and your having DMT like experiences all I can say is that it just might be the way things are. 


How are you smoking it? Some people have reported vaporizing it on top of some parsley in a bong with out water allows you to let the vapor cool before inhaling it. I have never used this method so I can't comment of effectivness but the theory behind it seems right.

I do an ammonia wash after the freeze precip so that should wash out any possible lye that got into the product.

but maybe it is just the method im using causing some way hot vapor since tere is not much time at all for it to cool down on the way to my lungs.

I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually, was just checking if anybody could give any hints

thanks

how overwhelming is DMT as far as intensity goes?  is it possible to have a bad trip on this drug or does it just go too far out to worry about "negative" and "positive".  from what i've read about it, it seems as if DMT isn't really known for intensity.  for example, if salvia gave someone an out of this world trip and they were afraid of DMT because it's so much more out of this world should that scare them away from it?


in summary, is DMT more intense than salvia?  in what ways?

any other related info would be very appreciated.

The intensity is about the same but DMT has much greater clarity and more cohesive visions. My experience with salvia includes alot of confusion and bewilderment. 


IMHO DMT is vastly superior. 


I could really be convinced that DMT is an alien interdimensional transit technology but I'd never be convinced of the same for salvia.


It is possible to have a bad trip on vaporized DMT but the duration serves as a sort of built in damage control.

DMT certainly soen't dissociate you in the way salvia does- I've generally found that at reasonable doses I'm still able to think fluidly, in the sense that I'm aware, at a core level, of what is occurring. At very high doses (estimating 100mgs up-usually smoked after having previously smoked, so perhaps tolerance comes into play) I've 'blacked-out' or at least completely forgotten that I was alive. *That* feels more like being unconcious. However, the overwhelming feeling is of positivity and euphoria, though there can be a lot of anxiety at times, as with every psychedelic. 


> from what i've read about it, it seems as if DMT isn't really known for intensity.  for example, if salvia gave someone an out of this world trip and they were afraid of DMT because it's so much more out of this world should that scare them away from it?

Comparing the two is very hard, except that they are both intense in their own ways. Salvia is something I use with caution and hesitation and outright fear, but its pretty inspiring and so worth the negatives- DMT is something I truly love to smoke, and can at almost any occaision. But time brings familiarity, and I began my proper DMT voyaging with small doses and gradually increased. Also bear in mind, DMT is one of the few psychedelics I enjoy low doses of, and are very rewarding in their own way. So even a small dose, which won't neccesarily rock your world, can be enjoyable and beneficial an give you something to think about.

Theres a million psychonautical jargon that everyones probably heard- but I remember a foaf saying that DMT was like being gently massaged, whereas salvia was like having a scalpel jammed in your head. Not a bad simile. But DMT has given me some of the most intense experiences of my life, though nothing as terryfying as salvia. If your ready for an incredible tsunami of emotion, then try some DMT+ Start small and have fun... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

well, DMT is in hundreds of different living organisms, including your brain (a theory) and one species of toad.  most commonly it's found in B. caapi, Psychotria Viridis and Mimosa Hostilis..  which is what's in ayahuasca (aswell as an MAOI like Syrian Rue) so yes, DMT is whats in ayahuasca.


people often use it for self exploration and whatever side dishes comes with it.  i've never tried it myself, #1 or 2 on my to-do list though.  it is one of, if not THE most powerful psychedelics.  not to be taken lightly or to get "fucked up".


what's it like?  i can't even begin to describe what i don't know.

Thanks for the info


I've heard the body produces it after 72 hours no sleep or light of any kind.


I've looked at the erowid vault for it and was wondering what people here thought. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah DMT is the active ingredient in ayahuasca. It is not orally active though so people smoke it for short yet very intense trips. It's a tryptamine, somewhat comparable to a mushroom trip in some respects. As for recreational value, it tends to be too powerful to be much use for merely recreation, though some would argue small doses can be, it is generally used to reach a verydifferent state of reality where contact with non-physical entities is possible.

This leads me to another question.


Contacting non physical entities, this can't be real, is has to be a hallucination.


The drug is what causes the hallucinations, there is no magic drug which makes God or what not come to earth and talk to you.


Right?

I'm certainly not knocking anyone because I really don't know and that is the truth.


But doesn't it seem that it would be a hallucination?  This would occur strictly while on the drug which implies that one would be under the influence of the drug and simply hallucinating.

i've met many people who will smoke DMT casually and recreationally if it is on hand...

at last flipside, i was chillin and rolling with about 6 people in the guys tent next to me. I mentioned I had some DMT kind of offhandedly since i didn't expect anyone would want to do it. The vial and pipe got passed around like a cannabis pipe... O_O  I was pretty fucking surprised because I definitely don't use it in the recreational sense.

i don't want to start shouting off a bunch of tomfoolery and blasphemy, but what i know about DMT is it's a chemical that interacts with your brain chemistry resulting in out of this world hallucinations and reality shifting experiences.  i would not be surprised if that's all it is, and i would not be surprised if it's that and so much more..

Its weird- reality is seen as something we 'receive' from external stimulus, but when we talk of things such as 'entities', elves etc. (hallucinations), its always considered to be something generated from within ie. not real. One of the two theories is right but not both. Either we generate the world via our conciousness, including all hallucinations, or we recive reality from an external source, which includes external hallucincations. I don't see why its so hard for people to accept the chance that DMT does in fact allow our brains to perceive other worlds, parted from this by only the sheerest veil....It seems more likely then my brain sponaneously creating such visions to me at least.

perceive other worlds or other realitys/universes? 


basicly, the way I see it, its all got to be something, and thats what it all is, something. everything is something that experiences it self in order fro something to be experienced. The highest level of reality per say, the reason behind it all. Now those other realitys, they are there, but maybe just because they have to, in fact any relaity has to exist, and any possibility has to be true. What if you realy wernt your self, but rather a mirrior of your self. 


FREAKY! 


This is what I call "mental masterbation"

Reality is just a hallucination...


 But let me tell you a story as to why DMT is very special to me. About this time last year I smoked my last 'break-through' dose (I trust you're familiar with the term), well I was taken to 'the place', where I saw entities I knew and recognised from my experiences with psilocybin. The took me along a roller-coaster ride and bombarded my brain with their special information, there was a distinct feel that some sort of healing was taking place. Then towards th e end, as the ride began to wind down, my father appeared. The entities went to him and began their healing but after a moment came back and, with metaphysical shrug of the shoulders they told me that it was too late and there was nothing they could do. 


I didn't think too much of it at the time but it was always at the back of my mind, and it gave me a sort of subconscious urge to talk to to my father about all sorts of things about life and death, he lived a long way away from me, and we only got the occasional time to see one another, so the last time I saw him we spent many a late night smoking weed and drinking red wine, discussing life and death. I even shared a low-dose DMT joint with him, his first go of it. When he died of a sudden heart attack at the start of this year the trip came back to me, I realised that the entities had already shown me this. I wept with joy and gratitude that, thanks to DMT, I had a chance to resolve so many of those deep issues with my dearly beloved father.


I'm not saying that with DMT you will meet god (you may very well meet *someone*, or more like many someones, but i don't know that you'd call them 'god'), but it has shamnic, theraputic benefits and that is undeniable.

**Breaking Through**


What's the secret to breaking through, I seem like I'm kind of on the verge, the classic chrysanthemum pattern dancing on my wall with what seems like little pin pricks of light starting to poke through, and then before I know it I'm back on my way to baseline. What am I doing wrong?

How many milligrams are you vaporizing?


My most intense experiences have been getting as much DMT in me as quickly as possible. I can usually only inhale about 25mg in one toke, then I hold it in for about 20 seconds and then exhale and quickly suck in the second hit (I've started tripping as I suck this one in). Then I lay back and hold it in as long as I can.

Sorry to go off the line of metaphysical debate here, but I was just curious about the shelf-life of well cleaned DMT?  Should keeping good synthetic deems over a period of time be a problem?  Is there any particular way I should keep it?  Is folding the crystals up in aluminium foil a bad idea, seeing as how thats how I have them now?  Thanks in advance....


I was considering getting a glass vial, but I saw a friend put his DMT into one and a lot of it got stuck to the sides, which sucks with a round vial... Guess i could search for square vials! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well, one good method to ensure that you breakthrough is SMOKE MORE!!! Thats the only way I continue to, is just keep packing the pipe. I think breakthrough, as a term, lends some air of violence to the DMT trip. Its more like sinkingdown underground then breaking anything. I don't feel likes there a point where you are  here and just beyond that is the other kingdom- in a way, you can experience a mild 'breakthrough'.


I guess though for the full spectrum of effects to manifest and when it does, it would be called breaking through. But I've never experienced the salvia-like sensation where all of a sudden I am ELSEWHERE; the DMT process can usually be followed and realised. Time seems to go so slow anyway.

Ok so whenever I'm smoking DMT out of a crackpipe, it gets dirty real quick.

Not just the outside of the pipe is black[my friends still haven't gotten the hang of NOT letting the flame touch the glass...] but the stuff inside turns black and starts tasting like ass pretty damn quickly.

Any way to prevent the chemical liquid from turning black, ie just staying brown?

willow, maybe 'break loose' is a better term...its as if you've cast the anchor away and you drift on into the sea...


Heirarchy, have you experimented with melting it at a lower temp? I remember this black residue forming from BURNING the 5-MeO-DMT I had (it's a bit more fragile than DMT for some reason).


Also, it could just be an impurity in your DMT? Maybe try washing a bit of it and trying that?

anyone else experience something lie this from smoking DMT;


when the effects coem on, I fel my face kinda open up its pores and and see light particals come out, at higher doses they look like jewls, almost diamond structures. They seems to come out right at the moment the "blast" from te center of your mind reaches the face. The thoughts I can manage to have about this is out of this world, rangingf rom is that my soul to my body rejecting the tsart of pimples.

^Not that physical thing no , but I 'see' out of my mind all around, the 'visual' aspect being kind of secondary to the 'information download' aspect, both are intergral of course but I seem to see the beautiful stuff in a more comprehending way as opposed to looking at it in an 'oh it's lovely'way. I see it and deeper in it , I dunno can't explain.

oh yes, I get this too, the "love" aspect, but Im talking about when I dont loose my self (which is alot now... dmanit I may ahve jaded DMT already!... prob not though) but right after I inhail and the effects come on, it feels like my fae comes alive and stuff is shooting out from it. this in no way is an explination of what I experiences, only a small observation Iv made that ahs happend a few times in my experiences.

or pose the correct questions? or just cause more, or even just confuse teh fuck out of you. either way you'll get SOMETHING from the experience. 


plus its fun, Iv never had a bad DMT experience,its just to short lived for me to find anything negative about it. and I'll respect it to, I dont do it daily like I easily could, and I can hold onto it for quite some time. Realy, its just fun to me now, I get a reminder that I dont haev to think so much all the time, that Im to used to "this" pattern of though/reality/what ever youw nat to call it and realy its as simple as just doing something to keep your mind of of it. create tasks and suchs for you to do while here and find enjoyment out of it. Thats the key, enjoy your existance.

well, it's more like i'd just prefer someone on my list that's just a double click away  if i think of a question, and if they aren't online then i can wait..  but more often than i'd like questions i post on forums go unnoticed, and no one likes a bumper.  it's just a personal preference man, if im having a 1 on 1 it's a lot easier to go in-depth among other things.  


at the moment i don't have any questions, if anything id just like to discuss your experience with it.

Nah it's like trying to remember a very vivid dream, you form mental reference points, it's prety easy o verbalise. There is alot about the experience that was much more distubing, I just have difficulty accessing those memories.

Your perspective is from within by default.  By definition, subjective experience requires a *subject*.  I'm not going to make a solipsist argument here.  I'm merely saying that you are more or less confined to your senses, memories, and subconscious.  Considering this, it seems very unlikely that these entities are external to your mind.  


Your mind forms a representation of reality through your senses, but this is still only a representation ... subject to distortion and outright hallucination.  Your dreams, for example, are completely from within.  Why is it difficult to believe that DMT doesn't behave somewhat similarly?  Any other explanation would be hugely at odds with any rational interpretation of reality.  Occam's razor points convincingly to one answer.  I must say that the internal nature of these entities doesn't make them any less interesting to me.

I'm fairly certain as we understand the brain a bit more these types of mental phenomena (entity contact on HT psychedelics) will be explained with neuropsychology, if not neuroscience proper. Positing an external entity (which does not cohere with any accepted theory of reality) seems like a viable choice now simply because we do not fully understand the way the mind is correlated to the brain (yet).


There is already the rough sketches of how these types of phenomena can be accounted by neuropsychology.


This is not to attempt to reduce the beauty, grandeur, or magnificence of spiritual transcendent states. It is just to place them in their proper place, as part of the biological processes the brain conducts.


**How wonderful our brains are!**

I think these so called entities are the same things that shamans and priest could evoke and control in the old days. We have no culture of guidance on these trips so they appear to be random things from our culture, elves and things like that. But if we were in a culture that imprinted our brains from birth with cultural entities we would see the ones that were imprinted on us such as Hindu deities Buddha deities, ect. We have T.V as our biggest imprinting tool and that’s where most of the things in our thoughts come from for most of our culture. So who controls the entities now days Disney? Pepsi? Are the deities real? I think they can control events and actions in this realm of reality that intertwines with our existences and that makes them real. I’m sure a lot of people can describe them in terms of nero science or what ever the mythology of their culture will support.

consider this:

Smoke some DMT in an area, such as a desert, which is totally devoid of life.

Then do the same thing in a forest or near a lake, river or inner city, or anywhere with an abundance of life.

Compare the trips.... Report back.


From D.M. Turner


> When I began smoking N,N-DMT my experiences over the first few months were bright, positive, enjoyable, and ever touching new dimensions. Some aspects of certain experiences had been quite frightening. However, the scary episodes only led to a deeper understanding of myself and the realms to which DMT introduced me.
> 
> After about four months of use I began to lose some of the rapport I had experienced with DMT, accompanied by a reduction in the frequency of my use.
> 
> 
> 
> Shortly thereafter I took a vacation to Arizona with plans to take psychedelics while backpacking in several desert areas. The first leg of my journey brought me to the vicinity of Mt. Lemon, just south of Tucson. This was to be my first experience smoking DMT in the Southwest, and I was anticipating an experience as magical as my previous trips in the desert.
> 
> 
> 
> However, the results were entirely different than what I'd expected, and completely unlike any of my previous DMT experiences. I felt a deep fear which is hard to speak of. I sensed the presence of death, despair, and loneliness. I felt haunted by some mysterious evil, and I thought of the word "spooky" to describe the unsettling feeling this experience left me with. The feeling of "enchantment," which is normally delightful on DMT, had become something sinister. And I was quite baffled as to how this occurred.

could it be that when you smoke dmt the entities you encounter are the living energy personified (if you can call it that) surrounding you???

I have one of those glass tube pipe things for vaporization purposes.  Can someone tell me the proper procedure for vaporizing DMT.  How close do I hold the lighter (it's a jet lighter), how long do I hold it there? when do I know to inhale?  Do I need to keep turning the glass tube as I here is done for meth?


Also, can extracted DMT be less pure and does it therefore require larger doses.  A friend told me that 200 mg of a particular and hypothetical extracted DMT was equivalent to 1 strong dose or 3 light ones, but I have read on Erowid that ~40mg constitutes a good dose.  Can anyone shed any light?

to vape it, just hold the lighter close without touching, it will puddle up into an oil and start to boil as vapors come off, inhail those, twril it if needed. 


as for purty, it realy depends , Iv had spice that 30mg would be THERE while other that would need at least 75-100mg for teh smae experience. But then again Iv done alot of DMT and Iay just be seeing liek all psychedelics it realy just depends frm experience to experience in it's varrability of effects.

Its an art.  Don't get it too hot.  Don't use that jet lighter.  Use as regular lighter, flame held far enough away so that it just barely vaporizes.  Let the vapor build up a little to cool and inhale very slow.  DMT does not like to be burned.  I have had the feeling of the entities being extremely angry with me because I let the flame touch it and ruined some of it.  IMO continued smoking seems to only go so far.  Its like it lures you in with sort of a bait and switch.  It shows you what it can do at first but then holds back.  What it really wants is for you to consume it orally.  


A close friend, D.M. Turner, and myself have all drawn this same conclusion.  I don't think it was ever suggested to me, or heard of it so I don't think its a power of suggestion thing.

Smoking DMT is an art. I think taking hits in a row with out taking a breath maximizes the intake effectiveness. Also to get a breakthough you are letting your self go in a trance, so you have to relax, breath deep..awawwzzzzzz

I'm going to experiment with this....something about bongs....I love the idea of one HUGE rip...but, I've been told that it is wasteful. I've experienced very good effects lacing a joint with DMT, but its hard to tell about 'breakthrough' doses, as when you put a bit in a joint, you're not looking to breakthrough, just looking to sparklethrough.


Anyways, the friends I'm moving in with imminently have a bong, so I imagine we will be extracting and taking huge rips of DMT very near in the future.


Question to Willow (or anyone else): Do you notice that you need more in bongs compared to by other (more efficient) methods?


I have a theory, that the bong allows you to deliver a LOT of DMT very quickly to your system, and this makes up for the fact that you may waste a bit by burning it (or having it crystalize on the bong wall). I really think tolerance comes into play in a matter of seconds for DMT (this is why injection is so efficient and you only need 20-25mg for a breakthrough).

^^ Dude, if you're in Aus then there's little worry with 'wasting' it anyway, 50mg of yellow/tan crystal should do the trick nicely. The only thing I find is that if you burn it too hot those critical few seconds before you break through can be a bit hairy, it tends to be more gentle with a lower flame temperature. Some people say weed interferes with it, prefer just tobacco, can't say I've noticed myself though

^^^Thats it- Australia= acacia. Usually the method is coating something; damiana is a fave; with DMT and then smoking away. I've always used bongs because I'm more then accustomed to smoking weird stuff from them having smoked pot for years.... using the correct method ie. burning/vaping really slowly works extremely well, one can see the DMT boil as such.... I theorise that the act of absolutely stuffing the smoke DEEP into your lungs, thereby giving the DMT the maximum lungsurface area to absorb into is surely a bonus; however, I question whether vaporised DMT is absorbed fully in transit through water..... 


Bear in mind these are my theories- I have however had less satisyfying experiences through a simple pipe, mainly because I can only smoke a small amount of material; with a bong I can smoke heaps in one suck. With very anal lighting techniques, and padding (plant material) one the cone pieces-hole, very little is lost. But, as said, when I have DMT its rarely a matter of 'losing' some ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) groweth abundant it doth down here.

i've searched through this forum and few other sources online, and i cannot find a sturdy answer to my question.


when it comes to extracting DMT, most of the teks i've read about have some type of final wash or recrystallization to purify the final product. i'm curious as to which of the teks provide the PUREST DMT.


is it feasible to actually remove all of the solvents and such? the idea of having pure DMT is alluring, though the possibility of smoking (even small amounts) ammmonia or naptha is out of the question for myself.


so basically i wanna know which of the solvents extract the cleanest....and which of the techniques provide the cleanest procedure.

on the nexus they speak of crystal clear dmt. and it is. i havnt done it myself, i will on my next batch, but ffrom what ive seen with my own eyes, it apears that the best method would be:


disolve your spice in about 30 ml per gram of real hot naptha or hexane and let it cool to room tempurature over a 24 hour period. you could also put that in the fridge after the 24 hours, then freeze it after that. pour off and dry it, then add someore hot spice juice over those crystals and keep em growing... i would do an ammonia wash on the big one after that. should give u a huge crystal clear dmt crystal!

^That works well.  As a last step if you already have nice looking crystals, letting a supersaturated solution of dmt in nampha evaporate slowly w/out fanning will give nice shards.

Im trying a recrystallization with a gram of spice in 30 ml of naptha in a double shot glass. Sitting in my closest with a candle lid on top of it. I am noticing that all the gunk comes out of the solution first and settles on the bottom while the pure shard like crystals form ontop of the gunk. It seems like when it is done I will be able to pick the top pure crystals off the gunk.


I think the key to recrystallization is forming the crystals real slow so they have time to build.


Although the freeze precipitate is quick and yeilds a quality product it also ends up with a little bit of color left in the product.  Which is usually fine for most people unless you want to go all the way.


I figure for the amount of time I spend extracting I might as well wait a few more days for clear shards.

**I need the most efficacious way to tolerate the taste of pure N,n-DMT smoke**


I have recently begun smoking 99.9% pure N,n-DMT freebase out of a glass pipe (not extract).


The smoke is almost unbearable, it seems like I can get only like 20-30mg into my blood stream before gagging/my body rejecting the terrible taste.  It's like the worst burning plastic taste I have ever had the displeasure of tasting, although the effects you get when you smoke it are very desirable.  I have tried mouthwash and mints (which seemed to help a little), but it didn't solve the aftertaste problem.


I'm wondering how you people smoke 50mg+ of N,n-DMT at one time.  How many hits out of a "methamphetamine pipe" does it take for you to get all 50mg down your throat?  Do you hold the hits in for as long as you can?  Should your first hit be the biggest?  Should I mix it with something else to make it taste more pleasurable?


Is putting it on top of bowls of weed a complete waste of DMT?  I would assume so, but my friend says it works.


I just can't imagine smoking 50mg of that material in less than like 2 minutes.  The taste really gets to me.  Do some of you like the taste?  Is it an acquired taste?  Does the aftertaste go away if you break through (I've only broken through once and it was on 40mg).  I know you have to smoke it as fast as possible before going into a trance, but I need some tips on how to smoke it that fast.  How many hits do you guys usually finish 50mg in, and how long does it take before the 50mg is gone?


Please, if someone could give me advise ASAP that would be great.  I really want to break through on 50mg.

This is what I did with my lightbulb pipe, poke two holes in the bottom of a pop bottle, one to stick your pipe into and one to let air into the bottle.


Voila! Use it and you will see exactly why this setup is AWESOME!!!


You can take huge lungfulls that you never before thought possible, 50-60mg hits are a breeze, try it and you'll see :D

I actually like the taste, though I would tend to dilute it onto a herb as a carrier. That way you can have 100mg pipes without wasting any. Possibly your extraction is leaving behind some impurity, I know nothing about extractions, but it sounds likely...


Merging this with the Big and Dandy DMT thread

I wouldn't say its acquired, maybe someone more into it than I am can better answer that, but DMT is DMT...you're going to taste it if you smoke it.


Bite the bullet, and just smoke it pure. Smoking weed with it will probably slow you down on its intake...not to mention how zoned out and into to one thing you get after releasing dopeamine.

I did not do an extraction.  It's synthed by a chem. company in China.

It seems there are multiple Big & Dandy DMT Threads open right now, this one is being closed.

The main one can be found [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=409844). Carry on there.
