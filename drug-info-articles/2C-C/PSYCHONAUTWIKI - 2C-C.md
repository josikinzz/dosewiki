**4-Chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine** (commonly known as **2C-C** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which were derived from the systematic modification of the [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) molecule.

2C-C was first synthesized by Alice C. Cheng and Neal Castagnoli Jr. in 1983 as an intermediate in a study evaluating the neurotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine analogs. Its activity in humans was later investigated and documented by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved").

Many users report that the effects of 2C-C are gentler, more relaxed, and [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) than other closely related [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) . It is one of the least potent members of the 2C-x family, with muted visual effects and a relatively unaltered headspace.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-C, and its history of human use is limited. Today, it is used for [recreational](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) and therapeutic purposes. It is rarely sold on the streets and distributed online as a grey area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) .

## Chemistry

2C-C or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chlorophenethylamine is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-C contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a chlorine atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. 2C-C belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-C's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience is the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, the 2C-C experience typically begins with mild stimulation, but usually becomes somewhat sedating as the experience progresses and surprisingly lacks the distinctive energetic feeling associated with most [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . This is described in [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) as " *an intense form of relaxation.* "
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-C can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft, all-encompassing and mild tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Whilst at lower doses one may find that their bodily control is enhanced, at higher dosages this becomes suppressed.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This compound seems to not increase heart rate as much as related substances.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)** - Very high dosages of 2C-C are known to cause random muscle tightening, which can become uncomfortable.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Although nausea remains present, in comparison to other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , this remains relatively mild and tends to dissipate quickly. It is considered by some to be one of the most physically understated [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) known.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and cartoon-like in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 2C-C is more similar in appearance to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) than that of [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) . They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and angular in their corners.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
2C-C can produce a full range of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. However, the dose required to reach this state is significantly higher than many related 2C-x phenethylamines. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - 2C-C is capable of producing high levels of hallucinogenic imagery, although typically only at very heavy doses. When this effect does occur, it commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - 2C-C is capable of external hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 2C-C is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. 
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are not as pronounced than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) .
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant effect is only manifested consistently in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Relative to other psychedelics, 2C-C does not produce this effect except at very high doses. 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)** - Relative to other psychedelics, 2C-C does not produce this effect except at very high doses.
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - Due to it's relaxing nature, some users report being able to sleep after the peak effects subsided. ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - This effect does not typically occur except at higher doses.
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** - This effect does not typically occur except at higher doses. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - In contrast to some other psychedelics, this effect does not typically occur except at very high doses.
### Combinational effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis majorly intensifies and extends both the sensory and cognitive effects of 2C-C. Extreme caution should be exercised with this combination as it can also elevate the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) risk of cannabis.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When combined with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of 2C-C have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone. It also results in more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) and corresponding [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) which can develop into [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Nitrous](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nitrous)** - Nitrous oxide is commonly used in combination with psychedelics. The two are known to possess powerful cross-synergistic effects, including the capacity to send the user directly into an ["ego death"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death) state. The speed and intensity with which this occurs is very rapid and the euphoria that can result often leads to the urge to [compulsively redose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - When combined with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of 2C-C become strongly amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of 2C-C are also intensified with strong sensations of euphoric pleasure manifested through distinct body highs and headspaces, and uniquely colorful visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with markedly lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually. This combination may increase the neurotoxic effects of MDMA based on its similarity to LSD, which has been found to increase MDMA neurotoxicity.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol can increase the disinhibiting and euphoric effects of 2C-C which lends to its use in recreational settings. It can be used in light doses to "take the edge off" a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines. However, this is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) and [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively affect a trip if taken in moderate to high dosages. Heavy drinking is strongly discouraged as it can easily lead to black outs and unpredictable behavior.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a 2C-C trip. They are very efficient at stopping ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to their very high abuse and addiction potential.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-C use do not appear to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-C is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a limited history of human use.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried this compound suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be conducted to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that like psychedelics in general, 2C-C is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-C is not built almost immediately after ingestion. Similar to [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) there seems to be no apparent tolerance buildup if used repeatedly for a few days. 2C-C does however produce cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics, meaning that after the use of 2C-C all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-C. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
