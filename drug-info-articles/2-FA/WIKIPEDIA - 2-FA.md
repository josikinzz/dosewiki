# 2-Fluoroamphetamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Fluoroamphetamine*

2-Fluoroamphetamine (2-FA) is a stimulant drug from the amphetamine family which has been sold as a designer drug. 2-Fluoroamphetamine differs from 3-fluoroamphetamine and 4-fluoroamphetamine in the position of the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring, making them positional isomers of one another. The replacement of a hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom in certain compounds to facilitate passage through the blood–brain barrier, as is desirable in central nervous system pharmaceutical agents, is a common practice due to the corresponding increase in lipophilicity granted by this substitution.

## Pharmacology

Anorexiant dose (amount inhibiting food intake by 50% for 2 hours, given 1 hour earlier) = 15 mg/kg (rat; p.o.).
Analgesic dose (50% inhibition of response to tail-clamp) = 20 mg/kg (mouse; i.p.).
Effect on blood pressure: 0.5 mg/kg (rat; i.v.) produces an increase in BP of 29 mm.

## Toxicology

LD50 (mouse; i.p.) = 100 mg/kg.

## Legal status

### United States

The Federal Analogue Act, 21 U.S.C. § 813, is a section of the United States Controlled Substances Act, allowing any chemical "substantially similar" to an illegal drug (in Schedule I or II) to be treated as if it were also in Schedule I or II, but only if it is intended (ref 1) for human consumption. 2-FA may be considered to be an analog of amphetamine, thus falling under the Federal Analog Act, if, as stated above, it is intended for human consumption.

### China

As of October 2015 2-FA is a controlled substance in China.

### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on substances, preparations and plants considered to be narcotic drugs" and is hence illegal.
