## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 50 μg
- Light: 100 - 150 μg
- Common: 150 - 250 μg
- Strong: 250 - 400 μg
- Heavy: 400 μg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 12 - 18 hours
- Onset: 30 - 60 minutes
- After effects: 24 hours +
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Flubromazolam** (JYI-73) is a novel synthetic [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) , and specifically, the triazolobenzodiazepine class which produces [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) , [disinhibiting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative) , [muscle relaxant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxant) , and [memory suppressing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is incredibly potent (active in the microgram range) with an unusually long 18 hour duration. Thus, it poses comparatively higher risks than other designer benzodiazepines, due to its ability to produce strong sedation and amnesia even at a very low threshold dosage.

Flubromazolam has been noted for its potential use in the short-term treatment of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) , acute [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and the sedation of hospitalized patients. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] However, it is currently exclusively sold by online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors for use as a recreational psychoactive substance and has not been formally studied.

Any comments regarding its pharmacology are purely speculation based upon the subjective effects it induces and its structural similarity to [triazolam](/w/index.php?title=Triazolam&action=edit&redlink=1) , [pyrazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pyrazolam) and other benzodiazepines.

It is worth noting that [the sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) can be potentially dangerous or life-threatening for individuals using regularly for extended periods of time, sometimes resulting in seizures or death. It is highly recommended to [taper](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Taper) one's dose by gradually lowering the amount taken each day for a prolonged period of time instead of stopping abruptly.

## Chemistry

Flubromazolam is a chemical of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD) class, which are benzodiazepine (BZD) derivatives. Flubromazolam is named for the fluorine, bromine, and triazole substitutions on its core benzodiazepine skeleton (FLUorine-BROMine-AZOLe-AM). Flubromazolam is a member of the benzodiazepine class as it contains a 1,4 diazepine ring fused to a substituted benzene ring. Bromine is bound to this bicyclic structure at R 7 . Additionally, a fluorine substituted phenyl ring is bound to this structure at R 5 .

Flubromazolam also contains a methylated triazole ring fused to and incorporating R 1 and R 2 of its diazepine ring. Flubromazolam belongs to a class of benzodiazepines containing this fused triazole ring, called triazolobenzodiazepines, distinguished by the suffix "-zolam".

## Pharmacology

Benzodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site and magnifying the efficiency and effects of the neurotransmitter [gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) by acting on its [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of flubromazepam on the nervous system. The [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) properties of benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors.

Life-threatening adverse reactions have been observed at doses of only 3 mg of flubromazolam.

## Subjective effects

Flubromazolam has been described by some users as being one of the most euphoric benzodiazepines. It has been noted for its more pronounced sedative effects and hypnotic than anxiolytic effects.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Flubromazolam has the potential to be extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit down and generally feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out instead of engaging in physical activities. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). 
These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of flubromazolam can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of flubromazolam is described by many as one of intense sedation and decreased inhibition. It contains a large number of typical [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) cognitive effects. 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Although this compound primarily suppresses anxiety, it also dulls other emotions in a manner which is distinct but less intensive than that of [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) .
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at heavy dosages.
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** ### After effects
 
- - **[Rebound anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Rebound anxiety is a commonly observed effect with [anxiety relieving](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) substances like [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . It typically corresponds to the total duration spent under the substance's influence along with the total amount consumed in a given period, an effect which can easily lend itself to cycles of dependence and addiction.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** or **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)**
- **[Residual sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - While flubromazolam can be used as an effective [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, its effects may persist into the morning afterwards, which may lead users to feeling "groggy" or "dull" for a few hours if not significantly longer.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Flubromazolam](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Flubromazolam.shtml)

## Preparation methods

- **[Volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing)** - If one's benzodiazepines are in powder form, they are unlikely to weigh out accurately without the most expensive of scales due to their extreme potency. To avoid this, one can dissolve the benzodiazepine volumetrically into a solution and dose it accurately based upon the methodological instructions linked within this [tutorial](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Flubromazolam likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Flubromazolam is extremely physically and psychologically addictive.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. However, in certain cases this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. For more information on tapering from benzodiazepines in a controlled manner, please see [this guide](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm) .

[Benzodiazepine discontinuation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) is notoriously difficult; it is potentially life-threatening for individuals using regularly to discontinue use without tapering their dose over a period of weeks. There is an increased risk of [hypertension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypertension) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and death. Drugs which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal.

Flubromazolam presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , meaning that after its consumption all benzodiazepines will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Benzodiazepine overdose may occur when a [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) is taken in extremely heavy quantities or concurrently with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) . This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) since they work in a similar fashion, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABA A receptor. Thus, their effects potentiate one another. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABA A receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer . Benzodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly and properly. Symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include severe [thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration) , [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , coma or death. Benzodiazepine overdoses may be treated effectively in a hospital environment, with generally favorable outcomes. Benzodiazepine overdoses are sometimes treated with [flumazenil](/w/index.php?title=Flumazenil&action=edit&redlink=1) , a GABA A antagonist, however care is primarily supportive in nature.

### Dangerous interactions

Although many drugs are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2-methyl-2-butanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-methyl-2-butanol) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - It is dangerous to combine benzodiazepines with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of benzodiazepines, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of benzodiazepines will be significantly increased, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) as well as [other effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Subjective_effects) . If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only dosing a certain amount of benzodiazepines per hour. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if hydration is not monitored.

  "wikipedia": `# Flubromazolam
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flubromazolam*

Flubromazolam (JYI-73)  is a triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD), which are benzodiazepine (BZD) derivatives. Flubromazolam is reputed to be highly potent, and concerns have been raised that clonazolam and flubromazolam in particular may pose comparatively higher risks than other designer benzodiazepines, due to their ability to produce strong sedation and amnesia at oral doses of as little as 0.5 mg. Life-threatening adverse reactions have been observed at doses of only 3 mg of flubromazolam.

## Legal status

### Sweden

Flubromazolam has been classified as an illegal substance in Sweden after seizures by customs and police, as well as indications from the EMCDDA of wider use as a recreational drug.

### Switzerland

Flubromazolam is illegal in Switzerland as of December 2015.

### United Kingdom

In the UK, flubromazolam has been classified as a Class C drug by the May 2017 amendment to The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 along with several other designer benzodiazepine drugs.

### Australia

In Australia, flubromazolam is Schedule 9 under federal law.

### United States

Flubromazolam is controlled in Virginia and Wisconsin. On 23 December 2022, the DEA announced it had begun consideration on the matter of placing Flubromazolam under temporary Schedule I status. Later on 25 July 2023, the DEA published a pre-print notice that Flubromazolam would become temporarily scheduled as a Schedule I controlled substance from 26 July 2023 to 26 July 2025. On July 25, 2025, and effective the following day, the DEA extended the temporary scheduling until July 26, 2026.
