Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether (2-O-methoxymethylsalvinorin B) is a semi-synthetic analogue of the natural product salvinorin A used in scientific research. It has a longer duration of action of around 2–3 hours, compared to less than 30 minutes for salvinorin A, and has increased affinity and potency at the κ-opioid receptor. It is prepared from salvinorin B. The crystal structure is almost superimposable with that of salvinorin A. Structures bound to the κ-opioid receptor have also been reported.
Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether has a Ki of 0.60 nM at the κ opioid receptor, and is around five times more potent than salvinorin A in animal studies, although it is still only half as potent as its ethoxymethyl ether homolog, 'symmetry'.
