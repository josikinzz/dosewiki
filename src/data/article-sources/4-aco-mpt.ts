4-AcO-MPT, also known as 4-acetoxy-N-methyl-N-propyltryptamine, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families related to 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin). It is thought to act as a prodrug of 4-HO-MPT and hence is believed to act as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The drug produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents, and was first encountered as a novel designer drug in 2018. 4-AcO-MPT was first described in the scientific literature by at least 2017.
