2,5-Dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine (DOC) is a psychedelic substituted alpha-methylated phenethylamine, a class of compounds commonly known as amphetamines. The phenethylamine equivalent of this substance (lacking the alpha-methyl group) is 2C-C.

This substance has no history of human usage prior to the 1991 publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in the book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved) by Alexander Shulgin. In modern times it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and described in his 1991 book.

In terms of its pharmacology, this substance acts as a selective 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist. Its psychedelic effects are thought to be mediated via its actions on the 5-HT2A receptor.

DOC is a highly dose sensitive psychedelic that is often sold on blotting paper and known for its strong visuals and intense body load. Many reports also indicate that the effects of this chemical may be overly intense for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics.

The DOC experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of DOC can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of DOC is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, DOC is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming, resulting in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging trippers to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most DOC trips.
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Vasoconstriction** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages but can be particularly uncomfortable.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of DOC is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation and a powerful enhancement of a person’s current mental state.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

DOC presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and unrealistic/ cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT or ayahuasca than that of LSD, 2C-B or 2C-I. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory states*

DOC and other substituted amphetamines produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, DOC is extremely high in imagery embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of DOC are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- Enhancements
- Distortions
- Hallucinations

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational DOC use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because DOC is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried DOC within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly but nothing can be completely guaranteed.

DOC is not physically addictive and many users experience a frequency self-regulating quality to the drug. Tolerance for DOC seems to be very mild and does not build up without repeated use over a short period of time.

**Legal Issues:**

- **Denmark:** DOC is a Schedule I drug.
- **Finland:** Possession, production and sale is illegal.
- **Israel:** Possession, production and sale is illegal.
- **New Zealand:** DOC is a Class C drug.
- **Poland:** DOC is not controlled in Poland and no analog law covers it.
- **Germany:** DOC is listed in Anlage I in Germany, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess without a license
- **Canada:** DOC is Schedule III in Canada, making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess without a license.
- **UK:** DOC is a Class A drug.
- **USA:** DOC is technically not scheduled in the United States, but could be considered an analogue of DOM or DOB and therefore a Schedule I drug.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, I was surprised at the extent to which DOC manifested positive cognitive alterations, hallucinatory states and a style of visual effects which is similar in appearance to mushrooms or 2C-E. The substances ability to maintain a level of stimulation which is not overly forceful makes it extremely useful for both psychonautic exploration and recreational events such as music festivals and raves.
