4-AcO-DiPT, also known as 4-acetoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine or as ipracetin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families related to 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin). It is taken orally.
The drug is thought to likely be a prodrug of 4-HO-DiPT, which acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It produces psychedelic-like effects in animals.
4-AcO-DiPT was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin by 2003. It was encountered as a novel designer drug in 2005.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in a 2003 literature review, the dose range of 4-AcO-DiPT is 6 to 10 mg orally. For comparison, the dose range of 4-HO-DiPT is listed as 15 to 20 mg in the same review.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-AcO-DiPT is thought to be likely to function as prodrug of 4-HO-DiPT, although pharmacokinetic studies are still needed to confirm this. It acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, albeit with greatly reduced potency relative to 4-HO-DiPT. The drug produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents.

## Chemistry

4-AcO-DiPT is a tryptamine and is structurally similar to 4-HO-DiPT, psilocin (4-HO-DMT), and 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin).

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-AcO-DiPT include diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT), 4-HO-DiPT (iprocin), 4-PrO-DiPT, luvesilocin (4-GO-DiPT), 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin), 4-AcO-DET (ethacetin), 4-AcO-DPT (depracetin), and 4-AcO-DALT (dalcetin), among others.

## History

4-AcO-DiPT was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin by 2003. It was encountered as a novel designer drug in 2005.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Denmark

4-AcO-DiPT is added to the list of Schedule B controlled substances.

#### Japan

4-AcO-DiPT is a controlled substance in Japan.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 4-AcO-DiPT as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Mar 1, 2005,  in their regulation SFS 2005:26 listed as 4-acetoxi-N,N-diisopropyltryptamin (4-AcO-DIPT), making it illegal to sell or possess.

#### United States

4-AcO-DiPT is an unscheduled substance in the United States. Due to similarities to other scheduled tryptamines, such as diethyltryptamine and psilocin, possession may be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act in the United States.
