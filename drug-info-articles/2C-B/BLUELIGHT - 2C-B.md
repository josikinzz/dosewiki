**FYI: 2C-B is usually found as the HCl or HBr salt, the HCl salt is about 15% more potent by weight. The HCl salt also dissolves better in water, and is anecdotally reported to be a little less painful to snort, probably due to that superior solubility.**

Did a bit of 2c-b with some aMT & MDMA today. I only recently discovered the bees, and must say..it lived up to the hype. I have tried 2c-e, i, & p and greatly disliked all of them. B has been a gem for me. Very colorful, great euphoria, forgiving & gentle, and I really love how it brings forward body issues. It helped me confront my eating disorder as well as my posture. It just zoned me in on the specific muscles and areas that were suffering from my lack of bad posture and allowed me to really focus on fixing it & standing up straight. 


And the tactile sensations are second only to MDMA, maybe even better in a way. I would love to try sex with the right partner on this one day.

2cb is really a great drug. Had some great times taking it early in the morning and walking around with the boys all day tripping balls. There's no comedown or skag from it. I've taken it at the beach and its been amazing. I've taken it at clubs and its been cool too.

I did 26 mg two days ago right after two tums and I gotta say it was pretty amazing.


My friend did 26 mg like 5 mins before without eating the tums and his comeup was a lot longer and less strong. However he is a bit bigger than me and probably had eaten a little bit more beforehand as well.


My friend had a post-trip headache about 7 hrs in :/  I don't think I got one.


The next day I had quite the afterglow still and when I did 35 mg of MXE and smoked a bunch of weed it hit me WAY harder than expected. Seriously Idk if I've had closed eye visuals on MXE like that before and I've had 60 mg before.


After the comedown it was kind of like I noticed the 2cb afterglow again too mixed with the after effects of mxe. 


2cb is really one of a kind with its cartoony visuals and signature body high and music enhancement yet sociability.

got some pressed 2c-b pills on the way.

They're 9mg each with 4mg of noopept added.


Anyone want to theorize on any sort of potential synergy between the two? I didn't get to ask the guy exactly why he added the noopept and probably won't be able to.

The noopept might make it easier to think a bit and prevent you from doing stupid things lol

2c-b is my favorite psychedelic hands down. It's so clean, happy, and gentle. 22mg is a perfect dose for me, although I have taken up to 60mg. I used to just relax in my hot tub and watch the stars ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Any time I describe it I always mention the unique extreme trails and colors. For some reason my head is clear as well. Feel for the most part dead sober, yet I am tripping. I've played wiffleball and dodgeball on it lol. By the time the ball got to the other person, the trail of it was still in the thrower's hand. Very interesting games for sure ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


I would give me left nut to have another stash of it you lucky bastards ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

9mg? That seems like a waste. Why not just make 18mg into one, rather than needing to eat two. Lame

Well no 9mg is better cos then if you need more than 18 you could have 27mg (3x9mg) instead of 36mg (2x18mg)

2c-b is active at 9mg. Especially for someone who has little experience with psychedelics it's a good amount, because they won't really be tripping but they'll feel the effects. I remember reading in pihkal about 2c-b dosages and many found doses under 10mg to be perfect, especially as an aphrodisiac.


I'll be eating at least 2 or 3 of them though personally.

I recently did roughly 15-20mg of 2c-b hcl orally and was slightly underwhelmed, loved the depth perception and sky looking like water though.


will try 25-30mg shortly and report back.

Yeah i prefer making my capsules smaller if I am going to a festival or something of that such... an event where I'll be with a good amount of people. With B I'll usually make them all around 10... That way people can eat 2, 3, or 4 of em depending on how hard they wanna trip. Its not really a big deal eating 2 capsules. Hell there's a ton of acid out there where you gotta eat more than 1 hit. I don't ever complain about that... unless the price is bogus.


With other things like 2ci, 2ce or foxy I usually makes those smaller. Between 6-8mg. A lot easier to dose out. 


I usually use 2cs as experience enhancers... so I don't like to take strong doses of em. I'd rather take a big handful of shrooms to enter a deep psychedelic state. Or smoke some dmt while deep in an acid trip.


2cs can work with introspection, but I still find lower doses to be better. I always get too much sensory distortion when I eat too many mgs.

got a new love for this drug. had only really sniffed around 20mg before, found it rather underwhelming. good visuals, but not much euphoria or head tripping. 


well, last night went out raving, and took a what i thought to be 20mg bomb about 2-3hours after a good xtc pill. think it was a bit more than 20, maybe 30-35, need new more accurate scales. so, somewhat apprehensive as it often makes me throw up - luckily i wasn't - dropped a bomb. come up was nice, visuals, euphoria, all good. but then it got really intense, i could "see" the music, mad, mad visuals. and mad headspace. was tripping thinking about things from my childhood just massively introspective, in this club, and sat watching people dance, it didn't ruin the night as i was having a great time, but i couldn't dance as i couldn't really tell people apart, couldn't roll a cigarette partly because i couldn't see it, and partly because i didn't have much understanding of what a cigarette was, how to roll one etc, trying to remember but just being confused as to what i was doing and what other people were sucking in. 


all in all tho, was a great experience, want to try higher doses at home, a setting more suited to that, and the xtc combo at a club again, but with a much lower dose, as less intense visuals, but with the clarity of music, empathy etc, will be great i imagine.

I got the vapor in my lungs and held it for a bit, but all it did was make me need to lay down and not feel too great for about 10 minutes I suppose there is a chance it burned into other compounds or something. I think you need to freebase it to vaporize it.

i've tried nasal and oral 2cb now and I can say snorting is definitely BETTER then oral, oral has a long and boring come up, snorting it burns like shit for a few minutes but kicks in much faster and feels much more 'stimulantish', i felt very light and excited/happy and very confident talking to peopleafter snorting 10mg, visuals started after about 15 minutes and where very nice, i snorted another 5mg about 1.5 hours later and it seemed to prolong the experience for about 6 hours total. The body load was fine and felt very good,i went for a 1 hour walk, i was a bit fucked up when i was talking to people although i was very confident in doing so, seemed as if they looking at me weird, it could have been me imagining it or them spotting my huge pupils ^_^ and realizing i was fucked.


one thing i experienced was my feet started sweating very badly and constantly while on 2cb, has anyone else experienced this ?

i guess you're right, it just wasn't on the same level as what i described, maybe my tolerance was up, also my scales don't seem to be accurate at all below 100mg, frustrating.

you should be using milligram scales because 10mg scales can be up to 50mg off.

If you're looking for more bang for your buck, insufflated is the way to go. 


However IME it has a lot more negative side effects like body tremors and sweating. I only snorted ~4mg and got mild visuals and body tremors but when I did 26mg oral I had almost no body tremors and a really really nice headspace and visuals

you get what you pay for but a quick search on ebay for "1mg scales" can show a few cheap 20$ ones which are accurate to 5-10mg, if you want true milligram precision you should be prepared to spend at least 300$

i just realized as well that when i was sniffing 2c-b before i was also taking ssri's, not this time round. that probably contributed to why this time round was much more intense. i'm an idiot, lol.

I get the tremors occasionally from oral and insufflated dosing. Plugging it changed everything for me. The come up was heavenly and I didn't have a hint of GI distress.

I took 19mg on full stomach, and peak of effects was at T+5h!

Effects were very weak, but pleasurable, no visuals though.

I'm insensitive to psychs,  but not to the extent when 19mgs feel almost like placebo. So keep this in mind.

With 2C-C as my longtime favorite, I've been really excited to try this one. Finally got my hands on it the other day.


The dose was 21mg.

Felt very stoned, very pleasant, but not quite tripping. Not much to speak of in terms of CEVs. I think the term "intensely relaxing" applies moreso to 2C-B than 2C-C actually. (at least at this lvl in my case).

Made me very untalkative and gave a bit of ADD. I often hear some of the psychedelics described as "clear-headed"; this is not one of them. Overall very stoned feeling.


I was pretty disappointed in the lackluster experience, but not entirely surprised. No unpleasant body effects or anxiety to speak of, so I have no reservations in going higher.

For comparison, it usually takes me 60 - 70mg of 2C-C to get where I like to be. Any ideas as to what dose of 2C-B would give a comparable intensity?

Going for at least 30mg next time, maybe 35, though I don't know when that will be.

if you think that 2c-b gives no cevs and or you are comparing it to 2c-c you must be tripping the cevs on 2c-b are extreme and very fluent


21mg is more than enough for that to be active - if you are talking about 2c-c dosages and or 2c-c in general u are in the wrong thread. if i read right however - it sounds as if someone gave u 2c-c instead of B and or whatever you got is very weak.

I think it was just weak for some reason. I measured the powder out myself. Looked white and flaky like every other 2C I've done.

I was comparing it to 2C-C because that's the most similar thing that I have prior experience with.

Definitely felt different than 2C-C feels though; it wasn't as clear-headed.

There doesn't seem to be a solid consensus on it, but in my experience it's considerably shorter. I've tripped two days in a row before with an increase of only 4-5mg in dose the second day. Though this may be attributed to 2c-b's steep dosage curve as opposed to tolerance.


That being said, there definitely is some sort of tolerance, but it's not as prominent as LSD. One week is often not enough for my LSD tolerance to go down, while it is more than enough for 2c-b.

Got ahold of a good batch of 2cb recently, really enjoyed it @ ~26mg. Very vivid & immersive cevs, nice oev's too, albeit somewhat subtle until later on in the experience.   I'd say it was "more unique" than some other 2c's I've tried over the years. Looking forward to using it at some music events this summer ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've gone up to 30 mg insufflated in an evening, which was very pretty and quite a beautiful experience. Colours are organic and natural seeming; they spiral and circle around the visual field. 


15 mg insufflated last night. An experience on 2c-b has the capacity for easy bonding with people one barely knows. I find myself quite energetic on 2c-b. 


It easily lowers ego placed boundaries and is very good for that I think.


I have taken 2c-b three times in the last month and think I may lay off it for a while as tolerance is building and the high is  slightly detracted from because of not waiting long enough between sessions. 


All in all, a fantastic chemical with great potential for increased human interaction.

so, the other night I did the highest dose of 2cb i've ever done, 38mg about an hour after 40mg of MXE at a concert.


WHAT A NIGHT!


I did 30mg of 2cb with 1mg ativan last time I was at a concert and I gotta say, MXE is definitely better concert material. 


2cb is my favorite concert drug, it gives me a LOT of energy, makes me wanna dance, it makes the bass sensations feel incredible, all in one package, and without a terrible comedown.


I actually really like the comedown of 2cb, it typically gives me little tingly sensations that are kind of like the ones you get from alcohol and blushing. It mixed really well with the afterglow of the MXE.


next time I do 2cb i'm probably gonna do like 45mg just by itself.

It's a good time you will like it. The bodyhigh may not be what you are used to feeling but it'll be nice for you at 20mg. This drug is great. Someone should try 2C-B with 2C-C, it's a great combo.

^ you definitely gotta choose the right occasion for this chem, and the right ROA. 


I like to take an oral dose and then snort a little on the peak after any body discomfort has passed and that pumps up the intensity without adding as many unwanted effects as going from baseline to snorting.


however those are the only two ROAs i've tried im sure there are smoother ones.

just be sure to get the timing right... adding one to the other after the peak will be a waste of material, unless taking much larger doses...

DMT, as well as LSD and a few other psychs, give me closed eye visuals. However they are usually of the "colored bubbles", "music visualizer", "geometric pattern" type. 2C-B with marijuana is the only drug (combo) that reliably gives me CEVs similar to what people report with MDA ("mind movies"). Saw a beautiful waterfall last time.


> 21mg is more than enough for that to be active - if you are talking about 2c-c dosages and or 2c-c in general u are in the wrong thread. if i read right however - it sounds as if someone gave u 2c-c instead of B and or whatever you got is very weak.

I don't have quantitative numbers here so I can't say this happens all the time, but... One of the most common routes to generating the bromine needed for 2C-B results in Br-Cl chlorine contamination. I suspect that in a large number of batches, if they were tested, you would also find 2C-C produced as an inadvertent impurity. It's possible that in some batches there is an inherent level of 2C-C. Of course a shitty synth in general or personal tolerance is far more likely, but I just wanted to throw that out there.


I would also like to reiterate, in light of the post regarding body load, that if you aren't plugging this one - you're doing it wrong. I honestly can't articulate the difference between plugged and insuff./oral ROAs; it is almost like a different drug entirely to me, it is so much more gentle physically.

2C-B is just one of the best psychedelic available at the moment, imho. The positive headspace is really optimal for outdoor day with friends, great for a truly recreational trip. About 2 weeks ago, in the amsterdam gay parade, dropped 25mg, even with such   crazy  atmosphere didnt raise any anxiety or confusing thoughts, simply was non-stop laughting all day. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


An interesting note:  B vitamin complex seems to enhance visuals and mental intensity about 20%, probably should work quiet well with other psychedelics.

I am not doubting you in the least bit but do you happen to have a source on that information, or is it just from personal experience. I completely agree that B is the best psych out there!!!

this drug is definitely not a good one to do alone, or for no reason. i've been dealing with worse depression than usual and drug use hasnt made it any better. 2c-b not only helped me see that but slapped me in the face with it. i can't even imagine what would happen if instead it was something like lsd or 2c-e. psychedelics = nor for me ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

doing psychedelics when depressed is extremely difficult if you are inexperienced. Even with experience, depression can ruin a psychedelic experience. If you are truly depressed and inexperienced, then it is very true that it would not be good to do 2c-b alone. In that situation it should best be taken with someone with experience, and someone whose energy is there to guide you through the experience, someone whose energy seeks to guide your mood to a better place, a person whose goal is to mitigate your depression. 


Other than that. 2cb has completely uplifted me a few times. I recall an experience on acid where I was very bugged out, had deep anxiety, was tripping alone, I couldn't imagine doing a thing, it was typical bad acid trip with plenty of bleak thoughts up in the loop. I snorted some 2cb, and completely flipped the experience. I went from one end of the emotional spectrum to the other, like going from yin to yang immediately. The world brightened up, I begin to see so many possibilities of action. I made music. I recorded and multi-tracked various instruments and voices. The results were wonderful. 


Sometimes psychedelics suck because your mind is so bent on the wrong things. Try meditating. If you can get comfortable with meditation, you may be able to get better results with psychedelics. Or yoga. I think yoga could be useful. If you practice it regularly, and come to a point in a trip where anxiety is high, do some yoga, and it will probably feel really good.


One last thing. I think that it is a matter of believing that you doing something useful. I enjoy dancing on psychedelics. So i like to crank the music. I feel as though it gives me exercise and balance. I like to focus in on the music, listening to the different instruments and voices present. I try to build a rhythm with one part of my body, and then follow the more abstract and changing rhythms with my limbs. If I am far along in certain research, sometimes a psychedelic experience will provide me with new ideas or directions to take my research. The more active you are in day to day life, the better you will feel about the time you devote to psychedelics.


Alright this is the final thing. Not so sure why you are feeling depressed. If psychedelics don't agree with you, you may be better off using alcohol or heroin. Those sorta things usually eliminate the bad feelings... and usually other feelings. But most users agree that there experiences feel good. It feels good to be drunk, and sometimes it makes it easier to have fun. It is a social lubricant of sorts. And it feels good to be on heroin. It makes your body feel warm and all pains go away, You feel complacent and it can make your conversations seem more clear. Of course use them responsibly; being addicted to either would be a horrendous thing and may lead to further reasons for depression. Some users use em to the grave, as their life spirals into what seems like shittier and shittier instances. I've seen it happen a couple of times.


So take a break. Try to figure out why you are not happy before trying to use psychedelics. And if you do use them try to find meaning in a trip. smoke DMT or 5-meo-dmt. You'll likely break through. Try to analyze the experience and relate it your life. It may show you something. 


That's All.

2c-b is my favorite concert drug for the following reasons,


a. It makes me wanna dance

b. The body high is perfect for live electronic music, especially when feeling sub-bass vibrations reverberate through your body

c. It is a damn good aphrodisiac if I say so myself

d. In certain ways it makes me more social than usual

e. I am relatively lucid for pretty much the whole experience

f. It can give me a LOT of energy which doesn't happen with most psyches, (pretty sure I had the most intense workout of my life dancing at a show on this drug one time)

g. friends of mine have said, 'this is like candy flipping but put into one drug!' and I would have to agree there is a lot of similarities but I find 2c-b's aphrodisiac aspect makes me like it more than candy flipping.


that being said, maybe Choco1ate you should try it at a concert next time or after you get a little more comfortable with it.

Hey guys, I'm hoping you can give me some direction on 2C-B. I've bought 4 capsules at 18-20mg each from a pretty reputable source. Did a good bit of reading up on everything, and for my first time decided to take a bit less than a quarter of one capsule out, and swallow the remaining three quarters, at home. The come-up took a good 90 minutes, a tiny bit of nausea but it wasn't a problem. At the peak I had some interesting open eye visuals, but it really felt like something was missing, it wasn't a very full experience, and it felt as if taking a larger dose next time wouldn't actually make it any better. I took the remaining quarter and that may have extended the experience by an hour or so.


6 days later I took a full capsule, and the experience was largely the same (should I have waited a bit longer?). The nausea was increased quite a lot, but still very tolerable, the visuals stayed the same, it still felt quite empty. This time it took a good hour and 45 minutes to reach the peak, and then soon after that it felt like it was wearing off already, like it was over before it had really started.


I've read a lot about the body high, and it wasn't at all what I expected. Instead of some sort of energy or vibrations, I just felt physically very tired. Just like when you take a large dose of MDMA and it knocks you off your feet. When I was at the peak my muscles felt very tired unless I was completely relaxing them. The only really comfortable position was totally lying down, and that felt very nice. But that felt like a waste, I wanted to be experiencing the drug to its fullest. I had wanted to take this drug in a club environment after a few trial runs, but I really don't think it would suit it for me.


I've got two capsules left, and I'm not sure what to do with them. I'm not sure whether to take one and a half and see what happens, or maybe just take both? I'm aware that the experience can rapidly shift from as little as 5mg, so I don't want to go from ~20mg to ~40mg and be completely blown out my own arse. The only other psychedelics I've taken are weed, ket and salvia. 


All advice, input, questions and comments are greatly welcomed. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

0x00: 25mg seems to be the sweet spot for getting to that next level. I would say stay at around 25-30mg. Over 30 maybe a little intense, and 40 should surely be intense. I have a friend who ate 40 at a fest, and the come up was very hellacious for him. He was sweating profusely and had lots of nausea. All that calmed down for him in about 2 hours, and he was fine to dance the rest of the night...


The highest I've gone is 33mg, and it was really nice. Very visual, very warm, very euphoric, the come down left me wanting more. So I ended up snorting about 20 mg about 6 hours after ingestion. Ate some shrooms too. I was just being stupid. THe actual 33mg was probably enough, the night just sorta played out differently.


Good luck man. In terms of limited supply, I would probably just wait a couple weeks and eat a capsule with a friend. If you are looking for something more intense I'd say eat 30mg, and save the 10mg to snort at some point. It will burn, but both experiences should be fairly intense.

Dear 2c-b,


Why do you continue to elude me? I just want to have the chance to meet you and hopefully become friends. I hear from others that we would get along famously. Don't be shy, I'll be waiting for you.


Love,

Stoned Immaculate

had it for the first time a few days ago. two of us tried 23mg. took a long time to come up almost 2 hours and the effects were very mild. mellow OEV but really fun CEVs. maybe will be trying a higher dose next time. 25-30mg perhaps.

**2-cb dose for sexy times?**


Good morning progressive beings


Could you advise me on your suitable dose of 2cb for a gentle aphrodisiac property? I'm not really one of these who wants to go talking all night and dancing in his undies int back garden, but I would like a little naughty time with the missus in a not-too-much-of-a-headfuck kinda scenario. Just something, "ooh, this is cosy and sexy, let's have a cuddle" type stuff ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I've heard about 8mg will suffice. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'd start with a very low dose and get in as much sexy time in the early hours of the trip - once you enter the psychedelic maelstrom it's sometimes hard to get any life from the bishop.

Agreed. A low dose is very effective for this kind of thing. Even so low that psychedelic effects are minimal. However, the subtle increase in general sensuality is still a very effective enhancement to lovemaking. Some folk have mentioned concerns that too regular use for aphrodisiac purposes can sometimes diminish their attraction to sober sexual activity although I have not found this the case. I used 2cb in this context maybe 3 or 4 times this year and have also tried 2ce/DOM for this purpose. Again, low end doses.


My Mrs does not indulge but the contact-high effect seems to play a role.

Your mileage may vary. Have fun - Pipp

yes - it really hurts when snorted. It reduces the chances of gastric disturbance though which is a common side effect of 2c-b. The Best route of administration in my opinion is dissolved in a few ml of warm water and administered rectally via a syringe (without the needle of course). This ROA has all the benefits of snorting without the pain.

^ I have never plugged anything but I would take this person's advice. 2C-B is probably the most painful substance I've snorted, and I am typically someone who enjoys snorting drugs. My preferred route is oral with this stuff, but yeah, the effects on the stomach... 


Personally I don't find that at all off putting either but some people can't stand it.

Less is definitely more here. Personally I would go for 7-9mg plugged/snorted, 10-12 oral.

The problem with oral 2c-b as a sex aid is that running to the toilet 2 or 3 times with semi-diarrhoea is decidedly unsexy. However, putting it up your arse can be considered part of foreplay if you are a bit kinky ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

12-16mg should be perfect. I prefer 16, because it become a bit more psychedelic at that dose. 12mg if you just wanna feel a little bit high.


If you are gonna snort this, 10-12mg is too much sorted. You'll be tripping good. With 2cb, I find that snorting it increased potency by 2 to 2.5 times. If I were to snort, it would be in increments of 2mg. I'd probably weigh 8-10mg and then divide it into small piles (like 4-8 piles maybe). I don't know, depends how I'm feeling in the situation. Then do one pile every 5 minutes or so until I reach the desired effect. Maybe do the first couple piles quicker than the rest, maybe allow 10 minutes in between each snort after the first couple. Trade off nostrils, it will reduce the burn.


Good luck man. Hope you enjoy some sexy time with the missus. I sure do enjoy making love on 2cb. Sometimes it is easier if she isn't tripping. When we trip together though it seems more casual, we'll usually eat some dose too potent, and then fuck on and off as we feel like it, which is nice.

For his bachelor party, my husband had me pack him and his friends 7 mgs each with 75-100 mgs of 4-fa...apparently very fun. Not "sexy times" exactly, but they were still able to interact with the strippers and appreciate boobies without the boobies turning into monsters. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I think 15mg orally or 10mg sniffed, sniffing will hurt if you've never sniffed anything before though.

dudes. when you said this shit hurt when snorted, you werent kidding around.


ive tried insufflating before, but with less than 5mg at a time, and probably my technique wasnt too good. fast forward to last night, sniffed 15mg in one go, i felt like a horse had kicked in my sinuses.

curiously, pain went away after 10-15mins, and the remainder of the trip was awesome. can almost say it was worth it... but really, i need to look into plugging as the pain man, the pain!

hey, not sure if i have much to add here but i have extensive experience with 2c-b, having dosed maybe 40-60 times in the period of 6 months. i definitely have (permanent?) background visuals in the dark, but besides that, i got out of that period of abuse pretty psychologically intact. never snorted it, wouldnt know about the burn, but ive snorted a salt bunk pill before so i couldnt be worse then that

I really don't get any noticeable bodyload from 2c-b. A little stomach uneasiness on the comeup, but I'd say even that falls short of nausea. The alkylated 2c's seem to be a little rougher on me though. 


Like mentioned above this has also really become a concert favorite of mine. Usually between 27-33mg is a really ..solid trip. Thinking about either bumping it up to the 35-40mg range and/or combining it with some 2c-c in the not too distant future. What type of doses have you all used when combining with the chloro? I'm a bit of a 2c-c hardhead,usually takes me 55-65mg to really trip proper, though 45mg+ is still enjoyable. Much below that & its kind of an irritating threshold effect.

why does it seem that 2c-b has a very erratic range of effects for me and my partner? 23mg, 20mg, and 25mg all very different. my most visual of the three was at 20mg. 25mg was more just getting lost and not very visual. 23mg was very mild. all of them lasted really short maybe 2-3 hours. this was taken orally. any comments?

I plugged 20mg of 2c-b and jesus christ, that was the most visuals I've had in a WHILE!


complete immersion in psychedelia with a very minor bodyload. I would agree that plugging is the best ROA.

If you really think about it, the same thing happens with all psychedelic drugs. The same dose of LSD, taken in the same place at two different times can produce very different effects. I'm not sure that there is any explanation for this phenomenon, except insofar as that who you are today is not who you were yesterday or who you're going to be tomorrow.


On a slightly different note, I have noticed that individual responses to a given dose of 2C-B seem to differ much more widely between people than other psychedelics. For example, I am more than satisfied with ~18mg most times, but one of my friends needs ~40mg to feel much of anything.

Extensive experience with 2c-c, and I'd say it, followed closely by 2c-d, is the grandaddy of erratic and unpredictable phenethylamines . 2c-c from various sources is notoriously impure (un chlorinated, poly chlorinated, etc) but even stuff from a verified, tested batch is really hit and miss. Absorption? Dunno. But my IM or IV experiments were always spot on. 


An interesting effect I noted after a decade or so of playing with 2C-B once or twice a year was a slow decline in the bang pow fireworks of the somatic effects, ie the visuals. Even after not taking it for several years the visuals never came back to that glorious first few times. My first time, a momentous occasion for reasons I can't share, was one of the most visual experiences I've ever had. Blew away 2C-E, on par, almost, with smoked n,n, DMT. Wow! Still, a fun, easy, and just simple recreational drug. It will throw you a curveball every now and then and sneak upon ya with some bonafide psychedelia ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

20mgs oral is generally a medium-strong dose of 2c-b. If you are insuflating it, opt for like 10mgs. I have a friend who is an advanced researcher and sniffed 20mgs in a car on the highway and he had a psychedelic freakout thinking he was a lizard creature and the rest of us in the car were going to incinerate his body because he was old and he tried jumping out of the car several times after accusing people of being magicians...this was fucking scary. 


A thing that I've noticed too is some people don't respond to 2c-b in any amount, these people also seem to be insensitive to MDMA. I wonder if it's because 2c-b primarily agonises the 5ht2**c** receptor. 


I also gave 25mgs to a couple of friends of mine at a citizenship party and it was the second psychedelic they've ever done (DMT was their first) and they reported having a fabulous time. 


2c-b really helps me deal with embodiment issues I get after I've been traveling hyperspace and then get all depressed about being a person in a body...hehe.

2c-b is the ideal concert drug imo. It's trippy, but almost never distractingly so, and though I've heard people say otherwise, you can get a nice, quasi-mdma rush with it, especially if there's lots of dancing and lights and loud music.

^Much more so with 2C-B than with other, traditional psychedelics. I still get quite a rise out of 300 mcg of LSD 20 years and hundreds of trips later, as well as things like mescaline, an other 2C's. Dunno why. Not like I hit it harder than the rest of em. Quite likely less.

Finally said "wtf" a couple of hours ago and sniffed 12mg for the first time. Can't say I'll be doing that again; just to painful for me.

That is interesting because I got the heaviest bodyload and nausea with 20mg orally. The trip was fantastic but the comeup rougher than 3,5g of Mushrooms which is why I didn't take my remaining dose for about a year :/

Snorting and plugging are unfortunately not an option.


I haven't tried any other 2c-x so I cannot compare but it would be nice to know why the side effects affect people so differently.

I would like to add to this discussion:  I used 2C-B many times in the 1990s.  At the time I was rather prone to bad trips, and I never had a single one of those on 2C-B.  Mushrooms and LSD sent me into raging anxiety more often than not in those days but 2C-B, not even once.

Probably one of the best psychedelics besides LSD. Except first experience with it was a nasal does of .1 that still had residual acetic acid in it and after my face stopped feeling like it was melting off my vision became 2d but had a constant cycling of random colors. But then I started feeling like every one in the room was laughing at me and then at one point it seemed like people where vibrating and talking gibberish and and then jumping to different places in the room instantaneously. Then I pretty much blacked out came back to I was at home and the visual effect reminded me of peaking on a couple hits of acid. Moral of the story never believe your friends when you ask them if that's a lot.

My 2 friends just took a tiny tiny tiny (prob abt 10mg) of 2c-b...that was about 6 hours ago. They're still not completely down, and it was the strongest thing either of them had ever taken. One of them said it was the greatest thing ever, the other said it was very very powerful (not necessarily good, just so intense). 


I suspect it was actually acid they took. They were extremely off their heads. Any thoughts.

I assume that the no 'what drug did I take' threads rule also applies to "what drug did my friends take" threads too.


Anyway, if your friends had taken 10mg of acid six hours ago, they would not be in a place to tell you how intense it was.

**best methods for consumption of 2c-b?**


I've wondering what the easiest and most effective way for a first time user to consume 2c-b is?


I thought perhaps putting dosages of around 15mg in empty capsules could be a good way of going about things, but would the amount of empty space in the capsule cause trouble?

and if so, would it be a good idea to fill that empty space with something like 5-htp, or some kind of vitamin supplement?


Dividing up such small portions can be difficult and different methods on consumption can effect the intensity and pleasure of the experiance


thanks

Any way if ingesting it orally will be sufficient. The method you stated is fine, no need to fill the capsule with anything else, the air in the capsule won't affect anything. I usually just put it on my tongue and down it with a drink, be warned it doesn't taste all that great though.

It doesn't matter. Stick it in a cap, stick it in a drink, whatever. The only thing that would really have an effect on absorption would be if you had just eaten a good sized meal.

No don't fill the cap with anything extra, it will be fine on its own.


Wrapping it up in a rolling or joint paper would help it break open quicker in your stomach though.

It is a really forgiving psychedelic in my opinion. I only began dabbling with 2C-B recently but have had a fair few trips on the stuff as I really enjoyed it. On one of the nights I was getting a real rushing come up, feeling fantastic and really euphoric and redosed a good 4-5 times as my friends were discussing visuals and I had none. 


Well eventually those visuals came, one of the most intense visual experiences I've ever had and I was only recently after a few shitty personal things so if it was something else like acid I wouldn't have felt in the mindset for it. But 2C-B was extremely forgiving, I went to a rave and although I had no clue what was happening the experience was almost out of body like, but not quite, if I just stood and closed my eyes and enjoyed the most amazing CEVs. The experience lasted ages and I was lucky the rave went on till the morning as I doubt I was safe enough to even cross a road. But the entire time I was still enjoying myself and giggling away.


Only issue with 2C-B, but it's been a while since I've had another psychedelic is that I struggle to have a good deep conversation on it unless it's a close mate. Although I'm up for chatting I just seem to be a bit more at loss for words or something. Bit annoying as I like to socialise and not just sit in the corner with nothing to say. I've noticed it happening to me with psychedelics when I first started taking them, but didn't really get it anymore with the likes of acid.


Really, really giggly chemical too I find and the colours are amazing. Shades of colour dancing around my room, rooms appearing as if they have orange/blue/purple/changing ambient lighting. Real amazing comeup and when you get to the visuals they are lovely.

I've done 2CB a handful of times. It happens to be the 2C I enjoy the most. I've had one bad time on it. I was 4 hours into a 3.8g closed cap amazon cubensis trip. I was walking in a field with 3 other people whom were also tripping. I asked if anyone wanted to try mixing 2CB and mushrooms tonight? 2 others were willing to join. So I decap a 28mg +/-2mg into a little pile and split it 3 ways. We all took our lines and within a few mins my vision is taken over. I keep repeating myself and felt like I was stuck in a loop. It was 5 hours later I started to come back down.

Hi,

I did 2c-b yesterday for the first time, it was my first psychedelic. Pretty interesting experience. The only turnoff was the nausea and the uncontrollable shaking in my legs.

How would it compare to a low dose of lsd, is it more intense?

It's going to vary from each person to person dramatically, if you can handle 2cb you will probably be ok on low dose acid.


I had 60mg of 2CE after a weeks break and I had mad vomiting and leg tremors that didn't stop but I got through it and it was a most rewarding trip.


Just always be vigilant for any unwanted side effects in your behaviour when using psychedelics.

Hey guys, thought I would add my thoughts on adding stuff to the cap;


I know several posters have said don't add anything.


But my tip is this: add a small bit of olive oil to the cap, just a tiny bit. It does wonders for absorption when swallowed. I feel it makes it a lot better over-all. 

peace.

Thanks for the tip zzz. I tried it for the second time last night. Really nice, not the most sociable drug as I was pretty argumentative and forceful with my opinions (not like me normally). Also I did not get very strong visuals, took the same dose as a buddy of mine who was getting mad visuals...so I redosed (snorted this time...hurt like hell) same amount and still just colours seemed blurry and streaky. 


I was having a great time and laughing like crazy though, and the body high was comparable to good MD at some points. Definitely will try again and looking very forward to some day doing shrooms and 2c-e if I can get it. One issue with this drug is that in the middle of the trip (total 5 hours or so) I kept coming down for periods of 1 to 2 mins, then back up for 10-15 mins. Next time I won't eat for several hours before... or while i'm on it.

No I mean it was a really nice night. I just like to be flying high and not touching down every little while. Really good fun, though. And I heard that unlike MD you can take this stuff several weekends in a row and not feel like complete shit from it.

Out of interest what was your total dosage? I found something similar my first time taking it, though admittedly that was in combination with Methylone so it was hard to say if it was the 2C-B or not - this was with 20mg iirc, or 25mg maybe. I tried it again on its own at 40mg though (33mg oral + 7mg snorted) and found at this level that effect mostly disappeared - there was still some waviness to the experience but I never felt that worrying "shit I'm starting to come down!" sensation.


Upping my dose also massively increased the visuals, 20 or 25mg (whichever it was) just slightly blurred the edges of objects and changed my depth perception a little, and mostly affected me in a physical way. 40mg though was a whole different story, I was seeing rainbow coloured kaleidoscopes bursting forth from the objects around me, everything was so colourful, bright, vibrant.. :D


YMMV though, you should up the dose in smaller increments than I did, as some people don't enjoy higher doses of 2C-B as much as me and some others do.

Someone had graced me with some 2CB a good while back.  (I swear Angels exist) I started with 18 mgs (Hbr) just to test the waters.  I was surprised that it worked as well as it did because I see people talk of 35-45 mgs.  Then I went 22, then 25, then 28. The higher the dose, the more visuals.  Seems the intense part lasts the first 2 hours, then another 2 or 3 of jolly happy tripping.  The first time I tried I remember reading here and other boards that the insightful spiritual part is absent from 2CB.  Just at that moment my head spun in a colorful psychedelic way down a swirling vortex of insight that made me laugh.  It was as if the 2CB was asking "what did I miss that another psychedelic would have given?"  Seemed to have a sense of humor.  It does seem gentler and easier to handle than say a strong dose of mushrooms or LSD.  And I can see a cross between MDMA and real psychedelic effect. Typical phenethylamine persian carpet colorful visuals with neon blue, green, and yellow and purple standing out. 


A few months later a good friend of ours had died.  Since his wake and funeral was in another state some friends and I got together for a memorial.  Sort of like a party he would have liked in dedication to him.  I brought the extra 2CB and gave it out.  The wonderful crazy thing is just thinking about the guy it felt like he was right there enjoying it with us.  Very empathogenic.  A great experience. 


While I do think that 2CB is lighter than a traditional psychedelic, I think it can be insightful and deep at times.  But yes, I would resort to mushrooms if one needs a deep deep spiritual healing.  But don't discount 2CB completely for that.  Any psychedelic can be insightful.

So, when you see people describing LSD/Mescaline/Psilocybin/DMT as their chosen psychedelic because they believe it offers a depth of experience that is competely unique, do you believe that these feelings are indiosyncratic & that with the right dose of the right substance at the right time ANY true psychedelic drug can prove itself equally enlightening? 


I use those examples of classic psychedelic drugs because these are the most likely to have been in widespread use & have been for many years & many serious fans of these drugs dismiss newer psychedelics such as the 4-subs, the 2c series & more recently the NBOMe's as being "depthless".


Is this just a matter of preference, of familiarity, or do the "classic" psychedelics really deliver a more profound, deeper & more valuable experience?

Did anyone here in the UK here about this?


[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2261285/2CB-Three-men-arrested-man-critically-ill-students-hospitalised-following-internet-drug-overdose.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2261285/2CB-Three-men-arrested-man-critically-ill-students-hospitalised-following-internet-drug-overdose.html)


Whats the chances that they really took 2c-b and only 2cb alone?


I really don't understand this, first they say it was bought on the internet, then they say 3 men have been arrested on suspicion of supplying the drugs:/


Maybe it couldve been an Nbome?

Police wouldn't have test results so fast so they either were told it was 2CB or found a label.


I suspect those arrested bought it and passed it to the boys who did no research or eyeballed doses and consequently all panicked.


Alternatively it could have been bulked 2C-B-NBOMe and sold as 2C-B to the boys who are normally well informed and expected the wide safety margin of 2C-B

That's a good question that others can chime in on.  For me I already had a preconceived notion that 2CB is not a deep psychedelic.  It seems to get deeper the more trips I take with it. And despite having bit hit hard a few times with some deep meaning I still feel it is a very gentle psychedelic.

Yeah, it comes in waves, and you get brief moments of lucid sobriety only to slip back into tripping without realising as such. It's something that could imagine be potentially quite handy if your trip starts to turn bad, giving you a couple of minutes to clear your head and assure yourself nothing bad can pysically happen or go outside if your in a club or whatever. The counter to that is when your just beginning to enjoy yourself/star reflecting you get yanked out of it.

At a dosage of around 10mg (a light and arguably sub-psychedelic dose), I found myself feeling incredibly stimulated. The closest comparison I can make would be the MDMA rush but much speedier, at times I felt like I could potentially run great distances and I found myself jumping over and around furniture. Has anybody else experienced similar feelings on this kind of dose? I have not taken 2C-B since but I plan to up my dosage at some point in the future.

Sure there are some places on the internet where you can get it, but mostly people are getting it from dealers. It's huge in the raver-scene. 


2C-C has been made Schedule 1 in the US, so that's probably why you're seeing it less and less. Don't think it's going to disappear entirely, as it's still legal in a lot of other places. Same for pretty much all other interesting 2Cs

Yeah. It's stimulating but not in a stimulant kind of way. The stimulation is more mental than physical.

Does anyone else get significant light-headedness when coming up on 2C-B? Every time I have taken it (orally, dissolved in water), I have become quite light-headed, almost to the point where I fear standing, from about 25-40 minutes after dosing. It's not unbearable or anything, but an effect that I don't recall reading about. After that I have always been completely fine, but I wonder if this is a typical reaction. This does not happen to me on any other 2C-X that I've tried (C,E,I).

Woah was reading the pihkal entry on 2c-b and noticed this


"There are people who choose not to go into the corporeal but, rather, prefer the out-of-body experience. They express discomfort with 2C-B, and seem to lean more to the Ketamine form of altered state, one which dissociates body from mind." 


That blew my mind with how personally spot on Shulgin was, for me at least and how people can react so similarly to something like a pyschedelic. I find the body "high" of 2c-b immensely uncomfortable and is my main (although not only) cristism of the compound. The second part was erie, I love the two dissociatives I've tried, nos and k far more than anyone I know... Was impressed that shulgin predicted my drug preferences before I was even born :D

I always think that the trip doesn't end until you sleep. If I were you I would wind yourself down, perhaps with a nice bath or even chemical assistance if you're desperate and then try and have a sleep. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

How good / safe a combo is 2C-B and methoxetamine? I've tried 2C-B and ketamine a few times but due to it's lower cost and dose, and longer duration, mxe is a better value drug for me to stock right now. Just wondering if anyone had any experience with this combo, I find ketamine can really potentiate 2C-B for a little while, but am a bit worried of the longer duration of mxe dragging on a little bit too long, and whether I'd have to take the mxe much earlier in the trip to overcome the longer come-up. I could only find one trip report on BL of the combo and they reported a weird body-load which I find strange since ket on 2C-B feels fantastic!

Never combined the two, but it should work fine, alexander shulgin recommended doing them the other way around mdma, then 2c-b once you reach bassline to reflect on your mdma experience.

I'm a big fan of a 12.5mg dose of 2c-b. It's a happy, sub-psychedelic boost to the day.

I have a similar preference to 2c-b as I do to breasts. I like small breasts. I also like big breasts. These two preferences are separate but complimentary.

Right so last night I was on 35mg 2cb (oral). I was a bit dissapointed with it's effects, maybe it's the over-hype about the drug. I had a +++ experience, visuall it was pretty nice, everything was breathing intensenly with patterns on it and trails after breathing objects was filled with three colors for me, the standard RBG(RedBlueGreen) as if it was a bit computerized. Bodyload was a bit annoying the first hour, I felt very weak so I munched alot of Pringles, it sure did help. But it was if something was missing all the time, so after 2hours I smoked some weed to it, sure it boosted and a bit mindfuck came into the roll so it got funnier but after 1hour it went off slowly, so all around 3h effects from it. Short acting sure it is, I didnt really feel the love in it just yet. I got 100mg left, I will try and use some out in the nature once it blooms up here(sweden) and enjoy the beautiful nature with it.

I've never had much like with 2c-b I think it's a very sub-par psychedelic that has that implacable something missing at any dose, so I wouldn't recommend dosing higher in search of it. Although I didn't go over 25mg though because that had me puking my guts up and feeling uncomfortable for about 2-3 hours. I found nothing beyond 20mg adds any nice aspects just increases body load and nausea and that about 18mg is perfect with minimum uncomfort for something that can actually be described as a psychedelic high. I think the only way to enjoy it is with copious amounts of cannabis at ~20mg any added psychedelic effects you want can be gotten through smoking weed just as much as they can by upping the dose. Obviously adjust accordingly for whatever your natural tolerance is as mine seems quite low.

I agree with you there Okami, it just doesn't go the whole nine yards.

It's a lovely, gentle mixer, great for parties or socialising, but if I want to make tripping an activity in itself then I would choose something else.

Yup. I don't think it does a great job as a psychedelic either. 25c-NBOMe fulfils the same role (happy, skippy, easygoing trip) but does it better.


As an entactogen though, I prefer it to MDMA.

Right so I'm not alone feeling the way I do. I found my dosage a bit underwhelming, for what I wanted. So next time i'll try to bump the dosage up to 40-44mg, anyone tried that before? I've read that there's not really a big difference from 35 to 45 really, just in side effects. I had no nausea, no headdache only "low bloodsugar"-body load on 35mg which could of been because I ate it on empty stomach and I am 240pounder who usualy eats 12times/day. This will wait for a month probably, don't want to stress my system. I'll remember to come back and report ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

From what I'm reading 2C-B sounds like a less stimulating 2C-I.  I am interested, how do the halogenated 2C's compare with each other?  I've only done 2C-I and 2C-T-2 and T2 will give me extremely beautiful visuals... rarely (2C-T-2 has a 'pseudohalogen' I think it's called).  2C-I is low on visuals.  Most of the time both of these (2C-I and 2C-T-2) will give me too much of a body load while psychedelically the effects feel threshold.  I mostly only get closed-eye visuals and an empathogenic feel from these. If 2C-C sticks true with it's 25x-NBOME cousin, it will be a much better drug than 2C-I.


So I ask again to make sure it's obvious, how does 2C-B compare with the other halogenated phenethylamines (in particular 2C-I and 2C-T-2)

I would say that it's less stimulating and speedy than 2c-I and more cosy/warm/empathic. 2c-t-2 isn't a halogenated phenethylamine.

I know but it still warrants being included in the discussion because it's a pseudohalogen.

2C-B certainly sounds good... Low dose 2C-I just makes me feel spaced out, but low dose 2C-B is mentioned pretty often.  How is the comparison on a high dose?  A high dose of 2C-I makes me feel very dreamy, not completely 'there', with lots of closed eye visuals and a body load thats too stimulating (or otherwise I would push the dose further because the effects are very unique, the only dissociating phen I've ever used)

That's what it felt like once when I took a highish dose of 2C-B, on MDMA. I was pretty damn dissociated but in a happy space. Very dreamlike, I lost track of time.

:D Good point. Goes for most psychedelics by the way.


I don't really get why 2c-b has only one and a half Big & Dandy threads, while all these silly NBOMes have so many. 


To me 2c-b is the perfect introductory psychedelic. It's my favorite party drug - a little trippiness, a bit of empathy, some energy and best of all: it doesn't last too long. I mean, I love doing acid on parties, but it's the residual stimulation that I sincerely dislike and which is the reason I don't take it so often anymore. Nowadays, on a good night, I really want to go bed on 7am. I'm not one for afterparties, because I truly love sleeping and feeling well slept. LSD doesn't work at all in that regard, and 2c-b is like acid light, both in terms of intensity (although that is of course relative to so many other variables) and in terms of duration. 


2C-B's a real classic in my book, a close 2nd grade after the proper classical hallucinogens (LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, ayahuasca and DMT... something like that). 


Also, I agree that 2c-b is not the right substance if you want a real trip. It just doesn't reach the same depths the classics do. Not by a long shot even. But despite - or because of it - it's excellent for a whole range of other settings and circumstances. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I wanted to check in on this thread and see if anyone else doesn't like 2c-b (reading above I see I'm not alone).  I had a quantity of it and took it in ranges from 10mg up to 30mg and accidently took something above 30mg one night (not sure how much, I put my solution in a plastic dish to draw my dose up into an oral syringe, dosed 30mg, and then rinsed and drank the residue from the dish after I poured the liquid back into my bottle).  I had drank a few beers that night and later on smoked some weed.  I had a pretty good night but it wasn't fantastic or anything.


In general I found the material would cause my eyes to strain, give me a headache (both this and the eye strain into the next day), leave me feeling very nauseous, and produce fantastic visuals that I couldn't really enjoy.  I found the headspace on it to be very serious and generally not fun.  (On LSD I could lay on the floor and really enjoy the visuals with 2c-b it felt like a waste of time, like I should be doing something important like watching a mindless movie...)


I found 2c-e to be a lot more rewarding, easier on my body, with similar if not superior visuals.  Granted I've never mixed 2c-b with MDMA and I regret that I didn't before I got rid of my material (as little as I enjoyed it I found myself abusing it anyway with lots of redosing so I gave it away).


I know a lot of people really like it and I was somewhat disappointed that I didn't get more out of it.


*edit*  Also I tended to be a jerk on it.  Really tuned in and aware of other people's emotions but no compassion for their headspace.  I tended to call my wife out and try to drag things out of her instead of allowing her her feelings.  It just wasn't a good material for me.

It was pretty cool at 23mg HBr, but I think I'll have to go with 27-30mg next time.


Are the CEVs usually so low and dull? There werent really any colors, just light/dark patterning, and not enough contrast.

I notice a goodly number of folks saying that 2C-B has 'something missing', or isn't 'fully psychedelic'. I have to strongly disagree, with the caveat that everybody's mileage does vary, and besides that those are no less valid of opinions than my own. I would chime in though with the comment that I feel 2C-B is very highly dependent on set and setting as far as its potential for any insight or personal realization/growth. 


I definitely have taken it in social situations where it has been more of a party atmosphere than a group trip with an emphasis or focus on the potential for mind expansion. In that situation it is indeed not very psychedelic, in the sense of LSD or DMT or even some of the other PEAs, like 2C-E. it was more recreational and empath/entactogenic in that setting. 


But I have also had a number of solo trips where I have gone into the experience with the intent of having classically psychedelic experience, and the result several times has been deep personal and spiritual experiences with lasting impact on my lifestyle and behavior. 


My opinion here is that 2C-B *will not* under *any* circumstances push you into an insightful experience. I think the key to having meaningful experiences is that 2C-B opens the door, but all the work is up to you to make use of that opportunity. I should add that recreational tripping can definitely also be meaningful, but in a different way, usually in strengthening social bonds, rather than by creating insightful experiences. But back on the topic of personal growth via a classically psychedelic experience, 2C-B is just too gentle to forcefully create a spiritual experience or personal insight from nothing in the way that other psychedelics, especially tryptamines, are known for. 


This is not to say that somebody who finds 2C-B lacking is wrong, or that they simply didn't try hard enough to gain something tangible from their experiences. Because I also find 2C-B to be very dependent not only on set, setting, and most of all intent or purpose, but also on whether there is meaningful insight to be had in the first place. And so I have indeed tripped solo on this compound just as I did when I gained very useful things, yet found nothing. My conclusion is that I wasn't in a psychological state where I could be receptive to that open door that 2C-B can provide. Once I reached a point where I felt more ready, more poised on the edge of a useful personal discovery, I repeated the experiment with equal dose, set, and setting, and that time I did once more gain useful things from the trip. 


In short I think that it's always a good idea to give this compound another try, with a strong focus on preparing yourself mentally beforehand in order to be receptive to meaningful experiences, and knowing full well that once 2C-B unlocks that potential for a classic psychedelic realization, it's entirely up to us to do the hard work and put in the effort to then reap that potential reward. Then again it's likely just not some people's cup of tea, and that's cool too, but for me it is an incredibly valuable and special compound!


Best

EDIT: Wow, I had TOTALLY forgot to mention that my experiences with it were insufflation! When I have tried eating it the thing was totally lackluster, too long, generally sucky. But be careful sniffing it, unless its in the HBr salt it will hurt your whole face like nothing you've ever experienced. With the HBr it still stings, but much less.

My friend gave me some of his batch of 2C-B recently, we both took 25mg orally (in caps) and went to a Flying Lotus show. This was my first time trying to chem. I was really let down though, barely felt anything in the way of tripping or rolling. A few tracers and a vague lift in mood. Meanwhile, my friend was tripping away. To be fair, he's smaller than me, but it was still disappointing )8 Ah well. He said we can take more next time! 


If I hardly felt anything off of 25mg, how much should I take to feel some decent effects?

yo flying lotus is fuckin awesome that was probably pretty sick even at a low dose.


snorting even as much as 3-5mg at the peak of an oral dose will add quite a boost in intensity and visual effects.


Last time I took 2c-b, I took 17mg oral, then 75 minutes later I took 125mg MDMA and then maybe 40 minutes after that I snorted three bumps of 2c-b. The bumps may have been anywhere from 11-30mg ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) haha it was dark and I was ready for an intense experience.


about 10 or 15 minutes later I was in a fit of coughing, which led to me throwing up a really small amount but I washed it off directly after with water and rinsed my mouth out.


then I was hit by one of the most intense waves of euphoria i've ever felt in my life. Everything exploded into glowing color, patterns started forming on everything, my framerate of vision seemed to get a LOT faster, and I had a lot of energy to dance. 


My favorite song came on and I went into a trance, two spotlights on the stage turned into the kaleidoscopic eyes of a lion that was staring me in the eyes. The lion had a mane of blue flames dancing to the music and during one of the drops of the song it breathed fire on me and ignited my body with blue flame.


when I went to get a drink of water the whole ground was patterns, peoples eyes looked neon, and I felt like I was floating. 


at some point I looked at someones collared shirt with a pattern of killer whales on it and the little black and white killer whales turned into eyes and incorporated themselves into the patterning across my whole vision.


It was my first trip in like 4 months and my first roll in at least 5 months and my god was it incredible. After I left the show I mainly just smoked and hung out with friends and the body high lasted quite a while. I could feel sound hitting my "solar plexus" for almost the whole experience, which is one of my favorite parts of entactogenesis. Also, I saw one of the most inspiring shows i've seen in a long time and the honey flip added to the experience wonderfully ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) love you all.


one thing to add is that I ate 30 grams of dark chocolate that was 90% cocoa like 5 hours before I dosed and I'm positive it made it stronger. The initial adrenaline rush that hit me was one of the most intense of my whole life and it lasted for most of the show. Chocolate has the precursors to dopamine, adrenaline, AND phenethylamine so it's definitely going to make an experience stronger than if you didn't eat it. Also eating it on the comedown seemed to make it gentler, I didn't feel the serotonin downregulation effects until a week later and they were pretty minimal ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have been doing a lot of research online about anti-depressants and drugs and how they react with 2c-b. Ive found a lot of answers except the one I'm looking for.


I take 60mg a day of Cymbalta (which is a SNRI). I have been on it for a few years for Fibromyalgia, not for depression, but I was looking to see if anyone knew if it would change the effects of 2c-b or molly. I have tried 2c-b twice, the first time was an amazing visual trip along with feeling great. But the second time, I didn't feel much. I'm not sure if I didn't take enough or if it is less affective due to the SNRI. I also tried molly once but didn't notice much. Any answers?? I have also looked up the affects of ssnis and snris on 2c-b and people have said you cant feel the effects of 2c-b on those meds. is this true?

Yes, as far as I'm aware, the SNRI will significantly dull or possibly totally block the effects of 2c-b, other classic psychedelics and serotonin releasers.

It will block most of the effects of MDMA but typically only dulls the effects of psychedelics. It seems like that's what you've experienced.

**2C-B Neurotoxicity**


Hey BlueLight,


I already took a look at The Big & Dandy 2C-B thread. I'd like as much information as possible before I decide whether to try it or not.


I'm wondering if there are other studies which may indicate the neurotoxic potential, or the lack of, of 2C-B. Ideas of 2C-B's potential neurotoxic effects would also be appreciated. Is there also a hangover associated with 2C-B due to a what I would assume as a down-regulation of 5-HT2C receptors?


Thank you.

There is no evidence to suggest that 2C-B is meaningfully neurotoxic, nor any mechanism through which it might be. Most users do not report a hangover. I've stuck this in the B&D thread for you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Tummy discomfort is somewhat 'standard issue' with PEAs....even mescaline has it.  Embrace the discomfort, take it to the next level and see it as a chance to purge and remove 'bad' from your belly and mind.  Some people think body loads are the body telling the mind of its condition...a close friend found a body load on psilocin this weekend (and psilocin is not known for body load) then concluded his diet is killing him, then discovered healthy eating.  I pray he practices his knowledge every day.  Maybe you will find knowledge this way.

He's saying maybe diphenhydramine to combat that body load. Although he's never done it himself. Maybe someone will correct him.


But yes, MGS, I'll try and purge next time or something, although it's less nausea, and its more like a tightness in the gut.

Ehhh the PEAs really all do that to some extent.  I'm telling, the advice...embrace the (fear, stomach ache, body load, etc) all are relevant.  Best way to not let it bother you is to choose to not let it bother you.

i have never had an unpleasant body load from 2C-B, but some trippers i know have. my advice is to eat light and healthy the day of the trip, dont sit in one place for too long and if you start to feel sick maybe pop some dramamine. if this happened to me i would have some dramamine, ibuprofen and valerian root on hand to take the edge off, but 2C-B gives me a kind of rolling body high which i very much enjoy!

Finely sliced fresh ginger tea with fresh lemon juice and zest, and dash of honey if you don't mind sugar sitting on your teeth for the trip.


Delicious, calming and IME great for GI issues. I have also heard good things about diphenhydramine as it's a 5-HT3 antagonist, but never had much luck with it. 


Ondasteron is the obvious one but much harder to get.

Well, this time around some benadryl seemed to alleviate all the body load. It was still just another boring 2C-B 24mg experience though. I think I'm done with this one. I feel like it has to be combined with weed/other psys or something, alone it was just too short and shallow in my opinion.

4-aco-dmt is the best mixer psychedelic in my experience.  Give it a go and give us a trip report!  No honestly 4-aco-dmt wasnt that great to me and the 2C family hasn't been that awesome either, but the thought of combining 4-aco-dmt and 2c-b does make me have a psychedelic wet dream.

Ha, there's a thread all about [2C-B + Tryptamines](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/398833-Combo-Subthread-2C-B-amp-Tryptamines/page3), sounds like the 4-AcO-DMT combo is pretty fun. I'll try it with 4-AcO-MET, closest thing I have.

Jesus guys, sorry for all the bumps.


Anyways, after some deliberation I have decided to take a house trip with a buddy (something I have not done in awhile) and introduce him to 2c-b. Its been close to a decade since I touched the stuff. I am thinking about 20 should be a good starter dose? I am thinking about taking the same dose. I also have 2c-c for a needed boost (along with more 2c-b).


I will have beer and etiz.

I agree on 20mg to start with although it really varies from person to person. When I tripped with 2 friends on that dose, me and one other had a brilliant trip while the third person only experienced slight visuals and an MDMA-like feeling. But he is a general hardhead.


Have a great journey. But I wouldn't drink beer since the nausea and bodyload can be pretty harsh on 2c-b if taken orally or insufflated.


Can someone comment on plugging and if this ROA reduces the side-effects? Thanks ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

20mg sounds like a safe dose for everyone to me, especially since you'll be in a comfortable environment. Unless one of your friends is pretty sensitive to psychedelics in general; I suppose they have experience with other substances? Worst thing that will happen is that you'll get disappointed because of a high (natural) tolerance. My first and only time on 2C-B so far I took 24mg and only got slight visual effects (they were nice though) and the MDMA-like feeling (actually it was better than my few MDMA experiences), as DickTate described. I just have a high tolerance to 2C-x's, I already knew that from my experiences with 2C-E. Didn't get any noticeable nausea or bodyload though, took it orally in pill form (1.5 of them, to be precise).


Never plugged 2C-B, but I've done it with 2C-E and that was a success. The worst thing about it was the fact that I shot 2ml of liquid and some air up my butt (first time plugging), which was kinda uncomfortable, but other than that I really can't complain. Compared to snorting the bodyload was like cuddling a huge stuffed animal. I suppose it's somewhat the same with 2C-B, although I'm not sure if it gets twice as strong. Is it stronger when snorted? If so, it'll probably be stronger when plugged as well, so keep that in mind.

Plugging 2C-B works very well. IME potency is close to doubled and bodyload is decreased.


I *do not* recommend using Benadryl / DPH for body load. That has always led to an alteration of the trip or even dysphoria for me.


And let me throw my hat in the ring and say that I am mostly done with tryptamines, but 4-AcO-DMT and 2C-B is SO MUCH MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. I can't even emphasize how well they go together. I would usually go much heavier on the phen side of the mix, you just want the trypt to bring some spirituality and magic to the combo, not overpower it.

So I did 17.5mg of 2C-B a couple weeks back, smoked some weed during come up and a couple times during the plateau and it was great, but I have more and I'm hoping for a stronger experience next time. I know it has a steep dosage curve, and I'm hoping to do a 20mg dose soon, but from your experiences would 20mg REALLY be that much stronger than 17.5mg? And is there a set and setting that would heighten the experience over chilling in my house just listening to music and shit?


Also, how long do you all recommend waiting between trips?

^ I might push it up to like ~23mg, I dosed that at a festival last time and it was still pretty mild other than an INTENSE peak experience that was like a flashback to an extremely intimate experience I had the weak before. There were sometimes where the head space was a bit confusing and things started to get a bit too much, but other times where it was hardly noticeable and I almost felt sober


2C-B can be a really light background drug, that's why I think it can be such an amazing booster drug to add to other combos

Maybe I'll try to obtain more so I can do 22.5(I'm saying thes XX.5mg doses because I can only get 10mg pills and I have to quarter them to divvy it up any more precisely than 10, 20 30, etc.), I'm also hoping to find some ways to minimize it falling to the background, maybe a music visualizer will hell stimulate the visuals.

Has anyone here ever mixed 5-meo-dmt on 2c-b? I find nn-dmt mixes great with 2c-b but it is a completely different drug than 5meo-dmt.

I've read elsewhere that 2C-E can be absorbed through the skin, is this also true for 2C-B? (assuming it's true for 2C-E in the first place)

Anyone seen/tried small white tablets labelled II oneside CB the other? The Stimulation has been really strong with these - is this the synth or is this another PEA where the bodyload just far far outweights the benefits for me? That was certainly the case with 2CT-7 & 2C-I and at least in the case of the 2C-I am know for a total fact the product was pure. These tablets produce a green reaction on a marquis reagent but that's obviously a limited test.

2C-B is the only 'classic phenethylamine' that doesn't really have a bodyload...well this one and 2C-C.  Everyone is different but easy on the body with a tendency to feel really good is kinda the hallmark of 2C-B.  I think it was called the original psychedelic aphrodisiac long before 'foxy methoxy.'

I've found that it has a body load just most people can manage it very well. Insufflating will definitely increase the nausea though. The first time I threw up on 2c-b was after insufflating a reallly large dose (three unknown sized keybumps in a dark concert as my favorite band was coming on) but it was more of me just coughing up the unpleasant post nasal drip. I threw up a second time because I snorted a ~4mg line in the middle of a quite a few lines of coke.


orally i've never had any problems with body load though, even at 38mg.

Those two definitely carry a body load, but I agree it's significantly less than most 2Cs. I tend to be a bit sensitive to body load, so I understand how those on the other end of the spectrum might find them to be without the load at all, but trust me, it's there.

Well that's what I've always thought but this was really bad - Tried them several times; hardly any effect in terms of psychedelia at all but the body is maxed out totally - really uncomfortable to the point of dysphoric; had to benzo myself down - waited 14 years* to get hold of 2C_B and paid an absolute ridiculus fortune for it; this feels like absolute shit. Really totally fed up : ( Guess I'll never get a go of B


Going to send some off for testing, rest in the bin 


AVOID THESE PILLS


*got hold of a tiny nearly pointless amount in 2000 again at a stupid price; if you include the dealer running away to South Africa with a huge amount of money of mine; 2C-B and bad luck have been totally intertwined for me.

I get no body load from 2CB.  Maybe a half a second of nausea, but that is probably from the acceleration.  2CT-2 and 2CI were harsher in terms of stimulation.  2CC and 2CD had no body load either.


Also at this point I am stunned my last 25 mg 2CB trip was as deep, beautiful, and life affirming as a mushroom trip.  That never happened before. I was in the camp that it was very colorful and trippy with empathogenic effects, but not deep.  It proved me wrong.  It goes to show any psychedelic can be deep at times.

I don't find mushrooms all that life affriming tbh that's why I've wished for 2C-B and the like. Anyway I should probably avoid this thread now - just going to make me depressed.

Ditto on the bodyload with T2 and 2C-I.  Both of those had a great trip headspace wise, but the bodyload with them both was so severe I won't take them anymore.  T2 always gave me an unproductive puke-fest (as opposed to productive purge) and 2C-I was waaay to stimulating.  2C-D has a little bit of what I called 'body kink' in the beginning, but it quickly passes and then it feels WONDERFUL.


Your 2C-B experience sounds like what happened to me.  For years I enjoyed 2C-B but always found it light, mostly recreational...and this was up to 36mg.  Then one day (same batch as I have always used) I took 24mg and was blown away with deeply introspective (trippy) effects, visions (as opposed to visuals), and some incredible empathy ala MDMA with the two friends I was with.  Ever since then, I've held 2C-B in the same regard I do 2C-C and 2C-D....which is that they are good all-purpose psychedelics with the potential for something deep.  Still looking for the purely recreational 2C...I bet 2C-T-21 is the answer....I can't believe I still never tried the stuff.  Spring time is coming isn't it?  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

hmm, IME 2C-B has body load too.  It's not as bad as other phens; I'd liken it to MGS' "body kink" during come-up.  I tend to get that body kink with everything though, even MDMA.


The body load doesn't hold a candle to something like 2C-E though.  I think this will all vary from person to person as 2C-T-2 and 2C-I produce a body kink, but not the unproductibe vomit-fest of 2C-E; which is smooth for many others

I'll maintain a lot of these issues (bodyload, as well as mental effects) in my own case, seem to vary as time goes on.  For instance, the last time I took 2C-E I had 0% bodyload.  Or the time I took 2C-B last year at 24mg and it blew me away, astounded me at how deep it was.  Sometimes I really do think issues of bodyload are often (but not always) psychosomatic.

That's what happened to me.  In fact I almost forgot I took 2CB it was going so deep (same batch, 25 mgs is the highest I have gone).  I was pretty thrilled and it was what I needed.  But my trips before that were always fun and colorful with great music enhancement, but not insights and visions.  It really had me rebooted too, it was what I needed.  I felt great after it and integrated for a few weeks after.  Interesting.  Maybe that's why Shulgin liked it so much.  Maybe there is a wall to get past?


Also spot on with the 2CI stimulation and 2CT-2 stimulation and nausea.  Add an end of the trip diarrhea for 2CT-2.  2CI was so stimulating I had to keep pacing and got a little concerned.  But after that period the trip got very colorful and emotional. (didn't someone just post they always cry on 2CI?  Well I get it.)   But 2CB (for me) had no load and it could be a public, beach, concert psychedelic anytime.


I did try 2CT-21 years ago.  I only had 8 mgs.  I think I posted in the 2CT-21 too right after.  It may have been a light dose, but it felt like a trip without the trip.  It for sure hade some empathogenic qualities, but it didn't excite me and that was all I had.


And I do believe Spring is around the corner MGS. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Although with it being 8 F out right now it doesn't seem like it.  Although late winter trips can be healing too.

I kind of think the same thing..or at least for me and you...certainly everyone in my circle thinks 2C-B is da shizzle and had no wall to climb first.  Everyone always wants to try that one.

Was your nose very numb after the coke? I get nausea when insufflating any of the 2C-x series normally but I think it's because of the foul taste combined with the burn, when I snort a little lidocaine first and have no burn there seems to be little/no bodyload and no nausea. The drip still sucks a little but I found just using a little more lidocaine actually numbed my throat enough that I didn't even notice the drip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I like 2C-B okay but I have never been deep with it at all or experienced it as strongly as I'd like even recreationally.  I suppose next time I try it I should try 40mg or so because 30mg doesn't do a while lot to me.  Actually one time 2C-B helped me get deep, I took it after the peak of some pretty weak acid and laid down to closed eye music... I split into multiple being split from the center point of the top of my head straight down through the rest of my body.  Crazy adventures, it was quite nice though not overwhelmingly strong at all even then.

I never got much enjoyment from 2C-B on its own; the visuals were incredible at 20-25 mg oral doses, laughter was abundant, but I found it gave me significant discomfort in my back and shoulders, and also wasn't very interesting mentally. 


Recently though, I've been enjoying combinations of methylone and 2C-B (both intranasal) and have found the 2C-B to really shine in these cases. I'll only need a single line of 125-175 mg with 8-12 mg 2C-B for the night and there is no compulsion to redose since the two work so magnificently together. It provides a solid 4 hour experience with incredible euphoria, enhanced/brightened colours, minor visual fluctuations, and overall feelings of serenity. 


Side effects are typical of higher doses of methylone; jaw tension, increased body temperature, sweating and dilated pupils (though my pupils don't dilate significantly with methylone alone). I also vomited the first time attempting this combination. I was laying down and didn't quite feel nauseous, more like I had a lot of air in my gut, but I knew I was going to throw up so I stood up to get to the bathroom. As soon as I stood straight up, I threw up into my mouth and the effects hit completely; my whole room was vibrant despite being dimly lit, I felt significantly taller than I am, unrealistically so, I was extremely euphoric, and my mind ran through a multitude of possibilities of what to do with the vomit in my mouth in an instant. I grabbed a cup, threw up my stomach contents, and the rest of the trip was blissful.

The sensation of being taller was coupled with this greatly liberating feeling that I was a strong and independent  human being and fortunate to be in this very contained vessel of a body in a uncontainable world/universe. It was as though I were standing atop a mountain and had just conquered the globe, only more meaningful as I had conquered myself. Very strange sensation that occurred as a very brief cognitive flash.

I fucking LOVE 2C-B, probably the most perfect psychedelic I'll ever have the pleasure of trying. LSD is still the favorite, but I think if I could only have one it would be 2C-B. It's effects are just so diverse, controllable and FUN that I can't imagine it'll ever be topped.


2C-B + MXE = Bliss :D


The only thing is, 2C-B is kind of a background drug. As in, you can ignore it if you really choose. If you just let things flow and don't worry how high you are 9/10 times you'll not have a single worry but if you try and gauge how "fucked up" you are than 2C-B might not be the drug for you. Not alone, at least. It's the perfect combo drug, it's pretty challenging to think of a bad drug to combine with 2C-B IMO

I think I'll be doing some 2C-B with MDMA this weekend. I really enjoyed the 2C-B with methylone combination, so I hope MDMA is equally as enjoyable, though I have long lost the magic with it and found methylone much lighter on the comedown. I would sniff amounts between 150-175 mg methylone with 8-12 mg 2C-B with no redosing and would always have a great night, very little comedown. I'm thinking 80-100 mg with the usual 8-12 mg 2C-B should be enough, I've just yet to decide which end of those ranges I will settle on, though I suspect I'll keep things low to test the waters. 

Has anyone who has 'lost the magic' or no longer really enjoys/benefits from MDMA used it with 2C-B and achieved a glowing experience?

Glad to hear, thanks Folley! I'm pretty excited, I really miss the ineffable experience MDMA provides, something methylone (and even MDMA after some time) couldn't touch upon unless combined with 2C-B. I feel I should add, all experiences with drugs are subjective, and I do not recommend combining these two unless you have accumulated experience with both and know the drug is actually what it's being represented as (ie. invest in reagent tests).

I think I even found 2C-B to combine well with butylone, which I normally don't find that useful at all. It's pretty pushy and stimmy but 2C-B is so smooth that the stimmyness evens out a bit and the push is actually helpful to give the 2C-B some actual direction and momentum because it can be kinda tame otherwise.

But I imagine that combo is not a guaranteed win, it did work out for me that one time tho.


2C-B has made MDMA feel more like one of my first times with MDMA and also given me a general love at first sight sensation which is unspeakably special.


Obviously drugs like GHB, ketamine, weed, nitrous and alcohol can all be very recreational to combine with drugs like 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-I, M1, 4-FA, etc. Of course not all at once! But there are a lot of pleasant combo's to make there.


I don't think I would find 2C-B that awesome with amphetamine however.. hmmm

I tried MDMA with 2C-B last night; 110 mg MDMA crystal was weighed, crushed and put into a line, while 11 mg 2C-B powder (very tiny needle-like crystals) was weighed and split into about 8 separate bumps. I was able to sniff through most of the 2C-B initially, though my nasal passage was not very accepting of the MDMA and I could only make it half-way through the line, taking small sniffs spaced by enough time to allow the pain the dissipate. Once I was half-way through the MDMA the discomfort and the drip of MDMA, which I resent, forced me to call it quits, telling myself I would return to it shortly. 


I then messed up my timing, becoming distracted by a lovely shower with the slightest psychedelic and euphoric push that was completely controllable and comfortable. I then sat around with one of my roommates to chat, play video games and smoke some cannabis. Roughly two hours after I began the combination I returned to my room for unfinished business. Promptly, I hoovered down the remaining powders I had left sitting on my desk.


The effects never quite reached the level of euphoria that bk-MDMA (150-175 mg) and 2C-B (8-12 mg) had, though the level of empathy and peaceful approach towards life was certainly greater. I figure the long time I spent before finished my dose interfered with me attaining the effects I had sought. 


Lastly, NO HANGOVER! I was very impressed by how different I would feel the day after bk-MDMA compared to MDMA, which I had abused and essentially ruined in my younger years. I was even more impressed by the almost entirely absent hangover when bk-MDMA was combined with 2C-B, which I can relate to simply keeping doses low due to the beautiful synergy. And finally, I have found a way to enjoy MDMA again, which I never thought I would be able to do. Ever since my magical honeymoon period with MDMA I would attempt to use it again every 6-12 months, but it consistently gave unappreciatiable effects during the peak, and would absolutely devastate me for the next few days.

I'm thinking of maybe plugging a bit of 2c-b and snorting some k tomorrow night after I get home from taking my programming exam. Usually I prefer having weed with 2c-b but find when it's plugged it's not even necessary although still goes great. I really love how much the effects vary between different forms of administration it takes on a whole new character when plugged.

I don't really enjoy the come up with many psychedelic phenethylamines, including MDMA, so taking them nasally helps reduce that period of time. Also, I've taken bk-MDMA and 2C-B before nasally and wanted to compare the differences between the two combinations, so I kept the ROA consistent, just not the timing unfortunately.

Plugging for me gives a really intense 2 hours or so where all I want to do is have music on and lay down and dissolve. Strong visuals but my eyes are usually closed for them so most of it is the body high. I don't want to do anything or interact with anyone either. It's like a psychedelic nod. Does anyone else experience something similar to that with plugging?

Ah, I see. For me snorting MDMA has just never worked. If it did that is how I would do it since I don't like the come up either. Also it seems like it doesn't last as long nor does it have the magic that swallowing it has when you snort it from what I've read where people "successfully" snorted it.

I might try the MDMA orally next time, since I am not so sure whether I'm effectively absorbing it in my nasal passages or just eating it with my nose - definitely some combination of the two. 

I will stick to using 2C-B nasally as I find a small ~1-2 mg bump every minute or so very manageable on my nose. I've also found the nature of the effects change when used nasally as well; 2C-B gave me a very powerful body load when used orally, and that same energy was present when used nasally although it came in a different form, one which acted as a catalyst in synching my positive state of mind with my body.

You should consider plugging as an ROA, if you haven't already.  IMO, in general phenethylamines are much less "deep" and full of content when I insufflate then.  On the other hand, when I plug them, it uses the same dose, nearly eliminates bodyload and smoothes/hastens the come-up, and most importantly, the depth of the experience is maintained.  It's a vastly superior ROA, for me at least.

I personally find a nasal dose of mdxx to boost and oral dose will do something worthwhile but I'd never take it nasally for my initial dose.


When I get done with semester I'm planning a mda+2c-b+k trip. I'm planning to plug the mda, then start doing the k once it hits me, and either plug or snort the 2c-b. I originally was planning to plug the 2c-b+mda together but I've never plugged any mdxxs I'll just do it on it's own for the start of the trip then decide how much 2c-b I want to add. I'll pre-weigh a few different sized amounts of the 2c-b beforehand to avoid making any errors.

MDMA just doesn't work well nasally for some reason.  that magic and anxiolytic warmth is not present, and its more a of a dirty/speedy feeling and not relaxing the way MDMA should be.  2cb works great snorted though.

I gave MDMA and 2C-B another go last night. 180 mg MDMA swallowed in a gel cap on a slightly empty stomach. After an hour and twenty minutes, after the effects of the MDMA had set in, I insufflated 12 mg 2C-B. The come up was very quick and strong after the onset, and the effects of the MDMA seemed to have fallen into the background. I threw up about 25 minutes after sniffing the 2C-B, and found I had to lay down for a few hours to ride out the peak. 

The combination didn't seem to blend as well together as bk-MDMA and 2C-B still; it didn't synergize into a lovely rolling experience but instead a very visual and euphoric one with mild introspection and depth. I watched some of Neil deGrasse Tyson's show (Cosmos, I think) and could not keep up with the information he was expressing, I was much too distracted by the colourful trails and tracers all over the screen. 

Eventually I turned that off and watched 'Moving Art: Flowers' which was essentially time lapses and artistic videos of flowers set to music, and this really let the effects shine. The MDMA was still far from being at the forefront of my state of mind, making itself present with just a mild euphoria and pretty strong jaw clenching. The 2C-B however made the colours extremely bright and vibrant, the likes of which I had never seen before, yet not much in terms of warping or patterning, which I actually enjoyed since it made the movie much easier to watch. All the while I was having lovely introspective thoughts and feeling completely at peace.

I fell asleep about 7 hours after the initial ingestion of the MDMA, and feel slightly off right now, but that may be more related to only getting 3 or 4 hours sleep. Overall it was a wonderful experience that offered me a great opportunity to reflect on the people and things that are important to me in life, and how wonderful of a life experience I've had with those people and things.

I think people more often describe taking 2C-B later in the roll, but I could be wrong as I have never combined them.  Glad you had a nice time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah I don't like taking them concurrently...they kind of just blur each others best attributes out. I like spacing around 3-4 hours between the two...and MDMA followed by 2C-B and 2C-B followed by MDMA both have their merits. And snorting either really takes the magic out of them in my experience.

Had a couple good 2cb trips now with 3 hardpressed pills (spread 8-12mg) 

Would taking 4 pills be too much? If i had to guess my last trip was 30mg and if i hit the top of the spread with 4 pills it would be 48mg.  

could this be too much? Or should i be good?

No, to the best of our knowledge, 2C-B does not appear to be neurotoxic, but I doubt there have been any real in-depth studies and scientific analysis of this. Looking at the lack of reported adverse effects of 2C-B and others related to it by users, as well the fact that related serotonergic psychedelics (such as LSD), having been studied, do not demonstrate any sign of neurotoxicity, I think we extrapolate from that 2C-B is unlikely to be neurotoxic (at reasonable doses I guess...)

It could be too much, but if you have had substantial experience with high doses before, you may be fine. I'd be hesitant, particularly as you sound unsure of the quanitity of 2C-B per pill- it could be a bit of a shock if one of the tablets is substantially stronger then others. Either way, follow your gut and be safe ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hello! This will be my first post ever, seeing as how i just recently joined. I have been lurking this site for years but i have just recently stumbled across a very good supply of   2c-b and have been experimenting with this chemical for the past 5 months. I've been researching and reading about this extensively on 2c-b which has inspired me to jion.

I'll help to the best of my abilities.


I have used 2cb over the course of consecutive days multiple times.  I have noticed an increase in tolerance but not by much.  You can use it 2 days in a row but you must increase your dosage to achieve the previous level of effect the day before.

As for the coke, i couldnt tell you but i would assume the coke comedown wouldnt help with the already somewhat anxious comeup.  

You'll be fine if you drink a few hours before

I have a new 2C-B story! I've done it probably a dozen times now, with dosages ranging from 15 to 35 mg. It is probably my favorite substance to use in a party setting, though I've found going over 30 mg makes it quite difficult for me to communicate. Well I was at one of your standard psychedelic drug parties with maybe a dozen people who were all on LSD, mushrooms, 2C-B, and/or MDMA last night and decided to go for broke and take 42 mg. I bombed it.


WOW it was a crazy experience! I was on another planet just 30 minutes after dosing, and by 45 minutes or so I was crawling around on the ground barely able to communicate with anyone. It felt a lot like being in a dream. Visuals were totally overwhelming and I frequently found myself completely unable to see the room that I was in. One of my friends kept giving me hits of his dab vaporizer which usually left me totally incapacitated for 10 minutes at a time while I fell into crazy swirling vortices of color.


Besides the visuals being the same as an ordinary dose but much more vivid and stronger, I also experience some severe auditory hallucinations even though I can't recall ever having auditory hallucinations on 2C-B. The pitches of people's voices, music, etc. would rapidly fluctuate up and down, as well as speed up and slow down. Sometimes I would see a friend say something and either hear it before I saw their mouth start moving or hear it delayed. This was really neat and I spent some time making strange noises and listening to how my brain was altering it.


Around the peak, I did get a couple very confusing moments where I suddenly felt stone-cold sober despite the incredible amount of color and sound distortion I was experiencing. It was actually a bit frightening - the first time I've ever felt frightened on 2C-B. These moments passed quickly though, and I'd soon be lost in fractal seas once again.


I did not experience any ego death. Since I was so completely fucked up my friends were taking good care of me and I never got to the point where I felt like I didn't know them or didn't know who I was. I was essentially always aware that I was who I've always been and had just taken a massive amount of drugs.


I didn't keep track of time so I have no idea what time it was when I started behaving coherently or regained the ability to stand again. I'd estimate that it was about 4 hours into the experience when I managed to start having conversations that were more than 2-3 words again. The rest of the night was absolutely fantastic and reminded me of a lower dose 2C-B experience.


Overall I had a ton of fun, it was easily the best trip I've had for about a year. I'd definitely recommend a high dosage experience if you are in a great set and setting and can survive the feeling of being shot out of a cannon. I've felt a bit like an exposed nerve ending today - loud noises and sudden movements are rather unpleasant and so I've been avoiding people all day, but it's nothing worse than an ordinary hangover. 16 mg of 2C-E has left me feeling much worse than this the next day.


Edit: Forgot to mention body load and other physical factors. I've never had any body load or nausea trouble with 2C-B and that continued to be true here. If anything, it feels like a pain killer - I feel like I'm floating, like a ghost. I did feel something intense happening around my crotch on the come up that gave me a strong desire to take off my clothes, but I decided against it (even though I was with a group for whom nudity is no big deal and I frequently end up naked at these types of parties, so it's not like I was feeling any social pressure against it).

I find 2cb to be really interesting. The headspace In combination with the intense visuals that are really unique. They almost look oily, as if the objects in your surroundings are saturated by each other. It's really hard to explain.


My favorite attribute is the time dilation. It seems to make everything move in slow motion!

My friends and me used 2c-b recently. Overall impression is that 18-23 mg is not enough for experienced people (not visual etc), but  is awesome for people who tripped very few times in their lives, if any.

30 is great, through.


For me, as always, even 60 mg is not enough for real fun. Damn my metabolism.

In theory it should have an impact because of tolerance from the 2C-B, as all serotonergic psychedelics have cross-tolerance.

My friends used 2c-b in range of 25 mg HCl recently. This seems full-blown trip, but still not as confusing as tryptamine trip. Contrary to underwhelming 20-23mg trip some of my friends did before, 25 seems to be better spot, leaving one satisfied. Also, some people reported pleasant afterglow and being content with life in the next days, myself included.


Music sounds just too powerful on peak, body twisting and moving according to its tones.

Does anyone else get really intense, borderline painful muscle tension from this chem? 


I tried 30mg and the bodyload hit me hard -- nausea/GI distress on the comeup, which while annoying and unpleasant I can deal with. However, the muscle tension on the comedown was incredibly uncomfortable. Even while lying down, I constantly had to shift myself around because if I was in one position for too long my muscles would become tense to the point of feeling like they were seizing up.

I have before but mainly at pretty high doses(30+)and once in a fairly large combo. The few times it happened I was lucky enough to have O-desmethyltramodol on hand which totally eliminated it.

Yes, i have definitely felt muscle tension. I have noticed though that this particular side effect can vary no matter the dosage.

i found that walking around and keeping generally active will alleviate most/if not all of the tension.

I found 2c-b to be a very odd and unpredictable RC. Unaware of the dosage in the capsule I railed a 3rd of it (Not a good idea) waited an hour then bombed the rest. 


Note I had been smoking grams of deepweb smoke all day with no tolerance and was uncomfortably stoned throughout the experiance.


The come up somehow lasted about 2 hours and the visuals were just plain weird and inconsistent, coming and going or only appearing if I looked at certain people or parts of the room ranging from mild disturbances to full blown ones where everything is distorted


I also had the worst body load I've ever had. Very intense and the sensation of electricity moving round my body.

Same here, when it's good the trip comes out fantastic, giddy, laughy, euphoric.

Sometime's though the body load is uncomfortable and the trip never really goes anywhere.  Each time this has happened to me is because i smoked marijuana with it.

So... last night I took 25mg 2C-B and wasn't feeling much of anything two hours after ingestion. So then we ate 16-17mg 4-HO-MiPT (miprocin) which led to a strong trip. It was hard to tell if they synergized. I want to say yes because I was tripping very hard, intense visuals and that damned muscle tension at the end. But this still doesn't explain why neither me nor my friend felt nothing before taking the miprocin? 

My only other experience with this batch was with 30mg and it was a great trip, strong but manageable. I know the 2Cs have a steep dose-response curve but it seems ridiculous that 5mg would make the different of tripping hard to not tripping at all.

Tried 2cb for the first time on NYE. I didnt know I was taking it.. which i completely blame myself for. I was previously taking mdma and somehow the 2cb got mixed up in the situation. As soon as it kicked in i could tell that it was not mdma. Very much like an LSD high but not as intense. Obviously being given the wrong shit put me into a strange place mentally. I went and sat in my car while people were still partying. I turned the heat and radio on and was bouncing back and forth between positive and negative thoughts. It seem liked every 5 minutes my mind did a 180. The visuals were absolutely insane!!!! I have tripped many of times and have never had visuals like this. Just close your eyes and you see some very interesting stuff. I kept seeing a cheap lil garden windmill for some reason. haha. Not a bad drug. The shitty thing is someone could easily have a bad time on it. Til next time ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I found that plugging diminishes the uncomfortable bodyload of 2c-b. Just lower your dosage respectively.

For me it was ~20mg oral/15mg plugged but I am pretty skinny and react sensitive to psychs and empathogenes.

So I took roughly 30mg 2c-b mixed with mxe the past two weekends. Once indoors by myself, once outdoors with my brother. Two completly different experiences (duh). 


First I started with a 20mg oral dose of mxe to set "trip mode". Two hours later I plugged about 9mg 2c-b. My only note from that night is an hour later and says "horny, thats about it. Notice 2cx sig. 4 sure!"....haha


I remember I had been sitting down trying to meditate and started getting so stimulated I had to get up and start messing around on computer. First non mxe/tryptamine experience in a few years. Somehow I forgot/wasn't prepared for the overly stimulating aspect of it (previous experience with 2c-c, 2c-e, 2c-i, and tma-6... been a while though. Just forgot I guess).


An hour after dosing 2c-b I take 20mg 2c-b and 20mg mxe plugged. Should have double or trippled the mxe. Was trying to lay down and listen to music but was so fucking stimulated. It was intense in a weird way. Headspace was almost normal, but I could see how 2c-b could turn into a serious headfuck. At the peak it's almost like it flipped and was like "this is what I could be, just double your dose and come play with meeeeeeeeee". I dunno if I can take that much stimulation though. Maybe one day ;-).


Hour and a half after redose I orally dosed 50mg mxe in an attempt to level out. Was not digging the stimulion. Was just feeling weird overall. Dunno how to explain it. I guess I had one thing on my mind and the trip ended up being another completely and I couldn't mesh the two. Wanted to plug the mxe, but could barely manage to weigh it and eat and get back in bed with lights out and headphones in. Just felt weird and wasn't likeing it. 


As soon as the mxe kicked in I wanted to take more 2c-b as it was fading and I felt that warm comfy mxe blanket. It was like 5AM and for once I decided to not be a complete idiot and took some etiz and went to sleep.


Fast forward a week and I am at my brothers. We are set to go hiking in the forest nearby. Take about 10mg mxe to set level of sorts Meditate then yoga for 1 1/2 -2 hours. Eat, shower, get everything set to go. Go plug about 18mg 2c-b and 15mg mxe. 


Something to keep in mind is that my brother doesn't know I'm tripping. Well, at least it's not out in the open. I remember at one we looked eachother in the eye and by his reaction I KNOW he saw the size of my pupils. (was wearing sunglasses most of the day otherwise). He knows my drugs history and my love for/use of psychedelics. I have had some seemingly extremely negative consequences due to my psycedelic usage, and ostensibly my family considers me "clean" at this point. I used to smoke weed 24/7 for years and was alwayssss fucked up, so in some regards I am. After all the super fucked shit that has happened due to me taking psychs, the assume that there is just no way I would do them again. (Well, they want to believe that and who am I to ruin their illusion)


Anyway... we drive maybe 10 minutes to the trailhead. Take another 10mg mxe orally. Starting to feel "something" for sure. We pull up and there are a few people there. We get out and immediatly go the opposite direction of the people to get away from them... theme of the day... haha. Hike about an hour or so until we get to the boundary of a state park with a few options on ways to go. We hear people one way, so go down the "closed trail" trail that is overgrown. hahah.


During the one hour initial hike, it seemed to last forever and be over in a minute at the same time. I swear my brother was half tripping because of me. He was doing weird shit and seemed sort of confused. At one point he is like "I think there are people following us". I feel a weird connection to him, and keep thinking of xorkoth saying while doing mxe in groups there is always a group vibe/trip. Except he was sober. 


I've noticed tripping around people sometimes they seem to catch a little bit of my vibe. Was on mushrooms one fourth of july swear during an intense part of the trip I notice my female cousin and aunt just feeling weird as fuck. Like they don't even notice, but I could tell they were like "what the fuck is going on"


I was close to just being like "yo I'm tripping dude, I think it's rubbing off on you". It was kinda too intense at that point though, if he would have freaked out it wouldn't have turned out well I don't think. I remember just backing up a ways from him, doing a white light protection/visualization around both of us. Imagine a connection between both of our hearts, asked for assistance having a beautiful and awesome day, and after that, it was!


It took us like 2 hours to go mayyyybe .5 miles down the overgrown trail. It wasn't really that overgrown, we basically just fucked off and my brother "cleared" it with this machete he just bought. Honestly, it was like we were little kids playing in the woods again. I just felt fucking superb and connected with everything. It was a beautiful, sunny, 65 degree day. For that period it was like we both just zoned out. I just watched him sit there and chop and shit, getting out aggression, frustration, fears, what not. Dunno, it was really weird and awesome. 


Make it to the end of that section of trail... and there were like 50 fucking people walking down a trail in the distance. It felt like I was at the mall outside. It weirded me the fuck out, and my brother wasn't having any of it either. We just turned around and went back the way we came. 


We basically just fucked around in the woods for 6 hours or so. Maybe went 3 miles... lol. It was basically like we were kids just walking around and whatnot. At one point he is trying to clear some trail/make his own... and a fucking family comes waltzing like 50 feet away. We were right next to the actual trail and whatnot just didn't realize it. He is more paranoid than me and is hiding the machete in the leaves and shit. Probably not a half bad idea, we probably looked really weird just sitting there "making a trail" like 50 feet from the actual trail...


I ended up dosing another 10mg 2c-b orally maybe 2 1/2 hours after my intitial dose. Another 20mg mxe orally 45 min-hr after that. The 2c-b was fading faster than I wanted it to, my booster just picked it up where it was at and carried me another few hours. At one point I sat down on the trail and meditated for 5-10 minutes. Was getting some closed eye visuals/scenes. Pretty nifty. 


It seemed like everywhere I stopped and looked, there were little mushrooms growing. Wish I had my camera, wonder what type they were. kinda like a reminder. My first trip in a few years was back in october on some pan cyans I picked in a local field. It's like they were just saying "hey, don't forget about us!"


I kept debating on whether to say to my brother "Hey, we've been having an awesome time huh, well I've been tripping". It's hard to sit there and have a conversation about honesty with him while I'm not being truthful... I dunno. It's not like he would tell me to fuck off and not chill with me, but I dunno if he would go with me tripping. I dunno... it's a conundrum and it will probably bite me in the ass one day (yet again), but whatever.


The difference between this chemical inside/outside are night and day. I think next time I would prefer a 25mg oral dose with a 15mg booster to take 1 1/2 -2 hour after initial dose. It's just too short plugged for a day out hiking or whatnot. I have the HBR not HCl by the way.

When I go to psy trance festivals I'm usually taking psychedelics on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday.


It's usually Acid on the Friday, and then some kind of 2c on the Saturday and Sunday. It's been 2c-b on quite a few occasions.


From memory there is usually little if any 2cb tolerance on the Saturday, but by the Sunday there is usually a little. This probably involved multiple redoses.

I had ~27mg orally and it was an amazing experience, but I found the OEVs to be a bit lacking, similar to ~150ug of LSD. Some rough nausea on the comeup, but no body load at all during the trip. It was fairly short but it was well worth it. 


5 days later I tried ~40mg, the visuals weren't that amazing as I expected them to be, and the euphoria was a bit lacking too, probably due to the tolerance. There was some vomiting on the comeup (on a totally empty stomatch I vomit even on LSD, it sucks) and again, no body load even at 40mg.


So, I'm planning to plug it without a tolerance, maybe 30mg, but that seems bit high. Any advice on the plugging dosage?

I'd say lower it a bit, maybe somewhere around 15-20mg's.

that's pretty much what i experience with 2c-b.  30 mg is the borderline between tripping and not tripping for me.  i have had strong trips at 30 mg, and lackluster ones at the same dose.  25 mg was basically a dud, while 35 mg is almost guaranteed to produce a medium-strong trip for me.

It's quite odd how different the doses are for different people with the 2C-x's, I think I'd say moreso with 2C-B than any others I've encountered. 13mg's was a bare threshold and 18mg's was a medium trip for me. Not sure if I'm oddly sensitive to 2C-B or another factor playing into this.

^ ^ Yes.  2c-b is interesting in this regard. My sweet spot is about 20mg.  I find 25 a bit strong and 15 a bit weak, but fun nonetheless. The odd thing for me is that I don't always get the same response from the same dose. Some trips seem weaker and some produce more uncomfortable body load at the same dose.

i wonder how much of it is due to individual biochemistry, and how much is due to differences in the 2c-b's purity?

It was hard to tell if they synergized. I want to say yes because I was tripping very hard, intense visuals and that damned muscle tension at the end. But this still doesn't explain why neither me nor my friend felt nothing before taking the miprocin?

A bit late, but I combined 4-HO-MET with 2C-B once.  I was finding the 2C-B trip by itself to be pretty lackluster, fun, nice, but lacking.  I added 4-HO-MET and it transformed into a truly magical and immersive experience, which I found interesting because I have never had a very powerful experience on 4-HO-MET by itself.  They seemed to synergize beautifully.  Some of the best CEVs I have ever had, realistic, colorful, and telling a story.  I would see beautiful mandalas at first and then they would unfurl and I'd fall inside and I would have more of a visionary experience, not patterns and colors but full immersive experiences.

I have tripped about 5 times on 20 and 25mg. It was 5 totally different experience, unlike my LSD trips, which had similarities.

Sometimes I feel body load, sometimes I have next to no visuals, only euphoria. Still, I like it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Ive tripped about 10 times on 2CB, mostly 1 capsule (presumably 20mg ), and a couple of 2 capsules


Had a great time every time....absolutely GREAT drug...loved it, would love to get ahold of A  gram of this stuff.....darknet here i come ;-)


PREFERABLE TO ANY PSYCH IVE DONE (2nd favorite next to MXE)


If everything works out will be able to research this, MXE and 4-HO-MET ....possibly altogether.......sounds heavenly to me....

Only tripped a good 3-5 times on it.

Last of which was like 10mg iv.


Straight to the moon defo body load the visuals were crazy tho triple everything.

Having a sedative for after is a must!

That sounds incredible! The visuals were very detailed... I wish I had taken time to explore the CEVs. 


However, I later realized that my scale was off by 10mg at the time. So I only took 15mg of 2C-B instead of 25, which makes a lot more sense.

When I first experimented with 2c-b I was in the middle of a period of bad drug abuse. I think that cheapened the experiences somewhat. Looking back I see why Shulgin loved it so much, the empathy is something special with this. I think I will wait a couple months and try it on an mdma comedown as I've heard great things about that combo.

took about 30mg with a good amount of mxe a week or so ago. Turned the mhole from dark and drab to super colorful. Well, it was way more than that, but thats a basic.

I replaced MDMA with 2c-b a years ago for going to clubs and took quite a bit over the course of a couple of years. I didn't suffer any of the effects typical to, say, stimulant abuse - i.e impaired memory, concentration etc. 


I did suffer mental effects though; for example increased synchronicity, so that's something to watch out for. HPPD is also something to watch out for.

2c-b don't seem to be as tolerance forming as other psychedelics but its know for forming HPPD when abused.

Probably no more than once every 2-4 weeks. But even that could probably wear you out after awhile

I took 2c-b about 5 hours into an LSD trip while hiking in Big Sur a couple years ago. Some of the most beautiful scenery and feelings I've ever experienced. Still managed to somehow get into fight with GF during the trip, but I think that's mostly because she was a crazy bitch? Damn harvard girls. Always told her she was going to make a GREAT attorney hehe.


Anyway, I've been hearing for years about using 2c-b on MDMA comedown. I have not taken MDMA in several years, and am hesitant to try it again. If I were to, it would have to be epic and in a great set & setting. I am curious, has anyone here ACTUALLY TRIED using 2c-b at the tail end of an MDMA trip? It just sounds incredibly counterintuitive. I cannot imagine putting a psychedelic drug in my body after gurning hard for 3 hours.

2c-b at the tail end of MDMA is a fantastic combo. I much prefer it to LSD+2c-b although my doses were probably too high for that one. There's a wonderful synergy with MDMA. The 2c-b seems to enhance the psychedelic properties of the MDMA and gave me some of the best CEVs I've ever had, very organic and watercolor-like. At one point I was seeing pyramids and brief flashes of entities.

I've recently experimented with this stuff having two different batches of HBr salt.

The first one was very white and it got me highest I've ever been with only 20mg. 10mg at a party with the same batch was very different from the first experience. It was more rolly than psychedelic. Kind of like LSD and MDMA combo.

The second batch had a brown/dark amber tint to it and I believe it's cut with something. Both batches tested positive with Marquis but trying the second one with 20mg only gave me a mild psychedelic experience (which was actually nice but not what I expected). 

So all three times I tried the substance I had three completely different experiences. If I didn't know it was 2-CB I probably would have though it was different substances all along.

I've never seen 2C-B that was dark brown/amber colored... sounds quite degraded or quite impure.  I have had 2C-B HCl, which is white, and HBr, which is sort of gray colored.  HCl is more potent by weight by a good bit so that batch was better for sure.

Yes I do believe it was slightly degraded or maybe even cut with something. It's mostly white though with just a hint of brown. I was doing some research and it seems that brown tint can occur due to bromine not being washed out properly. Kind of like brown MDMA which wasn't entirely purified in the last steps of synthesis. I believe bromine crystals can contain various impurities which means that brown stuff is just not very clean. I'm not a chemist though.  


I have never tried HCl yet but I heard it's less water soluble than HBr which would make volumetric liquid measurement more difficult. And HCl is supported to be worse to insufflate. HBr was already pretty terrible. Railing 5mg left me feeling feverish and as if  I had my nose broken but it only lasted a few minutes. Can't even imagine doing it with HCl...

I hadn't realized that 2C-B HCl is less soluble, but certainly it could be dissolved to 1mg/mL concentration anyway.  I always just weighed doses dry though since 2C-B is not very potent.

I don't either, I have a .001g cheap scale, cost me $25.  For something like 2C-B it's plenty accurate, if someone's dose is +/- 2mg it doesn't really have much impact.

^ ^ I guess I got unlucky with that scale - mine was a piece of junk that never worked properly. If you check the online reviews for the Gemini-20 it's hit and miss. You're either lucky and get one that works or unlucky and don't.  I use a Gempro 250 and it works like a charm, very stable readings and has a solid feel to it. Costs a lot more though.

I've owned 2 Gemini-20s and they've both been fine.  I mean they can vary by +/- 2mg, but I only use it directly for substances where that doesn't matter.  For something like DOC I weigh out a larger mass and then use liquid measurement.  It also helps to not tare the scale after putting the tray on it... for some reason when it reads 0mg it's less accurate.  If I don't tare the scale it reads like 2645mg, and I just put the substance on there with that weight already on and do some math.  Seems to register weights much better when there is already weight being read.

I am on my 3rd gemini 20 (first two didn't break, were discarded for other reasons), all have worked fine. Like xorkoth says, weigh up your drug with the scale allready reading the tray it comes with. I actually use two dimes and a quarter as a base. Always use the same dimes and quarter, helps to make sure I don't need to calibrate or new batteries. Weight is usually off +/- 4mg or so. Doing this method, I would say the scale is extremely reliable  and fine to use unless you are doing 5mg or less. 


Also, is the general consensus that any type of brown 2c-b is going to be significantly decreased in potency?

^ the brown tint batch I had was not decreased in potency significantly but I'd say it felt somewhat 20-25% weaker than the pure white stuff. To be honest, it could've just been cut with something and not really degraded. Once I get more of the same batch, I will send a sample over to wedinos to find out what's happening in there.

It could just be HBr, as the HCl I've seen has always been white and the HBr has not been white, but light gray, I could see how brown could be a tint to it too.  And the HBr is about that much weaker by weight.

26mg HBr was enjoyable and light-hearted, lasted about 4 hours. There's hardly any CEVs, but for the OEVs, it doesn't seem to produce color or distort things much, it makes everything "oily" like an above poster said. Similar effect as trails, it's that overlapping of your vision's previous frames effect and can result in mild hue changes if you stare long enough. Other than that it's more of this goofy giggly psychedelic state. 


Has anyone experienced a constant dull headache the day after? It won't go away!

Your description matches pretty much with how 2C-I affects to me. Could you get analyzed the substance with GC/MS or TLC? I got headache with 2C-I multiple times, and some of my friends as well.


I've never experienced headache after 2C-B even mixing it with MDMA. Nevertheless I am not sure if I have the HCl or HBr salt, but it should not matter in my opinion. If it was just the first time that happened and you've tried the substance before, it could be just a coincidence (do you suffer headaches frequently?).


For me, 2C-B CEVs typically look like water flows forming different figures, and visions of things like crystals of different colors. To me, 20mg (0,36mg/kg) makes the work very well in most of the circumstances for a good, 'social' trip. The OEVs I experiment typically include a slight blue coloration of everything, together with typical mescaline-like visions on the peak of higher dosages (like looking at the people around and looking how their mouth were being converted to sand pushed by wind.


When I add MDMA to the experience, I get a *way more colorful* experience, once I had an experience that made me see similarities with a mushroom-like trip, and the erotism of the experience gets improved as well.

2C-B ~12mg, IV: I prepped my shot and as I sat on the toilet. I finally finish and roll up my sleeve. I tie a long sock around my arm (lol) and find a vein. I finally feel a register and it I pull back; red clouds shoot up into the barrel, blast off. I feel an instantaneous rush and all I can mouth is "holy fuck". My vision feels like my eye's power has been magnified by 300%. I fight the dizziness and try to relax and come to terms that I'm already tripping this hard and make my way to my bed where I lay down and enjoy both intense OEV's and CEV's. The entire experience lasted about four hours. There were definitely some residual after effects.

That's a good and interesting point, but the effects felt the same as my previous 2C-B experiences, and the [reagent tests with another 2C-B batch](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/512598-Marquis-Mecke-Mandellin-results-for-stim-empathogen-2C-X-RC-s-amp-more?p=12941078#post12941078) (the one in question on bottom row) suggest that it's 2C-B. Though I will send it in for testing and get it confirmed soon, and I'll experiment with this batch more to see if I can get some visuals like you describe.

I've tried 20mg of the weird brownish HBr powder again and oh my was I wrong thinking it was degraded. I had very intense OEVs and CEVs. Actually, the circumstances were somewhat similar to the first the I tried 20mg of the substance. I was slightly drunk and pretty tired. Tiredness obviously intensifies the trip but I had an idea that dehydration might be doing the same. Anyone noticed any significant difference in effects due to dehydration?

I finally feel a register and it I pull back; red clouds shoot up into the barrel, blast off. I feel an instantaneous rush and all I can mouth is "holy fuck". My vision feels like my eye's power has been magnified by 300%. I fight the dizziness and try to relax and come to terms that I'm already tripping this hard and make my way to my bed where I lay down and enjoy both intense OEV's and CEV's. The entire experience lasted about four hours. There were definitely some residual after effects.

Fucking awesome! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I love 2C-E and I've always wondered what it would feel like to inject that (I'd go with IM instead though). I really need to try 2C-B some time.

Yeah, the 2C's are pretty caustic so you have to use more water than usual when IV'ing. I would IM next time as well.


I have also injected 5-MeO-MiPT and DMT.

**2c-b...**


So basically I've done 2cb about 4 times, 2 times it being sniffed, 2 times taken from a pill. Both times from taking it from a pill it was listed at 15mg, one time i took 1 and a half pills, waited around an hour and really didn't feel much, the only noticeable difference was the grass/floor was breathing ever so slightly. So then another half was dropped and still same effect. Then we had some pre weighed caps with powder so decided to drop those and see if that worked and still nothing. The pills and powder were both from a very reliable and top vendor, both different. The same powder was then snorted a few months later which was not weighed up, i think we took quite a lot and it defiantly worked. It was a crazy mind blowing experience, to me it felt like a full LSD trip, there was so many colours around the room, but it was a really bad trip, it was the first time the 2c-b we had actually made any effects and we didn't know what to expect. So long story short, the product was fine, but it worked nasally but not orally, has anyone else had this problem?


Im planning on taking some 2cb on my birthday after some MDMA and have no idea wether to bomb it or snort it, snorting isn't ideal as last time i was very nausious and puked almost instantly after sniffing it and was a very strong come up, but bear in mind it was a pretty big bump of 2c-b. Don't want to risk bombin git and having no effects again.


No one had taken any meds or anything like that, i have no idea why it happens.

you might consider snorting smaller portions? although i typically hear that 2C-b is generally overpowering/easier to OD on when snorted. no sources and i'm sure if you weighed it and got the dosage right for snorting it wouldn't be a problem.

I second the notion of plugging it.  I dislike snorted 2C-Xs... not only is it intensely painful and corrosive but it seems to make it more of a "fucked up" kind of drug, rather than a delicate psychedelic state.  Plugging doesn't have either of these issues and it only requires roughly half the dosage of oral, just like snorted.

i know sniffing hurts like hell, but i can handle it and would rather take the pain instead of risk it not working i think!

Yeah it is sticking it up your bum.  Quite a nice, if inconvenient, way of dosing a lot of things.  Plenty of people have snorted 2C-Xs but I still don't recommend it.  However if you keep the dosage low it seems reasonably safe.

2cb combined with mxe made for a (literally) out of this world/cosmic conciousness experience on the peak... but was uncomfortably stimulating after. Tried it a few times indoors, and it just seems like a bit too much to be contained inside...


Have tried it a few times outside and it seems to really fit. Going on a nice hike with some 2cb makes everything seem so much more full and nice.

I know someone who combined 2C-B and MXE this weekend and said it was amazing and highly synergistic.  I noticed the same thing with 2C-I the first time I took it on MXE, but then I tried it again much later and there didn't seem to be any particular synergy, though it was a nice trip.

Combined 2cb with dpt and mxe last night. It was like dpt and 2c b were making love on a king size bed with huge pillows and co.forters that was mxe... They combined beautifully, and at times the dpt and 2c b switched back and forth between taking charge...  A spectacular experience, would reccomend.

I plug pretty much everything. 


t 0 - 50mg mxe, 30mg dpt


t 1.5 - 50mg mxe, 25mg dpt, 20mg 2cb (could have been more or less, was a bag wash and based on similiar bag weight I say 20-25mg)


t2.5-3.0 - 60mg mxe


I was sorta timid. Took  70ishmg 2ct-7, 100+mg mxe (both of those in 3 doses over 4 hours or so), then topped with 50mg dpt and 75+ mxe the week before. The last dose turned a ho humish evening into holy fuck outer space land. Way more than I thought 50mg DPT would do. Had to take some etizolam eventually because it was a bit much.


This time I said "hey look guys, we are going to get along, please play nice" and after an initial sense of them fighting for control when I added the 2cb, they just melded into a pretty synergistic experience where they seemed to trade off taking the lead.


i added the last bit of mxe because the stimulation from the 2cb was a bit much and it kicked everything right back into full swing. With me, plugging, most things seem to peak about 1 hour in and be 76-80% down by 2 hours.


I really love DPT though. It seems like half the time I take it (always in the dark meditating or laying down), I start to notice a weird white light. A lot of times it seems to be comming from me, but sometimes just randomly around my room. Now I know why it's called "the light" ;-)

So would be this one be mild to someone experienced?  Just a guess would be fine.  I've taken 2C-P and had a great time, while finding it very manageable.  Just the body load kind of sucked.


I don't want one too mild though, like I hear 2C-D is.  I think if I do come back to psychs during the summer, I'd want to try a mild one.

I see.  That's good to hear.  This one seems to be visual at least, and I'd much prefer the less mind-fucky ones.  I'm at a point in my life where I'd like to just chill and relax.


As much as I like miprocin, it's quite heavy but not on the level of lsd, amt, shrooms and DOPr.  So now I'd like to get back to one that's about two steps lower.  Thanks.  Hopefully this one will do it.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I find 2C-B to be pretty visual, in a very beautiful way, and it is quite euphoric.  It greatly increases music appreciation and I find the CEVs to be better than the OEVs.  It takes me on mental/emotional journeys with closed eyes when listening to music.  I have had some profound emotional moments for sure, nothing far-out like with powerful psychedelics, no drastically altered thought patterns, more like empathogenesis.  My best experience with it was when I took some 4-HO-MET partway in, just post-peak, a bag wash so I'm not sure how much.  It became quite psychedelic then and the mind movies became really something extraordinary.  I listened to Paul Simon's Graceland for the first time since I was a kid and it blew my mind so hard, it was a wonderful experience. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What is a mind movie?


One time when I took 2c-b, I decided to do a netty pot (nasal irrigation). To prepare, you need a spoonful of salt (to dissolve into water). I dumped the salt into the clear glass of water, ready to mix it, but I got stopped when something in the salt caught my eye. WTF? I focused on the salt (probably not even moving my head very close) and I seemed to peering down into a city. As my gaze held and I stayed transfixed with single-pointed focus, the city expanded and zoomed. I saw grids of streets. I saw cars going down salt city roads, I saw trees, I saw people and houses. The city was alive.


Something like that?

A mind movie is when the CEVs take on narrative form and display whole scenes and not just patterns.  More like visions even though not necessarily fully immersive (like you will be aware you're tripping and seeing mind movies, as opposed to, say, full on vision from ibogaine where I was entirely absorbed by them and unaware I was having a vision).

Has anyone else had 2cb with alcohol? Was pretty drunk and decided to have a bit which was a bad idea, ended up in a pretty fucked state in a bar/club type thing. 


Kept going from really happy, giggling, dancing  then in a matter of seconds was completely lifeless, bad anxiety, very overwhelmed, then back to happy again. That lasted about an hour or 2 before I was kicked out! Very weird

What did you get kicked out for, how much did you take?

I drink beer nearly every time I trip on anything. As long as I'm not shit faced drunk then I don't have any problems and it helps with pre trip anxiety.

Thanks for all the suggestions, ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I will be going on a hike next week so probably do 20-25mg while hiking to the top.

Yeah 2 at once should be fine, I'd definitely limit it to that though.  Most people report 100mg being quite threshold.


But, this is the 2C-B thread, not the bk-2C-B thread.

Any body load with this one?  I've been interested in doing the nexus flip (mdma + 2C-B), but I also saw a thread saying that stims don't go well with the 2Cx substances?

I have plugged this and taken it orally. The only negative i have noticed is my hands get sort of... big? Like my fingers get a bit puffy and feel weird. Is this vasoconstriction/dilation? The same thing happens with LSD, but it seems worse with 2c-b. Sometimes it is more, sometimes less, but always a little it seems. Didn't happen when i took 2ct-7, and can't remember if it happened with 2c-c/e/i.


I haven't noticed any negative stomach affects with either ingestion route for 2c-b. Combining with MDMA definatly could make for some over stimulation and a pretty fast beating heart, but ya only live once (or do ya?!)

Hmm, if it feels cold/numb then it's definitely vasoconstriction.  I haven't noticed growth like that though, maybe you were still tripping?  Or idk, lol.  You should definitely feel the heat towards the center of your body/near the heart, and coldness going outwards from that center.


It probably can't be vasodilation, as that would be the opposite of high bp/hr.  That's pretty much what vasoconstriction is though; bp/hr is too high, and with this continued stimulation at that high level, it causes discomfort and some side effects.  I know how it's like though, that shit sucks.  =/


Haha, we definitely just live once.  But thanks for the input.  I think the nexus flip goes with the mdma peak (not that I get this anyway, I'd have to guess) before the 2C-B peak.  Hopefully this doesn't make the two synergize in a negative way.

I just tried 2C-B HBr (not the HCl) for the first time last night. I've taken 2C-I several times, 2C-C, 2C-E several times, 2C-P, and 2C-T-2 before, so I'm not a stranger to the 2C series. I took 18 mg and my girlfriend took 14 mg. I was a little disappointed with the visual aspect initially, though I was expecting that to be a little on the more mild side at the dose I consumed. I did end up enjoying it quite a lot though. At first I felt a clear headed stimulation and physical relaxation creep on slowly as I walked around my neighborhood and the wildflower center by my house. The visuals didn't really start until I got home about an hour after I ate it. For the record I had eaten quite a large meal about 4 hours earlier so its possible stomach contents affected the timeline. 


My girlfriend started tripping relatively hard compared to me anyways, as she was incredibly amused with various plants and objects around the house and was staring with a goofy grin. We ended up laying in bed for a few hours listening to music, and after 3 hours, we smoked weed. At this point, things actually got pretty deep, and the both of us went somewhat comatose in bed and did not have any desire to get up for the next two hours. I closed my eyes and had some very pleasant CEVs and music (Tool's Undertow) sounded incredible. This aspect of the trip reminded me somewhat of my 22 mg 2C-I + weed trip where I spent literally the entire trip laying in bed listening to music. There was a similar emotional vibe. Overall, I was quite impressed with 2C-B and I'm glad I finally got to try it after all of these years playing with its (formerly legal) cousins. It wasn't incredibly profound or deep, but it did amplify the analytical aspects of my personality and I did experience a sense of profundity here and there as I made some interesting connections between thoughts and ideas. I'm definitely excited to try it again, though next time I will be taking 20-22 mg or so and seeing how that goes.


This was the first time I ever decided to hold off on smoking weed and just experiencing the peak of a psychedelic on its own, and I'm glad I did. Smoking weed really amps up the musical appreciation and meltiness, but it was nice to feel a little bit more energized and clear headed while tripping for once ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

How do people find 2cb as a party club drug?


I've basically abused mdma over the past 2 years or so and have definetly built a strong tolerance and lost a lot of the 'magic'. I'd say I've took doses of 250-300mg 5 times in just the past 2 months and don't even particularly enjoy it anymore. Yeah I still get high to an extent and it's still a good social lubricant but certainly not even comparable to how it once was at smaller doses. Don't get music/lights enhancement at all anymore, empathy is slightly there but again not that noticable. Still gives me the energy to dance for hours but that's about it. I still remember the first few times of taking mdma and how incredible it felt, it almost feels like a different drug now.  


So basically I'm thinking a very lengthy break from it is needed, for my health more then anything and maybe the magic could come back further down the line, who knows. 


So I'm left with the decision of what to use instead of mdma, as I do enjoy going out once or twice a month on average. Not a big fan of coke as I've had a bit of a habit in the past and don't want to go back to that.


I can get my hands on some 2cb in either 15mg tabs or white powder. Im not experienced with psychedelis, but have heard good things about it and how it is good as a party drug in low-moderate doses. I'm not expecting it to replace mdma as such but I like the idea of it being a bit of a half way between mdma and lsd in some way, and tbh with my mdma tolerance as it is now, it's possible I will get more euphoria from this.


Suggested dose for said setting as a first time ? I'm thinking maybe 20-23mg? Would be drinking too, not exesively but slightly drunk.

2C-B works great as a party drug.  I wouldn't call it an MDMA replacement but it feels good, it's euphoric, and it produces empathy.  It's still a more complex and potentially difficult experience than MDMA is... it's a psychedelic and the come-up can be weird sometimes (though less so than with almost any other psychedelic I've tried).  Seems like a good idea to take a lengthy break from MDMA and 2C-B is a good candidate to use instead.


If you've never tried it before I'd start at 20mg... for me that's a low dose, I like 35mg or so, but everyone is different, so best to jump in at the lower end and raise it higher next time if desired.

2C-B seems to be affected by the amount of food in your stomach moreso than any psychedelic (or drug in general for that matter) I've tried.


The first time I took this batch of 2C-B was basically on an empty stomach, and I started coming up within 30 min or so. 


The past two times I dosed, I ate a full meal beforehand. 

With both experiences took over two hours to feel anything... it was like right after we accepted that we weren't going to trip, things started getting trippy. And each time it DID turn into a full-blown trip, definitely not placebo. 


So weird.

I'm so psyched, just got in a gram of the hcl salt. Currently prepping 12 mg for rectal administration. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Edit: First time plugging this compound and it is far superior to oral administration IMO. I easily went twice as far as I would with an equivalent amount orally. 20 mg was a very full experience. I had a 8 mg redose at somewhere around the 2 hour mark I believe. Redosing works just lovely with 2c-B. This stuff is the shit people. Empathetic and euphoric contentment, plain and simple. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Wow, I only got 60mg.  =/


I've heard this is very visual too, can you confirm this ecstacylover?  And what was your duration?  I know plugging/insufflating should be shorter with the inclusion of a quicker onset, and though I've skimmed this thread, I'd like to hear more answers especially in the present time.  Thanks in advance.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes, 2C-B is extremely visual. I didn't even take what I thought was a very high dose and the visuals were very prominent. I actually took this the next two days for a total of three days in a row, but 2C-B does not seem to develop tolerance too quickly so even the second day I still had reasonably strong visuals. I would say a 30 mg oral/15 mg plugged or higher dose with tolerance at baseline would be what it takes for me to get the full visual experience, but even a 20 mg oral dose had undeniably strong visuals for my friend recently. I plan on plugging 15-17 mg on the comedown of my next MDMA roll.


The peak only lasted about an hour when I plugged, but the redose kept it at a pretty intense plateau for a couple more. Overall I was completely down in 6-7 hours with the redose. Oral dosing would probably draw this out a bit.


Enjoy, 2C-B is probably the most euphoric psychedelic I've tried.

Cool, thanks for the response.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I do plan on taking this by itself, and then trying out the nexus flip a couple weeks after.  I heard that this flip brings out the magic of mdma and actually extends its effects, so I'm very interested in that.  Since I don't really get a peak from mdma anymore, I'm a little confused on how to time the flip but I got 3 doses to basically try it both ways; one to test out on its own, mdma then 2cb near the end, and 2cb then mdma not long after.


Do post which way you flip it.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I want to try this soon, I also don't really get much of a peak from Mdma, been bashing it over the last 2 summers, it's just a few hours of feeling pretty good and lovey and a nice mood uplift, but wouldn't say I have much euphoria from it at all anymore, sucks really! So adding in some 2cb sounds like it might help a bit. I think railing like 12-15mg of 2cb about an hour or 2 into my roll would be nice.


I'd love to know if anyone has ever tried 2cb and MDA? Been thinking about trying it at SGP this year but I think maybe that could get a bit weird

Another quick question, to anyone that has ever had a big insuffilated dose of 2cb let's say 35-40mg.. How does it compare to LSD visually and mental of you have tried LSD?

I've done MDA and 2c-B, amazing time. DO NOT insufflate that much 2c-B! You should never need that much and your going to burn a hole in your nose... Doing that sort of dose is like eating 80 or so mgs!

I felt that 2c-b was a lot better with MDA than with MDMA. Added so much to the already amazing visuals.

Hey, so tomorrow I'll be having the opportunity to enjoy some 2C-B, though I kind of want it to last longer. I have 3 14mg pills and I was thinking of taking 28mg and taking the other one a few hours in, do you think the 14mg will be enough to lengthen my trip or do I need more? (2C-D or 2C-C then) Never had any real success lengthening my trips satisfactory, I always end up in that weird twilight zone between tripping and not-tripping, so any help would be appreciated. Also, at what time from taking the chemical would you guys recommend my 2nd dose?

Hmm, I can't answer about the re-dosing, but 20mg got me pretty good recently.  The effects are very different from tryptamines, which are what I'm used to.  Lot less waving and morphing, but more melting which were pastel-like!  There's definitely a strong tinge of empathy, in which the peak started after about 45 min.  Though the main effects were visual distortion, they were pretty heavy.  Pretty strong body and head high too, but it felt more comfy than hardcore.  It didn't last as long as I would've liked because at the 4th hour, it was just about done by then.  And there was barely any mind fuck with this one, but it really elevated my mood.  All in all, it was a fun trip and it was definitely mellow to me.  I don't have much to even experiment with, but I think 25-30mg should be better/stronger.


I'm saving my rarer, longer-acting chems for later in the summer, but right about now will be 2C-B and then nexus flip time.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Hopefully someone can provide the re-dosing info.  I'm pretty sure it would be better to re-dose between the 1-2nd hour, or around the 2-3rd hour.  I'm estimating that the trip would be lengthened around then, since the plateau was still there for me at those times.  I've read that 2C-B/I/P/E have steep dose response curves, so 28mg should be significantly stronger than 20mg.  But you should probably wait until a more experienced person posts.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

2C-B and 2C-T-21 are the only major 2C-x's that I haven't tried, but I can extrapolate that 28mg of the former should be a nice, strong dose, yet not overwhelming. The 14mg booster should be ingested at T+3. Expect a powerful ride shortly after that, along with an extra two or three hours of plateau.

How is that related to what I said or to Kid's plan?


Also, to my knowledge, the only ones that have been linked to fatalities have been 2C-T-7 (a few) and 2C-T-21 (one). In all cases, the dosages were absurdly high (2C-T-21) and/or combined with things like MDMA (2C-T-7) and/or insufflated (ditto).

True, true. I was just confused by your followup because it read like a non sequitur. But yes, 2C-T-x chemicals demand an extra level of caution, T-7 in particular. I would never combine anything with 2C-T-x, let alone T-7, except maybe cannabis (which, alas, I haven't used in many years).

It just sounds incredibly counterintuitive. I cannot imagine putting a psychedelic drug in my body after gurning hard for 3 hours.

Do you mind elaborating a bit more?  I'm very interested in hearing about it.  Did it really prolong the roll when the 2C-B is taken at the tail end of mdma's effects?  Any other additional effects?  How was the 2C-B part of the trip different than taking it by itself?


I'm thinking of taking the 2C-B right in the middle of the mdma roll...I'm looking for them to potentiate each other more than actually flipping them.  I haven't dropped mdma in a while so I should at least get a mild roll with all these bomb pills out right now...but I'm trying to get as much info about this as I can, since I'll have to wait months to get a proper roll again.  =/

It is common for people to use 2c-b on the tail end of an MDMA roll to prolong the effects of the MDMA. I haven't tried this personally, so I can only tell you that it's a well known dosing strategy. If you try it/tried it, let us know how it went for you.

I'm mostly interested in how the 2C-B will augment the mdma roll.  I will definitely post about once I try it.  I'm looking forward to it!


If I'm disappointed by it, I'll be throwing in some miprocin in along with those two.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I tried this a few days ago (nexus flip).  It was okay; I may have to up my doses in the future.  I took ~400mg of mdma and then 20mg 2C-B about 2 hours after.  The roll was decent, neither strong or weak, and by the 3rd hour the 2C-B kicked in.  It did potentiate the roll, but it didn't bring out the magic of mdma at all; it more or less combined to make it a stronger roll with some 2C-B effects that seemed rather blunted than on its own.  Or maybe I didn't take enough?  I'm not sure.  It was more like a roll with 2C-B effects combined.  I was going to throw some miprocin in, but nah, I felt that it would be too heavy and not even bring anything to the table concerning the "roll."


All in all, it was pretty good.  It's about on the level of a candy flip and lasted just about as long.  The roll was definitely extended and became stronger, which I estimate was about 8-9 hours long because of the 2C-B.  Though in comparison, for normal users just upping the mdma dose should make the roll stronger than adding 2C-B into the mix, which just adds to the psychedelic effects really.  I can see why this mix was lauded, but for some poor fellow like me that was looking to bring out the magic, it doesn't seem to work like that.  At this point, I'm sure it's gone for good and I'll just have to suck it up and accept it.


Though I will definitely try this again and up my doses for both, as well as throw in some herb smoking the next time.  It was a bit heavy, but throwing another psych in would probably just turn the trip into a psychedelic...fuck soup.  Hell, idk.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


There was more to the trip though, but I'll only elaborate more if someone asks.  I did sleep all damn day after the trip.  I woke up groggy as hell.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'll make it concise and simply say perma-tolerance is real.


Edit: Thanks for the concern, well, if you meant it to be one.  With mdma, it's the substance I'm most familiar with by far when it comes to usage.  And yaa, I have access to legit pills; they aren't crappy.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Damn dude... I've never taken more than 200mg in one session other than my first time, my first time trying 'molly' which was just poor quality crushed mdma I took about 900mg over the course of 24 hours. Generally I'm good with 130mg-150mg for a session. Usually I stick with 100mg though...

Ahh, I see.  I rarely use/buy mdma in its powder/crystal form.  Tbh, it's mostly because I rarely run into them!  I stick to the pills with various stamps, test them and look them up on PR.


Yeah, I used the crap shit out of mdma so unsurprisingly, ever since then I lost the magic.  You took a damn good amount as well, lol, but did the magic die for you too?  Even my other friends who used it just as recklessly as I did didn't lose it.  Blahhhh.  I'm the unlucky one.  Not that I'm actually sad though. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

No I never really lost the magic. It's never like the first time again but if I take 130mg-150mg it has the magic. And can still roll hard on 100mg of good mdma if I haven't rolled in at least 3 months too.


Way off subject though, never have gotten around to trying 2C-B. Customs seized my 2C-B and 4-FA sample, and all 2C's are illegal in the states. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) only ever had the chance to try 2C-P.

It's like the saying goes: the best stuff are illegal.  Stupid WoD.  2C-P is pretty good.  A bit long with some body load, yet it's a visual, decently euphoric psych.  First time I've had neutral thought loops too.


2C-B is nice though.  It was pretty hard to find for me, but it's very warm and euphoric/empathic.  I'm guessing it might be one of the best 2Cs.  Swirly, melty visuals ime, and it just seems super user friendly.  I wonder if mescaline is the same?  It's very different from 2C-I and 2C-P, which are the only other 2Cs I've tried.


Next on the list are 2C-E and T7, by the end of the year.  I want to try those two before I quit.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Enjoy aftcu, I did 15 mgs in the Dominican Republic a few years ago and it was perfect.  I remember sitting on the beach with my pretty wife thinking about the times 30 years ago tripping on the beach with a friend and looking at all the pretty woman and wondering where my life would end up and when I would have my own pretty woman.  It was pretty amazing.  I had that thought and then looked at my wife that smiled and it seemed there was no time between the desire for a partner and instantly poof, there I was with one on the beach. ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I told my wife about that and she understood, like there was no time between the desire and having it manifest. :D  Also I had an ipod with headphones playing a 1972 Grateful Dead show.   Wonderful.


I just had 25 mgs last Fri Night alone in my basement.  The last of some given to me some years back.  Another wonderful night.  I know some more will eventually show up in my life, but so far I've visited 2CB land over 20 times in past years.


Enjoy!

Others have the same story, occassionally worse. Recently the DEA uses the Federal Analogue Act as an excuse in prosecuting almost any chemical they choose as schedule I. In practice any psychoactives remotely resembling schedule I chemicals are illegal. Notice none of the “legal” research chemical vendors in the United States remain in business long (excluding the darknet, some of the darknet vendors have lasted longer than a year or two).

I can't ever get around to trying anything else because every time my tolerance comes down a bit I just take the easy road and go with 2C-B. 


My last couple times with it I plugged 30-35 mg to start (which I'd guess is equivalent to 60-70 mg orally). I have a tolerance that would probably take months to return completely to baseline, but still the experiences were very emotionally intense. 


Especially the first time I plugged 30+ mg, I think it was 33 to be exact. I was getting trapped in the most Infinitesimal parts of songs. Gangster rap, which I normally dislike while tripping, painted a harrowing portrayal of American ghettos which was breathtaking and eventually gave way to a very liberating feeling. I saw skeleton imagery for the first time while tripping, and while that is not something I associate with normally I was able to embrace it and not be frightened. The euphoria was ridiculous, the more my body shook and contorted, the more pleasure I felt. It was surprising to me that I almost felt clearer-headed at this higher dose than I would at a lower one. I was able to keep great conversation when people would text me, although a public setting would have been surely too much.


Now I definitely understand what people mean when they say this stuff leaves your 'energy reserves' sapped. I felt emotionally, physically, and mentally fatigued for days; especially after the second 30+ mg dose which came less than a week after the first. Also, I've always heard people use the word 'gooey' when talking about beez, and that definitely resonates with me now as well. Honestly, this stuff is more euphoric than MDMA to me once you learn to utilize it to its full potential.

Yup, 2C-B is definitely a gem to me too.  It has zero body load and a nice buzz, similar to miprocin but the nature of the visuals are completely different.  Both are very euphoric, but 2C-B is light on the mind, while miprocin is just a tad bit stronger.  I'll probably combo them (2C-B and 4-HO-MiPT) in a few months after I try a higher dose nexus flip.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  that will be coming soon too.

2C-B can get pretty analytical at high doses, without losing its benevolent clear-headed nature, which is cool.

Ah, I see.  I actually haven't tried a high dose yet.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I guess it is like miprocin then; ime it was light on the mind, except at high doses too.  I like those since it's more "playful" without the edginess getting amplified just as much as the other effects.

Great idea on the miprocin combo, KL519. There's a "swirlyness" to this that I also feel on trypts, some serious potential for synergy. Then again, this works just about right with anything.

had an absolutely beautiful 2cb trip last night, 15mg insufflated combined with a few bumps of amphetamine and some lines of k. the incredible body high and general overwhelming feeling of well-being had me and a friend skipping merrily along the beach at 3am singing along to amy winehouse from a portable speaker. good times all round!

Cool.  Yeah, they do sound great in theory, along with matching timelines, so I was wondering if it would be a good mix.  Good to know that it is.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Haha, indeed, it would be interesting to find out what happens when a phenethylamine and tryptamine combines.  Especially these two since ime they are both easy going and balanced in favor of positive, enjoyable effects.  Although some prefer deeper substances, and sometimes I do too, as of now I kind of like the more shallow, recreational ones better.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

As much as I like 2C-B I'm starting to consider if I'll do it again anytime soon. While it's never made me throw up, I always get this unique nauseous feeling and it's been getting worse every time I've done it. The other day I was handling some for someone else and I noticed I still got this feeling of nausea and it persisted for like an hour afterwards. I guess my body doesn't like it as much as my mind.

it is weird. I have taken 2c-c/b/i/e/t-7 and have never experienced any nausea or whatnot. All of them plugged and 2c-c and 2c-b oral as well.


I combined 2c-b with dpt once or twice. It kinda felt like they were fighting for domincance, I asked them to play nice, and they combined into... something. Then kind of switched back and forth a little (mxe included). It was kinda stimulating in a weird way.

What's really weird is plugging had been my exclusive ROA with 2C-B for the past few months. Last night I just ate it for the first time in awhile and I didn't have any nausea at all! I don't even know what to think of this, except maybe YMMV. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hi guys, planning on trying 2CB for the 1st time tonight! Do you think 18mg is too much? im a 23yo girl for about 53kg (112pound i think?) and i am quite sensitive, like, anything more than 250mg of MDMA will make me sick.


Any recommendation?

I don't think that would be too much. But then again I don't think 250 mg of MDMA is anywhere close to a dose for a sensitive person.

Do you have any experience with other 2c's ? That could help gauging your sensitivity... I think for most people, 18mg would be a pretty mild, but active dose.

Why not?


But do you think 18mg will be too much then - also, usually does it last more 5 or 8hours, erowid is a bit confusing

Take 15 and save more for later if needed 2c-B can easily be redosed. As far as duration it's all up to your metabolism! Also good MDMA will never need more than 150mgs. Doing much more of highly pure MDMA could easily kill you...

- If you've never taken a psychedelic before, you don't know how you'll handle it. 2c-b is pretty forgiving, as far as psychedelics go, but it could still take you for a ride. You might become anxious, paranoid, have a bad trip, who knows.
- While I have nothing against taking psychedelics for fun (they can be a blast), you might be missing a chance to have unique experience that goes beyond partying. Especially for your first psychedelic experience, I would personally want to wade in from a calm environment and allow your mind to take you where it will, rather than having the party dictate.


If you're not an anxious person, there's a good chance that 18mg of 2c-b, as your first psychedelic, at a house party, could be a lot of fun. But, it might not be, and more to the point, you might miss out on a good portion of what psychedelics are all about.


Anyway, just make sure you are super-comfortable with the people around you. IMO that's the most important thing if you are going to do it.

I find that pretty much any psychedelic can turn into a "tough" trip if there are users that find E to be "too" psychedelic as well.  If it's possible to bad trip off of that, well then, I guess it's possible for someone to bad trip off of...anything.  But stimulants don't play nice with people who have paranoid-like tendencies...I used to think they were "bad trip" free before the simple events I've witnessed.


It's just an observation, because personally I don't see how 2C-B can be as tough to handle as lsd.  But like it was said, you could definitely have a bad time off of it if you aren't accepting the effects that it's giving you.  How the mind handles the trip, serving as the subject, is what will determine the results.


I do want to point out that there are exceptions to just about everything.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Although personal experiences should not be used as a barometer for anyone except the person him/herself, I'd just like to say that 2C-B is a great choice to first jump into psychedelics.  18mg sounds like an ideal dose, but be sure to test out <1mg just in case.  Have fun.

Does anyone else feel that the "stimulant" side of 2c-b has a lot to do with the surroundings? I can easily watch a movie on 2c-b and chill no probs, but when going to clubs the energy is insane and I can dance forever. Seems very... dynamic. 

Also: Does anyone else get really painful headaches from 2c-b? Either when the trip is done, or the day after... it's like flipping a switch. I don't always get it, but usually. Any rational explanation behind that? Maybe vasoconstriction related, idk.

Been a few years since I last had 2c-b, I recall one very strong trip when I felt very dissociated at certain stages if I was not focusing on staying grounded. I love k and MXE holes and have used both lots for a number of years - however I'm trying to avoid dissociative usage as it cuts down on my psychedelic usage.


I was wondering if anyone could comment on experiences with getting the more dissociative side of this out at higher doses? Would it be comfortable to navigate for someone very experienced with the above and plenty of heavy psy experience. Or is this not what I should be looking for? How about combining with ketamine?


Also anyone know how this goes with 2c-c?

**2C-B Duration**


Here's 4 2C-B trip durations. Weird how eating a meal 20 minutes afterward delayed the onset considerably.

^^ I find that eating beforehand affects 2C-B's onset more than any other drug I've tried. 


Two times stand out in my mind where I ate a full meal less than an hour before dosing. Both times I was with another person, and in each situation both of us thought nothing was going to happen. And then finally, an hour and a half to two hours after dropping... oh, is that wall breathing a little?

That is why I prefer to plug my 2CB - no messing around with the stomach or GI tract - faster comeup -  less material required. All in all just reduces the bodyload significantly I find. Although there have been times where I've felt the rushed comeup make my legs tremor uncontrollably for a bit. 


Not that unpleasant, but just remind yourself you've blasted a psychedelic straight into your bloodstream. And the joys to follow are absolutely worth it :D

Got some 2C-B today, going to test it out some this week and hopefully get a decent trip report for SSRIs + 2C-B, since none exist as best as I can tell. It's been a decent amount of time since I stopped SSRIs so it's not a perfect test of the combo, but by the best estimations I could find there is enough lingering drug and metabolite in my body to still affect things soemwhat, so my experience won't be totally irrelevant for others on SSRIs who want to take 2C-B, though hopefully it won't kill off my fun entirely.

I'm always cautious about calling any drug I've tried my favourite but 2C-B may well be just that. It takes the best parts of MDMA and LSD, throws them together and somehow strips away all the bad parts of both those drugs as well. The visuals have what I can only describe as a cartoon vibe to them along with being way more bright that LSD and it seems to me that the harder you focus on a single point (the wall, someone's eyes etc) the more trippy things get. I really can't say enough good things about it. It works really well with weed to :D

I'm curious...how much are you taking? 


I am currently experimenting with 2C-B. I have found 30mg to be a dose where the experience becomes really worthwhile. Emotionally and mindset-wise, it's, exactly as you said, a cross between MDMA and LSD. However, at this dose, the visuals are underwhelming. That's not an issue, per se, but it would be nice to experience the cartoony visuals everyone seems to be talking about.

I take 40mg and I smoke a fair bit of weed with it as well. It's worth bearing in mind that since 2C-B is so hard to measure out and the dosage curve is so sensitive that when I say "I take 40mg" I mean that I have 2 capsules of what I've been told are both 20mg capsules and I take both of them. It wouldn't surprise me if the actual dosage I take is 5mg under or 5mg over what I think I'm taking.


I was on 2C-B a few days ago, same 40mg dose and for some reason, this time, I had the most insane closed eye visuals I have ever had in my life. Life a kaleidoscope but not symmetrical with a huge ball of white light in the centre of it. Overwhelmingly beautiful ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I got my hand on some 2C-B powder which seems of decent purity. I dissolved 100 mg in 400 mL of water but some parts did not dissolve. I guess these were impurities. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I hate the prohibition we life in. 


I measure everything with bulb pipettes. So far I tried 1.25 mg, 5 mg, and 7.5 mg. 


1.25 mg was week but clearly there. 5 mg was great for sex. 7.5 mg I did at a festival but from my point of view 2C-B is not a drug to do in a club. It worked out great as I could just go in the nature on the festival and talk to people, which was nicer than to dance. 


Interestingly, my girlfriend tried 2.5 and 5 mg and never got any effect. It seems like I need much less than she does, which does not surprise me as it takes a pint of beer to get a strong effect for me.

You are correct. I took very small mounts of this, as I stated 1.25, 5, and 7.5 mg. Bulb pipettes are amazing and quite affordable for what they do.

Yea. It tough me that I am very sensitive towards this compound. Or how Shulgin put it once: I do not like to be surprised. Thus starting with 5mg, then 7.5 mg with some weeks in between. Perhaps I will try 10 mg in some weeks but with at least 6 weeks in between the experiments.

As mentioned above, I tried to dissolve 100 mg of 2C-B*HCl in 400 mL of tap water. Not everything went into solution and some colorless sediment remained, even after heating to about 60 °C. 


Any idea what this could be? I checked the usual methods for the synthesis of 2C-B in PiKAL and other sources but it is not evident to me what could remain after converting the freebase to the HCl salt. Even the acetate salt should have a good solubility in water. Any ideas here? 


For now, I keep the solution frozen but the next time I will filter of the sediment and try to run a Marquis test on it.

Try adding a few drops of vinegar and it should help any remaining material to go into the solution.

Also, you should be making your solution out of alcohol for long term storage.

Ballz_Trippington, thanks for the advice. Do you have any idea why adding a bit of acid will force the rest into solution? If there is some freebase left, that would be an oil (which would be on the button of the solution). I guess the people who made this added enough HCl to convert all freebase to the salt. 


Thanks for the advice with the alcohol solution for long term storage. I was considering this but I went for water as I do not want to consume alcohol and 2C-B as ethanol has a very strong sedating effect on me, even at low doses. Thus, I created a solution in water and put the bottle in the freezer to prevent it from going bad. What do you think? 


Thanks!

No, it can't - couldn't, wouldn't, won't.  


The LD-50 for rats is 350 mg/kg  even scaling by a factor of 5 makes it 70 mg per kg or 5,000 mg for a 155 lb human.  That = 5 grams


In Pihkal , Alexander Shulgin describes a tolerance test where the subjects were given 120-160 mg of MDMA daily for 6 days; on day 6, 160 mg did not even cause pupil dilation. At that point a 300 mg dose would have barely been threshold.  


Please don't spread disinformation like that.

Your 2C-B hcl should be entirely HCL with no freebase in it.  When I've had problems getting the last bit of chemical into solution a bit of vinegar seems to always do the trick. 

You should also be able to get your 2C-B to go into a higher concentration per ml with alcohol rather than water and alcohol will prevent bacteria from developing in your solution. 

I understand the dilemma about using alcohol if you don't wish to injest it though!

My apologies for my late reply. I did some research and there seems to be a rationale that lowering the pH can help to force salts into solution. Specifically I had a look at this paper: [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016382426347](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1016382426347) 


I will go for citric acid as you can buy it in high quality and use it as a power. First I will test with Marquis if the sediment is really 2C-B, then add some citric acid to force everything into solution. 


Do you think storing in water and freezing is not as good as storing in an ethanol water mixture? 


Thanks!

Firstly, I must say that it really looks like you are truly doing your due diligence here and I must commend you!! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I do feel that an alcohol solution is superior to water for storage ( in both situations I would still store in the freezer though). 

Putting the solution in the freezer should cause it to store less material as it gets cold so you might see that crystals have formed when you take it out of the freezer and you might have to shake it up after it returns to room temperature to get it all back into solution.  

I find most chemicals are more soluable in ethanol over water but there are a few exceptions.  So you should be able to concentrate it down to a dose being even just a few drops to a couple ml.  Not even close to a shot. 

I also find that alcohol helps preserve your chemical from degradation over water but that should be less of a problem with Phenethylamines than with Tryptamines.

I also recommend alcohol, you make it concentrated so the dose of alcohol is minute, far below the threshold for effects.  I'd probably go for 10mg/mL.  The main advantage to alcohol is that it's antibiotic/antimicrobial... your solution won't become contaminated after any length of time.

Thanks for the compliment! In my mother tongue there is a word that is very hard to translate. It basically means that you have the maturity to deal with drugs (Drogenmündigkeit). This is what I try to do here. Having a PhD in chemistry helps (not in experimental chemistry though) ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


I do not think that either water or ethanol has an advantage as a solvent for Phenethylamines when you freeze it. They are both very weak acids and the drug, being protonated by the HCl should no longer react with either for them. It is more important to lower the temperature to reduce the energy for reactions. 


Xorkoth: I agree with you and I can see your point. It is a practical reason why I choose to go with 0.25 mg/ml as the smallest bulb pipette I had was 5 ml, which corresponds to 1.25 mg. As I *really* want to do low doses, it was the most practical thing to do. If you freeze the solution 2C-B will crystallize anyways and will go back into solution when you warm it up again. 


What worries me is that people report that they made solution with far more than 0.25 mg/ml. When you read PIKAL, Shulgin describes that they dissolved 16 mg in a glass of juice with a little help of heat, which would correspond to something much higher as what I do here. I will test if the stuff that does not go into solution is really 2C-B or not and report back.

A bit of a different question: as pointed out above, my threshold does seems to be about 1 mg as I tried 1.25 mg as an allergy dose and got a very, very mild response. My girlfriend tried 2.5 and 5 mg and did not get any noticeable effects from it. We both took it for a sexual boost, not to have visuals. 


Thus my question: She was thinking of taking 10 mg the next time but she is not sure if that would be too much as she is very inexperienced with psychedelics. What is your experience with people with a higher threshold? Say that her threshold is 10 mg, would that mean that she would get the same effects with 10 mg as I get with 1 mg? Or does it more work like this that once the threshold is reached, she would get the same effects with 10 as I do? 


Thanks for your opinions!

It's very hard to compare intensity of effects between individuals, and hopefully she knows what to pay attention to notice subtle threshold effects (it is common for people doing LSD the first time to take a while to realize what the effects are)..


That said, I realize what you are asking, and no I really don't believe the threshold works in such a way that if she crosses it, suddenly she gets the same effects as you do. If she does, it will be because she had trouble noticing subtle effects at lower doses that were noticeable to you because you may have learned to notice them... There is some linearity to the dose-response, or if not, a curve. With some drugs there can be a dosage range where small increments can dramatically increase effects - the knee of a curve (2C-E has this potential but 2C-B not really), but it wouldn't be logical if your girlfriend would catch up to you suddenly in that 5-10 mg range, only if at that point she would have a steep knee in her dose-response curve. That would not be normal or reasonable since drug effects don't tend to vary by that much.. at least the shape of the curve shouldn't.


I think doubling the dose if she really had no noticeable effects is fine and rather typical for titration in such a case, I can't imagine that she would overshoot the empathogenic phase / dose-range of 2C-B right into the psychedelic zone... although for sensitive individuals some of the psychedelic potential may start right about there at 10.


IMO, 2C-B is so friendly and non-threatening that it wouldn't really be a problem, even if 10 mg turns out to be moderately pronounced. It should still be beautiful, pleasant and intimate and not mindfuck-y... possibly she will learn that around 8 is a better bet for her for your purposes, but that's about it.


If you worry about it despite all of this, of course you can opt for the next linear increment and give her 7.5 mg, if it's not worth her fears of psychedelics and you feel like it wouldn't matter because you have fun and good sex with or without the stuff.. so depends on whether it is an investment to try and find this active dose. As it is not expected at all you will have to go over 20 mg or even 15 mg, you are nearly there... so it kind of depends on you insist on the certainty rather than predictions.


Hope you both enjoy.. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for your very detailed answer and the time you invested writing this. 


The question if she notices the effects is interesting and may really contribute. But wouldn't I notice that she is different e.g. easier to stimulate? 

I mainly thought that it is due to different biochemistry that we need different doses. For example she has a far better tolerance in drinking alcohol than I have. 

Maybe it is a combination of both ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I used a coffee filter to remove the sediments, air dryed it, and ran a Marquis and a Madelin test of the little white flakes. None of them showed any reaction. 


Without a GC/MS I will never know. In the banana republic I life in, drug checking is not even legal. I would need to smuggle the substance to the Netherlands.

Have any of you guys taken 2C-P before?


I enjoyed it but the duration was way too long.  I've also taken 2C-T-7 and I enjoyed it as well but it always gave me a bit of panic there in the middle of the trip.  Snorting it wasn't a good idea at all.  


How similar is 2C-B to 2C-P and 2C-T-7?


I'll read over the thread, maybe it has been mentioned before.  Just hoping someone out there have done both and will respond. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

2C-B is quite different from 2C-P and 2C-T-7.  It's short, and the very mentally light... also really kind physically.  Very different feel.

Definitely less physical than 2C-T7 but I still find 2C-B stimulating, sometimes uncomfortable. Give me gentle 2C-D anyday ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My girlfriend and did a test last Sunday where she took 8.75 mg and I 6.25 mg on a pretty empty stomach. I used a 0.25 mg/ml solution which I made 5 months ago and, except for 3 times I used the stuff was frozen. I did 6.25 mg from the very same solution 2 month ago and had an amazing time.


This time we both had some gastrointestinal discomfort and the trip was not that great (I understand the 2C-B can produce very different trips from time to time). May it be that the 2C-B in the solution degraded somehow? I found similar reports in this forum but as a chemist it is very hard to understand how such a stable molecule as 2C-B should degrade in frozen water. 


Any ideas on this are greatly appreciated.

Wow those are probably the lowest doses of 2C-B I've ever heard of.  I don't think I would even feel 6.25mg.

Xorkoth, As I mentioned earlier in this thread my threshold dose seems to be around 1-1.5 mg ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I come from a family which is quite sensitive towards drugs ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I do not think that it is uncommon to use 2C-B as a an aphrodisiac. When Erox was sold, it was sold in 5 mg pills.

Wow, I wish I was that sensitive.  If I take 30mg of 2C-B, it's underwhelming but into full trip territory, any less and it feels like a threshold dose.  I've actually never been able to have a strong trip from it, though I find it beautiful and lovely.

Perhaps we want different things from the chemical. With the doses I took so far I do not get into "full trip territory" but aphrodisiac effects to enhance sex and pleasure. If most I get slight alteration of my mindset but no optics or audio distortions.

I've had very intense, beautiful trips with 2C-B, although it retains that empathogenic "lovey" character no matter how high I dose, definitely doesn't have much of the more morbid aspects that other psychedelics do BUT when dosed high it still shouldn't be underestimated, can be quite powerful, I often refer to it as "mescaline jr", although it can be a bit more manic than the ultra-zen mescaline

Gone through a ton of this stuff since I got my hands on it about a year ago. Problem is that after snorting it the first dozen times (~30mg doses), orally the effects seem incredibly mild and weak even when taking 35-40mg. Going to try taking 50-60mg orally next. Only worry is the stomach issues, got mild stomach discomfort from taking 35mg orally, and my buddy had a lot of stomach discomfort.


Snorting bypasses this but it is such a savage way of consuming this. Burns so badly (can't imagine its any good for the sinuses), leads to throwing up sometimes, and general disorientation for the first half an hour. But after that, it's such a great trip. It's almost like this energetic psychedelic rush. Works great for general partying where a headier psychedelic wouldn't be as smooth.


Anyone have any suggestions for other 2C familar compounds that are similar to 2C-B, but maybe more visual? It seems, from what I've read, a lot of the more intense 2C chemicals generally just have more nausea, a heavier body load and an annoyingly long duration.

I find 2C-C quite similar, it has about equivalent visuals in intensity, and similar style, but for me, more greens and blues and more fractallized/greater detail.  Also the headspace is somewhat more psychedelic, but it still has that wonderful warmth.  Duration is about the same and it's about as potent for me, some find it a little less potent but I've always been a hardhead to 2C-B.  Both are very untheatening.  I prefer 2C-C by a bit.


2C-E is the most visual 2C (and one of the most visual psychedelics) I have tried but it's a heavy-duty psychedelic, very strong and very mentally altering, and not really much like 2C-B.  2C-T-7 is extremely visual but rougher, but also quite warm and euphoric.  Also more stimulating.


2C-I is fairly shallow, very visual (maybe more than 2C-B), but overall less good.

Also, has anyone tried subbing 2C-B? Wondering if it provides more of a "rush" than eating it. I know it wouldn't be as BOOM as snorting, but snorting is just too damn hardcore.

Took 17mg oral of this yesterday, and it didn't felt good. It reminded me why I don't take 2c-x. A lysergamide or tryptamine is just a gentler trip for me, the overstimulation of 2c-x makes me feel nervous and get shit done, and that's what I'm after on amphetamine, not psychedelic. Awesome party drug though

Does anyone have experience successfully redosing 2C-B? 


I am having a trippy gathering of friends for my birthday this weekend, and while I was considering finally trying 2C-T-7 I figured I should save that for a calmer setting. 


2C-B seems like the right choice since it is one of the more social psychs (for me at least) and is just a lot of fun without being too mindfucky. But sometimes the duration is very short for me, just a few hours and then I'm completely sober. I want to feel it for most or all of the night. 


Would it work if I took an oral dose to start and then did little bumps to keep it going? If so, how should I time the redoses? 


I know insufflation is painful, I've done it once before, but it is worth it for me in this instance if it means I can keep the night going. Because it's my birthday, dammit!

Yeah, snorting works better for redosing than taking more orally.  I'd say that you should redose whenever you start to feel it dropping, as long as you want to keep going.  If you let it get too far down, it won't come too far back up.

This one fell into my lap. I didn't look for it and I also didn't even have to pay for it. I loved 2c-c and 2c-d, especially 2c-c as I felt it had a cool unique headspace. I never thought I'd get a chance to try 2c-b. I'm totally psyched!


I have never tripped with my girlfriend before (she likes mainly stimulants, and was more than a little creeped out walking in on me extremely high on acid a couple times chanting vigorously and passionately from the tibetan book of the dead with all the lights turned off). We have been together several years and are in love. She seems genuinely interested in trying 2c-b too. She loves Mdma, and I would never take it again nor would she, but I do have some Mda too. 


From what I've read about it, I am thinking this would be a good choice to assist with having great and interesting sex, discussing our relationship, and just enjoying ourself and a nice day off. Our relationship has been great lately. 


Sbe agreed to try it with me when I brought up the idea. I think that's really cool. I think that a phenethylamine in general would be the best choice for us Possibly eventually a tryptamine too. Essentially all of my trips these days are solo...but she is my other half and I didn't pressure her to trip... she's done a lot of drugs too. 


We will be taking the substance orally (I almost always take psychs orally,

I was thinking 20 milligrams. So... does this one have a proclivity for stimulation, euphoria, deep thinking, visuals, empathy, sociability, spirituality? Is it less cosmic, more in tune with the 'real world'? I think it would just be myself and her the whole time... we are pretty private people.


It's also a rough time of my life and she's being understanding and supportive. That never stopped me from tripping since I'm pretty experienced now and growing older approaching my 30's, so it's generally okay for me to confront things and if it's not, some of the deepest insights I have had have come from "negative" experiences.

I find 2C-B to be much more focused on the self and the body, rather than cosmic or out there.  It's quite visual and quite euphoric.  I find it most similar to 2C-C but less psychedelic than 2C-C, and warmer.  It can be quite erotic.  I find it only slightly more potent than 2C-C... for me 20mg is a very light dose.  But for some it's good.  What sort of doses do you take for other 2C-Xs?  Like what do you take for 2C-C?

Does 2C-B combine well with LSD or 4-AcO-DMT at all?

I combined 2C-B with 4-HO-MiPT once and it was a very fun time with strong visuals. I imagine it with 4-AcO-DMT would be similar but more serious/spiritual/deep.

Xorkoth, I have taken 2c-c up to 80mg. Anywhere from 30mg to 80mg. I could go definitely go higher, but I don't have too much material and I really enjoy the stuff. It's a costly trip, but some things in life are priceless. I find 60mg to be excellent - very euphoric, with a decent visual component, much more psychedelic than I was expecting from something often overlooked, while offering an interesting and unique headspace. That is the amount of the HCl that I'd take if I were going to take it tonight, or with my girl. I never experienced nausea or any side effects either, although I'm not too bothered by bodyload (within reason) as I suffer from chronic pain anyway. The experience was always a little cold and mechanical; it definitely didn't feel natural, like something like 4-ho-met would for me. My emotions weren't blunted, but they weren't potentiated very much either by the 2c-c. 


I know the Shulgin's used 2c-b alongside Mdma for psychotherapy and to me it makes sense that it would be a little warmer, like your take on it. That sounds really sweet! 


For 2c-d, I haven't experimented with doses as high yet. I took it several times around 10mg as a sort of psychedelic study aid (I actually found it worked quite well for that purpose, I could be having slight visuals at that dose, a nice body high while helping me focus and also to make associations while learning that I normally might not see, I am a very visual learner). For 2c-d, I'd take 40mg if I wanted a nice short trip off it. I don't have as much experience with 2c-d at moderate / high doses. 


So I just got into phenethylamines other than Mdma around the end of 2015, and I haven't taken them since as I had several trips and tried many new things that year and felt like taking a good break. My recent light trip with 4-ho-met was just great. Does 2c-b still have a nice headspace to it?  Also - wow, I thought 2c-b was much more potent than 2c-c, almost double the potency. They are more in line with each other in terms of potency? I have the hbr salt if that makes a discernible difference. We are not exclusively taking it for eroticism but also to have a nice time on a little vacation, and we'll probably spend quite a bit of time exploring a nearby city and just talking.

Had a great night out on 2c-b with many friends on this past friday. I took 25mg of the HBr orally and didn't puke! I think what helped was making sure I ate a pretty filling and balanced meal about 4 hours before and didn't eat after that. I didn't get the heavier bodyload I get from taking it orally sometimes, got the nice energetic trippy high that I love! Could have been set and setting, maybe also that I began exercising ~3 weeks ago. Who knows, done stuffing that crap up my nose though.


Also, I made the nasal spray! Here are some thoughts...


I made the ratio of water to non-iodized salt to 2c-b so that each spray would have roughly ~1.25mg. Just enough salt to make it close to the nasal ph.


I only hit it maybe 2 or 3 times since the 25mg orally surprisingly got me good and dandy. The initial, instant discomfort from the spray was definitely helped by having the salt in there I think, before I made the solution I tried a squirt of just plain water up my nose and it was quite uncomfortable.


It's definitely much better than snorting tiny bumps, much less pain. There is a bit more drip through and there is a brief burn from it, but it goes away quickly and its not so bad since the throat is a bit more hardy than the delicate music membranes in the nose. I imagine its less painful since it has already been dissolved in water and doesn't need to undergo that process in the nose.


Everyone seemed to agree it was much better than plain snorting. So worth it. The device is a bit bulky and annoying to have in your pocket all night though.


Great night. Great show, then hung out with everyone back at our place and listened through music, drinking beers and smoking weed until 8am.

I've done it on LSD a couple times. I think getting the dose timing is tricky. Every time I've done it, its been well into the LSD trip, then we starting doing bumps or dose the 2c-b. I think the tolerance created by the LSD is pretty strong, because its pretty subtle what the 2c-b adds, definitely just more energy. I think if you took them at the same time, or in a way that they both really hit at once you'd be better able to experience them combined.

I had my first ever (what I would consider) to be a ++++ experience with this substance, 


I think that it was a once-in-a-lifetime tyoe thing and that if I took 2c-b again it wouldn't happen. 


It was, by far, the most spiritual experience of my life. There was so much entity contact I don't even know where to start Complete synesthasia. 


I can barely type today, I'm pretty shook up b it.... I mean, I feel like I met God. This is a reallyy seriously and sacred material for me, that I will forever hold dear to me. Nothing - and I mean nothing - has ever camr even lose


The visuals wer were so strong I couldn't walk I had the sense to lay down and tel a family member I was taking a nap. teleported, man, I teleported... I saw things that were beyond words, I guess I'm sensitive to this one or something. I'm really shook up todaay. It was the deepest and  most spiritual psychedelic experience of my life. I feel that my their eye was blasted off its hinges : )


Seems to happen when you least expect ir.

Wow, crazy, I can't imagine having that sort of experience on 2C-B.  How much did you take?

Wow that is wild, usually that takes over 100 mg of 2C-B i think... Am also interested to hear how much it was and the circumstances and nature of the entity contacts etc.


Planned on taking it today but had to get some other things done so probably tomorrow. I have powder that is pink-ish and pills that are supposed to be about 15 mg, apparently a little variable. Not sure what I'll do but probably I will take enough - I used to be quite pleased with 35-40+ mg.

Yeah 35+mg is where it needs to be for me.  


I'd love to taste 2C-B again.

I don't know how this was catelyzed, that will always be a mystery to me, but I believe it was my turn for the stars to align. The material was produced with loving hands and graced to me for free - and by surprise, like it was just my time. Also, I never would have come across it if I hadn't decided to quit sniffing heroin habitually (long story...)


I hadn't really tripped in over a year. I went with erowid's middle ground dose of 30mg, so not even that much! It's straight up 99% powder though and I took a nice chunk. Bear in mine several tabs of good acid, quarters of mushrooms, 40mg 4-aco-dmt, 80 mg 2c-c - nothing came close to this. I personally think it's because I consumed 3 tablespooms of raw cacao nibs before the trip!! And because I had zero tolerance - but I'm clearly sensitive to the compound, and there was just good karma all around.


it was so intense I trashed my house for a while stumbling around. Made it outside for some cold air. Opened all the doors in winter. It felt like a more warm version of LSD at this point, I was enjoying it but the visuals were getting stronger by the minute. A family member was on her way home and she could NOT know about this. I looked at my phone for the time, but I couldn't see the phone. All I could see were geometric fractals - beautiful patterns - and auditory hallucinations too (for the first time). 


My voice was echoing and all sounds were amplified. She arrived home and immediately asked if everything was okay. Luckily, I had thesense to know to stay home (I had my jacket packed with my health card, a jar of valium, and jar of dillies... lol.


so I managed to hold a conversation with her, convinced her I was napping and indeed okay, lay down, and this is when I lost touch with reality for the next 6 to 8 hours. I experienced hallucinations about the worst case scenario (my family raiding my stash, and taking me to the hospital) - which didn't happen of course, but I actually experienced it happening. I saw myself on the front page news: psychedelic madman!!! I knew at this point to ride it out : )


The entities I first encountered were very formal and business-like. It seemed like they were somehow running the universe and very, very busy in an immaculate, bright white business complex. I was in a hustling and bustling business environment. But it was so psychedlic. It was like I was observing the mechanisms of the universe itself, the chemical reactions, the physical interactions - but they were entities in business suits making exchanges and hand shakes with one another! Some had horns etc... it's weird cause I'm sort of anti-establishment...


Keep in mind that before this happened, the visuals had built up to the point that I could no longer see or hear anything around me. The visuals turned into a bright white blazing light, and that's when the visions started. I believe this is known as a "breakthrough."


i've never been convinced about  the Third Eye until now. It was literally wrenched wide open. I'm pretty sure I could see out the back of my head. It was fucking chaos. One hell of a trip. The information overload became so extreme that I "broke through" into clear white light and the beginning of a long vision quest...


at the climax, i was in an area that was nothing but bright light. There was a dining table and nothing else (the whole experience kind of had a hospitality vibe to it, like I was in good hands). Sitting with me were three Beings who I could tell were of utmost holiness. They were in white robes, had 3rd eyes open, and like hindu gods and goddesses.... or holy men. Their eyes twinkled, smirking at me with delight. I knew I was in the presence of those to hold with utmost respect, perhaps Gods or Bodhisattvas. I sat with them and drank tea, and I plunged back into my body  laying on the sofa. I think it was 6 hours later.


I was really shook up today and had a bit of a headache, but that was a life-changer right there. I wasn't asking for it like I sometimes do, I just got it. Oh, the mysteries of this grand universe of ours! There are sound things science just can't seem to explain. Maybe it's the 5ht3... doesn't this one interact with a rather novel receptor subtype?


Barely made it to vacation with my girlfriend today but it's been really nice. I've never needed a filet mignon and fois gras so bad hahahaha, some virgin seasors and a little speed... oh and cheesecake : )

That's nuts, on 30 mg! That really makes me want to try a higher dose of 2C-B, haha. From what I've read about it I've always suspected that it would have the potential to be really special like that, in the right set and setting.... You should definitely feel lucky to have such a sensitivity. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Does 2C-B interact with 5-HT3? I'd be interested to see any actual scientific data on that, I've been curious about how that receptor might interact with psychedelic activity myself. I also have been able to find some studies saying that DMT binds there, and bufotenin  (5-HO-DMT) even more strongly.


Anyway, thanks for sharing!

I really wasn't expecting it to be like that, but I knew there was somehow something special about the compound.


i believe it has binding affinity associated with 5-ht2c over the more general 5-ht2a receptor, although physics is more my thing.


I seem to be more sensitive to it than most psychedelics. I certainly look forward to experimenting with it again! Especially in nature : ) It was a really powerful trip and my energy is different today - jovial, lighthearted, more serious about my goals. I feel blessed to have it.

Had 30mg plugged the other day. With a 50mg booster a couple hours in. Things got real fuzzy real fast. I forgot just how much I liked it :D


FWIW - those are stupid doses, please don't go that high. I have years of experience.

80mg? How do you not suffer so many body load side effects from those dosages?

With 33 mg today  it's nice and sensorically intense as I like it but sure, it's shallow so that was I was not what I was going for today 


I hope to have some more time for the real but its getting hectic

I've never taken it nearly that high, but I have never had even the tiniest bodyload issue or physical discomfort on 2C-B, from up to 40mg.  I think if I took 80mg of any 2C-X, it would probably be 2C-B.

I reckon if I'd taken it any other ROA besides plugged it would've been physically unbearable but yep, pretty much what Xorkoth said! I'm guessing staggering the dose helped, I wouldn't go for 80mg in one go...

For what it's worth, I've taken 2C-I at 80 mg and had one of the physically lightest trips of my life, no side effects and tons of euphoria, despite getting a shaky and sweaty body load at 25 mg and 40 mg. Sometimes body loads are weird like that.

That is good to know - there's probably so many variables at play when it comes to psyches / set / setting / sensations and what not.


FWIW a light dose of 2C-I was one of the most jittery and anxiety inducing trips I've ever had, don't wish to repeat it.

I can't believe (well I do believe you) that 80mg of 2C-I was physically light with no side effects.  if I take it even to 22mg, I start to get some serious stimulation side effects.  I feel like 80mg would kill me (probably wouldn't but there's no way I'd ever even begin to approach that dose of 2C-I.  2C-B, yes).

I feel you guys, I was pretty concerned about how stimulating such a high dose might be. When I was looking at it while getting ready to dose I started thinking about it and my whole body started shaking, I had to wait fifteen minutes or so just to calm down enough to convince myself to take it. The crazy thing is though, there was no real simulation at all - in fact, I felt somewhat sedated. I was so euphoric that any movement would send immobilizing ripples throughout my body, so I spent the whole thing just lounging around. The visuals I had were soft and not in my face at all but still strong and vivid, lots of beautiful neon colors in paisley patterns and cubist perspective shifts. And even still, no confusion of any kind at this point. It was great really, I'd do it again if I had the 2C-I.


That experience has prompted me to do a lot of research over the years, and I've actually read a lot of interesting stuff about how psychedelic behavioral and neurochemical effects in animal studies can have bell-shaped curves, meaning an effect first appears and then disappears again as the dose increases. There is even a good amount of literature about them producing stimulation at low to medium doses and sedation at high doses, and I've seen people claim this to be the case on various drugs, even like 5-MeO-MiPT in the 30+ mg range. So, maybe if the body load is just based on stimulation, that can just vanish in really high doses depending on the drug and individual?

Maybe some part of body issues or stimulation is due to proportion of activity on different receptors and while there is a general lower threshold for activity, taking high doses perhaps changes those proportions not too unfavorably. Other possibilities are perhaps that some activity distracts or numbs. I know something like MDMA can be numbing or 'painkilling' but I don't know about for example 2C-I.


2C-D for a full on trip would require similarly high numbers of milligrams, which I find interesting since certainly not everybody takes it that far, but I also find it really discouraging to have to take so much from a toxicological standpoint. Mescaline of course requires even more and while it has a long history of human use going for it and supposed safety, I find it suspicious and high doses not a perfectly great idea for those reasons.


2C-B acts on 5-HT2C but at 2A it's pretty atypical. Either low affinity partial agonist or even antagonist. I wouldn't think a potent antagonist either way because it's not like it combines badly with something like LSD. So, why would 2C-C be any different? It's probably a 5-HT2C agonist too but maybe it is more normally efficacious at 2A. 2C-I would be a similar question, only it's a step in the other direction in terms of atomic radius of the halogen.


All of this could raise completely different issues when it comes to high doses, overdoses and toxicity associated with it's primary activity (like NBOMe's just seem toxic from unreasonably strong activity at 2A, although it is quite possible this is made worse with the imbalance from being selective for it - if that turns out to be true, combining an NBOMe with 2C-B might make it more rather than less safe).


No idea what the fatalities are associated with 2C-X that are not 2C-T-X, and what the cause of death is.

Excellent points, thanks for chipping in. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I know that the 2Cs in particular are well-situated to be in that sort of position too, as most binding studies I'm aware of show them mostly binding selectively to 5-HT2 receptors, but only by like ten to twenty times, so theoretically they could become much less selective with particularly high doses. That really wouldn't surprise me actually even just because of how different the trip was in general on 2C-I with 40 mg vs 80 mg, even the geometry generally had different dominant colors and shapes.... It sure seemed like it could have been pharmacologically a pretty different trip than the lower doses anyway.


Yeah, I'm not too certain where I stand on the basic phenethylamines toxicologically either. Just going by reports and accidental overdoses I've read about, it seems like most of them can be dosed over 100 mg orally with relative safety, except for maybe 2C-P, but of course it's hard to say whether that's because they actually are that safe or because the people who took those doses just happened to have been 5 mg under the danger zone. Nonetheless, the relationship to mescaline does make me a bit less concerned.... I wouldn't consider it necessarily as safe as the classic indoles seem to be, but I'm not that worried about that, and honestly would probably does up to the point of a few grams at once before stopping. While again obviously not a guarantee of safety, I have heard of others dosing that high before without serious consequences, and have even stumbled upon one report of an astounding eight(!) grams ingested accidentally without issue. However, I think it may also be worth considering that going by the most recent binding studies I'm familiar with mescaline's receptor activities may be more alike LSD and DMT than they are the other phenethylamines, so just being structurally similar to it may only mean so much. Still, it probably means something.... Some of them seem to be ridiculously safe for sure after all, like 2C-B which I've heard of being dosed in insane amounts (200-300+ mg) more than almost any other psychedelic and still haven't heard of a single death or serious health problem on it. I wouldn't be the first to take something like 2C-I *that* high though.


Come to think of it, I'm not sure I know the general mechanism of fatality with 2Cs either.... I'd want to guess maybe seizures? But how many fatalities caused by basic 2Cs have there actually even been?

I am quoting Shambles from the 2c-b Stage 1 thread below (sorry, I couldn't find a way to quote from the old thread). I've been doing a lot of reading on this compound since my experience was so fascinating. 


"  I found one 2C-B pill (somewhere between 15-25mg - they were quite variable) was *incredibly intense - almost unpleasantly so - first time I tried it, and so did Occasional Mrs Shambles who had the same. Other people had no problems at all. Was the first 2C compound I ever sampled and actually put me off for a while as that didn't seem like a heavy dose at all but I was almost delirious - going out of body and the like. Never had that since though - find it much nicer sniffed if you can cope with the burn.  "


*

I feel like I can relate to that first time part. I am definitely sensitive to this compound, normally I have typical reactions. 2c-b gave me experiences from psychedelics that I've never had before and wasn't expecting at all from a low dose of 2c-b - synesthesia, out-of-body type vision quests similar to lucid dreaming, entity contact, sensory distortion so strong that I lost touch with reality and myself. I was shook up by it a bit and at first overwhelmed by how visual it was. However, I feel that on a dose of acid that gives me mild visuals in comparison, the headspace might be more intense than this, and the experience overall more spiritual. I could still hold it together cognitively and have pretty clear thoughts on this, up until the peak. The experience changed me in a positive way, especially with empathy-related and antidepressent aftereffects. It changed the way I am proceeding with my future. It seems to have hit the reset button in a good way. But if I took a dose of acid high enough to give me that type of sensory experience, it would be well into the hundreds of micrograms and a serious commitment. 


On drugs like shrooms and 4-ho-met, I enter a philosopher mindset. It isn't really about the visuals at all, unless I am pondering them. I tend to think deeply and it's still a sensory experience (more in the mind), but whatever is in my mind at the time I will make all sorts of associations with to the point that I may never look at something conceptually the same way. This in contrast was a crazy sensory experience, and most 2c-x drugs I have tried are like that, but never to this extent. They also seem to be a lot more unpredictable dosage-wise compared to other families of psychedelics. 


But for all the philosophizing, I began to crave deeper sensory experiences. Presently, I'd like to explore just how far I can go in altering my sensory experience of reality. I definitely wouldn't call that recreational, in my case, it's just different than philosophizing like being on mushrooms at a party and ending up trying to explain some aspect of quantum physics to a drunk friend. If all psychedelics were the same apart from things like duration and onset it would be boring. So I think I might try 2c-t-7 after I have experimented with this one a little more, and start at a threshold dose, and not eat any of the health foods I have daily like fresh turmeric or raw cacao nibs for a few days before tripping that I have a gut feeling could interfere with metabolism of some weird psychoactive chem. I feel like this one has more to show me in the future, I definitely plan on taking it again at the same dose. 


This is just in hindsight.

mmm 20mg 2cb nasal and some nice noise cancelling headphones, I'm enjoying calvin harris radio at the moment it is so light and effortless, hearing things I never knew were there! The colors are definitely pretty and fascinating and lovely, **but 2CB is primarily a music enhancer**. Do yourself a favor and spend 10% of your months drugs budget on some nice noise cancelling headphones and you will never regret it. I want to get another one for wifey with a splitter or Bluetooth so we can both just jamout all wireless trippin balls 


[edit] I'm sereiously jamming out to a song that plays on repeat at work which typically annoy the fuck out of me,

 2CB = a winner. I'm sure ill laugh at myself in the morning this song is really annoying lol


more on topic tho: I had just done 10mg 2CE nasally (don't do this), about 2 days ago, and did not notice any significant tolerance effect on today's 2cb dose which was, in fairness, small unweighed spoon bumps, 2 small bumps til  I was where I wanted to be, but it didn't take much.


 Thinking back for next time, I might want to switch the dates of these trials, as 2CB is clearly more subtle and would (I think) benefit more from fresh receptors, than saving myself for 2CE's onslaught...like you could miss anything on that chem..what's the opposite of subtle?

Okay so I went on a bit of a 2C-B binge. Consumed about 150-175mg over the course of the week. I am still experiencing VERY subtle residual visuals. I dont think its HPPD. No walls breathing, or stationary movement. Words arent moving around while reading. Best way to describe it is everything is bright and colorful and blinking feels different from before. Hard to describe. 


Anyone else experience this?

Very familiar. :D

2C-B-Fly, MAL and 4-AcO-MET do it to me if taken in combos and in larger doses, usually goes on for almost a week. Sometimes when I blink I can catch a glimpse of a weird multi-color visual effect too - very quick colorful images of random sorts.

Okay thats relieving to hear. Was started to think I might have slightly broken my brain. LSD residual visuals have never lasted this long after dosing so I was starting to get a tad bit worried lol.

So, maybe if the body load is just based on stimulation, that can just vanish in really high doses depending on the drug and individual?

Concerning 5-meo-mipt;  I experienced the same reaction to it with high doses when I was taking it regularly.  Due to an error with my scale combined with irresponsibility (eye balling) I am sure I consumed 30+mg of it several different times thinking it was closer to 20mg or so.  When I would take it at that dose the worrying stimulation effects would go entirely away.  The entire nature of the substance would change and the body load would go away all together.  Instead of providing me with stimulation and a mild trippy head space it became a full on experience akin to Psilocybin.  It became very sedating in high doses and very visual.  It was possible to repeat this experience even if I had been using lower doses multiple times in the same week before shooting for 20-30mg.  I don't suggest anyone attempt it but at the time it did provide a very unique, fun, and worthwhile experience.


It reminded me a lot of higher doses of LSD where you could take multiple tabs and by-pass any unwanted effects common in the usual dosage range.  Meaning there is so much going on while on the peak you either don't notice or don't care about the body load.  I wish we had more information on these RC drugs so we could explore the higher end of them without worrying about health effects.  Maybe one day they'll actually get some study instead of begin regulated to the grey/black markets.

Yeah I agree, smoking weed on psychs even 2c-b can send it in a weird direction. I too love smoking weed on MDMA ahahaha, most people do, MDMA filters out any possible negative emotion that weed can bring on.


Ahhh, nothing like the after glow of a candy flip in the summer, finding a good spot on the beach and smoking enormous amounts of weed until the sun comes up with all your best friends.

had my first experiment with this compound last weekend... the dose was 25 mg 2c-b Hydrochloride, the come up wasnt bad and i felt absolutly no nausea... visuals were very very slight, little to no headspace, but great change in the mood, lot of stimulation and some time dilatation... I difenetly like it and look forward to try it in higher dose.. maybe 35mg.

To feel 2c-b right after coming down from lsd you'd want to take 2-3x the dose you would take without tolerance. IMO it's a waste of material but do what thou wilt

2C-B and LSD combined is one of the best drug combos I've ever tried.  But you should try to stack the peaks, not take it on the comedown.  LSD (any psychedelic really but lysergamides really seem to do it strongly) will have produced a ton of short-term tolerance right after the main effects, so taking something else is kind of a waste.

If I remember well, I think I've read in other posts from you that taking 2C-B 6 hours after dosing acid is a good way to combine the two, do you maintain that ? Do I have to lower/up my standard 2C-B dose ?... also, do I have to reduce my acid dose ? My standard dose for lysergamides is 150µg ... Thanks !

This. The combo rivals LSD and MDMA, and the peaks should be stacked. The trip is very visual and blissful.

I find it better to stack the peaks.  The time I combined them I took 2C-B like 2 hours into the LSD.  It was so beautiful, an inward journey that was intensely psychedelic yet warm and loving.    In my experience, when you're already coming down from a psychedelic, more psychedelics won't hit you as well as if you stack the peaks.


I'd say take a standard dose of each, that's what I did.  It'll be a lot stronger but that's probably what you want.

Not from experience with that particular situation but I generally assume that a reasonable dose of any 5ht2a psych will cause an immediate tolerance needing about 300% of the dose to reach the same effects. Based on a cross-tolerance chart that's somewhere out there.

On 2cb my buddy wanted more so offered him LSD.  I wished I had joined him in the end because it was one of his best trips ever.  32mg 2cb and LSD taken 2 hr later.  Still, I enjoyed the 2cb that night.  Allah, show me more!

I tried this combo (150µg Ald52 then 30mg 2CB 1h30 into the experience) and I can confirm: it's a total bliss that really rivals candy flipping ! I can say that for me at least i found it better than the combo Acid + MDMA...Positives:  Total bliss, the 2c-b took away all negatives feelings that one may experiment while on lysergamides, not a single moment of anxiety !....negatives: 2cb took away the "power of analysis in a deep way" that acid offer... I mean while on acid I can really think about things very fast and go really deep.. the 2cb makes my brain a little foggy

I also like the combo better than MDMA and LSD.  For me, the one time I did it, I had a really psychedelic journey, it was so colorful and blissful, yet really deep too.  I was laying down listening to music with my eyes closed, and I felt like I was 4 or 5 different creatures at once, lie my consciousness was split into equivalent geometric "slices" centered on my head.  I can't remember who all I was but I remember one of them might have been a dinosaur.

I was laying down listening to music with my eyes closed, and I felt like I was 4 or 5 different creatures at once, lie my consciousness was split into equivalent geometric "slices" centered on my head.  I can't remember who all I was but I remember one of them might have been a dinosaur.

Do you remember the doses? I only experiment being more than one personne one time in my life  and it was the first time that i smoked a good amont of a really good weed on the come down of MDMA, Back on those days i had litlle to no tolerence for both MDMA and weed.. and felt like I was two personnes: the first was me watching TV (the real me) and the second was outside in a coffe with some friends... for about 15 min I literally was living two lives at the same time !! when i came back I found it hilarious and laughed a lot !

If I recall I had 2 hits of LSD and then added 20mg of 2C-B rectally (which is around 35-40mg orally) about 3 hours in.  Originally I was going to just do the LSD but it didn't get as strong as I wanted so I added 2C-B.


This was in 2006 or 2007, so I can't be sure I remember right.

Is there anyone who had mixed 2C-B with 5Meo-Mipt? I'm Thinking about doing this combo next WE (20mg 2c-b and 14 mg 5meo at the same time) if it goes well and safe.

It'll be perfectly safe.  I haven't done it, but it sounds like it would be a great combo.

Thanks Xorkoth... However I would like to know what effects I have to expect and if there will be any synergy... if not, I will report back about this combo next monday ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ...

FWIW plugging 20mg 2cb was INSANE. 


I went from sober to like near DMT level visuals in the span of a few minutes and stayed tripping that hard for at least a few hrs


edit: also my most powerful 2cb experience was after eating a shitton of cacao just like satori

Hey SONN!  Long time no see!


Yeah, plugging 2C-Xs is my favorite ROA, it comes on very strong, and quickly, without the burn of snorting (snorting 2C-Xs is truly horrific), at half the dose, with reduced bodyload.

Hey guys, I've posted about this before but I'll say it here since this is the 2C-B Thread.


I don't think snorting 2c-b is a good idea. For a while me and my buddies just sucked up the pain and snorted it, since it seemed to sort of produce the best effects once the initial pain/come up was over. But if the sheer pain isn't enough to convince you it might be doing damage to your sinuses...


I tried subbing ~5-10mg of the stuff a while back. I put the tiny pile in my lip like you would chewy tobacco. And after about an hour of just a slight stinging, I checked inside my lip and it had completely taken off a layer of skin where it was sitting. Obviously skin in the mouth is very thin hence why subbing works, but that same logic sort of applies to snorting it, and boy does that hurt a million times more. I shudder to think the stuff was sloughing off layer of skin in my sinuses.


Just eat the stuff, or plug it if you're comfortable with that. I used to have nasty stomach problems from eating it, just general bloating and nausea, but I've sorted this by taking stomach settling aids, eating a hearty meal no less than 3 hours beforehand, and avoiding having the couple beers pregame I was doing before taking the dose. 


Also, another sort of experimental way of taking it that I've devised; the mouth sprayer! Basically, I had created the 2C-B nasal spray that I read about, but it was honestly just nasty as fuck, still burned and had a ton of drip. But, it was already all mixed up, so with a chaser of sorts on hand, you can do a few sprits in your mouth and chase it down. This beats having a ton of small dosed caps and you can regulate your dose nicely over the course of the night.


On the topic of dosing over the course of a night, can someone explain to me how 2C-B tolerance works in layman's terms as to how you can dose it all night whereas most psychedelics dont work that way?

Why have I never tried this?  Probably because I tried plugging dexedrine when I was in college and the burn frightened me.

when I plugged 2c-b I stupidly mixed it with some alcohol which probably made the trip less clean feeling

Last time I had 2cb was around 4 hours after id come up on 220ug of acid, I IM'd 10mg or therabouts along with 150mg of ketamine just after the 2cb comeup and had an out of body experience. It was very intense, very colourful and mostly calm. The weed & L were the culprits of making it wild! Fractals galore, portals opening(thats the K), there was one entity in the form of an old lady watching over/protecting me from my slightly open door. Wish I had have smoked some DMT that night, im sure it would have been awesome!

I think you haven't been tripping real long, am I remembering right?  Everyone has terrifying trips sometimes, it's normal.  Sometimes something kicks your ass unexpectedly.  Those are high doses on a combo, with weed.  The weed probably is the thing that really kicked it into overdrive.

Right ! I start tripping on october 2016.. had what I was thinking as "bad trip" maybe 4 or 5 times on lysergamides (essentially feeling sad the most duration of the trip, sometimes break on tears for a while, or some manageable fear) but nothing that's like that damn horrific one

I had a trip on 2C-E and weed once, where my reality deconstructed entirely and I felt myself dissolving into an absolute void.  I became convinced that if I reached the peak I would cease to exist and so would the whole universe, that I would end everything forever and completely.  I was the most terrified I've ever felt, just raw, animal panic.  I grabbed a kitchen knife and seriously contemplated killing myself with it because I thought it would interrupt the trip and I'd be reborn and everything would be fine.  Obviously I didn't actually end up doing it, part of me accepted I might just be tripping and then I sort of accepted my mistake that would end the universe, and when I hit the peak I just blinked and it was 30 minutes later and I was past the peak.  Took a little while to figure it all out but I look back on it as one of my most profound and amazing trips.  I've also had other trips where I fully believed I was dying.

Yeah generally adding weed is the number one cause of people freaking out.  Honestly though you just need to expect that sometimes your trips are gonna be rough or frightening or even outright terrifying.  It's just part of it.  I mean the vast majority of my trips are not difficult ones, but occasionally they are.  And when they are, they'll pass, and you'll be fine.

Will 2mg of etizolam oral before 15mg rectally of 2-cb ruin the trip?


I have taken 1mg of xanax before a 2-cb dosage and it really helped the trip of the comeup.


2-cb is fairly sacred around these parts so I dont not want to waste but also have the most fun with it.


Thanks!

Thats a lot to handle, before adding in weed, let alone after. 

I have been using psychedelics for over 20 years, i wouldnt feel the need to go that hi in doses.


Of course, i have done reckless doses before, but realize that less is actually more. If more is more, then keep chasing until you work through that.

I sound a bit facetious or righteous, i dont mean that. But it does underpin the comments about how weed can be the trigger.


For example, drug 1 and drug 2 may be ok together.

Drug 1 and 2 and 3 may go well too.

However, drug 1 and weed could be straight to bad trip land.


It also can be set and setting, but im guessing you got that already. 

Best of luck

Honestly though you just need to expect that sometimes your trips are gonna be rough or frightening or even outright terrifying.  It's just part of it.  I mean the vast majority of my trips are not difficult ones, but occasionally they are.  And when they are, they'll pass, and you'll be fine.

Recommendations on dosages combo with MDMA? 


Separately, I usually take 25-30mg of 2C-B and anywhere from 125-175mg MDMA depending on how hard I want to roll.


I?ll be in a mostly private space with a lot of friends. I?m looking to probably feel the roll the most but I want the psychedelia as well.

When I do that combo I take my normal doses of both, but I take the 2c-b on the comedown as it seems to really pick up where the m leaves off. Highly recommended to go this route

Does the 2c-b take away the mdma comedown feelings? I can?t imagine that a trip would be fun if you?re feeling all the negative comedown feels.

I've never had negative effects on the comedown from mdma so I can't speak to that, but it's definitely a euphoric feeling above and beyond that of the 2c-b alone. It's also an extremely good combination for sex

  I found that spacing enough your roll (one month at least) and taking a light to normal dose of mdma is a very effective way to reduce/eliminate negatives effects of the comedown.  as for the doses, like said just before, i do my usuals doses for both, but i had never stuck de peaks, i always take 2C-B 3 hours after taking mdma... good combo by the way !

Yeah, fat dose of 2cb, even fatter dose of 4-ho-mipt (erowid dose scale doesn't even go past 30mg) plus a joint to yourself. Not to mention you had been taking MDMA all day, that certainly would add into it as well. You just took a shit ton of drugs and had a shit ton of an experience lol, not a lot more to it.


Don't mean to sound like a broken record but weed just makes psychedelics really intense, especially ones that are already mentally intense. I don't notice the increase as much with more transparent psychedelics like 2C-B. I remember A couple years ago I took mushrooms with probably a dozen people, tail end of the trip we ended up in a small room playing music, being social, everyone is talking, etc. Rolled a joint and it went around ONCE and everyone became dead silent.

Going to do some 2c-b tomorrow. When I first tried it ~2 years ago, I was always snorting it. Which was fucking awful, and I would never do it again, it really resulted in a better high than eating it. I used to snort like 30mg at once and it was an absolute blast once you get past the initial ~20 minutes of extreme pain (lol). Snorting it resulted in a high energy, intensely visual trip. I can't eat more than 20mg without getting a ton of bodyload n nausea, and an overall sluggish and subdued trip.

Yeah I mean, if i wanted to do 30mg, i'd rather do one 30mg bump than 3x10mg bumps, since you're putting yourself through that pain 3 times lol. I feel like past 10mg the size of the bump probably doesn't it make it that much painful. We tried doing it in tiny 2-5mg bumps, but overall just made your nose hurt for a way longer time and not that much less.Just sucks that eating it I can't get the same effects, most of my friends who also snorted it seemed to feel the same way.Does anyone know if taking 2c-b orally mixed into some warm tea drank over ~5-10 minutes would be easier on the stomach and body than taking the same dose in a gel cap?

I've long since sworn off snorting it, though. I've always read that sits likely terrible for your sinuses, shits caustic. I haven't snorted it since I tried subbing just 5mg and it burned off a layer of skin on the inside of my lip lol

  I've never found 2C-B nauseous, everybody is different (obviously), I've read in this thread that pluggin it is the best way to take this material for those who suffer from sides effects on it, if you go for this ROA be carefull cause you have to take roughly 50% of your standard oral dose to got same effects.    other option is to take a spoon of dry ginger (powder) with some water the moment you begin to feel nausea, for me it always kicks nausea away almost instantantly.. anyway keep us updated ;-)

Yeah snorting 2Cs has to be absolutely terrible for your nose, it burns SO BAD, easily the worst burn of any substance class I've tried... they all burn similarly too.  I've also caused a burn in my mouth from trying to do sublingual.  Rectal admin is fine as long as you don't make a super concentrated solution.  I have always pretty much used 3mL of water, which is what fits in a reasonable oral-turned-rectal syringe I have, and there is no burn.  When you snort it though it's just laying there on your sensitive nasal membranes, burning away.

Wow, okay. 2C-B + MDMA is indeed a great combination. 


I took 150mg of super clean MDMA - came up super fast, rolled really hard, etc. Almost exactly three hours after dosing I ingested ~30mg of 2C-B. And you were all so right, it completely negated any of the comedown feelings of MDMA. In fact, I felt like it extended my roll while adding really awesome visuals on top of it. My headspace was still somewhat clear but at the peak of the 2C-B is was kind of hard to talk, I'll attribute this to a lot of weed smoking throughout the night. I also did a couple of bumps of DCK throughout the night but they didn't have a strong impact on the trip/roll. 


Total effects tapered off for the most part about 6 hours after ingesting the MDMA. This doesn't sound like a long time compared to something like LSD, but the effects were strong for the entire time. It was perfect for the situation (hotel afterparty with many many friends), I would probably dose lower of each for something more public like a show or festival though.

Glad I took just 20mg the other night. Didn't realize it being st. patricks day would have such an extreme effect on the state of the show and entire downtown area. Spent a good hour of the come-up and trip in line at the venue with people puking, getting into fights and general shittiness. Whole vnue inside was the most packed I'd ever seen, smelled of stale booze and everyone inside looked as if they had been in there binge drinking since the afternoon.


2C-B certainly has a higher "general banter tolerance" than LSD or mushrooms, but this night was seriously pushing it. Probably wouldn't have dosed if I knew what I was getting myself into lol. Nearly puked in line just seeing/thinking about people puking. 


And yeah, as usual, 20mg, lots of uncomfortable bodyload until the trip was well on its way.

Rectal ROA trial was a success the other day. Dissolved 150mg of 2c-b in 15ml of purified water. Then plugged 0.5ml using an oral syringe, for a 5mg dose. 


First 30 mins had a slightly elevated HR and minor muscle tension, after that it was smooth as anything. Light headspace, very minor OEVs when focusing on a scene, heightened ability to visualize with eyes closed, empathogenic effects prominent. Made some good therapeutic progress during some inner work. Was almost fully back to baseline after 2.5 hours. 


The whole experience underlined the friendliness of 2c-b at low doses. Had an accessible window into that 'Other World', but was able at any time to relocate awareness and see to everyday concerns. Amazing substance.


Next time, going for 6mg, same ROA.

So I purchased what vendor says is 20mg 2C-B pills but based on all trip reports I read, still have some confusion about the dosage, while it is 2C-B. I tested it with 4 different reagents, all as it should be. Would like to know your opinion about the Nexus-flip I wanna do. I got good 140mg of MDMA crystal (my usual dose for my 90kgs) and I would take one 2C-B pill 3h in (20mg). 


About the previous tries, when I got it last week, I tried half a pill at 10pm, since this is my first psychedelic (mainly chose it for somewhat clear mind). I barely felt the dose, maybe just some hightened sociability but really just a tiny bit. Me and my girl had sex after good 2h after dose, felt a little different but barely. I redosed 3/4 of the pill after 3h from inital dose and nothing seemed to be happening, just that I wasnt really sleepy and I eventually fell asleep about 7-8h after inital dose. 


I guess that tasting lead me to believe I would need one pill and a 3/4 to hit me. I did it yesterday before noon, 3 days after first try. Since it was my first real comeup, I felt pretty uncomfortable with the bodyload (from 35 to 70 minutes into) and felt the need to walk it off. I went for a hike in the woods. I put my HR belt on and Suunto watch to monitor HR just in case, cuz I was a little panicky - hence the first time psychedelic experience. HR never went above 130 (hike is a little uphill), but I noticed that on some times it was fairly low at 75 which was weird to me with what I was feeling. Anyway after that bodyload subsided, it felt nice being in the woods. Colors were nicer, but I wouldnt say overly saturated or specially strong. I also didnt have any OEVs, CEVs only after few minutes eyes closed, but very subtle, nothing big. And this was about 1,5 or 2h into the trip. So this dose should be around 30-35mg but I highly doubt it. I was back at home at about 3-4h mark and started cooking lunch. Was a bit clumpsy but everything else was pretty normal. Oh, I had a little better sense of smell and taste I noticed.


Now I hope I make some sense when I say I'm a little confused about the dosage. So I will go to this party friday eve, its a club with very family atmosphere, I know the guys DJing, I know people usually coming there, will be there with my girl (she will only be doing recommended 1.3mg/kg of MDMA). There probably wont be more than a 100 people, also alot of room to step aside, sit down, go out etc, so with set and setting I see no problem. Also with every roll I use alot of supplements (ALA, ALCAR, Vitamin C and E, ECGC, NAC, Magnesium and towards morning I have a capsule of electrolytes because I sweat a fair amount dancing). 


Based on what I described, how much of 2C-B you'd recommend I take? Will supplements power and prolongue the roll of 2C-B too? What about the tolerance? Friday will be approx 90h after last roll.

It sounds like you're very eager to trip hard. You need to space out your dosing way more to get full effects from a regular dose. Based on what you said I don't see much reason to think your pills are underdosed.


You first took 10mg, which is a low dose so it makes sense you didn't get much effect. Redosing psychedelics is usually useless unless you take a huge redose. The additional 15mg might have prolonged things a bit but that's about it.


3 days later your tolerance is still around 200% of what it was before your initial dose, so the 30-35 mg would have hit more like 15mg, a nice light trip which sounds like what you got. 


Generally you want to wait at least a week, preferably two, between psychedelic doses to make full use of them. It's not like M which allows you to redose or roll semi-frequently (though really you shouldn't be rolling more than once every three months or so).


I have no idea if the supplements would change 2C-B in any way, if anything they might make it come up faster or prevent some metabolization, effectively increasing your dose. These are claimed to happen when you supplement M but I never noticed any difference and don't bother with supplements anymore except some Tums before and 5-htp after. The research is pretty spotty about neurotoxicity anyway.

Yes, eager indeed. I just recently discovered these things, I was in the dark for first 31 years ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). Thanks for all the explanations, I understand what happened better. 


So do you think it has no point of doing the nexus flip thing because of the tolerance and 20mg 2C-B wont do a thing? This is my only chance before august since I wont use MDMA until the festival I'm going to. If advised against by more experienced, I will not do the flip. I have enough of respect for substances and am very thankful, that I found this now and not in my reckless teenage years.

It's not that there's no point, you would just have to take more 2C-B, which personally I would consider wasteful but if you don't care about the cost it's fine.


I love the MDMA + 2C-B combo and highly recommend it for what it's worth. I don't think you're too inexperienced or anything, 2C-B is a pretty gentle psychedelic mentally speaking. 


That said it would be difficult to give you a proper estimate for how much to take next time without having a precise timeline of what you have taken so far. I'm not clear on how long it's been since your last dose of 2C-B and when exactly you intend to try again.

Regarding psychedelics, MDMA, and parties (from my own experiences, and also observing those around me), it's not worth doing MDMA more than once every few weeks *at most* - you just start digging yourself into a kind of serotonin debt. I've seen a fair few ravers go down into depression and general social/mental unhealth by abusing MDMA in this way. There are those who seem to have pulled off periods in their lives where they were hitting MDMA pretty hard and emerged apparently unscathed. To me, it's not worth the risk, I've seen too many burnouts.


In terms of risk, proper psychedelics (2C-B, LSD, mushrooms) seem to be lot more forgiving if you take them often, and also self-limiting - most people just don't feel like taking them again and again and again, and also they just become less and less effective. I've taken PDs plenty of times 2 or 3 days in a row at festivals or parties, and they actually do keep working if the vibes are good, you don't dose too high, you come down properly in between and get plenty of rest and recovery. It's definitely not something to make a habit out of, nor should you seek repeated peak experiences/dosages, but low to medium party doses seem to work a couple of days in a row I find.


20+ years of raving has taught me that music, community and vibe are absolutely #1. Psychedelics are a really nice way to enhance all that but should never be the primary focus of partying. And finally, for extremely special and rare occasions, a bit of MDMA with or without a PD like 2C-B or LSD.

I understand. About the timeline I mentioned everything in my original post, will write again to clarify more. So one week ago tried 10mg + T+3h 15mg, 3 days after that 30-35mg, Nexus flip four days after 30-35mg. Looking at it now, its really close spaced. So based on what you said and general psychedelic tolerance tomorrow I need 400% of my first dose, so that would be 50-60mg? That seems quite a lot and even if that is true for 2C-B tolerance for me too, I wouldnt do it. Too scary. Also as it is potentiating M effects too.


Price isnt really an issue, so I probably will take the recommended M dosage for me and then pop one pill 2h in. If I slightly feel it, should I take another or just let it slide this time with one and try this in a few months time?


Anyway, thank you for your time and answers, I learned a lot.


@perpetualdawn, nice way to put it. Thanks.

Yes, based on my calculations which you should absolutely not rely on, you would need to roughly double your last dose, so take about 70mg, to achieve the effects of about 20mg tolerance-free.


Again I would avoid redosing the 2C-B within the same session unless you have a huge supply and just don't care about the cost. Your 20mg dose is going to feel close to 6mg, if you end up feeling that at all. If you took another pill afterwards you would be adding about 2mg extra to the trip. Note that I'm basing this all off the ubiquitous 'psychedelic tolerance chart' and my math is spotty at best, it's not clear how to calculate for frequent dosing.


Taking a huge dose all at once is definitely daunting even if your tolerance is high, and not something I'd necessarily recommend unless experienced with a high dose of the substance anyway. Generally I'd just say it's better to be patient and wait for your tolerance to return to baseline.

Ok hold up though, I vaguely remember reading in multiple places that 2c-b tolerance does not work the same as other psychs like mushrooms or lsd, that you can keep building up your dose with smaller doses or something like that? I'll try to find it.


EDIT: So nothing entirely conclusive or scientific, but if you google "2cb tolerance" a bunch of discussion come up about how the short term tolerance isn't nearly as pronounced as it usually is with other psychedelics. Some people even claiming to having taken the same dose 4 days in a row for the same effect, which is most certainly not possible with LSD.

You may be completely right, hence the caveat of my source for these calculations. That said it may also depend on personal metabolism or something. OP's experiences do seem to line up fairly well with that same rate of tolerance buildup though

Thanks. After some thought when I googled 2C-B tolerance and experience, there are inconclusive statements for one side or the other. Didnt want to risk awsome night I just finished, so I decided against 2C-B this time. M lingering on a train ride back home, 2C-B will wait for me to explore further, especially his effects on me.

I look forward to taking a larger, more "psychedelic" dose. The stimulation is wonderful and fortunately not in a jittery/edgy sense. Nothing feels forced about the experience. I feel foolish for not having weighed the dose but famously I thought "a little bump to test the waters"

Anyone else feel this stuff gives quite a hangover sometimes? It's fantastic stuff though.


Took ~27mg last, later than I had planned, was up until like 5am but just laid in bed unable to really sleep until like 10am. Obviously sleep deprived, but I ended up with a massive headache, and even now (8pm) I've eaten and am well hydrated still have a gnarly headache. This had happened before but I notice it doesn't happen every time.


It's not like a mood or mental hangover, just physically feel wrecked and tired. Head hurts lol.

Yeah, I have gotten that from 2C-B and particularly 2C-D before. I don't know if it's the drug itself (most likely, I think) or just a tension headache from the muscle tension they can cause. I haven't had any since I started taking a chelated magnesium supplement with my dose

I've never had a hangover from any 2C, I usually feel great the next day, unless I got drunk on the tail end.  But to be fair I get very few negative effects from psychedelics, I even think the come-ups are comfortable these days.

Anyone tried microdosing this stuff? Or maybe not so micro and just low dose?


When I take 2c-b, I find it to be quite stimulating and I become very sensitive to sounds in the same way I do with other psychedelics. But 2c-b is so clear headed and stimulating, it feels as if it could be more productive. I like to design sounds, and often when I take 2c-b I'm far away from a setting where I'd be working creatively, but I hear sounds in my head that I've never heard before. Treat it like a psychedelic adderall almost.

I tried it recently, by insufflating very small lines until I felt the dose was right. It was nice, quite productive and it gave the world a nice vibe and put some energy in my body. Conversation flowed. But it's also kind of disconcerting when you can see partially for.ed fractals on the carpet. IME the line between inactive and working is very fine with 2c-b.

How similar is this compound to 2C-P?  I've always wanted to try this one but sadly the 2Cs seem to elude me.  Any time I've been offered 2C-B I've been weary about trying it because I was never sure if it was what the person said it was.  Sounds like a beautiful experience.

From what I've heard, it's not especially similar to 2C-P, a material frequently compared to 2C-E.  While they will have superficial similarities as they are in the same family, 2C-E is arguably the most deep/intense psychedelic so far discovered, while 2C-B is among the lightest. It is all subjective, of course, but that seems to be widely held to be the case.


I've never tried true microdosing of 2C-xs, but threshold doses of 2C-B and 2C-E were terrible for my motivation, clarity, and productivity. 2C-D at a threshold dose offered some benefit to my creativity and energy level, but the negatives outweighed the positives for me

I've only tried 2C-P and 2C-T-7 out of the family but I feel like these wouldn't be useful for microdosing either.  The one time I attempted 2C-T-7 as a low dose it felt like I was getting all the bad aspects of the experience with little of the good.  It seems like you have to break through the wall until the experience becomes something worth attempting.  Odd because other substances that I've microdosed provided enjoyment/good effect.  I've mainly only microdosed LSD and it always made for an eventual day at work.  Just become hard to gauge the dose sometimes, there were a couple of times where I took a little too much and had to deal with being too spaced out and paranoid to enjoy the microdose.

I've always figured the reason 2c-d was the 2c-x considered a smart drug was because the dose response curve isn't so tight, and and so you get a lot more lenient with your dosing. I might try microdosing 2c-b again, but instead using an solution that I can more accurately dose.

What still puzzles me is the psychopharmacological action of 2C-B. I, IMHO, would classify it as "classical" psychedelic (in the sense of 5HT2A-partial-agonism) with entactogenic/empathogenic properties; but according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-B) its action is primarly interacted with the 5HT2C receptor, with only little/nothing/even antagonizing the 5HT2A receptor? Another thig that puzzles me is: is this the right space to ask for, or is the [Neuroscience and Pharmacology Discussion](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/forums/155-Neuroscience-and-Pharmacology-Discussion) a better place to ask?

It's fine here but you'll probably get more detailed responses in NPD

Yesterday I had the pleasure of taking 2C-B again, this time at 20 mg (I describe my first 2C-B trial at 15 mg in more detail [here](https://www.bluelight.org/xf/threads/2c-b-15-mg-first-time-gentle-awareness.880057/)). I don't think I'll bother writing another full trip report for this one, since it was qualitatively similar enough, but I do want to give a brief summary of my trip, and an update on my thoughts about 2C-B in general.


Again, it was a very smooth yet enjoyable ride, delivering an elegant and balanced rendition of the essential effects that I've come to expect from my favorite psychedelic drugs.


As expected, some of the more obvious differences between 15 and 20 mg involved the hallucinogenic or sensory aspects. This time, I was more focused on open-eye than closed-eye visuals. I spent the majority of the trip outdoors in the daylight. Textures on the surfaces of objects were flowing like rivers, and I saw figures in the clouds. Sounds were also enhanced in a way that reminded me of 4-HO-MiPT: random noise took on a pleasantly musical quality.


I did plenty of satisfying introspection, as well. I felt like I was beginning to grasp just how much energy I waste worrying about my self-image, pandering to others instead of being true to myself.


I recall hearing 2C-B described as "LSD Lite"; as silly and trivializing as that sounds, I can actually sympathize quite a bit with that sentiment. While they do have their differences in character, I think that both LSD and 2C-B ultimately scratch a similar itch for me, with LSD providing a more pronounced effect at the cost of heavier side effects like cognitive impairment and body load. Stronger isn't necessarily better, and lately I've been partial to subtler trips. However, I'm glad I have access to more extreme materials like LSD (and others such as 2C-E) for when the set and setting allow.

So after having given 2C-C a try I now impulsively decided to take 2C-B yesterday. Prepared a gelcap of 15 mg, 30 mins in I felt something happening, thought this is too little, took another 10-15 mg, memory is hazy on that, scale went off just as I was adding a tiny bit of powder more when the scale read 8-9 mg, so about ~15 I assume.


That was a mistake, lmao. When it finally fully kicked in after an hour and a half I was pretty tired already, so after an hour of coming up to the peak I was like oh boy, this is going to take longer than I expected. It wasn't as euphoric as the 2C-C imo, stimulation was there but very contained, only at the end of the peak I felt some jitters and actual tension (just overstretched my neck again), so I took some (more) etizolam (took a mg 3-4 hours before dosing too). Certainly helped, didn't really stop anything but some restlesness and took off anxiety about the pain I had, oev's were still there after 6 hours, last 2 hours I was at least able to read again without having to strain myself and my eyes.


But there were definitely some similarities to mdma, the beginning of the first hour I was thinking that anyways. After the visuals became all-encompassing I had to close my eyes, felt weightlesnesss for a little bit and  the moment I opened them again rainbow sparkles and colour fluidity all over, but swirly kaleidascopic, not as cartoonish as 2C-C, a bit warping alien. The trip was very manageable but not as friendly as 2C-C where I had a constant smile on my face, it was more along the lines of 2C-D, sometimes pretty infuencable by some bad vibes from music or whatever I was watching/thinking of, other times very enjoyable and even more so, sometimes some surges of ecstacy coursing down my spine whenever I was feeling completely immersed in the visuals/headpsace.


Perhaps 15 -20 mg is enough for a next trial, without having doses a benzo beforehand, this might've influenced the onset and intensity somewhat, or not and it was simply too little. I think I like 2C-C more from just the 1 trial with each of them, even 2C-I which I haven't taken in a while is a bit more manageable imo, more stimulation though, I could sit still or even lie down on 2C-B, but don't think I could keep my legs still on 2C-I.


Good stuff anyways. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

2C-B is surprisingly potent, I've found.  Back in the day I used to have to take more but these days 20mg is as strong as 30mg of 2C-C for me, I took 30mg the first time I got my first batch I've had in many years, and I could barely see from the visuals.

Took 2 tabs of 2cb this morning, said to have 25mg in each. I'm little sceptic of that amount, because this "50mg" feels more like 20-30 mg. Anyways, it's nice to feel 2cb again.

Nice ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 2C-B pills are notoriously underdosed, which is a shame because some might actually be the right dosage. 

Hope it was good

From the moment I first heard about 2C-B, it went to the top of my psychedelic bucket list. Have some (hopefully) 20mg presses on the way. I'm pumped the hell up, boys.

From what I can see 2c-b pills are never any good whatever bull shit they claim - tried the QDance green Mario pills saturday; said to be 25mg so took 2 - total waste of time - you would need 5 of these to get going so likely 5mg each? Who knows? Got 2 more of the shitty things; was going to dissolve them and try plugging them; doubt it will be enough tho.  2c-b always works out so stupidly expensive I've never really had a full go in 20 years - you pay over the top for say 10 doses and then discover it's 2 goes so it no longer seems worth pursuing sadly

I have been combining 2C-B with DMT and I am loving the synergy. Even a sub breakthrough hit of D is enough to add this mystical, shamanistic vibe to 2C-B. Its almost as if it pulls more of the "mescalito" nature out of the 2C-B. All in its been beautiful and look forward to more of this pairing.

Oh yeah 2C-B and DMT combine fantastically.  So do 2C-B and LSD, by the way.

Hey all, here's an unusual experience I've had with 2C-B.

A while ago I had a very early flight so I decided to spend the night packing up and watching something on a low dose of 2c-b instead of sleeping for like 3 hours. I figured the stimulation wouldn't let me sleep and I would have some fun too. 

Now as I've gone through almost 1gr of 2c-b over the last couple of years, I know my doses well. 10 mg for a nice visual and emotional enhancer that is perfectly controllable outdoors, 15 for a more intense visually fun and 25 for a nice and fast “in your face“ ride, with 35 getting into unpleasant bodily sensations. Anyway, I've weighted 10 mg and swallowed them in a capsule. 

In around 40 minutes I realised that the visuals were getting way more intense than I was used to from such a low dose. I was also entering the PEA mind space very quickly. How could this happen from mere 10 mg? It was too late to ponder so I turned up the music and laid back. Luckily I had gathered my luggage by then.

In the morning (not like it took too long to arrive, lol, I left home at 5 AM while still tripping) I thought about this unexpectedly strong experience and the only conclusion I could come up with was that the sugary snacks I'd consumed throughout the evening (my last ”real” meal was over 6 hours before that) somehow intensified my trip. Have you guys noticed anything similar in your trips? Is this the ”sugar high” interacting with 2c-b? ![o_O](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png)

-----------‐

Also I'd like to know your recommended timings for LSD + 2C-B. I plan on taking 150 mcg and then 15 mg 3 hours later - how's that?

I very much doubt sugar affected your trip. Psychedelics can be extremely variable in regards to dosage, and that's likely what you experienced. Many of us have had weak trips off high doses or strong trips off low doses, and it sounds like you experienced the latter. I've personally experienced this with 2C-B, also. One evening I did a low dose of 10-12mg with a friend, and 3-4hrs into the trip, when I put on a psybass album, I unexpectedly brokethrough to a half hyperspace kind of place.

Nearly 3 months with no posts? Sad to see what may be the ultimate recreational drug (imo) getting so little love


I went through around 120mg staggered over a 4 hour period last night. The main thing I learned is that if you want to dose much more than 50mg at any given time then you want to use a different ROI than oral. The bodyload starts getting quite uncomfortable at this range and of particular note is the bladder tension, I just felt like I constantly needed to pee for 3-4 hours.


Anyway, that aside it was a pretty good time. I was trying to to find my ceiling for oral doses and I think I found it.


Now, nasal or boofing going forward that is the question. Both are very unappealing in their own way.

The chills are a bummer in winter but it doesn't bother me too much in the summer. Keep a blanket to hand. Physical side effects like that seem to be more pronounced when you dose orally so you could trying snorting or boofing instead and see if that helps.


There may be other supplements you can try to improve circulation but I haven't really looked into it. Actually, I've never even supplemented magnesium before so I'll be trying that next time.

Wow, that is the highest dose I have probably ever heard of.  I usually take 25-30mg, myself.  Back in the day I used to take more, but I seem to be getting increasingly sensitive to psychedelics as I get older.


2C-B is great stuff and will probably always be around, it is one of the few "RCs" to have broken through into the mainstream.

I seem to have a fairly high tolerance to it, while the mood enhancement and lovely  body high are there at 20mg, I don't usually start getting any visual effects until I'm past 30. Whenever I hear people talking about their 'crazy visuals' on 20mg (nevermind the kids on Reddit claiming to be 'tripping balls' after 1 underdosed pill) I have to question whether we're taking the same drug. I suppose it's all subjective.


I've settled on 30+15mg (redose after 60-90 otherwise the peak subsides as soon as I start enjoying myself) as my go to dose for a while now, last night I just got carried away because I had a night to myself for the first time in weeks and that happened to be how much 2C-B I had on me.


I hope it's around for a long time too, the rest of my life ideally as it's certainly my favourite recreational drug. 


Out of curiousity, what's your preferred ROI? I think I've seen you talking about boofing elsewhere but 30mg that way would be pretty potent.

Whenever I hear people talking about their 'crazy visuals' on 20mg (nevermind the kids on Reddit claiming to be 'tripping balls' after 1 underdosed pill) I have to question whether we're taking the same drug.

My sweet spot used to be 36mg followed by a redose of 72.


Oral is the best ROA it's like it's metabolized differently

I much prefer taking it orally as well but it seems like there's a limit to how far I can go before the negative aspects of the bodyload detract from the trip. In future I think if I'm wanting to dose much higher than 50mg in a single dose I'll supplement with a nasal spray.


Anyone know how long 2C-B can last in a saline solution? I kept my last one for a couple of months and it felt like it was less effective the last time I used it but it could have just been crap technique on the day. I find them a bit finicky to use.

I personally don't find it to be particularly visual when taken orally. That's more something I get from intranasal use. Like you, I have to get to 30mg+ before that develops via an oral ROA, and that's also when the bodyload starts to become annoying.

Would the salt in the saline not do that? I’m not sure how I feel about ethanol up the nose, but then I suppose it would be highly diluted.


In other news, I was wondering what people had noticed in terms of colour variation between different salts? I’ve heard that HBR can be either tan/brown or white and that HCL is pretty much always white. This has been my experience in the past but I’ve had a gram of (Allegedly) HCL come in today which is tan bordering on yellow, a bit paler than DMT perhaps. 


Has anyone else noticed colour differences between batches of HCL or is it always white? I’m guessing it just be a bad synth or just mislabelled HBR.

There's going to be some 2cb in the house sometime soon ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


I'm very excited, I have only done 2cb proper once, and that was a 10mg nasal dose. It was fun but I don't think I captured the full character. I have much more experience with 2ci and 25b-NBOxx

It wouldn't even have to be a bad synth, a tiny, tiny impurity can result in substantial coloring.  Not necessarily something to worry about.


I have seen white and gray/tan.

Hi. Is 2c-b OK to dilute in ethanol, or some alcohol drink like vodka? The goal is to get a more accurate dosing by weighing a larger amount of about 500mg or so, and reducing the typical +-5mg scale deviation for doses of just 20mg. I've read some analogues like bk-2C-Bare not appropiate for diluting since they degrade in contact with water and wonder if this happens with 2c-b too, or is it ok and would be stable on alcohol solution.

Absolutely! These days I end up dosing via a vodka solution 90% of the time. I consider it to be one of the more viable options for ensuring dosage consistency  . Just ensure that you use a graduated cylinder + a mg scale for measurement and find a good syringe + storage bottle to dose with. Some people like to store their solutions in the fridge but I don't find that to be necessary as phenethylamines don't degrade very easily.

Hadn't tried 2C-B in a few years and wasn't even planning to trip, but I took a few mg sublingually last night. I started feeling pretty good so I kept repeating this every 15 minutes or so for the next couple hours. I didn't take much in total, maybe 20mg if I had to guess, but it was a really impactful experience.


When it first started setting in I was having a lot of intrusive thoughts. Normally I deal with these by actively trying to block them out or reacting in some ego-driven way about why they shouldn't bother me, but this time I just sat there in faced them. Just actively focusing on them and they would then just sort of dissolve. I think this was really helpful because when I was coming down I realized that I'd had none of these thoughts for the remainder of the experience.


About 3-4 hours in it really started to remind me of MDMA. A very pure euphoria, and a complete emotional openness without any vulnerability. I felt so compelled to change things in my life that I wasn't satisfied with. Was looking up experiences that I could have in the coming year that would take me out of my comfort zone. And I ended up making a list of major things that I have wanted to do but have continually put off.


Anyways, just thought that if anyone's looking to manifest the empathogenic side of 2C-B, that titration is a good way to achieve it. One time I had something similar when I kept mixing small amounts of 2C-C in some beers and I got a lot of effects reminiscent of MDMA that time as well. Didn't get a migraine last night from 2C-B last night either. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It absolutely has a lot to do with how often you trip, tripping more frequently starts to produce physical tolerance, and even if you wait 2 weeks between doses, it also produces what I call behavioral tolerance, where tripping becomes more ordinary to you, so the same dose seems to affect you less because there is less novelty to it.

is there a way to go back to reverse tolerance days? just wait a year for novelty expansion? 


otherwise, dxm + trippo for me

"Like an Old Friend in a New Skin"

30mg 2C-B [rectal]

~12mg DMT [vaporized]

Boring biographical:  early 30s, did a fuckton of 2C-I about a decade ago, and a bunch of other shit as well, mostly of the trippy sort though I love MDMA and stimulants left to my own devices. The day before I'd taken a good deal of amphetamine to help me power through a early start for dental surgery [50mg total over the course of the day]. A small lapse in judgment on my part has me assuming this will impact my tolerance. It may have, but if it did, it did not seem to matter.

This was an impromptu trip, and my lack of prep is expressed in my lack of notes. A partner of mine with an increasingly close friend dosed some 4-HO-MIPT and were having a grand time over voice chat when I finally decided to dose. It was about 23:00 at night when we got around to things [exact T 00:00 = 23:17] having spent some time cleaning up the house and tending to other chores after work.

The solution was prepared with a good milligram scale, 50mg in 5 ml of water to split between myself and my roommate, with me having the lion's share. Once the solution is drawn up and ready to be administered we split to dose and endure the come up before facing one other's company again. I personally retreat to my bedroom, dosing quickly in my bathroom. The 3 ml solution in my rectum felt like fire and the urge to defecate was almost instant, but it was resisted for ~10-15 minutes while I made my bed....

Which, by the time I was even really started I was tripping. This ROA continues to impress with the sheer speed at which things can over take me, and I found myself distracted by the play of shadows in the folds of my sheets. I was also alarmed at the realization just how confused I already was, just how intense the visuals already were, and the acute awareness of just how little actual time had passed. Somewhere I realized I had absolutely overshot my target for the evening and it was now time to settle into the paradoxical relaxation of holding on while surrendering enough to a overly intense ride! Shortly after I disappeared into the bathroom and expelled the remaining liquid, whatever of the compound remaining being lost to the rigors of the waste management system. I doubt it was of any significance.

After what felt like something between an hour and three days spent in uncomfortable agony on the toilet while occasionally dry heaving into my  bucket [I estimate ~5-10 real time minutes] I finally accept nothing is coming out of me by either end and bring myself to exit the bathroom to sprawl on my bed; I attempt in vain to put music on while I pass by my computer, but I fail to actually get something playing through the visual noise that's overtaken my world... Once at my destination I proceed to give up on retaining much of anything about myself beyond the fact I'd taken an incredible amount of psychedelics. That thought I'd essentially enshrined in a reliquary for the occasional reassurance I wasn't going to die and this wouldn't be forever, as one does sometimes when their everything else is melting into the room, soft and fluffy bed first. 

I could attempt to explain my visual sphere, and I'll try in the useless attempt to remember it in detail much less wrangle any meaning into the confines of language! During this come up my closed-eye world was entirely immersive, colorful and explosively fractal when it wasn't making fantastic plant life. Open was just simply too confusing to remember, it earnestly felt something like a breakthrough vaporized DMT trip... Just so, so much longer in duration.  I could tell roughly what things were where through my eyes, but it'd be a lie to say I could 'see' in a meaningful manner. It was all just so noisy, with the noise readily resolving into intricate patterns borrowing the local colorscape. 

I wish I could say I wasn't terrified, but I honestly was. While I was reasonably confident in my ability to survive to the part where things chilled out, parts of me were worried and barely able to communicate with the people on voice in any meaningful way, if at all leading to that particular form of solipsistic hell where you're not sure where you are in relation to reality or life itself. I was commenting on being glad I was well seasoned for someone a little less fried around the edges would probably be screaming from the frothing chaos of their thoughts while desperately wishing for the appearance of another physical person. It was of course at this moment my roommate walks in with a warm greeting, I greet her back the best I can and make a joking comment about her terribly perfect timing before making her put on music and collapse onto the bed to melt into being foam with barely a hint of ego. She makes some sort of LCL joke in reference to one of the endings of EVA, and it wasn't the worst way to relate it. I could also describe myself at this point as a "musical orgasm". 

Even with the wretched timing her presence is comforting, we heap against each other and ride out the intense peak of this experience before finally regaining enough of our facilities to actually adjust sound levels and rejoin the wider digital group. My partner and friend have been having a delightfully erotic time, and we're compelled to play along at least a little in spite of the specter of my normal tripping asexuality... And we're to a great deal successful, at least for a pretty long while. Theres groping and grinding. A bit of licking and too-intense-for-her biting, much to my disappointment. We writhe and roll in hopes of meshing flesh in that perfect way and honestly find something close enough again and again. Somewhere around here we have my one and only recorded note, and I quote: "I can taste the pen on the paper??" which I can only explain as being like licking myself. 

But my attention for such matters always fades, and end up talking here and there from the comfort of my own chair before diving back into the pleasures of the flesh, eventually hearing from the other partnered trip space there was a marvelous discovery for the violet wand and a mylar flogger... And I of course instantly decided I had to have it, leveraging my submissive roommate with much prodding to overcome the hedonistic hesitation the 2C-B has bred in us both. Of course, asking a pair of people tripping so hard they can hardly remember the concept of names to set up a tool as complicated as a violet wand in a hastily cleaned room is a fool's errand, but thankfully the fools on hand were up to the task! After a false start where the wand wasn't plugged in but we both absolutely insisted we were feeling something.

Other highlights of the night include exploring some realizations on why my relationships have stability issues [frequent moving and an effectively unstable timezone], realizing I should give up on motorcycling [at least on public roadways], and deciding to do a little DMT!

Well, my roommate decided to do some DMT, as we were winding down around this point [4ish hour mark] and I feel capable of running all the needed hardware from scale to torch. Carefully I weigh out ~25mg of DMT freebase, loading it into a dab rig I keep dedicated for the task with several beads and carefully torching it to temp. This is the first time I've tried to use the torch for this, and I over shot just *slightly*.   My roommate takes the hit, instantly exhales, gets reminded to hold it and does it again! This time she holds it and falls back, I look to the piece, shrug, and finish it before joining her on my bed.

Here we once again weakly settle against one another, too lost in our respective worlds to talk, my closed eye world is once again a colorful space of geometry, while the open eyed space collapses to a 2D pastelscape, with the shifting RGB lights I have installed making the colors somehow jump in waves from the smoothly shifting light. The candygore dragon painting I have on my wall refuses to make any sense, being a vivid window into a world of impossible shapes and delicious colors.  As we come down we share little anecdotes and cuddle, only slightly ragged by the repeated intensity.

And, as almost seems to be a theme with my better tripping nights, I found myself hypnotizing someone! It was the friend who was with my partner, and my first real interaction with them in such a way. To not spill too much detail here, while absolutely imperfect, it was still absolutely an amazing time that needed to happen!

Ahah, crazy stuff. 30 orally was pretty high for my tastes! Did you feel the 2c-b trip fade away quickly after smoking DMT? I noticed such interaction with mushrooms before. Like you mind was flushed clean and everything that isn't DMT is gone.

If anything it picked it back up a bit, I was already on the come down.


And yeaaah, it was a little much!! Not a *bad* little much, but very much one of those "hold on!" come ups at least

I boofed a similar amount of 2c-b which was great when the come up passed but before that was a bit of a "hold onto your chair/ sweat profusely" type experiences. 


I've found that after taking 2c-b a few times the come up has gotten easier though, in particular I don't have stomach troubles like I did the first few times, not sure if it's just because I know what's in store or because my body has gotten used to it though.

I suspect that the speed of onset (and intensity of bum burn) may correlate with how dilute the 2C-B solution is. I kinda think that using more water may slow absorption and onset a bit. It's a tough thing to test, though. There's a ton of natural variance.

This has been my experience.  Back when I first started with 2C-Xs, I would have violent come-ups where I felt poisoned and would throw up, often repeatedly, every time (it would then calm down and become comfortable).  But for a long time, I have had zero nausea whatsoever, and easy come-ups, from 2C-Xs (and indeed, all psychedelics, even AMT and mescaline from cactus juice).

Morning Glory Seeds are the only psychedelic that can have me vomiting on the come up.  Not all the time.  I found the longer I can go without barfing the stronger the trip. There were trips I was able to muscle through the nausea and not vomit.  Once the trip starts it is almost like anti nausea for the rest of the time.


Never had that nausea with anything other psychedelic, never 2C's.  Even cactus powder tossed and washed does not make me too nauseous if at all.  In fact cactus powder is easier than morning glory seeds.


I have had some rough come ups on 2C-B.  Just very strong hitting but 15 minutes later I am ok.  Sometimes it just comes on like a tidal wave but also goes away quick. I can see nausea at that point if it is too much.


I am so over due for a 2C-B trip.  It has been almost two years and laziness (as well as just getting older) has made me wait. I actually need any trip.  By this time any year I at least have a DMT trip in.  My last good trip was acid last fall in a cabin in the mountains.  I have had too much construction going on in the house the last 3 months but that is done now and I have no excuses.

Yes, the only time I was nauseous during the whole trip was on hbw. I didn’t had to puke but felt sick all the time. Maybe an a/b extraction would help since lsa seemed to be a nice substance on its own which is readily available.

Had a great trip on Monday with 20mg of 2C-B that helped me make a bit of progress on working through an issue I've been struggling with. My friend took 2 pills sold as 20mg each and also had a fantastic time (and predictably, was tripping much harder than I was). Looking forward to trying out 30+mg soon, which I have never done in a single dose (only over multiple doses taken hours apart.)

2c-b really shines around 27mg, a little less and I wasn’t satisfied.

Every time lately that I've felt like taking a psychedelic I've been reaching for 2C-B. I like taking it sublingually but I really need to start putting it in solution at least. It's pretty caustic and I've still got some painful sores in my mouth from taking it 2 nights ago.


Probably beating a dead horse at this point but it's definitely an amazing drug for sex, or even just hanging out with someone special. I took 25mg sublingual and about 2.5 hrs in a switched flipped and I really wanted to get it in. I asked my friend to come over but she was going to be awhile so about 3hrs in I took a 13mg booster to keep up my good mood. I was never really tripping that hard but for the first couple hrs sex wouldn't have been as appealing.


Anyways my friend ended up coming over about 4.5 hrs in. We just hung out and listened to music and talked for awhile, probably for 2 or 3 hrs but I wasn't keeping track. I didn't tell her I had taken anything but she kept saying how happy I seemed and that I was smiling way more than usual. I'm pretty much infatuated with this chick when I'm sober but on 2C-B she was mind blowingly hot and I didn't hesitate to keep telling her. Ended up having amazing sex and took it to some places we hadn't gone yet. Was a bit worried I might not last as long as usual, since I'm usually on phenibut when we hang out, but there was no real issues in that regard.


Definitely my favorite 2C-X currently. It's weird because 2C-B was the first psychedelic I used extensively (mostly back in 2014-15) and then around 2017-18 it seemed like a switched flipped and my experiences with it started feeling more sinister and I started getting sever migraines from it on the comedown. I'm not sure why, perhaps it was high levels of stress or even related to my abuse of dissociatives. These days 2C-B really is a perfect blend between a psychedelic and an empathogen for me. Basically no comedown anymore either.

Interesting, I hear a lot of people say this.  For me it's been the opposite, I used to puke from RC psychedelics EVERY time when I first started, I would have horrible bodyload and nausea.  But for a long time now, I get zero nausea and barely any bodyload, ever.

I'm one of the people who used to tell you that, but now I agree with you. It seems to me like mostly a psychological thing that you just have to figure out how to adapt to now.

Extreme pain, I do not recommend it.  Although if you make a nasal spray solution it is much better.  I still dislike snorting 2C-Xs because the come-up is really intense, in a bad way, IMO.

That sounds fun except the railing part... just eat it!  It's insanely painful to snort.  I've snorted just about anything, 2C-B (and other 2Cs) are, by a huge margin, the worst to snort.  Ruins the trip for me.  Better to eat it.

Gotta agree with Xorky snorting it is a pretty bad plan, I've not ever felt pain in my nose like what a 2C-x is capable of causing. And I've probably done it a good twenty or thirty times cuz I'm a knucklehead, always out of impatience and trying to squeeze the most out of materials. If you wanna faster come up plugging is much better option almost twice as potent as orally and kicks in like 10-15mins tho would be pretty awkward in a group setting, lol.

I've arranged plugging in a group setting before. It's perfectly doable, with a couple of preconditions:

- access to a clean bathroom (the rectum is associated with dirt, so both equipment and dosing setting need to be extra clean)

- have the technical talk down in full medical detail so everybody understands the scientific advantages, and agrees there's no good reason enduring extra nausea just to waste more compound with a much more boring onset

- have enough humour about it to relax the doubters (but not too much, blatantly blue humour would evoke extra creeps)


This was when I was trying to get my Huxley-esque island commune going. I suppose it helped having a little aura of authority going.. though you get that anyway if you make clear you know what you're talking about, provided people aren't feeling like they're following some shady figure down into his weird druggy spiral. There's some forgiving tolerance to that anyway since they're generally interested in the chemical and in having you share its effects with them.

An old friend of mine (sadly she has passed) used to plug often, and more than once I would walk into the kitchen with her bent over with a syringe in her ass.  It was awkward, but in retrospect, it's a memory that makes me giggle.


But yeah, plugging 2C-Xs is a much better option than snorting.  If you use 3mL of water, it won't burn at all, and the come-up is very fast, with a rush that snorting gives you, it's about as potent as snorted, and the quality of the trip is much better than snorted.  Snorting 2C-Xs is very bad for your nasal passages, in addition to being horribly painful.  But assuming it's diluted in water and you properly lube, plugging isn't damaging.  Another option is making a nasal spray solution, which greatly reduces the pain and damage when doing corrosive drugs nasally.

These days 2C-B really is a perfect blend between a psychedelic and an empathogen for me. Basically no comedown anymore either.

You could try taking Ginger and Magnesium Glycinate with it. Might help.

Actually the other day I ended up getting a headache the morning after doing 2C-B the night before. Not the worst one I've had, but it still sucked. It was either the higher dose (50mg over a few hours—more than I've done in awhile) or the fact that I was really bad about staying hydrated that evening. I'm actually leaning toward it being the latter.


Ended up taking 500mg acetaminophen which I've found really helps anytime that I do get a headache from psychedelics. My theory for why this works so well is that acetaminophen inhibits COX enzymes, which contribute to synthesis of [PGE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2#Smooth_muscle_effects) from [AA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid). Injecting PGE2 into healthy subjects reliably produces migraines, as you can see in [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19187340/) study. My guess is that 5-HT2A agonists can produce a buildup of PGE2 by activating PLA2 enzymes, which leads to release of AA and increased PGE2 synthesis. I don't think it's just limited to psychedelics either, as MDMA gives me even worse headaches on the comedown, and I think this could be mediated by its indirect activation of 5-HT2A receptors. The PLA2 pathway would be activated to differing degrees by the various 5-HT2A agonists, which would explain why some psychedelics seem less prone to producing headaches.


Even though the acetaminophen helped, I was still hesitant to go lift as it can be ill-advised depending on the nature of the headache. PGE2 appears to dilate cranial arteries, so maybe there wouldn't any blood pressure concerns. Interestingly, while 5-HT2A receptors contribute to vasoconstriction in periphery, they don't contribute to it in cranial arteries (at least not directly). I really did want to lift so I ended up going later that night and FWIW I felt so much better afterwards, although lifting always makes me feel better.

Interesting theory, makes sense.  That sucks you get headaches from 2C-B... I have never gotten a headache from a 2C-X.  I certainly have from some psychedelics though (BOD, or maybe it was BOHB, gave me a wicked one, and 3C-P gave me an absolutely horrific one the first time I took it.  And AMT can sometimes end in a persistent, low to moderate severity headache, though other times it doesn't).

Yeah it does suck, but I've been using 2C-B pretty frequently the past few months so I'm thankful this is the only time it has happened. 2C-C and 2C-D never gave me headaches, other than maybe one time on each of them. Then 2C-B-FLY gave me a pretty nasty headache the one time I took it.


I don't remember ever getting comedown headaches from tryptamines or ergoline derivatives, so perhaps I'm just sensitive to PEAs. Empathogens are the worst for me though. MDMA, MDA, and 6-APB have all given me excruciating headaches—that's probably the main reason I don't take them anymore.

Phens have more blood pressure issues, and vasoconstriction, and also generally more 5-HT1b agonism (which is the one that affects the heart valve, not sure if that would be related or not), so I think it makes sense.

[@ecstacylover](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/344631/)

That theory seems to make sense. I've gotta ask though: what's your antioxidant stack when you partake in these drugs? Because if an NSAID is effective, then an intervention higher up the inflammatory stream might be effective too, without the various risks that come with the APAP, which one has to assume become magnified by the wildness of the ride. Antioxidants are less powerful of course, but they are many, combinable, and synergically so. I'm not taking into account the differential effects between the substances you list, but whatever's going on it must be getting amplified by the general state of overdrive.


I'm not only asking because I've spent over a year reading papers on inflammation, it's also because a phenethylamine (not sure which one but I guess 2C-E.. maybe 2C-C..) was the first drug on which I tried out a vitamin stack. And to my skeptical surprise, indeed, it made the difference between feeling physically mauled by the experience, and feeling kinda back to normal just like before the dosing. (I followed someone's calculation back then, from erowid I believe.. but can't find the numbers anymore, I vaguely remember factors of four times the recommended daily amount.. so four multivitamins would be a start if you don't happen to supplement your trips already.. or build a custom stack of course, in which you can include the more powerful ones.)


My apologies if all this is old news 'n irrelevant. But APAP is one of those killer chemicals.. of course only because people just assume it's safe in all circumstances.. but nevertheless, some harm reduction attention is deserved, surely.

I take 5mg melatonin on a nightly basis, but aside from that the only antioxidant I've taken recently was sulforaphane. Technically not an antioxidant in and of itself, but it upregulates lots of enzymes with antioxidant activity. I've never really had a stack specifically for psychedelics though, although I frequently combine phenibut with them.


My understanding is that acetaminophen is much more benign than NSAIDs, but it's not something I take consistently anyways. I really only ever take it when I have headaches from these substances.

Had 25 mgs of 2C-B this morning at 10:00AM.  It had been 3 year since I reached for 2C-B.  Been reaching for LSD or 4-ACO-DMT the last two years when I wanted to trip.  I think some of the funniest parts of my day is when the 2C-B seemed to pointing out some big insights and was like "See!  See!"  It was quite comical. Showed me it was a contender.   And it was, great insight today.  I was going to take acid but the weather is sort of cloudy and raining with just moments of sun today.  So I decided to go for a shorter trip with 2C-B.  It did not disappoint nor was it shallow.  My hats off to 2C-B.  Any psychedelic can be deep and helpful.  I wonder where the notion that 2C-B is shallow came from, the stuff is gold as it keeps getting use.  I feel bad for waiting 3 years.  But trips have to be planned and the correct psychedelic has to be chosen. 2C-B ways reminded of those Persian carpet visuals.  This was my first daytime 2C-B trip.  I usually take that one at night.


I think I also decided I need to trip more.  It always refreshes.   Before this trip upstate my wife was like you do what you have to do to get your head together.  Life can wear a person down.  Almost went for cactus but needed something with half the duration and 2C-B carries some of the cactus spirit.

I don't think that 2C-B is shallow, but it's so overtly cool and fun that the pure pleasure can dominate.. Fantastic stuff, I should take some again soon and I was actually thinking about it earlier, I only have pills though which is a mild bummer.

Never had sex on 2C-B

![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

But yes, people do say that doses <10mg are great for sex.


2C-B is from a whole other class of psychedelic drugs, so that means very different effects, but it's generally considered to be slightly easier to handle and it lasts about half as long as acid or its analogues (like 1V-LSD). If you like the 1V microdoses, then just microdose ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) a full blotter is fun too though, just saying. Be safe & enjoy!

I used to snort a fair bit of 2C-I, and I'd been planning on plugging it but some wretched idea took the group and people are deciding to snort it instead [meaning I'm going to actually have to bring my scale instead of just stuff to make a solution] 


I personally like plugging it, I can imagine orally is good, 2C-I oral was good... But I recently did a good dose of 2C-E oral and the come up was so alike to a recent round of food poisoning [down to the taste when I finally cleared my stomach] it was the worst.

.

Everything was great aside from that tho, but it has at least me personally wary enough about having it orally.

Urx, that’s really bad to snort especially 2c-I. It’s too painful and the gets less god. Try rectal or oral it’s better.

Taking 2C-I orally is so good one of the best trips out there for groups/events very recreational and great for a party setting. It has a slightly speedy nature and makes me very outgoing and Euphoric the visuals are beautiful and complex. Moreso when you eat it rather than snort, I find the 2C-x to lose a great deal of their sparkle when you use them intranasal.

I really don't disagree, at least regarding rectal. I'm also not sure what "It's better" is really going to do to people taken by some masochistic meme so fierce it *changed their minds* from plugging it in the first place. The meme is my fault, I compared snorting 2C-X to having Satan himself cum in your nose, and now people want the painfacial and I am filled with regret at the power of an idea. 


As I mentioned in the post you quoted, I'm having to pack a scale for this trip when everything had been premeasured for volumetric dosing, the plan pretty firmly had no snorting in it to start ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

100% agreed on NOT snorting 2C-B (or any 2C-X).  It hurts far more than any other drug to snort, it's horrible, ruins the trip and takes 20-30 minutes to finally be able to focus on something other than pain.  It's more stimulating and rough physically when you snort it, too, and less mentally interesting.  Oral really works the best, but if you want to cut the dose in half, plugging is MUCH better, it produces a trip that is qualitatively similar to oral, but cuts the dose in half and comes up very fast with a rush.  And reduces the bodyload compared to oral, rather than increases it like snorting.

I think some of the funniest parts of my day is when the 2C-B seemed to pointing out some big insights and was like "See!  See!"  It was quite comical. Showed me it was a contender.   And it was, great insight today.  I was going to take acid but the weather is sort of cloudy and raining with just moments of sun today.  So I decided to go for a shorter trip with 2C-B.  It did not disappoint nor was it shallow.  My hats off to 2C-B.  Any psychedelic can be deep and helpful.  I wonder where the notion that 2C-B is shallow came from, the stuff is gold as it keeps getting use.  I feel bad for waiting 3 years.  But trips have to be planned and the correct psychedelic has to be chosen. 2C-B ways reminded of those Persian carpet visuals.  This was my first daytime 2C-B trip.  I usually take that one at night.

The last time I took 2-B, it really showed me its colors and I had a very strong, very powerful, and deep trip.  I used 20mg of MXE as a launching pad, which obviously potentiated it, as I knew it would, but boy did it ever.  I took 30mg of 2C-B, I redosed an hour in with 10mg more (20 + 10).  I was at a show.  By the end of it I was peaking hard, and couldn't talk, I just followed my friends around and our sober friend was driving.  The visuals were out of this world, and I had an ecstatic and beautiful concert experience.  It was a bit too much for me after the music ended, but I managed, and then spent the next 5 or 6 hours at my friend's (my bandmate's) house, listening to music and discussing it.  It was extremely profound, everything we listened to was like listening to it the first time, with very grounded and profound insights into culture and specifically I was thinking about how all this old music would have been like and meant to the people when it was new music.  I finally "got" The Beachboys, as we listened to Pet Sounds.  I had always wanted to "get it", but never did, somehow.


That trip really elevated my understanding of 2C-B, as well, and its potential.  Increasingly over the years it has become more and more powerful for me, back in the day, I could take 40mg and just get a nice, light recreational trip, but the last few times I've taken it, it's really knocked my socks off.

So after action report!


The people who snorted it seemed to not be too phased by the pain, and the one who did about as much as I plugged settled into about the same wavelength as me.... But that someone and I look enough alike that our mutual affections started being called 'self absorbed'.


Someone put 25mg up their nose, and it was a *little* much, mostly in that they were losing track of time. I'll try and get something more complete written up

Holy balls, 


I snorted 32 mg of 2c-b on accident the other day. My scale has been acting up - I should've been more careful; I only meant to take 6-8mg.


What an intense but awesome experience - burned sooooo bad, my god. Made me cry a bit. Amazing visuals though, super intense coursing of energy throughout my body's energy meridians, or something. I remember why 2c-b helped me with an eating disorder and my posture years ago. It brings attention to the body in a special way - reminds me of yoga, but different of course. 


I did this a day or two after having some iboga - albeit a small amount, so that also added to the intensity of the experience. Microdosing iboga is something else - has truly helped me in wonderful ways. I see now why they call it the master teacher in Africa. 


Glad I had my gf there to be a soothing presence - we went to the dog park and wandered around some beautiful nature areas. Was truly magical. 2c-b is the tits. Would never ever snort it again though lol.

I had two incredible 30mg 2CB experiences in August that I may report on soon.


The first trip was indoors and especially life changing. It helped me work through some insecurities that I have been struggling with.


For the second trip, I went hiking in a valley for several hours and also had some interesting realizations. I don’t remember it too well but I have some voice memos on my phone that I have to listen through eventually.

this is exactely true. just recently talked to simstim and he told me that he likes to take all of his 2c's nasally. something i just dont get. you loose much of the highs profoundness and it really hurts, especially with the halogenated ones. btw i just remember that i once vaped small amounts of 2c-e repeatedly one evening years ago. was with my last girlfriend at that time and she somehow didnt like it. dont know why, she also took drugs in not too small amounts. maybe it was because she had a problem just because of seeing me vape something, had a little problem with meth. this is all long ago, dont know why i write this in the first place. anyway, vaping 2c's can be nice if youre not looking for a solid mind blowing trip.

I've been delving into 2C-B this year, both with a nasal spray and with eating it. I have to agree with the above post about it being better orally. Nasal feels like it lacks depth and completeness. It increased my sensitivity to stuff, and I had some could relationship discussions, and I felt the beauty of the sun and ocean, and connected to my dying grandmother, it was good. At the same time the oral doses felt much more complete. One aspect is they seem to include a more pronounced body aspect, similar to how mescaline feels for me. More heart too. Sometimes I experience a weird thing with 2C-B where I just get really spaced out, like there isn't much content, like my body and mind gets filled with empty space that is a bit numb. It doesn't happen a lot, but never experienced that with a psychedelic before. 


Yesterday had a funny experience, took 20 mg at the airport and it hit harder than 50mg has in the past. Funny to be secretly tripping balls amidst thousands of people like that

I took 55mg of 2C-B orally yesterday. I think I’m starting to understand why big doses don’t seem to impact me very much around the peak. I become fragmented and all the parts of me – the body, the thoughts, identity, visuals, music, and memories are all separated by a sense of space, and that space becomes much more vivid than the parts of me. When this happens, the parts aren’t as impactful. For example, the visuals just don’t stand out, not because they aren’t there but because my attention is glued to the space. 


Sometime after the peak the content once again came to the surface and I spent a lot of time seeing myself as an Organic chemist and what that might be like. One thing that is amazing with psychedelics is the imagination is increased so much, I could see and feel the glassware and what it might be like to interact with people in different industries and academia.


I’m curious to keep pushing the dose higher, what will happen? Will the void just become all consuming or will content start to emerge in the void again? 


I also read recently that people have been vaping 2C-B HCl successfully, that might be interesting to try.

Taking both your recent posts together, you might consider just taking lower doses of 2cb. I usually preferred ~30-37 mg 2cb, but only tried as much as 45.  I get a headache after 2cb/2ce, so don't feel the desire to push the dose much higher than what is already quite effective.


Edit to say that even 30 mg can be a large dose for someone with less experience or less tolerance. Or with more pure 2cb.

I'm curious to see what will happen if I push the dose higher, will it just void out or will phenomenah return? I imagine it will get more voidy, but the part of me that is thorough wants to see. I'm also unsure what the safe range of dose is for this substance. I'm pretty sure this is fairly pure 2c-b as I've dosed it at very low doses like maybe 2mg intranasal and felt threshold effects, and others have a much higher response from low doses, someone even had strong visuals from 8mg. 


But you're probably right about lower doses being the sweet spot.

In my experience it just becomes more and more unpleasant the higher you dose. The visuals do get stronger but I find they become very strenuous on the eyes and I get a headache. The body load also becomes much more negative and apparent. I've dosed 50mg numerous times and this is always the case, 70mg once by mistake.


35-40mg seems to be an absolute sweet spot for me. 


If you're after a heavier and deeper 2C experience I would recommend persueing 2C-E instead of pushing the envelope with 2C-B.

My gram of 2C-B HCI should be arriving any day now and im beyond happy about this. Its one of my favorite drugs ever, infact id venture to say that my preferred psychedelic trip is with a compound from the 2C-x series. They just have the most pleasing euphoria and the persian carpet visuals are so beautiful. 


My last batch of this was 2C-B HBr that was pinkish tan (very good quality) but im curious as to how this white stuff is going to compare. Know that its stronger mg per mg so the 25mg dose i usually take is going to hit a little harder. Before this i had 3 doses of 2C-B tucked away in my collection so now having another forty makes me feel so grateful. 


This should last me a number of years because i only plan on using it a few times of year, im gonna share it with my girlfriend so i have to be mindful to stretch it out. Mostly im just going to eat LSD and Psilocybin when i trip so i can keep my more rare drugs. Who knows i will probably order some more eventually just to put aside, id love to find a good deal on multiple grams so i can have close to a lifetime supply. 


When i get around to sampling this batch i will let you all know how it goes, happy trails ![🙂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I always found HCl to come with a less body load than HBr, might be placebo, might be purity of HCl I used to get was better than HBr, but it might really have to do with different salts.

I’m not sure why i never got around to trying 2c-b. Have done 2c-I and 2c-e plenty and I love mdma (over say speed or acid), so if anything 2c-b should have been something I sought out, but for whatever reason, never striked at any opportunities.


That all changed a couple weeks ago. I had the great pleasure of being able to watch the Chemical Brothers and had the option for 2cb. What an amazing choice. To start, I had no idea what kind of completely all-encompassing show I was about to witness and glad that I had something that was lighter on the soul during it.


2c-b might already be an all-time favorite for me. The comeup felt like a very gentle roll, and then the visuals were just a complete party. I am a fan of some of the easier headspace queens in 4homet and allad, but something about the 2cb made it even less serious than those two and really brought a fun party atmosphere. Normally psychedelics have a tendency to make me socially shut off and introverted as well, but 2cb seemed to be much less in that regard. Now I just wish I hadn’t waited so long to try this beautiful substance -


One thing for people with experience - a few people noted that the effects dropped off pretty sharply for them, however for me it was a smoother (and a bit longer) decline. How does it generally finish for you?

Slowly, it lasts quite long too if the dose isn't small, but the flashiness can disappear somewhat quickly I guess, depends a lot on the dose too.


2C-B can be anything you want, but I think in its essence it's a serious psychedelic, it's just that somehow all that comes together and creates this beautiful, flashy and easygoing layer on top of it. Great stuff, glad you enjoyed

Very excited I finally discovered some 2c-b hcl. It’s the only main 2c-x I have yet to do. I’ve done vast amounts of 2c-i,e,c, and d. 2c-i and e were my favorites, the former was more recreational, electric, and possessed an empathagenic nature while the latter was far more of a real psych that took you for a deep ride. 


Same source had 5-mapb, which I’ve heard good things about, thus naturally I snabbed 2 gs.  Tried 6-apb before and it was pretty awesome, but must have been 12 years ago lol. Took a rather large dose and had a long pleasurable experience. Was quite a bit more visual than MDA.  Oh, he was kind enough to off a 100 mg sample of 4-ho-Met after I said I wanted to order that as well, but didn’t have the $. The 4-ho-met is in freebase form which I believe is almost equipotent to hcl, perhaps a tad weaker. I wonder if one could vape it.

Hmm. Could all 3 compounds be mixed together? 5-mapb, 4-ho-met, and 2c-b? I’ve heard 5-mapb isn’t very stimulating so perhaps 2c-b and 5-mapb would make a lovely combination.


Last time I tripped. I did a tab of lsd, 200 mg mda, BDO, and 12 mg of 3-ho-pcp. Post peak I packed an oil burner full of dmt and started hittin that bitch until I couldn’t anymore. Had the most awe inspiring intense breakthrough ever. I was fucking catapulted into ineffable beauty. Shit was wild. 


How does DMT combine with 2c-b?

Did not go well. I was scammed. I have a highly regarded vendor selling 25mg 2cb hcl pellets. He won’t have 2cb hcl powder for a few more weeks, but thought I’d buy 4 or so. Normally I avoid pellets and tabs as I like to get the material itself. Does anyone have any experience with using pellets?

Personally i would hold out for the powder, alot of times pills and pellets are notoriously underdosed. Its not worth the rush if in the end you are gonna make out much better you know. Youve got other stuff you can trip on in the meantime amirite?

On New Years Day I took 7.5 mg of 2C-B.  I first experienced 2C-B at a low-ish dose around 12 mg (?) over a decade-and-a-half ago.  It hit surprisingly strong with nausea and significant body tremors followed by a brief period of visuals and then a kind of fizzling out.  I was very disappointed by the trip, but that may have been because I used 2C-I as a point of comparison, and 2C-I is a drug I had used and enjoyed many times.  Only recently have I returned to this substance, and I'm "titrating in" as I have been doing with other things lately.  I've already had a surprisingly euphoric 2C-B experience at 2 mg followed by a stronger but somewhat lackluster one at 4 mg.


I think this stuff slams my GI system pretty hard, which may limit my desire for it at higher doses, but the discomfort faded as I hoped it would right at around the 1.5 hour point.  Here I had some beautiful paisley pattern visuals, albeit in monochrome.  I had sex with my (not tripping) wife, and the sensations were almost electric.  The approach to orgasm felt like it would just keep building in layers forever before everything just kind of went blam!  And then, I felt like I never really came all the way down from that peak.


I danced for about an hour, and then we cooked and ate homemade sourdough pizza together.  I had a huge appetite even though I was still decently tripping and enjoyed the food immensely, mostly while remaining active on my feet.  I realized that any muscular action in my body caused these insanely euphoric rushes, that were kind of erotic but also kind of anxiolytic.  These feelings seem to be of a particular 2C-B flavor.  I started finding creative ways to engage as many muscles as possible, and then just kind of got sucked into the feeling of pleasure.  We wrapped up the evening with a new board game, which involved me giggling and laughing a whole lot but otherwise being perfectly clear-headed for learning and playing a new game.  The day after, my muscles felt noticeably worn but I felt very little pain, and then I just felt that muscle euphoria along with a kind of satisated feeling continue for days.


This trip really brought home that 2C-B is something special, very distinct from 2C-I or 2C-C or anything else I've tried.  It's not going to be my favorite because it seems remarkably shallow for a psychedelic, but it is hedonistic as fuck once that euphoria gets going past the 1.5 hour point.  I *really* like eating on this drug.  It is perhaps the least anorexic psychedelic I've had.  In general, it's another one of of those psychedelics makes me wonder why anyone would bother with the usual entactogens like MDMA.  (I say this selfishly of course, knowing that everyone reacts differently.)  Obviously, I will have to continue my experiments to ascertain how reliable this kind of experience is.  I hope the early trip body load doesn't get too much worse and I can take the experience further some time in the future.


I should also comment on the after-effects since it's been more than a week.  In the days after, I felt very euphoric with a strong sense of analgesia, but I also felt just a bit apathetic and lazy.  It felt kind of shallow relative to other psychedelics just as the primary experience felt shallow, but I also am feeling quite healthy in the body.  The health problems I struggle with have been almost entirely in remission, which might be the case with other psychedelics, but the point is that it can work in that fashion like other psychedelics and offers the potential for a very casual and hedonistic experience.  I can totally understand why this was among the Shulgins' favorites.

Funnily enough, I don't find it to be particularly hedonistic. Shallow and gentle to be sure, but not riotous fun. More like a sunny picnic by the lake, watching the clouds and the ducks. I've never seen the comparison to releasers like MDMA, but I'm a bad judge of those anyway--I can only guess at what those are supposed to be like, because my body hates them. The 'scalines are my empathogens of choice. For me, 5-MeO-MiPT remains the least anorexic and most hedonistic of 5-HT2a agonists.

I'm sure it could go that way too.  If I'm in public, perhaps it would be better not to be uhh, enjoying it too much, right?  One idea I had was to dose it with appropriate timing before going out for a fancy dinner, the kind where one sits for hours with many courses.  Nevermind the fact that I don't go out to eat anymore, I dare say that if I tried this, I might cause offense by enjoying the food too much.  A trip to the museum might be easier to pull off.  I did a museum trip on low dose mescaline once, and it was excellent.


As for the comparison to MDMA, I admit I have only had two experiences in which it seemed to actually work "properly" for me.  That's out of around 10-12 total, plus once each with MDA an methylone, which didn't work either.  My default empathogen experience seems to be a kind of emotional purgatory which leads me to feel dysphoric (i.e., feeling in a way I don't want to feel) and withdrawn.  The body effects aren't too bad, at least until days after when my mood does weird things and my immune system seems to crap out.  Incidentally, I've taken psychedelics on the tail end of some of these dysphoric experiences and rapidly turned things around to experiences that are blissful, although not clearly superior to what I would expect without the empathogen.  Anyway, as for what MDMA feels like to me when it has worked, it's really not too different from many aspects of tripping.  I guess it's a bit like tripping mildly with training wheels.  It's a lot harder to "fall down" and hurt myself.  It also seems to trick me into thinking that I'm more sober (or less "tripped out" anyway) than I actually am.  OTOH, the "padded room" effect kind of limits the possible depth of the experience.


MDMA and other psychedelics definitely have important pharmacological connections.  MDMA has significant activity at both 5ht2a and 5ht2b.  Recent research suggests that 5ht2b activation may be critical to MDMA serotonin releasing effects, which is counterintuitive given the fact that MDMA also binds to and reverses the flow of the serotonin reuptake transporter.  It's not clear what role 5ht2b plays in this, but since many psychedelics also activate 5ht2b, the possibility also exists for other psychedelics to release serotonin or at least enhance its release somehow.  I don't think this has been clearly demonstrated though.  AFAICT, the function of 5ht2b and 5ht2c both are still quite mysterious relative to 5ht2a, which itself is still pretty mysterious.

How do you all feel about 25e NBOH? I feel it's the answer to 2cb. I mean that in the sense that it's the perfect 2cb type drug and blows it out of the water. I'm actually a chemical supplier myself a legit decently sized distributor that operates in North America and Canada. I've done it all and for many years very irresponsible too. I was convinced id never feel anything euphoric again. Then 750ug 25e NBOH 40 minutes absorbed due to being sublingual and I cried so much because it was so beautiful and pleasurable. Just wondering how do you feel about it compared to 2cb thanks everyone

Yep, this is what I get from MDMA (and sundry benzofurans.) My first positive experience with MDMA was it turns out another drug entirely, unknown but I suspect aET. 


Occasionally, I've just gotten cognitive and emotional blunting instead of withdrawal (with both 5-MAPB and interestingly aMT.) 


Between 5-MeO-MiPT and the 3,4,5-substituted phenethylamines, I'm happy with my alternatives.

This might sound weird, but this is the exact reason I used to use nitrous oxide during every psychedelic experience. It causes me to have an experience similar to a natural orgasm, and it feels like it really breaks the trip through to a new level of satisfaction that lasts the entire rest of the experience. I stopped doing it both out of concern for the possible long-term effects of using nitrous oxide regularly and also because using it all the time just made it kind of dull, though.

I feel this way about a lot of phenethylamine psychedelics, and a comparatively smaller number of indoles. I actually really love eating Mexican food on phenethylamines, especially if it's really spicy. Great combo.

If you take a high enough dosage MDMA will make you trip harder than most other things, and you'll still feel sober for it. It's weird as fuck. It's actually deliriant-like to the point that I've often suspected it might genuinely be a deliriant since it does have proven affinity within recreational dosage-relevant ranges for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, but it does so many things that there might be other explanations too. I've literally seen (and trip sitted for) people who respond to it like they're on diphenhydramine or tropane plants though. One was so delirious he would pantomime playing Xbox at his house with several friends around while sitting in front of a TV that's off with nothing in his hands in the living room of my house with no one except me. He "smoked cannabis" out of a bong that had nothing in it and seemed satisfied by it. I told him that the next day and he said, "But... when I exhaled I saw rainbows come out."


Some friends and I used to purposefully take lots of MDMA to get this specific kind of trip a lot. I don't recommend it but it was lots of fun and it influenced my drug journeys quite a lot for years to come. The most I ever took at once was around 800 mg of really good stuff and it gave me some of the strongest hallucinations I've ever had in my life still to this day.


The roll itself (which I find to occur earlier on than the trip) got shallow for me though after like half a year or so of heavy use. It started to seem obvious to me how much of it is just a mechanical response that seemed to mean very little to me once the experience was over, and then I could barely remember what happened anyway. I stopped caring about going to the club on it and started treating it more like an extended come up for reaching the trip instead, at which point I would walk around forests at night with friends seeing all kinds of mind-blowing hallucinations. One of my favorites was watching a field of grass waving like ocean waves, and then literally seeing whales made of grass leaping up out of it.


I do personally find phenethylamine psychedelics to have something very direct-feeling in common with MDMA, but not with the whole MDMA experience. Something about the body high and energy and music-listening experience and stuff definitely feel very similar. I never get the feeling of the shallow roll I didn't like though.

What's the safety profile of mixing MDA with 2c-b. My last 2c-b experience was weak due to the underdosed tablets (supposed to be 20mg pink nasas were more like 11mg according to wedinos). I'm getting some some 2c-b pressed rolex's  from a more solid source and others have purported to have good experiences from them. 


I've taken over 200mg of pure MDA and have a giant innate tolerance, so i was hoping to increase the psychedelic component to MDA with the addition of 2C-B. I'm well aware a lysergamide would make a safer combo, but this is what i'm working with. Does anyone have any insight?

That is very different from my experience.  N2O pretty much just disconnects me from my body for a few moments.  It's kind of fun and strangely addictive, but if I do too much in one session, I get a very eerie and icky after-effect in which I felt slightly insane and lasting some hours.  I actually had this problem after the dentist when I was young.  Actually, the last time I had N2O at the dentist, I actually had a "hole" experience, in which I went flying through outer space toward heaven.  I was 18 at the time, and I sat in my car in the parking lot for about half an hour afterwards because it took me that long to feel like my survival instinct was properly intact.  This experience was a big inspiration for me to seek out psychedelic drugs, starting with DMT, but I never experienced anything else like it nor have I really sought out dissociatives.

Mmm.  Back when I used to eat onion, garlic, and large amounts of chile pepper, I would happily eat it all the time.  Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Indian, African and Ethiopian, etc. all found their way to my palette while on psychedelics, in addition to plenty of late night diner visits.  Sadly I can't eat much of that anymore because my IBS got so bad.  Onion or garlic, even in small amounts, became reliable triggers of horrid symptoms.


The good news is that my GI system seems to be doing fine with psychedelics.  In fact, I think they are helping to treat it as with my myriad of other functional / auto-immune problems.  I'm trying to not get my hopes up and focus on long-term healing, but if I can heal my GI system, I may be able to eat onion, garlic, and larger amounts of chile again.  Yum yum yum!  I'll still probably be COVID shy, but that's what take out is for.  And then I don't worry about offending anyone if I appear to orgasm from tasting a curry.

I was only half serious, but you have given me a lot to think about.  I could discuss this in much more depth but that would not really be on-topic here.  At times, I have not been at all shy to express my pleasure.  I mean, I don't really do quiet sex, so if a window is open or I'm in a tent, then everyone around is going to know what me and my partner are up to.  This is most especially so if my partner and I are tripping, in which it can go on for hours.  At times, I've felt it to be my duty to raise awareness of what's possible in terms of ecstatic pleasure.  Few people realize their true potential to experience pleasure, so they don't know what to strive for.  They need inspiration!  Of course I doubt most of the others saw it that way, but I really didn't care at the time.

Anyway I won't take your suggestion.  In fact, I doubt I'll take MDMA again.  Even a "normal" dose feels toxic to me in the days following.

I took 2C-B with my wife (!!!) on Sunday.  We both had 12.5 mg to start, and then I gave her a 4 mg boost at T1:00.  I touched (+++) at moments with help from some weed.  She barely got into (++) unfortunately, but that's not entirely surprising for reasons I won't go into here.  I also won't get into any of the intimate details (she was actually very withdrawn and introspective until dinner time---spending much of her time alone), but I will say that at T+6:00, I felt sober enough to pick up take-out sushi from our favorite place but still high enough that my gastronomical senses were massively amplified.  Every time I ate a piece, the different sensations exploded like many fireworks in my mouth.  It was so intensely pleasurable, I wanted to slap the table or even flop onto the floor and twitch, lol.  It has to have been one of the best meals of my life.  Afterwards, we watched "Isle of Dogs", a Wes Anderson movie, which continued the Japanese theme of our evening.  It was a great way to run out the rest of our trip.  I was surprised at how much staying power my trip had.  I felt like it was going at T+10:00, after my wife had gone to bed.  (She was always pretty good at sleeping while tripping though.)


The aftermath of our trips turned out to be much more significant than the trip itself, even though the compound and the experience from it were necessary to catalyze these consequences.  Our time together in the following days has been like an intensive therapy with major revelations about ourselves and our relationship.


Something I should mention is that my wife did not get a headache, which is rather amazing considering that in the past she would get them almost every time she took a serotonergic psychedelic (regardless of what it was).  Perhaps the lack of headache simply reflects her weak dose-response, but either way, she came away quite satisfied with her trip and definitely intends to trip more in the future.  I'm so happy for her and for us!

I'm so happy for you! Honestly, a trip where you both get time to reflect and feel no pressure to meet the other person's needs is often great, and the light experience can be a good way to dip your toes in. It's nice to know that psychedelics don't always have to be balls to the wall to be rewarding. 


I think I'm a bit more like her. I think it would take >25mg to get me to a ++ and well over 30mg to get me to a +++ with oral 2C-B. 


I love it when the real work of the trip unfolds in the days after. Sounds like it was really special.

It's kind of fun and strangely addictive, but if I do too much in one session, I get a very eerie and icky after-effect in which I felt slightly insane and lasting some hours.  I actually had this problem after the dentist when I was young.  Actually, the last time I had N2O at the dentist, I actually had a "hole" experience, in which I went flying through outer space toward heaven.  I was 18 at the time, and I sat in my car in the parking lot for about half an hour afterwards because it took me that long to feel like my survival instinct was properly intact.  This experience was a big inspiration for me to seek out psychedelic drugs, starting with DMT, but I never experienced anything else like it nor have I really sought out dissociatives.

Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Indian, African and Ethiopian, etc. all found their way to my palette while on psychedelics, in addition to plenty of late night diner visits.  Sadly I can't eat much of that anymore because my IBS got so bad.  Onion or garlic, even in small amounts, became reliable triggers of horrid symptoms.

At times, I have not been at all shy to express my pleasure.  I mean, I don't really do quiet sex, so if a window is open or I'm in a tent, then everyone around is going to know what me and my partner are up to.  This is most especially so if my partner and I are tripping, in which it can go on for hours.  At times, I've felt it to be my duty to raise awareness of what's possible in terms of ecstatic pleasure.  Few people realize their true potential to experience pleasure, so they don't know what to strive for.  They need inspiration!  Of course I doubt most of the others saw it that way, but I really didn't care at the time.

Your stance on the toxic feeling of mdma is something I understand greatly. 2C-B mixed with 500mg of 400x Kanna extract in a gel cap was very similar without the toxic feeling. It certainly felt more "out of control though", even taking that dose of Kanna without the 2C-B. Whereas mdma turns me into a puddle of love and empathy, Kanna just on its at that dose had me pacing around my living room with every feeling and emotion and thought I had just helplessly pouring out of my mouth, like MDMA allowed me to move through that wall at will, yet that dose of Kanna simply dissolved that wall and an emotional flood occured. My next try was the same dose but with 2C-B and it was certainly more in control and felt vaguely like if MDA came directly from a plant somehow.

I'm actually a chemical supplier myself a legit decently sized distributor that operates in North America and Canada. I've done it all and for many years very irresponsible too. I was convinced id never feel anything euphoric again. Then 750ug 25e NBOH 40 minutes absorbed due to being sublingual and I cried so much because it was so beautiful and pleasurable.

As far as I'm aware there's no overdose point (people have gone as high as 500mg before), but I wouldn't push it. It took Nazi experiments using numerous simultaneous IVs of pure mescaline to finally find its LD50.


I find doses in the 2-5mg range to essentially be like psychedelically flavored nootropics, 5-20 to be like psychedelic seasoning best added with other drugs, 25-35 to be normal trip territory, and 45-60 to be heavy trip territory including guaranteed nausea but also it's where the profound, nearly "religious" or "spiritual" feeling nature of this drug truly begins to show itself. The highest I've gone was 75-100mg insufflated. I vomited like I was on ayahuasca but it was a lot less brutal. It lasted more like 8-10 hours, and at points my visuals looked like a mescaline flavored DMT breakthrough, where I couldn't even see in front of myself, just the visuals. That was one of the most profound and life-changing experiences of my life.

I'm pretty confident there's a death associated with the insufflation of ~100mg of 2C-E. 2C-E, 2C-P and 2C-TFM all seem specifically unforgiving in their dose response curve, so please be careful if you do go hard with the 2C-E. Miprocin and DMT are beautiful though and I've pushed miprocin quite hard. 25mg of 2C-B, 25mg of DOM and 40mg of miprocin made up a favorite trip for me once, all mixed up into one big line and insufflated.

Yeah, I had an accidental overdose on 2c-c. ended up having 2 seizures and 8-10 hours in utter complete hell.

I've never been the same after those episodes, i mean i was broken for quite some time. 


Yeah, i've done a high dose of miprocin before and it was one of the best trips i've had. I can't wait to add a breakthrough of dmt with it. Finally got past my fear of dmt (after the 5-meo event) and it's the exact opposite of its 5-meo derivative. I finally got the courage to smoke past that stage before the breakthrough and it's actually less anxiety inducing than smaller doses. Once you blast through reality and are flying through different realms, my anxiety fades away in the presence of such awe and beauty.

I'm sorry to hear about your overdoses, are you able to recall what doses led to that occurring? I have a friend who's eaten a gram of 2C-B over 5 days and seemed relatively alright, but he was 260-280 pounds.

I notice opinions on DMT and 5-Meo-DMT vary a lot.  I have not smoked DMT but have gone "all the way there and back" on ayahuasca+DMT and while it was indeed breathtakingly beautiful and loving it also took me through periods of overwhelming fear.  I found notes of my first trip on aya+DMT, and I spent a considerable portion of the trip fearing that I had stopped time for myself and would be stuck forever because of it.  When I came back down, after only 2 hours of intense tripping, I felt like I'd literally been away for a month.


I will say that 5-Meo-DMT feels like poison to me.  I have another report to post of ~1.5 mg which wasn't especially trippy but left me very hyperstimulated for 7 or 8 hours after.  I also once took ~5 mg 5-MeoDMT orally in the wake of a failed aya+DMT trip.  The MAOI was still active.  The psychedelea was modest but my body felt literally on the edge of death.  It was absolutely terrible---my worst drug experience ever.


Anyway, I agree 2C-B has a lot overdose reports and no deaths (to my knowledge) yet, but in general, I don't believe anyone should ever assume safety with any drug at very higher doses because there just aren't nearly as many reports as for "regular" doses.  I mean, someone did die from snorting ~150 mg (?) of 2C-E, but so far I only know of one person several others doing stupid things like that.  These drugs interact at a few different receptors for which people may exhibit a wide variety of genetic variations.  Idiosyncratic reactions can happen with just about any drug, at any dose.  The key is to look at the numbers.  Lots and lots of people have taken 2C-B at up to 30 mg many times, probably millions, and no one has died, which means that the drug probably is quite safe in that range.  Much fewer have taken over 100 mg though and only then maybe only once or twice.  Let's say it was 500 people.  (I don't know how many it actually is, it could be 5000 and the argument would still apply.)  Well, what if the risk death from 200 mg from person to person are around 1 in 500?  Maybe no one's died *yet*, but in that case it probably will happen eventually.


So I guess my bigger point is that safety is typically not a certain matter (unless you do something real stupid like MAOI+SSRI) but one about minimizing risks, and given the huge unknowns, the risks of using uncommonly higher doses are by definition much greater, just as they are much greater when using any relatively untested chemical versus things with solid history of human use.

I have not smoked DMT but have gone "all the way there and back" on ayahuasca+DMT and while it was indeed breathtakingly beautiful and loving it also took me through periods of overwhelming fear.  I found notes of my first trip on aya+DMT, and I spent a considerable portion of the trip fearing that I had stopped time for myself and would be stuck forever because of it.  When I came back down, after only 2 hours of intense tripping, I felt like I'd literally been away for a month.

I also once took ~5 mg 5-MeoDMT orally in the wake of a failed aya+DMT trip.  The MAOI was still active.  The psychedelea was modest but my body felt literally on the edge of death.  It was absolutely terrible---my worst drug experience ever.

> Anyway, I agree 2C-B has a lot overdose reports and no deaths (to my knowledge) yet, but in general, I don't believe anyone should ever assume safety with any drug at very higher doses because there just aren't nearly as many reports as for "regular" doses.  I mean, someone did die from snorting ~150 mg (?) of 2C-E, but so far I only know of one person several others doing stupid things like that.  These drugs interact at a few different receptors for which people may exhibit a wide variety of genetic variations.  Idiosyncratic reactions can happen with just about any drug, at any dose.  The key is to look at the numbers.  Lots and lots of people have taken 2C-B at up to 30 mg many times, probably millions, and no one has died, which means that the drug probably is quite safe in that range.  Much fewer have taken over 100 mg though and only then maybe only once or twice.  Let's say it was 500 people.  (I don't know how many it actually is, it could be 5000 and the argument would still apply.)  Well, what if the risk death from 200 mg from person to person are around 1 in 500?  Maybe no one's died *yet*, but in that case it probably will happen eventually.

> So I guess my bigger point is that safety is typically not a certain matter (unless you do something real stupid like MAOI+SSRI) but one about minimizing risks, and given the huge unknowns, the risks of using uncommonly higher doses are by definition much greater, just as they are much greater when using any relatively untested chemical versus things with solid history of human use.

Just found a 20mg 2cb pill i thought i had lost in SF china town. I took 2 and went to china town with my girl. it was quite fun, but very mild. stopped by the famous chinese bar that serve anthony bourdains favorite mai tais. I was coming up when we sat at the bar so that famous mai tai helped smooth things out a lot. My vendor shipped 200ng of 2cb powder a couple days ago and he just informed me my dmt, miprocin, and 5-apb are coming as well. 


Apparently many vendors selling.6-apb hcl actually have 5-apb hcl. This literally just happened to me. Thought it wad odd that their 5-mapb cost more than the 6-apb. I honestly didn't mind because I had never tried 5-apb, plus it's more potent. I plugged 100 mg last week and was blasted. really like it. It's a lot cleaner than 6-apb and more rolly/stimmy, but lacks that psychedelic edge. i have MDA so i don't need that anyways. I also liked that 5-apb had no bad comedown or after effects. I actually had a glow the next day. 


I'm guessing DMT, miprocin, and 5-apb will get along together quite well.

It's kind of fun and strangely addictive, but if I do too much in one session, I get a very eerie and icky after-effect in which I felt slightly insane and lasting some hours.  I actually had this problem after the dentist when I was young.  Actually, the last time I had N2O at the dentist, I actually had a "hole" experience, in which I went flying through outer space toward heaven.  I was 18 at the time, and I sat in my car in the parking lot for about half an hour afterwards because it took me that long to feel like my survival instinct was properly intact.  This experience was a big inspiration for me to seek out psychedelic drugs, starting with DMT, but I never experienced anything else like it nor have I really sought out dissociatives.

I think I can understand what you're talking about with this, but I only ever found these feelings enjoyable. I've only ever used it while safe alone at home, so I never had to worry about being able to drive home or being in public around "normies" or anything.


I will say that one of the reasons I don't really use nitrous oxide or other dissociatives anymore is because I'm afraid of them pushing me into an episode. I have had some past experiences like that where in retrospect I can say that nitrous oxide at the time didn't really seem to... help.


I only ever use nitrous oxide at what you could call a "hole" level though. If I don't go completely into that place, I generally just consider it an unsuccessful usage attempt. I basically never would have less than eight chargers in my balloon, although again it's been years since I actually used it regularly now, and mostly at all. I do consider it to have been a meaningful stepping stone on my path to being where I am now, both with drugs and otherwise....


Dissociatives in general I think are some of the most phenomenologically interesting drugs, although for what it's worth, almost any time someone describes something that reminds me of things I have experienced while insane without drugs, it's from a dissociative experience. Make of that what you will.

Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Indian, African and Ethiopian, etc. all found their way to my palette while on psychedelics, in addition to plenty of late night diner visits.  Sadly I can't eat much of that anymore because my IBS got so bad.  Onion or garlic, even in small amounts, became reliable triggers of horrid symptoms.

I'm trying to not get my hopes up and focus on long-term healing, but if I can heal my GI system, I may be able to eat onion, garlic, and larger amounts of chile again.  Yum yum yum!  I'll still probably be COVID shy, but that's what take out is for.  And then I don't worry about offending anyone if I appear to orgasm from tasting a curry.

That is unfortunate, but I hope you're able to get that GI healing as well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I've been worried about similar problems lately as well, I stopped eating that much spicy food for a while and I think I need to start reintroducing it to my system to build up my tolerance again. Perhaps taking more psychedelics would help me with that as well....


I do have a thing about garlic that has scared me away from it for a long time. One night after eating a bunch of garlic parmesan chicken wings I discovered this.... It literally felt like I was going to black out from the stomach pain and I couldn't touch any other food for the rest of the night despite my friend taking me to a new restaurant he wanted me to try. I even feel weird trying cannabis strains with 'garlic' in their name now, lol. That's how much I've become instinctively wired to avoid it. Perhaps one day I can heal this for myself too though.

At times, I have not been at all shy to express my pleasure.  I mean, I don't really do quiet sex, so if a window is open or I'm in a tent, then everyone around is going to know what me and my partner are up to.  This is most especially so if my partner and I are tripping, in which it can go on for hours.  At times, I've felt it to be my duty to raise awareness of what's possible in terms of ecstatic pleasure.  Few people realize their true potential to experience pleasure, so they don't know what to strive for.  They need inspiration!  Of course I doubt most of the others saw it that way, but I really didn't care at the time.

Understandable lol. Well, now you've got a new way to share the news. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm human too and I understand feeling embarrassed to be suddenly caught supposedly enjoying yourself too much by someone's standards in public or something. But in general, I don't hold back my having a good time if I can avoid it, especially not for something as simple yet special as enjoying a meal. Why not enjoy every single moment of every single day we have on this planet to the fullest extent we can possibly achieve?


In reference to the previous quote of yours here that I have responded, I have actually gotten an 'orgasm-like' level of enjoyment out of food before too, heh. Kind of a... head-wavey, lost-in-pleasure, "Mm... Mmmm... MMMM!!" Made me realize that some people aren't just being expressive when they react to food that way lol. Sometimes things really just do taste that damn good, and again, why not enjoy it when they do? ![😁](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f601.png) That happened to me once too when smelling a strain of cannabis, haha. I could literally see flower imagery floating out of me from the pure, orgasmic release of how fucking good it smelled. Then I spent the next couple of weeks smelling every strain like a freak trying to make it happen again, sadly it didn't. I was hoping it was going to permanently open up my neural pathways and make smelling cannabis like human catnip for me. I guess sometimes cannabis just really can smell that good.


For what it's worth, this is actually one of the reasons I just kind of instinctively run with my natural altered states a lot of the time.... Well, more learned than instinctive, but it's become like second nature. I just love experiencing life too much, and my episodes take me to heights that nothing else does, and then afterwards I feel like I'm more easily able to reach similar heights from other stimuli in my life than I was able to otherwise, which is also part of the reason I started liking psychedelics and such in the first place as they do something similar for me too, although not to quite the same level (although to the highest level I had experienced back when I first started using them, hence why I fell in love with them). The more I can learn to let go, the better.


*cough* Not that I think people should necessarily take my advice on how to handle things like manic psychosis. But that's definitely how they've gone for me and is a big part of why they're so addictive to me now. There's something to be said about being able to go all the way without fear and express your ecstasy regardless of how you achieve it.

I definitely do think it feels like that is happening even if there's even more to the explanation than that too. It's an incredibly unique and fascinating state, but yeah, probably best avoided by people who are actually trying to use drugs in safe and healthy way. Just something I managed to get a glimpse into in my more reckless days.

My boyfriend and I call it "being irondomed". I have done a somewhat comical amount of 2C-B in the past couple of years, the highest rate being my boyfriend and I putting a gram down in about six weeks. DOM is something we took to using as a "launching pad". By that, I mean usually a DOx, LSD or an N-benzylated phenethylamine as a base for other drugs to be applied from, like seasonings on a curry.


We've used all of these on their own and in smaller crosses before, but quickly found that 2C-B + DOM has a special synergy to it, as does 3-MeO-PCP and MDA, so we decided to see if those two synergies would synergize, if that makes sense.


They sure did. It was easily one of the most magical experiences of my life. Could've added LSD, salvia or nitrous but I think that can be added to any experience essentially just to make it better. It should always be assumed in any drug use I mention too that I'm smoking obscene amounts of cannabis alongside whatever I'm dosing. This specific Valentine's Day experience everything was dosed at the same time except 1/3 of the MDA and 2/3 of the PCP which were done progressively in lines, iirc.


I think that exploring the intersections of these compounds is just as important as exploring them on their own, as far as harm reduction goes. I can certainly vouch for a novel and unique form of mania from PCP use while on MDXX drugs, for example leading me to video call random friends at late hours of the night feeling like that Basquiat painting 'Dustheads'.


While I don't ever want to broadcast the message of "everybody should match me for dose on this shit", as very often that's not the right move for people, all I can really do is accurately report on my own use of these things in the way that I've found the most useful, I suppose.

Seeing as we're on the subject of safety profiles, for data sake I might as well report that I once took 885mg of 2cb over an 18 hour period. Most of that was in the last 6 hours and I'd taken 2 tabs of acid 8 hours earlier so there was a tolerance from that. A lot of synergy too. Beautiful explosive colourful fractal imagery and a euphoric near orgasmic body high throughout. Exceptional ++++ experience.


On another occasion I took somewhere in the 500mg ball park over the span of a couple of hours (didn't keep notes that time so don't remember extact dosing schedule, but the final dose was 200mg). It was 3 days after I'd tripped on something else so I had a tolerance. Unpleasant dysporic experience. It wasn't a feeling of toxicity exactly, no pain/nausea/fever/delirium or anything else one would consider typical signs of an overdose. It was more like the body high you typically get from 2cb had reached its peak and then overshot and crossed over into physical dysphoria. My body just felt wrong, like I was inhabiting a corpse. After laying on my back like a dead fish for about an hour I started coming down and felt fine afterwards. 


. [@iom](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/57348/)'s right that we can't assume anything and there is a lot more data on low doses than high doses, but it's also true that 2cb has been in the public domain for the better part of 40 years without a single documented fatal overdose, and what evidence there is points to a potential lethal dose being closer to a gram than a mg and orders of magnitude higher than a typical recreational dose. Hopefully we never do hear of a fatal overdose. Stranger things have happened.

Likely taking this for the first time on Saturday. In pill form so unsure of the strength.


My current plan is to break up the pill and maybe take like 2/3 of it. 


Assuming I'm in control of things then 3 hours later take some (medium strength) mdma plus the remainder of the 2c-b pill.


Sound like a reasonable approach to more experienced heads on here? I'm looking for noticeable impact but nothing too crazy.


For context, I've been taking 6-apb a fair few times a year for several years as well as occasional hits of weed, mdma, pills and amt.

You may be better off taking the whole pill at once and skipping the MDMA until you know what 2cb is like on its own. [Pills are usually dosed around 15mg](https://www.drugsdata.org/results.php?search_field=all&s=2cb) give or take which is on the lower end of a typical recreational dose.


If you're set on mixing it with MDMA I would still take the whole pill and about 3 hours after the MDMA for a proper nexus flip.

IME if you stack the peaks it can be quite intense. I've seen someone take 2 full doses of 2C-B and MDMA stacking the peaks (somewhat unknowingly) and they had too intense of an experience and writhed around in bed for hours before saying they would never take 2C-B again (sadly).


My most rewarding 2C-B/MDMA combos have been ala Shulgin. That is taking the MDMA first, and the moment your peak passes take a reasonable dose of 2C-B. 15mg has been enough for me personally.

There's no comedown from the MDMA and the 2C-B allows you to introspect.


I've taken the combo many times in many different orders, and that really has been the best for me. Stacking the peaks is intense, even for me, even when taking half doses of each. It also seems to stress my heart a bit. 2C-B then MDMA was less intense, still rewarding, but I definitely experienced the MDMA crash part.

Thanks for the replies. I’m just concerned that doing the full pill straight off runs the risk of me finding the whole thing too intense


I do agree the pill is likely not high dose though… so may go for the [@Shinji Ikari](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/551610/) approach and only go for the flip if I’m very in control.

Have you taken other psychedelics before?  If not, maybe try to find a sitter who has some experience with psychedelics.  That way, if the whole tablet is too much, you'll have someone to help you through it.  Usually I would recommend your cautious approach, but if you only take 2/3rds of the tablet, it's likely that the experience will be lacking.  That's ok if you don't mind being patient and can get more tablets, but if you only have one tablet and don't expect to be able to get more, you may want to take the small risk of taking the whole thing and being a bit overwhelmed.  Hence, I suggest a sitter if you are inexperienced with heavy trips.


I also don't trying to take the other 1/3rd after 3 hours.  It likely won't do much of anything at that point.  Instead, save it for a small "day-enhancing" dose or save it to combine with tablets you get in the future.  Good luck!

Would a mod be able to edit the last paragraph of the OP where I've highlighted in bold? I think they mixed up the HCl and HBr salts when discussing solubility. I would DM them about it but it looks like their account is inactive.

Also curious as to your 2C-C overdose. What was your dose?


I think my biggest was 60mg? at one point all of the colors of the TV are just bleeding out of the TV almost like liquid. I was alone and quite alarmed.

I took 25 mg of 2-cb last week, interesting compound. Reminded me of MDMA more than any psychedelic, though without the overly mushy lovey dovey feelings. I've never done any 2c drugs. Its nice, I would like to try a higher dosage. The visuals were minor, I see shuligan suggests that a few mg increase in dosage has huge difference, I will probably do around 30 next time. Felt super friendly, I could take this dose at a show for sure. Its fast acting too, much less commitment than an LSD trip, and the day after I felt pretty good with no residual tiredness. LSD I sleep a long time after. I don't think it will be my go to drug, but I hope to add a couple of doses to the stash.

Bright colourful high contrast visuals with a shiny liquid finish. Kind of like a wet paint filter over vision. Really slow comeup, solid couple of hours before peak. Stimulating and energising. Very well humoured it didn't take much to have me in hysterics literally crying laughing.


Peak lasted about 60 to 90 minutes. Then a plateau with solid visuals and lots of giggles for a couple of hours and mostly sober 6 hours after dropping the capsule. I vaped cannabis throughout and had a few bumps of ketamine from around hour 5 until it was bedtime.


Not much bodyload at all, actually less body feels than I notice from either substance alone. I needed to pee a lot towards the end but I always find that with 4-ho-met for some reason so it's not unique to the combo.


Felt a bit mushy and emotional towards the end of the trip but it was an almost entirely recreational experience.


Setting was home alone at night. Set...just a normal day I suppose. Mood was neutral but improved substantially by the trip.

^You can dose every day for a week and still have noticeable effects. Having as properly empty stomach (4-6 hours after eating) should mostly kill the nausea.

What are you guys preferred doses of 2cb?


I've tried it before at 10mg & 20mg. Both were solid but slightly too chill for me. I'm trying to find a dose that's fully psychedelic without becoming too intense or physically uncomfortable.

Yeah 2CB mixed with 4-HO-MET is a great mix. Both pretty much the easiest going psychedelics in their categories, so there's very little mindfuck if any, just a nice body buzz and cool visuals

I've pushed it over a hundred, but the dose response curve gets absolutely punishing ~35-45mg, that's when you get the nausea and all but also the intensely psychedelic beauty of this compound. Imo there's rarely, if ever a reason to exceed 50mg of 2C-B.


2C-B is also the only psychedelic I've seen people develop compulsive use with, especially if you're ordering by the quarter or eighth ounce and you're fine with burning a hole in your septum.

After taking 2C-B about 50 times I settled on 23 mgs as my go too.  I have done 28 mgs a bit too strong) and have done 18 mgs (which was a beautiful little trip I had on a beach in the DR.)  Was too nervous to take weed with me on the DR trip so I made a parsley blend of JWH-018.

As far as I can tell the tolerance is essentially zero. You can chain dose it for days.

I may revisit oral 2C-B HBr (23mg sweet spot) but I prefer to use it rectally. I get a richer experience with better sleep quality and less material. It does chap my ass, though. Literally, that is. I'm a weirdo and get the best effects when insufflated, but the comeup is pretty unpleasant for the duration via that route. I don't take much that way, though. 2-5mg is more my speed. Much more than that hurts my nose. I get less of a lingering tail of insomnia, more headspace, and actual visuals.

Except ket isn't a tranquilizer and 2cb isn't a stimulant and they make each other stronger rather than offsetting each other. Mixing weed or dissos with psychedelics expecting them to take the edge of the trip has ended horribly for a lot of people. Ket and 2cb is an amazing combo though, but for the opposite reasons you suggest.

Somewhere between 30 and 40mg will be your sweet spot I should think. The body load doesn't really start getting rough until 50mg ime. But you also might want to consider

this for next time. There's much less bodyload taking rectally and you achieve similar effects to an oral dose with half the amount.

It can creep up on you. I had one summer where I was going through the better part of a gram a week because of how cheap and accessible it was and how few responsibilities I had at the time.

Literally, that is. I'm a weirdo and get the best effects when insufflated, but the comeup is pretty unpleasant for the duration via that route. I don't take much that way, though. 2-5mg is more my speed. Much more than that hurts my nose. I get less of a lingering tail of insomnia, more headspace, and actual visuals.

I made a 2cb solution and put it into a nasal bottle once. The result was having a very sore throat and nose. God knows what it feels like up your backside.


Saying that, 2CB was dirt cheap when I used to do it. Looking at the prices now I may be tempted towards routes with a better absorption rate.

It makes you really need to take a shit for like 10 minutes and then it's fine. It's nowhere near as uncomfortable as a nasal spray which I agree is a horrible ROA.

I made mine to microdose with so it's only 1mg/spray. Oddly enough Etizolam's nasally active almost instantaneously upon administration, so I often hit both at the same time lol. Dual wielding nasal sprayers feels like being one of those people with four cigarettes between their fingers smoking them like a harmonica though, it just feels goofy as hell. 


2C-B in liquid form is honestly superior for dosing easily, going 20mg/mL has done me better than going dropwise, dropwise is never that accurate. Good for compact movement of huge amounts of 2C-B in discrete ways.

Ketamine is a dissasociative anesthetic, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a tranquilizer.


Tranquilizer: a medicinal drug taken to reduce tension or anxiety.


Ketamine has been used as a tranquilizer on animals since forever, and it has been used as a tranquilizer on humans.

I would agree though it is a very nice combo. I felt like I was floating.

It's a fun mix

I re-read my original post and I should have worded it better. Anyway...

2C-B isn't a stimulant, it's never been a stimulant. It may have stimulating properties and some degree of dopamine agonism but so does LSD, so does mescaline, so do most phenethylamine psychedelics. Are we going to start calling those stimulants too now?


I appreciate that a drug can be more than one thing, but labeling 2C-B a stimulant is just misleading and why a Wikipedia editor thought that plucking out a random study from 2015 to redefine a drug which has been clearly defined and it's effects documented for decades is beyond me.

Well, okay, fine, but please put this in context against the post I responding to. Conventional tranquilisers such as benzodiazapines may have the effect of 'slowing down' the intensity of a psychedelic drug (or indeed a stimulant) but ketamine will have the opposite effect and potentiate the effects. I'm not trying to be a pedant but I thought it was important to point this out for the purposes of harm reduction so that people don't try combining these drugs with the wrong expectations.


Again, I should have worded my original post better. [@specialrelativity](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/81238/) please accept my apologies if I came accoss as rude or combative.

Today I stepped up to 18 mg of 2C-B HBr.  I don't know the HCl equivalent, especially given varying hydrates and shit, so perhaps it's roughly the same as 14 mg of HCl?  I had a beautiful day.  Overall the trip felt much smoother on the body than the 12 mg trip I took in early spring.  I don't think this is because of the larger dose but because my body is reacting differently than it used to.  I believe I'm in better health, too.


It's interesting that it took me several tries to "get to know" 2C-B, but now that I know it better, I like it a lot.  This was the biggest dose I've ever taken, and next time I think I will step up to either 22 or 24 mg of HBr.  I had plenty of visuals, but they were rather faint and subtle.  I definitely got weaker visuals than I did on my 14-15 mg 2C-I trip in early August.

I took a pretty large 2cb dose last weekend (or the weekend before?) and then combined it with FXE. It was pretty fun, but probably don't need to dose that high again lol. I tried 40mg. I think yeah the perfect dose is going to be 20-25mg, like others have noted.

Went on a 16km run on 18mg 2C-B.


Was fantastic. Only recommended if you have been training. But a well worthwhile experience. 


Running absolutely does limit the effects however. 


Next up I’ll be trying it on 5mg DOM.
