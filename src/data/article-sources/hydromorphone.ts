## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic.

### Background

Hydromorphone is a pure opioid,
1
a semi-synthetic hydrogenated ketone derivative of
morphine
that has been available clinically since 1920. Structurally, hydromorphone derived from
morphine
in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound.
2
Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential).
3
The first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.
9

### Indication

Hydromorphone is indicated for the management of moderate to severe acute pain and severe chronic pain. Due to its addictive potential and overdose risk, hydromorphone is only prescribed when other first-line treatments have failed.
1
The WHO has proposed a three-step ladder for the management of pain in which it is suggested to start with a non-opioid medication followed by addition of weak opioids to the non-opioid treatment for moderate pain and finishing in the use of strong opioids such as hydromorphone along with the existing regimen for cases of severe pain.
2
Off-label, hydromorphone can be administered for the suppression of refractory cough.
1

### Pharmacodynamics

In clinical trials, hydromorphone has been shown to be suitable for pain relief in patients that do not tolerate the side effects of
morphine
or that suffer from renal failure or asthma. It has been shown to be 5-7 times more potent than morphine with a shorter duration of analgesia.
2
Some of the observed effects of the consumption of hydromorphone for acute pain are complete and longlasting pain relief when compared to other pain relief agents such as
meperidine
,
morphine
,
diamorphine
,
bupivacaine
,
indomethacin
, and
fentanyl
. On the same trials, hydromorphone was shown to produce respiratory depression, lower cognitive function, miosis, mydriasis, constipation, hypotension, and vertigo but to present a reduced incidence of pruritus (which indicates a lower release of histamine) and nausea.
7
The respiratory depression is known to be caused by the effect on the brain stem respiratory centers as well as to a reduction in the responsiveness of this brain stems to increase carbon dioxide tension.

### Absorption

The immediate release version of hydromorphone reaches its peak concentration after 30-60 minutes while the extended-release version reaches the peak concentration after 9 hours.
1
When administered orally, hydromorphone is absorbed mainly in the upper small intestine with a bioavailability of 60% due to intensive first-pass metabolism. In the controlled-release version of hydromorphone, the absorption follows a biphasic pharmacokinetic profile. However, even though there are clear distinctions in the absorption pathway of hydromorphone, the AUC of both versions is reported to be of 34 ng.h/ml which indicates an equivalence.
2
The parenteral administration of hydromorphone, which is the most common pathway, presents an almost immediate absorption as observed by the presence of peak plasma concentration almost immediately. This peak plasma concentration declines rapidly due to fast redistribution into liver, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle. In the parenteral route, the pharmacokinetic profile is log-linear and dose-dependent and to present a higher bioavailability of 78%.
2
Other administration routes such as rectal, nasal, intraspinal and transdermal present lower bioavailability and changes in their pharmacokinetic profile.
2

### Metabolism

The metabolism of hydromorphone is mainly hepatic and it is represented by the generation of hydromorphone-3-glucuronide through glucuronidation reactions.
1
This primary metabolic pathway is done by the activity of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7.
4
The first-pass hepatic metabolism is so large that it represents 62% of the initial administered dose.
3
On the other hand, hydromorphone is also characterized by the presence of minor metabolic pathways such as the CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-driven generation of norhydromorphone.

### Half-life

The half-life of hydromorphone immediate-release is of 2-3 hour while the extended release can range from 8-15 hours.
1

### Toxicity

The reported LD50 of hydromorphone in the mouse was of 104 mg/kg when given intravenously and 84 mg/kg when given orally.
12
The reports of overdose with hydromorphone are characterized by respiratory depression, somnolence, skeletal muscle flaccidity,  cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, myosis, mydriasis, bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and even death.
Label
The management of an overdose might require assisted ventilation, supportive measures, as well as cardiac massage and defibrillation. It can be recommended the use of
naloxone
solely in the cases of respiratory depression. The use of opioid antagonist should be restricted to patients that present respiratory depression as they can produce acute abstinence symptoms.
Label
Hydromorphone was not shown to be mutagenic nor clastogenic and long-term studies of carcinogenicity studies have not been performed. On the other hand, reduced implantation sites and viable fetuses were noted at a 2X normal concentration.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Hydromorphone is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Hydromorphone may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Hydromorphone can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abrocitinib
The metabolism of Abrocitinib can be decreased when combined with Hydromorphone.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Hydromorphone which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with or without food. Food does not significantly affect absorption.

### Mechanism of action

Hydromorphone is an opioid agonist that can bind to different types of opioid receptors. Its analgesic effect is suggested to be related to the effect on the mu-opioid receptors. It has been reported to also have a minor affinity for the delta and kappa receptor.
3
,
6
On the other hand, it is known to act at the level of the medulla which allows it to depress the respiratory drive and suppress cough.
1
The onset of action of the immediate release form of hydromorphone is achieved in 15-20 minutes and having a lasting effect for 3-4 hours while the extended-release form onset of action is of 6 hours lasting for about 13 hours.

### Pharmacological action

### Actions

Binder

### General Function

Binds water, Ca(2+), Na(+), K(+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin and drugs (Probable). Its main function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood (Probable). Major zinc transporter in plasma, typically binds about 80% of all plasma zinc (PubMed:19021548). Major calcium and magnesium transporter in plasma, binds approximately 45% of circulating calcium and magnesium in plasma (By similarity). Potentially has more than two calcium-binding sites and might additionally bind calcium in a non-specific manner (By similarity). The shared binding site between zinc and calcium at residue Asp-273 suggests a crosstalk between zinc and calcium transport in the blood (By similarity). The rank order of affinity is zinc > calcium > magnesium (By similarity). Binds to the bacterial siderophore enterobactin and inhibits enterobactin-mediated iron uptake of E.coli from ferric transferrin, and may thereby limit the utilization of iron and growth of enteric bacteria such as E.coli (PubMed:6234017). Does not prevent iron uptake by the bacterial siderophore aerobactin (PubMed:6234017)

**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Hydromorphone** (also known by the brand name **Dilaudid** in the United States) is a semisynthetic [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) of the [morphinan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphinan) chemical class that produces [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is occasionally prescribed for use in the management of moderate to severe pain and is structurally similar to other opioids such as [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) and [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) .

Hydromorphone is commonly used in a medical setting, mostly [intravenously](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Intravenously) due its very low [oral](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oral) , [rectal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rectal) , and [intranasal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Intranasal) bioavailability.

If using this substance intravenously in a non-medical, recreational setting, the [safer injection guide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Safer_injection_guide) should be followed along with all [harm reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) practices. [Sublingual](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) administration is also considered to be superior to oral administration in due to its increased bioavailability; however, hydromorphone is bitter and hydrophilic so it is absorbed poorly and slowly through mouth membranes.

## Chemistry

Hydromorphone is an opioid of the morphinan class. Hydromorphone and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R 9 and R 13 with the nitrogen member looking at R 17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan. Hydromorphone is a hydrogenated ketone of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) and thus is extremely similar in structure.

It is a derivative of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) ; to be specific, it is a hydrogenated ketone thereof. Comparatively, hydromorphone is to morphine as [hydrocodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hydrocodone) is to [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) —that is, also a semi-synthetic drug. Hydromorphone is made from morphine either by direct re-arrangement (made by reflux heating of alcoholic or acidic aqueous solution of morphine in the presence of platinum or palladium catalyst) or reduction to dihydromorphine (usually via catalytic hydrogenation), followed by oxidation with benzophenone in presence of potassium tert butoxide or aluminium tert butoxide (Oppenauer oxidation). The 6 ketone group may be replaced with a methylene group via the Wittig reaction to produce 6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine, which is 80× stronger than morphine.

Hydromorphone is more soluble in water than morphine; therefore, hydromorphone solutions may be produced to deliver the drug in a smaller volume of water. The hydrochloride salt is soluble in three parts of water, whereas a gram of morphine hydrochloride dissolves in 16 ml of water; for all common purposes, the pure powder for hospital use can be used to produce solutions of virtually arbitrary concentration. When the powder appeared on the street, this very small volume of powder needed for a dose means that overdoses are likely for those who mistake it for heroin or other powdered narcotics, especially those that have been diluted prior to consumption.

## Pharmacology

Hydromorphone molecules exert their effects by binding to and activating the [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) as an [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) . This occurs due to the way in which opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia, [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) along with [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) . They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) (pain relief), and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) (anti-anxiety) effects.

The recreational effects of this compound, including [cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) and [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , occur because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally produced within the body and are also active on the μ-opioid receptor set in the brain. The way in which synthetic opioids such as heroin structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects. This is because natural endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and feelings of pleasure. The natural endorphins can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Hydromorphone](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Hydromorphone.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Like most opioids, unadulterated hydromorphone does not cause many long-term complications other than psychological and physical dependence and constipation. The harmful or toxic aspects of hydromorphone's usage as a recreational substance are exclusively associated with not taking appropriate precautions in regards to its administration, overdosing, and using impure or adulterated batches of the substance.

Heavy dosages of hydromorphone can result in [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , leading onto fatal or dangerous levels of oxygen deprivation. This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) - this effect is proportional to the dosage of opiates consumed.

Hydromorphone can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates on their own vomit. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) ).

Opioid overdoses can be fatal if not treated immediately by calling the local emergency medical services and administering an opioid antagonist such as [naloxone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naloxone) to the overdosed user.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other opiate-based painkillers, the chronic use of hydromorphone can be considered extremely addictive and is capable of causing both physical and psychological dependence. When physical dependence has developed, [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of hydromorphone develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly. Hydromorphone presents cross-tolerance with all other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of hydromorphone all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) will have a reduced effect.

The risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and [relapse](/w/index.php?title=Relapse&action=edit&redlink=1) , largely because of reduced physical tolerance to the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects of the opioid. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer for a user that has been sober for an extended period of time to only dose a fraction of one's usual [dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) when using again. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance.

In one study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment. Because of the structral and chemical similarity of hydromorphone and [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) , it can be assumed that the same interaction between physical tolerance and the environment occurs in hydromorphone use.

### Dangerous interactions

Hydromorphone is dangerous to use in combination with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) as many fatalities reported as overdoses are caused by interactions with other depressant drugs like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , resulting in dangerously high levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) .

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants increase respiration rate which allows for a higher dose of opiates than would otherwise be used. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position blackouts/memory loss likely.
- **DXM** - Generally considered to be toxic. CNS depression, difficulty breathing, heart issues, and liver toxicity have been observed. Additionally if one takes DXM, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position
- **Ketamine** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MAOIs** - Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.
- **MXE** - MXE can potentiate the effects of opioids but also increases the risk of respiratory depression and organ toxicity.
- **Nitrous** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are common.
- **PCP** - PCP may reduce opioid tolerance, increasing the risk of overdose.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of seizures. Tramadol itself is known to induce seizures and it may have additive effects on seizure threshold with other opioids. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present.
- **Grapefruit** - While grapefruit is not psychoactive, it may affect the metabolism of certain opioids. Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice . This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected . Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.

**Hydromorphone**, a more common synonym for dihydromorphinone (not to be confused by dihydromorphine, which is a different derivative of the morphine family), commonly a hydrochloride (brand names Palladone, Dilaudid, and numerous others). It's a semi-synthetic opioid.

## History

Knoll introduced it to the mass market in 1926 under the brand name Dilaudid, indicating its derivation and degree of similarity to morphine (by way of laudanum). The brand name Dilaudid is more widely known than the generic term hydromorphone, and because of this, Dilaudid is often used generically to mean any form of hydromorphone.

  "wikipedia": `# Hydromorphone
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydromorphone*

Hydromorphone, also known as dihydromorphinone, and sold under the brand name Dilaudid among others, is a morphinan opioid used to treat moderate to severe pain. Typically, long-term use is only recommended for pain due to cancer. It may be used by mouth or by injection into a vein, muscle, or under the skin. Effects generally begin within half an hour and last for up to five hours. A 2016 Cochrane review (updated in 2021) found little difference in benefit between hydromorphone and other opioids for cancer pain.
Common side effects include dizziness, euphoria, sleepiness, nausea,  itchiness, and constipation. Serious side effects may include abuse, low blood pressure, seizures, respiratory depression, and serotonin syndrome. Rapidly decreasing the dose may result in opioid withdrawal. Generally, use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Hydromorphone is believed to work by activating opioid receptors, mainly in the brain and spinal cord. Hydromorphone 2 mg IV is equivalent to approximately 10 mg morphine IV.
Hydromorphone was patented in 1923. Hydromorphone is made from morphine. Hydromorphone is a therapeutic alternative on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 233rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.

## Side effects

Adverse effects of hydromorphone are similar to those of other potent opioid analgesics such as morphine and heroin. The major hazards of hydromorphone include dose-related respiratory depression, urinary retention, bronchospasm, and sometimes, circulatory depression. More common side effects include lightheadedness, dizziness, nystagmus, sedation, itching, constipation, nausea, vomiting, headache, perspiration, and hallucinations. These symptoms are common in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain.
Simultaneous use of hydromorphone with other opioids, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, sedatives, and general anesthetics may significantly depress respiration, progressing to coma or death. Taking benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) in conjunction with hydromorphone may increase side effects such as dizziness and difficulty concentrating. If simultaneous use of these drugs is required, dose adjustment may be made.
A particular problem that may occur with hydromorphone is accidental administration in place of morphine due to a mix-up between the similar names, either at the time the prescription is written or when the drug is dispensed. This has led to several deaths and calls for hydromorphone to be distributed in distinctly different packaging from morphine to avoid confusion.
Massive overdoses are rarely observed in opioid-tolerant individuals, but when they occur, they may lead to circulatory system collapse. Symptoms of overdose include respiratory depression, drowsiness leading to coma and sometimes to death, drooping of skeletal muscles, low heart rate, and decreasing blood pressure. At the hospital, individuals with hydromorphone overdose are provided supportive care, such as assisted ventilation to provide oxygen and gut decontamination using activated charcoal through a nasogastric tube. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, also may be administered concurrently with oxygen supplementation. Naloxone works by reversing the effects of hydromorphone, and is administered only in the presence of significant respiratory depression and circulatory depression.
Sugar cravings associated with hydromorphone use are the result of a glucose crash after transient hyperglycemia following injection, or a less profound lowering of blood sugar over a period of hours, in common with morphine, heroin, codeine, and other opioids.

### Hormone imbalance

As with other opioids, hydromorphone (particularly during heavy chronic use) often causes temporary hypogonadism or hormone imbalance.

### Neurotoxicity

In the setting of prolonged use, high dosage, and/or kidney dysfunction, hydromorphone has been associated with neuroexcitatory symptoms such as tremor, myoclonus, agitation, and cognitive dysfunction. This toxicity is less than that associated with other classes of opioids such as the pethidine class of synthetics in particular.

### Withdrawal

Users of hydromorphone may experience painful symptoms if the drug is suspended. Some people cannot tolerate the symptoms, which results in continuous drug use. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal are not easy to decipher, as there are differences between drug-seeking behaviors and true withdrawal effects. Symptoms associated with hydromorphone withdrawal include:

Abdominal pain
Anxiety
Panic attacks
Depression
Piloerection (goose bumps)
Inability to enjoy daily activities
Muscle and joint pain
Nausea
Vomiting
Runny nose and excessive secretion of tears
Sweating
In the clinical setting, excessive secretion of tears, yawning, and dilation of pupils are helpful presentations in diagnosing opioid withdrawal. Hydromorphone is a rapid-acting painkiller; however, some formulations may last up to several hours. Patients who stop taking this drug abruptly may experience withdrawal symptoms, which may start within hours of taking the last dose of hydromorphone, and last up to several weeks. Withdrawal symptoms in people who stopped taking the opioid may be managed by using opioids or non-opioid adjuncts. Methadone is an opioid commonly used for this kind of therapy. However, the selection of therapy should be tailored to each specific person. Methadone also is used for detoxification in people who have opiate addiction, such as heroin or drugs similar to morphine. It may be given orally or intramuscularly. There is controversy regarding whether any opioid (such as methadone) should be included in the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, since these agents also may cause relapse when therapy is suspended. Clonidine is a non-opioid adjunct which may be used in situations where opioid use is not desired, such as in patients with high blood pressure.

## Interactions

CNS depressants may enhance the depressant effects of hydromorphone, such as other opioids, anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, chloral hydrate, dimenhydrinate, and glutethimide. The depressant effect of hydromorphone also may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors), first-generation antihistamines (e.g., brompheniramine, promethazine, diphenhydramine, chlorphenamine), beta blockers, and alcohol. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.

## Pharmacology

Hydromorphone is a semi-synthetic μ-opioid agonist. As a hydrogenated ketone of morphine, it shares the pharmacologic properties typical of opioid analgesics. Hydromorphone and related opioids produce their major effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. These include analgesia, drowsiness, mental clouding, changes in mood, euphoria or dysphoria, respiratory depression, cough suppression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased biliary pressure, and increased pinpoint constriction of the pupils.

### Formulations

Hydromorphone is available in parenteral, rectal, subcutaneous, and oral formulations, and also can be administered via epidural or intrathecal injection. Hydromorphone also has been administered via nebulization to treat shortness of breath, but it is not used as a route for pain control due to low bioavailability. Transdermal delivery systems are also under consideration to induce local skin analgesia.
Concentrated aqueous solutions of hydromorphone hydrochloride have a visibly different refractive index from pure water, isotonic 9‰ (0·9 per cent) saline and the like, especially when stored in clear ampoules and phials may acquire a slight clear amber discolouration upon exposure to light; this reportedly has no effect on the potency of the solution, but 14-dihydromorphinones such as hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and relatives come with instructions to protect from light. Ampoules of solution which have developed a precipitate should be discarded.
Battery-powered intrathecal drug delivery systems are implanted for chronic pain when other options are ruled out, such as surgery and traditional pharmacotherapy, provided that the patient is considered a suitable fit in terms of any contraindications, both physiological and psychological.
An extended-release (once-daily) version of hydromorphone is available in the United States. Previously, an extended-release version of hydromorphone, Palladone, was available before being voluntarily withdrawn from the market after a July 2005 FDA advisory warned of a high overdose potential when taken with alcohol. As of March 2010, it is still available in the United Kingdom under the brand name Palladone SR, Nepal under the brand name Opidol, and in most other European countries, In Canada, pre­scrip­tion continuous release hydro­morphone is available as both brand name (Hydro­morph Contin) and generic formu­lations (Apo-Hydro­morphone CR).

### Pharmacokinetics

The chemical modification of the morphine molecule to hydromorphone results in higher lipid solubility and greater ability to cross the blood–brain barrier to produce more rapid and complete central nervous system penetration. On a per milligram basis, hydromorphone is considered to be five times as potent as morphine; although the conversion ratio may vary from 4–8 times, five times is in typical clinical usage.
Patients with renal abnormalities must exercise caution when dosing hydromorphone. In those with renal impairment, the half-life of hydromorphone may increase to as much as 40 hours. The typical half-life of intravenous hydromorphone is 2.3 hours. Peak plasma levels usually occur between 30 and 60 minutes after oral dosing.
The onset of action for hydromorphone administered intravenously is less than 5 minutes and within 30 minutes of oral administration (immediate release).

### Metabolism

While other opioids in its class, such as codeine or oxycodone, are metabolized via CYP450 enzymes, hydromorphone is not. Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized in the liver to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which has no analgesic effects. As similarly seen with the morphine metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide, a build-up in levels of hydromorphone-3-glucuronide may produce excitatory neurotoxic effects such as restlessness, myoclonus and hyperalgesia. Patients with compromised kidney function and older patients are at higher risk for metabolite accumulation.

## Chemistry

With a formula of C17H19NO3 and a molecular weight of 285.343, both identical to morphine, hydromorphone can be considered a structural isomer of morphine and is a hydrogenated ketone thereof.
Hydromorphone is made from morphine either by direct re-arrangement (made by reflux heating of alcoholic or acidic aqueous solution of morphine in the presence of platinum or palladium catalyst) or reduction to dihydromorphine (usually via catalytic hydrogenation), followed by oxidation with benzophenone in presence of potassium tert butoxide or aluminium tert butoxide (Oppenauer oxidation). The 6 ketone group may be replaced with a methylene group via the Wittig reaction to produce 6-methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine, which is 80× stronger than morphine.
Hydromorphone is more soluble in water than morphine; therefore, hydromorphone solutions may be produced to deliver the drug in a smaller volume of water. The hydrochloride salt is soluble in three parts of water, whereas a gram of morphine hydrochloride dissolves in 16 ml of water; for all common purposes, the pure powder for hospital use can be used to produce solutions of virtually arbitrary concentration. When the powder appeared on the street, this very small volume of powder needed for a dose means that overdoses are likely for those who mistake it for heroin or other powdered narcotics, especially those that have been diluted prior to consumption.

### Bacteria

Some bacteria have been shown to be able to turn morphine into closely related drugs, including hydromorphone and dihydromorphine among others. The bacterium Pseudomonas putida serotype M10 produces a naturally occurring NADH-dependent morphinone reductase that can work on unsaturated 7,8 bonds, with result that, when these bacteria are living in an aqueous solution containing morphine, significant amounts of hydromorphone form, as it is an intermediary metabolite in this process; the same goes for codeine being turned into hydrocodone.

## History

Hydromorphone was patented in 1923. It was introduced to the mass market in 1926 under the brand name Dilaudid, indicating its derivation and degree of similarity to morphine (by way of laudanum).

## Society and culture

### Names

Hydromorphone is known in various countries around the world by the brand names Hydal, Dimorphone, Exalgo, Sophidone LP, Dilaudid, Hydrostat, Hydromorfan, Hydromorphan, Hymorphan, Laudicon, Opidol, Palladone, Hydromorph Contin, and others. An extended-release version of hydromorphone, called Palladone, was available for a short time in the United States before being voluntarily withdrawn from the market after a July 2005 FDA advisory warned of a high overdose potential when taken with alcohol. As of March 2010, it is still available in Nepal under the brand name Opidol, in the United Kingdom under the brand name Palladone SR, and in most other European countries.
There has also been a once-daily prolonged release version of hydromorphone available in Australia under the brand name Jurnista as of May 2009.

### Legal status

In the United States, the main drug control agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration, reports an increase in annual aggregate production quotas of hydromorphone from 766 kilograms (1,689 pounds) in 1998 to 3,300 kilograms (7,300 lb) in 2006, and an increase in prescriptions in this time of 289%, from about 470,000 to 1,830,000. The 2013 production quota was 5,968 kilograms (13,157 lb).
Like all opioids used for analgesia, hydromorphone is potentially habit-forming and is listed in Schedule II of the United States Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as well as in similar levels under the drugs laws of practically all other countries and it is listed in the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs. The DEA ACSCN for hydromorphone is 9150.
Hydromorphone is listed under the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz as a Betäubungsmittel in the most restricted schedule for medicinal drugs; it is controlled similarly in Austria (Suchtgift) under the SMG and the Swiss BetmG. The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (United Kingdom) and comparable French, Canadian, Australian, Italian, Czech, Croatian, Slovenian, Swedish, Polish, Spanish, Greek, Russian, and other laws similarly control it, as do regulations in virtually all other countries.

### Use in executions

In 2009, Ohio approved the use of an intramuscular injection of 500 mg of hydromorphone and a supratherapeutic dose of midazolam as a backup means of carrying out executions by lethal injection when a suitable vein cannot be found for intravenous injection.

## Veterinary use

Hydromorphone is used as an intravenous analgesic in cats and dogs. Hydromorphone's potency is 5–10 times greater than morphine when given intravenously and the length of effect is dose dependent with times ranging 1–8 hours. Anaesthetic recovery can be prolonged from long use of hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is not useful compared to morphine when given subcutaenously in cats or epidurally in cats and dogs. Hydromorphone can provide analgesia up to 12 hours when given intravenously in horses and is also effective when given intramuscular. Hydromorphone has minimal adverse effects in horses when compared to other opioids such as morphine.
