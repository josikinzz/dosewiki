## Subjective Experience

I had sampled skullcap a couple of years previously, but my notes were sparse. On
the adapted Shulgin scale they indicated a + when drank as a tea, and a +* when
smoked. Translating this, I felt a very minor effect, possibly too minor to articulate,
but enjoyed slightly more potency when I smoked it.

This was contrary to most Internet reports, which claimed greater effect from tea
than smoking. Regardless, I decided to re-test by smoking, as on the evening in
question I had a full stomach, which could have reduced the efficacy of oral
ingestion.

As I wasn’t feeling at the top of my game, I was hoping for some sort of mood lift, or
less optimistically, for an anxiolytic response. My expectations, however, were not at
all high.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 Filling the bowl of a small bong, I take five large hits, in fairly quick
succession. [7pm]
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
None of the hits are terrible in terms of taste, although they are perhaps
slightly harsh. On the first hit, I feel a slight and momentary head rush.
Thereafter, I don’t feel any obvious response or any immediate form of
intoxication.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:03 Sitting down at my desk, perhaps I do feel slightly better. The stomach
anxiety has diminished, and there is a slight fuzziness there or thereabouts.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am not stoned, but I do feel a mild but marked reaction. There is nothing
unpleasant about it, but it isn’t a high or any form of euphoria. It is simply a
more chilled heady feeling and accompanying state of mind.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:10 Ten minutes in, these effects are still with me. I feel a gentle calmness,
relative to where I was beforehand. There is a distinct headiness about this
which is quite soothing.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:20 I am still relaxed. Throughout I have retained mental clarity, and at
no stage have I felt that my functionality has been impaired. It is a solid and
reasonably interesting experience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 The ride is starting to subside a little, although I am still calm and
chillaxed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 The effects are now less pronounced, and I am close to base, but
certainly not at base. It strikes me that I could have been more deeply sedated
earlier than I thought I was.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 Most of the headiness has gone. I feel more or less back at baseline,
although anxiety is still absent and I still feel calm in a naturally sedated way.
I am wondering if there will be a knock-on effect for the night’s sleep.
\`\`\`
The night’s sleep was a little strange. There were weird dreams, which could be
unconnected, but the sleep tended to have the same skullcap headiness quality to it,
and this was definitely there when I awoke in the morning. There was no discomfort
but it was present and it only dissipated after an hour or so, with the help of a cup of
filtered coffee.

Following this experiment, I am now left wondering about skullcap consumed as tea.
Given that smoking touched a fairly pleasant ++ experience, this may well be worth
another fling.

I should also state that the skullcap I used was very dry, and had been lying around
for some time. This suggests that fresh skullcap might produce an even stronger ride.
Bear in mind here that with a higher quality sample five bong hits may well be
overdoing it.

Finally, it is worth noting that a number of species of scutellaria are cited as being
psychoactive. Of these, scutellaria nana is sometimes claimed to be the most potent,
although it may be difficult to procure.

## Summary
Scutellaria is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. They are known commonly as skullcaps. The generic name is derived from the Latin scutella, meaning "a small dish, tray or platter", or "little dish", referring to the shape of the calyx. The common name alludes to the resemblance of the same structure to "miniature medieval helmets". The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide, mainly in temperate regions.

## Description
Most Scutellaria are annual or perennial herbaceous plants from 5 to 100 cm (2 to 39 in) tall, however a few are subshrubs. Some Scutellaria are aquatic. Scutellaria have four-angled stems and opposite leaves, and flowers with upper and lower lips. The genus is most easily recognized by the typical shield on the calyx that has also prompted its common name.

## Traditional use
Skullcaps are used in traditional medicine, such as in traditional Chinese medicine. The root of Scutellaria baicalensis – a common component of many preparations –  is marketed in volumes that have led to the overexploitation of the wild plant. Its rarity has led to an increase in price, and encouraged the adulteration of the product with other species of Scutellaria.
In 1773, Scutellaria lateriflora became a common treatment in North America for the hysteria and hydrophobia caused by rabies. Today it is still a popular medicinal herb. It is widely available as a commercial product used in western herbalism. The plant reportedly commands prices of \$16 to \$64 per pound dry weight.

## Constituents
The main compounds in skullcap are flavonoids. Isolated chemical compounds include wogonin, wogonoside, and 3,5,7,2',6'-pentahydroxyl flavanone found in Scutellaria. Other constituents include baicalin, apigenin, oroxylin A, and scutellarein.

## Selected species
Estimates of the number of species in the genus range from around 300 to about 350 or 360 to 470.
Selected species include:
