Propylisopropyltryptamine (PiPT), also known as N-propyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family. It reportedly produces hallucinogenic effects that resemble those of other related dialkyl tryptamine derivatives, although PiPT is reportedly relatively weak and short-lasting. It has been sold as a designer drug, first being identified in 2021 in British Columbia, Canada.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), PiPT had not yet been evaluated.

## Interactions

## Chemistry

PiPT is short for N-propyl-N-isopropyltryptamine. PiPT is a tryptamine, which all belong to a larger family of compounds known as indolethylamines

### Analogues

Analogues of PiPT include methylisopropyltryptamine (MiPT), ethylisopropyltryptamine (EiPT), diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT), and dipropyltryptamine (DPT), among others.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United States

PiPT is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States.
