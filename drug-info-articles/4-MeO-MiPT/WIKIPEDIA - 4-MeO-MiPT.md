4-MeO-MiPT, also known as 4-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a lesser-known psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-methoxytryptamine families. It is the 4-methoxy analogue of MiPT and the O-methyl ether of 4-HO-MiPT. The drug is taken orally.
It acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The drug produces psychedelic-like effects in animals.
4-MeO-MiPT was first described by David Repke and Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1985. It was subsequently further described by Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved). The drug was reported as a novel designer drug by 2016. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-MeO-MiPT.

## Use and effects

Shulgin found the effective dose to be 20 to 30 mg (or ~0.4 mg/kg body weight of subject) orally; the onset between ingestion and the first noticeable effects was 20 to 40 minutes, with a listed duration of 4 to 6 hours. The effects were significantly milder than those of 4-HO-MiPT, with 4-MeO-MiPT producing erotic-enhancing effects, and few of the visuals common with tryptamines.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-MeO-MiPT acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) and non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C receptors. Affinities towards receptors outside of the serotonin receptor family have not yet been assessed.
Increased extracellular concentrations of serotonin, resulting from SERT blockade, similarly may compete at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, altering or blunting effects mediated by this receptor, which could potentially explain anecdotal reports of subjective effects being dose-dependently milder than that of 4-HO-MiPT or 5-MeO-MiPT. This profile makes 4-MeO-MiPT a potential candidate for elucidating the role of SERT blockade in the mechanisms underlying serotonergic psychedelic action.
The drug induces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. Its potency for inducing the head-twitch response in mice is similar to that of 4-HO-MiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT, but the efficacy for doing so is markedly lower: 34 head twitches versus around 80 head twitches per 30 minutes for the aforementioned compounds.

## Chemistry

4-MeO-MiPT is synthetic derivative of the substituted tryptamine and 4-methoxytryptamine families. It is the 4-methoxy analogue of N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine (MiPT) and the O-methyl ether of 4-HO-MiPT.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 4-MeO-MiPT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-MeO-MiPT include N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine (MiPT), 4-methoxytryptamine (4-MeO-T), 4-MeO-DiPT, 4-MeO-DMT, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-AcO-MiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DMT, and psilocin (4-HO-DMT), among others.

## History

4-MeO-MiPT was first described in the scientific literature by David Repke and Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1985. Subsequently, it was described in greater detail by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known Loved) as entry #39. The pharmacology of 4-MeO-MiPT was studied and described in the 2020s. It was reported as a novel designer drug by at least 2016.
