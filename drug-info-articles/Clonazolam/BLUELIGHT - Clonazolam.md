Reviews on one site seem promising, but no one is really comparing it to other benzo's. This is a Kpin analog correct? The folks behind it are ones I have good faith in though. Considering an order atm...

What is with the interest in triazolo benzos? They're stupid potent. I'd be really careful with this. 


Curious to hear some reports though. Klonopin was my favorite benzo for anxiety without muddling my thoughts. 


If the triazolo SAR applies though, this guy could be fully active at 250 mics or maybe even less (clonazepam is active at 125 mics in benzo naive people). Interesting times we live in. I'm kind of glad to see the shift away from crappy stims but these ultra potent benzos... I'm not so sure.

You shouldn't be taking benzos all day every day, if that isn't obvious enough. They don't do much in the long term, you just get more anxious because of withdrawals. Take them when you have a panic attack, not as a precaution!

That's debatable as clonazepam maintains its anxiolytic efficacy indefinitely in many people as long as they don't abuse alcohol or other gabaergic drugs. It worked great for me for years until I got too deep into drinking then my tolerance sky rocketed and it pooped out. 


It was much the same thing with Valium. 


Short half life benzos are best for panic attacks but the medium and longer half life are just about useless for that purpose since by the time they actually kick in, the panic attack is already naturally passing. 


But triazolo benzos are the most abusable in my experience, I'd say this one is going to have a whole bunch of addicts if it takes off as an Etizolam replacement (quite likely since deschloro appears to be pretty much inactive and the extreme potency of this drug means the pellet vendors can make an absolute mint). 


IIf this pans out as a recreational clonazepam, it would be the best benzo in existence in my mind as long as it maintains clonazepam's extremely powerful anxiolysis. 


I'll be watching this one closely, seems like something that might be nice to add to the collection.

So would it be correct to assume that,since it is a triazalo class benzo ala alprazolam,that it would pack a harder punch and have a faster come up than clonazapam?As an above poster mentioned,I find clonazapam useless for panic disorder since it takes about 2 hours to even start to do anything and it's slow mechanism of action makes it never really do much,if anything for me.If my assumption about it's triazalo action is correct this could be a good one to watch for.The idea of a benzo that has the effects of alprazolam with the longer duration of something like clonazapam or diazapam seems like an excellent prospect for those with severe panic disorders who need to be on benzos round-the-clock and also require the fast onset and power of alprazolam.This has me intrigued to say the least.Is this a brand new compound or one of the ones developed earlier that just got shelved on the back burner and now they've started researching it again?Anyone out there tried it yet or know of any reports of clinical trials?If they're doing research testing I would galdly volunteer for this one.The idea sounds promising and I would be very much interested in finding out more about this chemical.Sounds like it could be a best of both worlds,dream benzo.Keep the info coming on this one.

Apparently the onset is rather fast. The current price is way too high to really make it a viable alternative to other benzodiazepines/thienodiazepines though. If it's any good the competition will pick it up sooner or later and we'll see much more competitive prices hopefully.

The lab that made flubromazolam will undoubtedly be able to make this stuff cheaply. 


I found a site selling it... I may place a test order. I've got other international mail coming though so I'm going to wait til that clears, always looks weird getting international mail and we have a nosey mail man.

The people who brought out Flubromazolam sell it for less than $XXX/g in bulk, and don't even bother pressing pellets at all ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I highly doubt that they're behind Clonazolam.

Sure, but the $XXX/g mentioned by the poster above is slightly ridiculous. Pretty much all RC benzos are available for $XXX, and that would be single grams. Much cheaper in bulk obviously.


And "behind it" as in "reintroduced to the scene" after it hasn't really been available for..a long time, I guess. Just like diphenidine was first made in 1924, pretty much forgotten and "reintroduced" last year.

From my own benzo XP this would could be easier to taper off of than klonz due to its shorter half life and high potency, hence = less built up in your system over time considering you dose properly for medical issues and not "abuse" it.  I'd like to try it out.

Not everyone has those kinds of connections, especially in the states but this is definitely price discussion which isn't allowed. 


On the addiction front, I never really got the short half life = easier to taper. The withdrawal syndrome is caused by down regulation which is going to be the same whether you are on a short or long life benzo but the drop should be smoother on a short term benzo. I was unable to taper from Klonopin directly but switched to Valium and was able to taper off 2mg worth of Klonopin equivalency over a month and get down to a much more reasonable 1mg equivalent dosage.

Wait, is this the one that's like comparing xanax to klonopin then comparing etizolam to Clonazolam?? If soo, I'd be interested in it...like the short half lives ones for fun, but tolerance builds up quickly and I find the the longer half life ones to help with general anxiety and not panic attacks...don't really have a prolbem with panic attacks just GAD...

Hi all! Anybody have any new experiences to share with this? I got some recently and im yet to try it! Id rather not be sedated as much as possible. How long do the effects last? Its it more functional then recreational?

tried this one last week. took 1mg spread over a couple hours. felt like a more sedating, long lasting pyrazolam which i enjoyed but its difficult to say much else about it due to the nature of the benzo "high". One thing i did notice was a day or 2 after I felt WD's more so than if i had chipped at etiz or pyrazolam.

more sedating? Dayum, id rather have a more functional benzo for anxiety. How long does this take to "kick in" or to feel its effects? When ive had a pyrazolam, they have felt a little etiz like, felt a bit fuzzy headed with it. It's hard to explain their effects isnt it!

I have found it simular in duration but less sedating than its parent. But it's so subjective it's hard to tell and just tried 0.5mg. Also have general benzo tolerance so makes it harder to be objective.


Very little info it seems untill the bigger company's add to to their retail.

Get a script for Tranxene (clorazepate), not only doctors barely know the medication, you can bring it up for that reason...it's not a big mover and no big pharma is even selling it in my country, have no idea who invented it, only have a generic company making it here. It's a prodrug to nordazepam, so a valium without the valium part. ;d

But what else were you doing at the time? If you were doing other drugs and especially drinking, your tolerance sky rockets as you start taking extra to compensate for the anxiety from other substances or from the additional down regulation from the alcohol. 


I switched from 8mg of Xanax a day to 4mg of Klonopin and after the first week of withdrawals from hell I was doing great, then a few years I cut back a milligram without issue but then I got back into the research chemicals and  suddenly it didn't work anymore up to 6mg and I had to cut over to Valium to get any relief that doesn't work anywhere near as well as Klonopin did. Now I'm stuck at home unable to function outside of the house just getting by on 20mg of diazepam a day which is twice what my psychiatrist even prescribes me. I know of people who take the same dose of Klonopin for 10+ years but they don't drink or do any other drugs.

Would love to hear some comparisons to other benzos from people who have tried this. All these new benzos are fucking exciting, Its about time we started getting a cornucopia of designer benzos just like we have with psychedelics. 


Also about benzos becoming ineffective with long term use. That does not hold true for me, I abused benzos heavily for years, then detoxed, stopped abusing them and just got a prescription, Ive been on .5mg 2x a day for 2 years now and I still get high every time I take it. I just rarely abuse it, with benzos a little abuse will rob me of the therapeutic effects quite quickly. And when I do abuse it I must take a tiny amount or none at all for 2-3 days before I can use my prescribed dose and get therapeutic effects.

That's probably the only angle one can look at benzos that make them less addictive than opiates, a couple days "binging" on benzos won't bring you withdrawals, lol. I'm surprised no one called you on that, this is a HR forum afterall (which means erroneous hypothesis should be called on, it's nothing personal).

Prettty sure. 


Before I became a daily user of benzos in 2007, I was scripted seconal for extreme anxiety before high school exams to take at night, which is a barbiturate. I was only given 14 a year from 1998 to 2004 by my doc. I would sometimes abuse it (with seconal abuse is not much more doses than 2). Then when in 2004 Health Canada removed all barbs except for butalbital and phenobarbital, I was given 20 Placidyls for a whole year, worked wonderfully to kill bad trips and also my anxiety before big life-defining exams in college. Then in 2006 Canada removed Placidyl. So I was scripted Mogadon and Restoril (Nitrazepam 10mg prn or Temazepam 30mg 1 or 2 gelcaps prn) for insomnia crisis like I'm known to have. I would only get 30 a year of each, my doc was old and old school as you can see, when he retired is when problems started. Had a sleep study done where I slept at the hospital which is bullshit, a good sleep study would have me sleeping at home with the EEG (which some countries do, I think they can do it in Canada but are too lame to do so often (costly)). And I was sent to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with GAD and a panic attack disorder. So there came Clonazepam, and the bastard gave me 2x 1mg right off the bat. I'm going on record here and I'm gonna say, do not misrepresent clonazepam, it is still really powerful and when i was on it 24/7, it's longevity and potential, even if it takes a while to kick in, is really not ideal, also sleeping on clonazepam sucks, would always wake up with a slight headache. Nothing my eventual taper on Valium (which I'm still on, couldn't kick it completely, but 20mg of Valium is a lot less benzo stimulation than 3.5mg of clonazepam a day (what I eventually needed). I even started my own taper with the doc, but on my own terms, that we'd use as close as possible the Ashton method....


But yeah, anyway as you can see, I only got trouble when I was on 3.5mg a day of clonazepam, if my mistake I would take more (I would never ever lose it like so many people do with benzos+alcohol, hell I was able to play Victoria II (a grand strategy game, and do well at it while I was taking my 3.5mg of clonazepam and 12 pack of beer a day, which I did for a whole year). I ended up stopping the daily drinking by itself, which wasn't a problem since I already had benzos, and then later went and told the psydoc "I want to taper away".


I'm telling you my story in detail because, i want to show you a true example of hell. I think you're like me, an anxious person and think of scenarios because physical wd of benzos do not happen when you take them irregularly because you don't develop a physical tolerance. When I would miss more than a day of 3.5mg of clonazepam I would get stomach spasms ffs. Now, like until next tuesday, I'm out of valium cos I had some 4-aco-det and the feels I had after the trip were bad so I had about 55-60mg of valium and and the next day 30-35 instead of my normal 10mg twice a day dose. But with this dose of benzo in me, it's a lot easier to go without it for a while, I actually get trouble 6-7 days in where all the valium metabolites are gone then I guess I start feeling bad, but its nowhere the affliction I had when I was served my clonazepam once a week because a fuckin ER doctor renewed my script this way for a long time and I hadn't been to my psydoc in a long while, every monday morning I was there, all night up feeling like hell, with absolutely nothing to take me down and even if it did, clonazepam is used in neurology a lot, for seizures, in some countries in fact it's only used for seizures, up to 20mg a day. The blowback from not having that hefty dose of clonazepam for more than 36 hours was horrendous, despite the long half-life of clonazepam...it varies a lot, I think it's 30-105, and of course discussing that with my psydoc, he would claim the highest end of the bracket as the real half-life 8) I felt like I could die from status epilepticus at any moment (fall into unending seizures and die).


You got nothing to worry about.

Fair enough I can believe you went through hell with WD (been there myself) and im not saying you are wrong im just saying that when i use benzos again for a few days then stop, il get the shakes, bad anxiety and dont sleep very well. Not full blown risks of seizures but still very real symptoms which i never got before i was addicted to benzos!

Well, I am trying this right now. I normally use 20mg of valium a day, had a 10mg pill earlier but won't take more, have hidden the rest so I don't take them if this thing knocks one out like triazolam over a longer period. I'll try to be as specific as one can be. So this is really a triazolo version of clonazepam? I'm having 1mg. A couple of these small yellow barrels ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


e: 20 minutes after taking the 2 doses, I realize one could have been enough, heh, I'm doing fine though, just have incredible difficulty typing. There's very little muscle relaxation which is kinda a disappointment but not too bad. It's a lot like triazolam'd clonazepam so far or maybe I'm not hitting the peak yet, which is supposed to be 1h in. We'll see.

Clonazolam seems like a winner, had 1mg at 3pm, 1mg at 5pm, and 0.5mg after supper(please remember I had only 10mg of valium and no xanax today, as well as no bupe, picking up my bupe and xanax script tomorrow. Had 2 grapefruits for dessert, which had my co-renter raise an eyebrow, told him, triazolo benzos all seem to be made much more powerful with grapefruit or juice. If it works like Xanax I won't be redosing in a LONG (relative to me) time.


Grapefruit worked on Triazolam and worked a HELL LOT with Xanax, still makes eating a grapefruit 20 minutes before taking 0.5mg xan would make it last all day, but I remember my frustrations back then, when I was scripted a large dose daily of clonazepam (3.5mg) and how grapefruit changed nothing when it came to clonazepam....May the science continue!


Any Shulgin-like figure for novel benzodiazepines, please PM me, lol, jk, but that would be wonderful hah. But really if I could get canada to approve Midazolam in pill form or simply Loprazolam, I would feel I did my part in throwing a monkey wrench into the gears of the machine. On a totally different front than most see it, but still very real.

They tend to pre-dosed, unlike the phenazepam disaster. Never had a single surprise. Except this time, there is very little info out ther about Clonazolam. Hasn't stopped me. It turned a "for-sure-shit-day-unless-I-get-a-package-I'm-waiting-for-since 12 business days" and damn, it finally made it here today. There is a respected vendor selling powder flubromazolam, who normally sells it as blotter to people who he's been doing business with since a long while.


Speaking of flubromazolam, the 50x1.25mg tabs I should have gotten last monday have advanced in their "processing", the pointer on the bar is now at 1/2 instead of 1/4. Package log still says it's "kept for further processing" which I imagine is verifying if illegal drugs are in there...wouldn't be surprised a pill has spots from reagent tests done by customs and their special crews. I'll keep the buying of things outside the country on the DL after that, for a while, I got enough clonazolam to make me ignore my valium script for a long time :D

Christmas came fast and early (in four days!!!) Just got my 1-g powder and am about to check it out - allergy type test first, solubility check in EtOH 95% (everclear, I'm not an idiot...), if so then PG should be good too. I kind of prefer ethanol solutions b/c they tend to dissolve faster and are - for me - easier to  dose using an insulin rig, allows me to dose at very fine increments. No I don't shoot this stuff, just like using the syringe to pull up the solution so I can dose at 0.1-mg increments from a 1.0-mg/mL solution. I simply, slowly squirt it into my mouth (under tongue burns like fuck, so not there) and then chase it with a beer. "A" beer as in one (1), more and I get too fucked and it ruins the experience. The advantage to PG solutions imo, is the ability to hold it under your tongue. For etiz I like that for very fast relief of panic. I panic a lot. Always have, since age 2.


I wonder if this will have the minty flavor of K-pins and Flubromazepam? A 2-mg K-pin under the tongue is almost numbingly minty. I love that, whereas seems the azolams taste like shit, I know flubromazolam does as well as good 'ol alprazolam, whereas flubromazepam tastes minty, not so much as K-pins but close.


I'm scripted K-pins but only took 1 of my normal 3 today (or I'd seize at some point), and kept my Etiz at 4-mg (both taken 8 hours ago...) so I should be pretty baseline for me, in a few hours - when testing will begin. But still, my experience will be different than those who don't consume daily (smart thing people - being dependent on benzos sucks ass, this whole RC thing is just a big party for me, it'll have to end someday. Thank god I have the gear to do that properly (I figured tapering will take one year), I have more than enough and every bit of it is legal to hold! That's the killer part, as long as customs doesn't fuck with it you're totally cool - w/ research powder. Fuck pressed shit anyway, to costly and it get's seized regularly. Though I like a blister pack of well known name branded or generic pills from a good source to compare to the powder solutions.


Could not believe the delivery time frame. From overseas to midwest in four days! Four days since order placed. Amazing. 


Be well. Be smart - **do not drive when you've had benzos** - you often don't realize how fucked up you might be. If your fucking with benzos like many on here are, best to not drive on days after you go big - esp., early the next day. If you're walking into walls don't get behind the wheel. Cheers and happy holidays.

Okay here's how it is for me : Very reminiscent of clonazepam, so the only dosage available of 0.5mg is for caution only, I found myself eating 2mg of this, with only 10mg early in e![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)OF VALIUM, of my own script, phew, I had to correct that, wouldn't take 10mg of clonazolam hah) the morning yesterday (was keeping to my normal schedule, didn't expect to get my package finally, and the mail man we got lately goes around my area at about 2pm, at the complete end of his run.


Anyway, this hits fast and hard, but not hard as in Lorazepam or Temazepam's sudden boom, your muscles are jello and your memory goes to crap instantly. It's a lot like clonazepam as in, i won't be going to bed with this one, I get into my hobbies again and stop worrying about things I can't control, no matter how ugly some things I know are...


6 hours into it I've had 2mg of Xanax, a couple of 1mg pills, and I ate a whole grapefruit 20 mins before. Xanax reacts really strongly to grapefruit/gfj in my case, in fact it's the only benzo, no wait, I've seen Nitrazepam have that warning too, but I only ever got one of the kings of Rx benzos a couple times, 15 10mg tablets I would keep for night-before anxiety and insomnia related to exams the next day, and unlike temazepam, nitraz would continue in the day, not giving me sleepiness but a kind of serenity where concentrating was easy.


Anyways. For benzo naive/people who buy benzos like this to make rough trips get easier/relax sometimes with a beer or two and not daily users like me, otherwise my brain is filled with thoughts about what bad things can happen, could happen, might not happen when not on benzos...channelling Walter White here I know, but I'd personally prefer 2mg of these gelcaps. It doesn't last for a long time like flubromazolam, which I didn't have the chance to try yet...and not sure I ever will, after about 6 hours the effects are gone to me. But make no mistake this is a good benzo. As good as the flutoprazepam a Japanese friend of mine sent me in the mail back years ago, they mostly use benzos no one else use in Japan and that one was far from a fluke, like clonazolam, good stuff overall. Only downside is that it has none of the sedation and muscle relaxation of Valium, which I am scripted, I'd never give up my valium prescription, I almost did for 6mgx3 bromazepam a day instead of 2 10mg valium a day and I'm glad I kept the valium. Muscle relaxation is one of my favourite effects of benzos, followed by anxiolysis then sedation. Come to think of it, this clonazolam seems as powerful an anxiolytic as bromazepam, which is something. Probably why I enjoy flubromazepam so much.


I give it an 8.5/10 (daily doser rating)

Just hope its not a case like with etizolam & deschloro-etizolam where they took a perfectly good drug and ruined it, at least IMO as I got no effects nor did my friends from the 1/4g deschloro-etizolam we had. Expecting a longer lasting etizolam is a what one would most likely expect but instead it was devoid of any noticeable effects that would qualify it as a benzo and had it high doses upwards to 20mg-30mg, could be the source but I can't post sources here. 


The molecular chemical structure model of deschloro-etizolam vs etizolam has also been compared with the molecular features of triazolam (etizolam) vs alprazolam (deschloro-etizolam).

Hah, never fear. This stuff is the real deal, not "Etizolam-2" or w/e this ultra weak deschloro-etizolam was. A site pushing it a lot removed it and are now offering Nifoxipam. Another to add to the shopping list ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

It hits hard and fast, and is pretty damn sedating. Should be getting more in the coming days. My tolerance is rather high. But ala Flubromazolam, they feel kinda similar, yet this hits much harder and faster.

Hey there man, be cautious, unless you have some rx script regularly, you could be in hell when the fun ends ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Honestly, these things are pretty darn good. I've been prescribed - triazolam, alprazolam, clonazepam, temazepam, lorazepam and diazepam throughout my "run" Also was big into etizolam but it never really did it for me. This stuff does. 


I also have a massive tolerance, so I usually eat a lot. I'm not sure how many I took yesterday, but it was an awesome day. I didn't even do much, but it just felt good to be alive...I can see this becoming a problem. But, it did feel good to enjoy life...and as I type this, it still does. Of course I had a bunch around my room like I always do with all my benzodiazepines. 


Take care.

Can someone compare it to Diazepam ( my favorite benzo) in terms of potency, duration and effect. I am not sure if its worth it, cause i can get every benzo i want for the price of the script, which is a maximum of 20€ usually. I thinking of buying midazolam oral solution (2mg/ml) which is even injectable or this, to get something different from the usual meals...

difficult to tell, given i take other Rx (one being a very long acting) benzo's... 

but given i took mostly 4 or 6x0.5mg's in stead of taking 1.5mg xanax or 30mg valium, the stuff seemed ok, kept anxiety at bay, did feel anxiety relief after having ingested too many stims, it definately did the job (4mg's clonazolam that time...) but packs no punch like xanax and none of the euphoric relaxation like valium.

Yea, it def doesn't pacc a "punch" but I find it way more sedating than most benzos. It's also euphoric to me and my two friends who each tried .5 You can. Easily sleep 12 hours. I took my last one like 16 hours ago and I still kinda feel it.

Research show that is about the potency of triazolam, 0.25mg/0.5mg = 10mg diazepam, but of course equivalency charts are just good when it comes to switch to diazepam so the patient doesn't get sick, but that's a good idea. 2mg of it is like triazolam on a long haul.


Etnies, grapefruit juice works awesome with xanax thats for sure, makes 0.5mg last all day for me. And it sure did work well with triazolam, especially since triazolam has a miserable 52% oral BA, I bet it increased it to 90%+ because I remember the only time a friend of mine gave me a dozen 0.25mg green brand name Halcions, eating grapefruit for breakfast would push back the day so that I would have breakfast later again ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Only to do when you have nothing to do in a particular day though.

I currently take 3mg kpin and 2mg xanax a day and have been for about 8 years. What would you guys recommend as a starter dose? 2mg is what I was considering. Thanks for any advice. I'm well seasoned with benzos, but this will be the first time researching this one.

I got a pill with **UPJOHN 666 **text, It was clonazolam. I was too tired and fall asleep in 2 minutes. So, now I'm waiting for the bulk.

I was on xanax on and of for 3 years. Ive never got a buzz from it that everyone gets except the very first time i took it. The last two yrs a diff dr. put me on the klonopin he said it has potentially for abuse. xanax is meant to come on fast for right now. klonopin is slowing released over 8 hrs

and ill sometimes take half or skip one of my doses and im fine. now if i had to got like 2 three days its be diff.but i still think not as bad as xanax

I'd say flubromazolam /may/ be a bit more potent than Clonazolam. Just going off the experiences I've had with both. Imo Clonazolam > Flubromazolam in general.

Klonopins=Fire! My favorite benzo. Comes on slow but stays with you all day long and it's a lot smoother than Xanax it seems. Though I wouldn't (and haven't ever) turn a Xanax down either! I also seem to have less negative side effects on klonopin like no black outs, aggression, crying jags, out of character behaviors etc.

This has probably been stated many times but could someone draw me a comparison between Clonazepam and clonazolam? I'm a big fan of Clonazepam which i felt was clear headed anxiolytic while also being quite recreational.

Clonazolam is much more hypnotic and a "punch in the face" drug than Clonazepam. If I'm going out to do anything that requires me to be active (not asleep) I'd pick Clonazepam. If I just wanted to sit around and watch some TV/film, play a game, ect I'd pick Clonazolam.

I'd say clonazolam is more euphoric and overall a better high than clonazepam. I took 6 mg's on friday and blacked out about 4 hours into it. I also ended up doing 6mg of alprazolam on top of that like 7 hours later.

Test compound:  Clonazolam (Clonitrazolam)

Test subject: Male, 190lbs, undislosed age

Tolerance: Clonazepam 3mg daily & Alprazolam 2mg daily


This trip report will be done with nothing else in my system. I want to know exactly how I react to this compound.


00:00 I decided to start at .5mg and move up as needed even though I have a strong benzo tolerance. I have the small yellow gelcaps.


00:15 Feeling a bit hungry and feel, feeling good, took another .5mg


00:45 In a very good mood. Nice and relaxed


01:15 Starting to feel the euphoria others spoke of.


I can already tell I like this compound and want more. Has anyone gotten the powder yet and made a solution? If so how? It would be so much cheaper. I'm still pleased with these capss go.


I'll add more to this report as my day goes on. I have nothing on my plate but more Clonazolam

Have had both, and I enjoyed Clonazolam much more than Flubromazolam. But I will say Flubromazolam is a bit odd, I can't really put it into words, but it's just... much different than any other benzodiazepine/depressant/thienodiazepine/ect. I'd say no, but your experience might be different.

I wish I could say. The only package I ever had stole by customs was a flubromazolam 1.25mg pellets package. That I paid in GBP for and I'm Canadian, that's quite the assrape. I'm not about to pay anything in GBP again, considering the loonie has dropped to lows not seen in more than a decade (0,74 US = 1 CAD right now...that's crazy, last month it was 0,89 and that was kinda low, I gotta rent my damn server in US dollars...)But that's all unrelated to the current discussion sorry, I'm just still mad at my stolen package. I've had opiates sent to me from overseas by friends/UK pharmacies that sold their OTC DHC(that we don't have in Canada at all, which is probably very illegal) and Gee's Linctus with that 30mg of morphine per bottle in the past ( a while ago, but I'm sure it could be done easily still). I lost a week's food on the table in money, totally randomly ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Does anyone know what the tolerance build-up is like with this? It sounds perfect, but then again so did flubromazolam until I realised it became completely ineffective after only a few days use.

I'd say it raises around the same rate as Etizolam or Diclazepam(Maybe slightly faster), granted I don't have /much/ experience with Clonazolam yet, but it's nowhere near as bad as Flubromazolam; In my experience.

Thanks for the reply. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. I'll definitely be placing an order tomorrow. I'm excited to try these. 


If tolerance is 'normal' for a benzo, then they may have done it.. created the perfect stim/trip killer. 


Etizolam is good but doesn't knock me out long enough to sleep through the comedown and feel refreshed upon waking. 


Flubromazepam is amazing but takes way too long to hit, especially for a bad trip scenario. 


Flubromazolam seemed perfect, but then turned out to be the worst compound for tolerance increase, like, ever. 


I hold high hopes for these ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Seemed fine at 5mg/ml with PG. Could probably knock that up to 10mg/ml, and possibly farther with a bit of messing around with it. 


Only difference between oral and subL seem to be quicker onset and slightly more pronounced effects. Nothing special about it.

It works around the clock I find. Not as obvious as taking what would be an effective dose of diazepam/bromazepam/nitrazepam/whatever strong long lasting very anxiolytic Rx benzo everyday though. It feels a lot like triazolam XR, if they ever had the idea of making it. That's why I stopped taking it everyday and just add some over my script when something upsets me very bad enough to start the panic attacks I'm almost totally rid of (the benzos really helped me put the finger on the things that start em, a big problem is that most are things I have no control over. Then I crank up Bad Religion's No Control and try to kind of let go. But yeah, the GAD remains, I used to have social anxiety back when I was a teen and in my early 20's...I'm glad I beat that without medication (well, I think the LSDXM trips I did helped me get rid of that, for a while, psychs will show you the way and the afterglows will make it very easy, but it's so very easy to fall back into the daily grind because of well, let's face it, the world is depressing, even if the so-called climate change stuff seems to be a joke (according to what I was taught back in my first science classes, we should be about to boil out since 5 years...). All eco-political ramblings aside, just be careful, this stuff is basically like Triazolam+, Triazolam was removed from all canadian provinces except one in late 2013, because of how addictive it is and how people claim not to feel it even when they have a good dose in them, very soon after the original dose.

I'm not about to pay anything in GBP again, considering the loonie has dropped to lows not seen in more than a decade (0,74 CAD = 1 US right now...that's crazy, last month it was 0,89 and that was kinda low, I gotta rent my damn server in US dollars...)But that's all unrelated to the current discussion sorry, I'm just still mad at my stolen package.

Hello! Thought I'd do a trip report on this compound. Tis my first one so apologies if it's not up to standard. 


I'm Male, 30 years old, 5'11 and weigh roughly 190lbs. Regarding similar substance experience I have tried Diazepam 10mg a couple of times, but have mainly indulged with the RC Benzos. Diclazepam and Flubromazepam were both a disaster, leading to me being hammered for weeks on end. Etizolam has been my favorite so far and one I'd say I take fairly frequently (twice a week). I usually take 2mg of the pink blister pack types when I do, but yesterday only had 0.5mg. 


Thought I'd mention this as I'm assuming I have a slight tolerance due to my semi regular use. I'm also on Conserta (54mg) every day which will also have an impact.


(15:00) Ingest 1 x 0.5 Clonazolam capsule. Going to make some food and find something to watch

(15:30) Slight relaxation

(15:40) Feels like time is slowing down. Skin on my hands feels soft which I often take as a sign that benzo's are working. 

(16:00) ooh it's very nice this. Feel very relaxed. Typing is becoming difficult and my brain is coming up with some weird ideas, none of which need repeating here.

(16:10) Have urge to clean my house and DJ. Will be good to test how functional these things are.

(16:30) That didn't go well at all, couch is too comfy so didn't even make a start. Will try again now.

(17:07) Kitchen is clean(ish) and living room is looking a lot better. Short term memory seems to be lacking but nothing too much to worry about. On a scale I'd say it's not as bad as cannabis. However, with higher doses I imagine you'd start to think you were living in Memento or something...

(17:36) Still very relaxed. Maybe slight euphoria.

(18:00) Seems like the effects have hit a plateau. Still feel very nice but I might try 1mg next time. Will just ride this one out for today.

(18:45) Effects are still working and I feel like I can function perfectly well.

(20:00) Feeling quite tired now, nothing that will send me under, but I think if I lay down I'd probably fall asleep. Gonna have some food and see how I feel.

(21:00) Feel comfortable, happy and relaxed. So far this feels on a par with Etizolam but is seemingly lasting longer. I don't feel like my memory has taken a beating, but then again I never do on these things so I suppose I'll find out more tomorrow. It doesn't feel quite as euphoric as Etizolam, but I believe this might be rectified by taking a 1mg dose next time. 

(21:10) I'm going to eat more food and watch more things. 

(00:26) Going to head to bed now and I reckon sleep will welcome me fairly swiftly. Still feel very nice indeed.


(09:00) Woke up feeling fine. No withdrawal / comedown / anxious feeling but I suppose that might come later. No sense of memory loss either! Had fairly vivid dreams but I'm not sure if that was due to the Clonazolam. Will update this report if I think anything needs adding but overall I was very impressed with this benzo.

Thanks for the comprehension. I'm in the process of getting rid of suboxone (now at only 2mg a day), so I need benzos to even out. I've tried to go benzo free from my supposedly low dose rx of 20mg valium a day + the prn 1mg of xanax (I get 15 a month), I lasted 9 days until I sort of started getting used to it, but not sleeping was giving me the worst headaches and I'm prone to migraines due to a jaw condition (which both opis and benzos help). The clonazolam provider is very safe even if overseas strangely, I told other vendors that their big packages with declarations on them might not be the best idea for pellet products, pellets seem to indicate human consumption a bit too much, so this guy's regular mail only policy seems to make sense.


Got myself 125mg of etizolam powder domestically from a very trusted vendor inside Canada this month, won't get fooled again, even if the vendor that sent me the confiscated (at the canadian border) flubromazolam (which I don't understand why they never released it, it's not like it's something illegal) is offering me to double any order from them next time...Well, sure, next time, bank transfer costs 35 dollars when overseas so that'll have to wait for a while. Benzo withdrawal is totally the worst and I'm gonna do with great and not-so-great (etizolam) material so I can get rid of suboxone, that is for sure, and yeah I'm one of the rare people who never was crazy about etizolam, those comparing it to xanax or rivotril(clonaz) or bromaz confuse the hell out of me. It's ok, way too short lived, only really awesome after a stim binge, once I just put my tongue inside my etizolam baggie (do not try at home without a tolerance) after a dexedrine binge + circumstances that made me feel like SHIT, and suddenly I was euphorically going to bed. 


Then when the suboxone is gone, I'll do the taper of the diazepam, 1mg at a time, every 2-3 weeks, I don't see any other way. I actually got the weirdest of the symptoms I read about for benzo withdrawal during those 9 days where I forced myself to take nothing, upper respiratory tract infection! I could feel my sinus, throat and tongue hurting, that was very weird, especially since I stopped smoking 5 months ago now (that one gave me the will to stop suboxone and the rest later, I'm sick of being enslaved to chemicals, no matter how useful they may be!

It was fine, no problem here, although there's a trip report subforum, it's not sacrilege to do so here. All I have to say is, if you keep it to dosing 3 times a week max, you won't get too much danger of rebound anxiety. It's easy to develop an habit when used to kill stims and you're doing lots of stims (especially when both benzos and stims are scripted). Or if you like to drink and like to make it not cost you too much...not recommended, but you see what I'm saying hopefully. I wouldn't wish a benz addiction on my worst enemy!

So hope does this compare to regular kpin? From the tr that fellow wrote it sounds very similar. I have been taking two 2mg kpinz everyday for over 2 or 3 years now and have had no problems with sky high tolerances or anything. It lasts much longer than any benzo I can get prescribed or R.C. Very good benzo never even had a withdraw but that is my experience. I would love to see how this compares to regular klonopin, some on other forums are saying that it is 4x strong than klonopin does any one else believe this. I would like to get a couple grams as benzodiazepines are getting harder to get prescribed or on the street. Any feedback would be much appreciated. Thank you

Never had Klonopin so cannot comment on that. Was just curious with you saying that there doesnt seem to be a withdrawal from them? If you have been on them for years now how can you be sure or have you taken breaks inbetween?

Kicks in WAY faster than clonazepam. Like Triazolam quick. Has a clonazepam/bromazepam feel but really that's just vague comparisons, I just say Triazolam XR ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Ugh, wait until the lucky day you acquire Midazolam or Loprazolam (not lorazepam) pills from Europe.

0.5 was unbelievably functional. Went about my business feeling good all day. This stuff seems a bit too good to be true. Might have to leave it be for a few days as I don't want to ruin it for myself.

Wise words here. But I can't be too harsh with guys like Etnies having a blast, I was once like this, now I just hope never to be in benz wd most of anything. But yes clonazolam is very functional. I spent 3 days at my dad's during xmas times and endured him no problem! lol. I got him to get into Breaking Bad so we watched that with my brother and it helped me find something worthwhile to do at his home before leaving instead of panicking.

10mg/ml in PG went swimmingly. So 10mg/ml is rather easily possible for anyone that has powder, I'd recommend lower, but just saying that 10mg/ml is quite within the range of this. Didn't think it'd be worth it to go any higher. I'd say sticking with 5mg/ml or even 2.5mg/ml would be best with this chemical. Stay safe and or sane everyone.


EDIT: I'm an idiot. I used an ethanol solution, not a PG solution.

Clonazolam is now becoming more widely available on the UK scene thankfully, and it remains the only RC benzo I haven't tried just yet. That will obviously change very soon, and in about a week or so I should have received my first package. Reading this thread has given me high hopes for this one, great to hear that it hits fast and is very sedating. That's exactly what I'm looking for. 


Recently I've been experimenting with Flubromazolam and Nifoxipam, and between those two I'd say Nifoxipam (at the right doses) is better for euphoric recreational purposes, while Flubromazolam is better for a faster acting knockout solution. From what I can gather from other people's thoughts on Clonazolam, it sounds like it just might be the right kind of mix that I've been looking for. Guess I'll find out in about a week or so. Can't wait!

This taste rather putrid in solution. Kinda a mix between Diclazepam's numbness and Alprazolam's aftertaste, yet it seems to linger a fair bit longer.

Yes I have have had breaks in between not very long ones though, but longer than 4 or 5 days. The half life of clonopin is pretty good and I think that like 90% of it is excreted in your urine within 24 hours. This of course is my experience and I am not saying it is not addictive because it is if abused heavily or even moderately all mermaids are.

Also I have never had triazolam you are saying it us lil that but like the extended release version. Has any one who has had clonopin before and also had a chance  to try clonazolam ? If so are the differences too insignificant to tell a significant difference?

No, there is a /major/ gap between Clonazepam and Clonazolam. Much more sedation, much quicker onset, longer lasting (imo). It is pretty much what I'd except from "Triazolam-XR" to be honest haha.

Fur those that take k-kpin (3-milligram as is my casen & is prescribed, do you take your clonazolam the days you take the RC? I want to get tho most out of this, amazing RC, also how long a, break b/w days of use do you guys find effective- obviously a year would ideal. I'm thinking more of 5 days to a week.


This is serious stuff, long half life, mixed with birth Flubros, had to see doctor 8:30 twodays later, At 36 hours. If you do get up to go somewhere check your balance and speech.. I had a physicians appt last week two days after that binge and she wanted to call a neurologist I slurred my speech so much and looked so fucked up. I felt fine, not even tired.


Your often cannot judge your own intoxication, until you drive across the center line esp., the next day , so have a friend  listen to you talk (I live alone) and be very careful driving. Already been in one accident the day after clonazolam intake, granted it was,a lot.

This is he first benzo that's had any real affect on me since I tapered of etizolam two years ago. I was starting to think that I had a permanent, or at least very long term tolerance resulting from my two year etizolam habit, as the last few benzo's I've tried have had no effect at all. This stuff completely knocked my on my arse. Even .5 mg was enough to feel, and a further 1 mg made it difficult to walk with out holding on to walls. It was like like the first time I took etizolam. Oh boy, I'm not sure if this is going to be good for me at all.


EDIT: By the way, when I say etizolam habit, I mean I was taking it everyday for two years (stupid, stupid, I know) but I always stuck to two milligrams per day - even when it stopped having an affect I was too afraid of withdrawal to increase the dose. I don't deserve praise for this - it was out of fear, not willpower. So absolutely I was addicted and I'm not proud of it, but at least I had an easy three week diazapam taper (supervised by my doc). Having been through that, I shouldn't be messing with benzos again. Yet here I am :/

Clonazepam is not a drug for treating anxiety and its licence in the UK does not include its use in the treatment of anxiety disorders. I prescribe it, rarely and sparingly, for epilepsy and certain idiopathic non-convulsive epileptiform disorders and epilepticus states of those disorders. There are some off licence conditions I can prescribe it for but only in small doses. Also, tolerance to etizolam is less burdensome than most benzos. Clonazolam with its sub-milligram action is an accident waiting to happen.

@pjd555 I must admit some of that is over my head, but I'd be interested to hear you elaborate on the statement that etizolam tolerance is 'less burdensome' - by this do you mean tolerance builds slower than with most other benzos? Or that despite tolerance it remains an effective clinical treatment? I'm only asking out of idle curiosity.

Interesting that it's not prescribed for anxiety. I know Clonazolam is a different substance but I've found that 1 x 0.5 capsule has eliminated all anxiety with myself throughout the entire day.


I am concerned with my daily use but I have found it so useful it's difficult finding reasons not to stop, apart from the risk of some savage future withdrawal or shocking levels of tolerance developing.

I too experienced anti-anxiety effects from this compound, but I did find that the muscle relaxant and hypnotic effects were more dominant. However, I did take three times as much as you so it's not a fair comparison.

The problem with clonazepam is not that it isn't effective as an anti-anxiety medication but that it has one of the worst addiction ramp times of the benzo groups. Most anxiety disorders are a symptomatic expression of an underlying condition or a perfectly normal situational response. In the 21st century anything but short term use of benzodiazepines to provide symptomatic relief for anxiety is almost impossible to justify. If a man has a broken leg morphine will provide symptomatic relief for the pain but no matter how much is administered, in the absence of other treatment, he will still have a broken leg. The same applies to most types of anxiety disorder and current guidance is that benzodiazepines should not be prescribed for generalised anxiety disorder. They do nothing  to treat the cause of the anxiety. If the profile of clonazolam is even close to clonazepam talk of solutions with x mg per ml is going to create a lot of addicts very quickly.


As for etizolam it does appear to have a tolerance profile which is different to benzodiazepines in that q tolerance ceiling appears which is sometimes followed by a drop in tolerance which with further use can lead to another higher tolerance ceiling and so on. People get addicted less quickly but that pattern has dangers which are not acceptable and, in any event, it seems to be a pretty pointless drug because of its very wide receptor action. It's a very blunt instrument and I can see why most countries don't see why it should be considered for inclusion in prescription formularies when there are plenty of other drugs available with narrower activity and a more well understood chemistry.

It is such in some countries, but in most countries clonazepam is used for anxiety. Hell, it is only used for anxiety here (seen way more people with scripts for anxiety or insomnia than seizure medication, I don't know anybody who has a neurological problem, only I did, which I explain later), I know it is used in neurology, but clonazepam is indeed used for GAD due to its long half life. Stop talking out of your ass. Maybe only Scandinavian countries use it only as a seizure medication (I know for sure it is the case, yet they have yummy ketobemidone pills).


Clonazolam, sold in the way it is, as 0.5mg gelcaps is NOT an accident waiting to happen. You'd need to eat a good handful of these to...end up sleeping a lot? This isn't phenazepam kemosabe. Is clonazepam with its submilligram action am accident waiting to happen,?, rhetorical question, of course MANY people who are scripted it have done dumb things because of it, mostly at the beginning of treatment or if used for fun one night only (and what about those 0.5mg and 0.25mg doses?, the 0.5mg orange ones being the most often scripted for anxiety of the bunch, 0.5mg bid in fact).


I doubt you are a doctor, anywhere, if you do not know clonazepam is indicated for anxiety disorders ALSO.


And I say that as somebody who was scripted clonazepam in the ER for a month with a referral to a neurologist because of what was a case of HPPD (also an indication for Clonazepam). When I told the neurologist it also took care of my anxiety issues, he said, well psychiatrists use this too, so you're only going to use one med for 2 problems, the less meds the better. And I left with a script of 0.5mg three times a day


As for your declaration that clonazolam is the most powerful benzo you've ever tried....i'd trade all the clonazolam 0.5mg gelcaps I have (about 30 left) for 10 temazepam 30mg. I mean jesus, this is close to the holy grail but isn't.


Clonazepam, and later Diazepam when I tapered away my ramping up dose (you are right, there, it's not as bad as xanax in that aspect though...), have helped me put the brakes on my  overactive imagination and constant thinking of all possibilities at once. It gave me a pause, a long needed pause in my life, and yes, my psydoc and neurologist are alright with me being on benzos (now a low dose of 20mg of valium a day). I've discovered a lot of ways to calm myself down naturally, having my brain stop running away in a vicious circle of anxiety causing anxiety causing anxiety that spirals out of control, I was one of those rare cases where benzo use for long term was needed. I've seen the most respected doctors say that there was nothing wrong with someone being on a low dose of benzodiazepines for life, if some people are to be on SSRI's/SNRI's or atypical antipsychotics for life. I've identified and eliminated thanks to clonazepam and diazepam my social anxiety fears, which I've worked with on my own, through thinking, reading. I don't need a paid for whore of a friend called a stinkin' psychologist, that is for sure. 


Now I still need benzos because of things that I know, that deeply disturb me, and that I cannot do anything about. Things I can't do anything about that terrorize me. So, yeah, your judgment of others' scriptage and doctors is very unwelcome to read here. I bet you don't believe anybody can be a case like me where benzos are needed round the clock. Since my psychiatrist knows the dosage I am at is mostly fine with me, and that my memory is much better than when he tapered me away from the 3.5mg of clonazepam I was at daily to the 20mg of valium (a drop of 66% in benzodiazepine gaba subcomplex stimulation), my life has turned for the better. But I needed to get to those 3.5mg of clonazepam a day, one 2mg as I woke up, and 3/4 of a 2mg at bed time. I was in a life situation that was so shitty it was the only thing preventing me from comitting suicide. It didn't last long either, but I'm glad you're a neurologist and not a psychiatrist. By the way, the official Rivotril instructions say it can be used up to 20mg a day for seizure disorders. That's right, keep the clonazepam low, pump 'em full of depakote or bullshit of that kind.

I am not against the use of benzodiazepine drugs in specific instances. To say that clonazepam is only used for anxiety in Canada is a shrinking truth. At its peak 95% of prescriptions were off-label.  Current guidelines simply include it in the list of benzodiazepines suitable for use as adjunctive therapy in the early phase of treatment. Guidelines in Canada state that benzos should be used at regularly dosed intervals for a short period of time and not used on an as needed basis. Roche do not market Rivotril as an anxiolytic and, as in many countries, its use as such is in decline.

I would like to point out that I have never made that statement and have never used clonazolam.

Americans love their K-Pins too much and it's really even more of a truth that it is almost exclusively used for anxiety or insomnia in that country.


Also, "Adjunct to treatment in the early phase", to what, the poisons called SSRI's and SNRI's with their manic induction, suicidal ideation, worsening of the situation side effects? I'd rather not have it ever and keep my feelings, too, the normal ones, when not anxious.


This female friend of mine, she's on Cymbalta, 90mg too, experimental dosages everywhere! And of course, her doctor didn't script her a goddamn TCA that probably works just the same, but nah, her Cymbalta pencil and prescription pad with prepared scripts where only a name needs to be added did the job for her, of course. And maybe it has to do with the fact that Cymbalta is the ONLY antidepressant in Canada that's still under patent, gotta make some money and not help cure, yeahhhh! Experimental dosages too, 60mg my ass, lets give her more, it's gonna bring in more cash, 200+ dollars a month for a fucking script is abnormal here, is what I can say. Even if her job pays back 80% to her later, she gotta pay for it already, and.....well you should see her. No cares, no fucks given about anything, there could be nukes falling in the country and she would be like "meh". That's what your wonderful antidepressants do, it creates zombies out of people.


Cannot say the same thing for the demonized benzos. Certain benzos help you sleep when taken as needed, like temazepam, nitrazepam, flurazepam when you got a big day at work the next day or very difficult exams that are life altering if you pass them or not the next day. The rest is real anxiety medication, and the addictivenessof them is overblown, since the "Discontinuation Syndrome" (LMFAO), talk about an euphemism. I know somebody who tried to kill themselves over 5 times now because of the brain zaps after stopping Zoloft. Know what she's taking daily now to feel better? Lorazepam 2mg as needed.


Seriously, you sicken me, get out of my bluelight.

SSRIs are certainly no magic cure for depresssion. On the other hand, so are benzodiazepines.


If you exchange anxiety with a drug addiction, you move problems, but you don't solve them. And one could argue that benzodiazepine withdrawal is worse than SSRi withdrawals (excuse me pharma companies, of course I meant "discontinuation syndrome"). Both are manageable with a proper tapering though.

Hey man, I did mention how benzos helped me pump the brakes on that crazy brain of mine going way too fast. It did help me think things through that I could change in my life, something that couldn't have happened due to HPPD and a kind of weird condition caused by 2 surprise DOB hits in 2001 (I know for sure it was DOB, the guys arrested at the top of the DOB distribution chain were all arrested and it was on TV just a couple months after this). Had it been LSD I would have been fine. I'm kinda sick of repeating this story around here, although I understand not everyone has been here as long as me. And then I also got HPPD from smoking weed after the bad HORRIBLY SICKENING 32 hours of that DOB bad trip I endured, trying to find friends to go to but it was a week day, I skipped college when I took the dose on "saturday" night at 12:30 am, so Sunday, so yeah.


We all know of certain people who need benzos for a long time, if not life, for as required as it is kind of strange how some of the eureka moments came out of nowhere, because my brain wasn't reeling from GAD/SAD/Panic Attacks constantly, add insomnia recognized since childhood (5 years old), made worse by a earthquake in 1988 when I was in grade 2. A 6.4 in a zone of Canada that normally never gets earthquakes, hitting at 8h45pm. I remember my finger cracking tick (which would devolve into all kinds of joints cracking, including, back, hips, jaw) as I got older as it seemed to relieve a pressure that built inside of me a few mere seconds after the cracking. Apparently it does release endorphins to do, but if you could see all the ways I can crack my fingers, you'd be like what the fuck...A neurotic mess, made worse by my parents starting to hate each other when I was 10 who threw shit at each other and I guess if he didn't have kids (me and my brother), he would have killed my mom. The throwing her into walls etc.


Made for another self-hating male with insomnia who worked his crazy ass off in the canadian winter being a delivery boy with 2 runs, mostly cos I could buy beer in the weekends, if you're Canadian, you'll know that it's easy to buy it at 15 years old, but buying a pack of cigs, will get you carded at 30 years old (and the stores politics is if you look 25 and less to be carded, which is still an infrigment of the canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom) but anyway.


I just hate people who go around telling others benzo bad, ssri treatment good, that's not harm reduction in the slightest. It's just corporate whorism. I know all about benzo withdrawal, the trick is just, not to lack benzos. If you lose your SSRI's or use more than the doc prescribed (wouldnt know why one would do that, but lets say other more "fun" antidepressants or antipsychotics (Nozinan) like Manerix, Remeron, Nozinan, you won't have trouble if you try to refill 14 days early, or have to tell long ass stories about how your job (which was true for a while, required you to go pretty far because I was working for WIS, an inventory company, where they pack you in a 15 places van and you go and take inventory of the store with your little machine. Once they refused to give me my script of valium in advance, had to have my fucking boss call in. But that's the pharmacy where I'm at now that is stupid like this, I'd change chain, but right now it's the closest to me, and I was forced to switch to it when I was put on methadone, not all places offer the methadone in juice thing, and the methadone 40mg biscuits are long gone here too, there's still the Metadol pills for pain which I can't know why the fuck they won't use instead (1,5,10,25mg pills, seems perfect for dosing someone in not-so-round dosages when going down doses, say 47mg), from what I know, technicians who fill those bottles at night love to put less methadone in them than they should because they hate the methadone junkies. Suboxone is less of an hassle, except the way it works is the same as methadone here, 6 takehomes max blah blah blah.


All this when I know for sure they got a "trip" code, meaning somebody won't be around to renew, and if you renew your benzo script in another pharmacy, it gets permanently transfered there, it's the law. Like how you can't even have a painkiller script moved from a pharmacy to another and need a new script. 


Basically, being treated like scum because of benzos, which I was a daily user of, way before I slipped and fell into the opiate crack, which is the fault of my dental specialist who had me on a codeine contin 150mg and the last 2 months, the 200mg ones+ IR codeine+apap pills round the clock treatment for my TMJ disorder and trigeminal nerve damage in the same area retiring, getting my dossier from the clinic and trying to meet other doctors with that specialty, there are 2. After getting help with a phone script for some goddamn not empracets but Tylenol 3, can't have a real Empracet script through the phone, had to have the added caffeine which made it do nothing at all as I was so preoccupied with the tachycardia. So I called him back one more time for an appointment and some of these damn things meanwhile, and he started to get mad that I wanted another favour so much he effin hung up on me. 


4 years of being told it was all in my head after this (when duh, it is indeed in my head where the problem is, left jaw articulation particularly and trigeminal nerves junction before it goes under the bones is where the problem was situatied. Treated like shit 95% of the time, or when I did score opiates, it was at the ER, one bottle, no refill, no paper to meet a specialist, I'd be willing to go into another city, since the other maxilofacial dentists are such douchebags in my own. That, also, grinds one's nerves, a shitload, not to be believed, when the secretary of the clinic I used to go to (which is now just a normal dentist office) could all tell them what was wrong with me, but no, asked for x-rays, CT's. Finally got an MRI, but I was on methadone then, too late. 


Blah blah blah, at least it's a real human story, not somebody who's claiming a benzodiazepine isn't used for anxiety, when it is, a hell lot.You know what benzo is used ONLY in neurology, I've seen it said to be used for anxiety....maybe in children, but Frisium aka Clobazam, is what this Neurologist dude should use for seizures. Frisium has almost no abuse profile too.

Will you please stop making up out and out lies about what I have said. I have not once said that any particular benzodiazepine is not used for anxiety. You do not have even the tiniest bit of self-awareness to realise that your incoherent ramblings in response to rational, evidence-based posts are quite possibly symptomatic of a troubling psychiatric condition. Your comments about the difference between two Co-Codamol / acetaminophen-codeine compound analgesics are simply baffling. Empracet Codeine 3 and Tylenol 3 are the same compound paracetamol (only North America, Japan and Columbia stubbornly stick to calling it acetaminophen)  analgesic sold under different brand names. The Canadian variant of Tylenol 3 contains 15mg of caffeine which is well below any known useful threshold as an adjuvant in a compound analgesic and is probably there to piss off people cold extracting the codeine. At that level it certainly should not be causing tachycardia in patients without an underlying heart condition and I'm having difficulty imagining such a condition which wouldn't also be complicated by 240mg of codeine per day.

I have just noticed your comment about tricyclics. They have their uses but giving depressed people pills which can be fatally toxic with extraordinarily small increase in dosage is something I would rather avoid if at all possible.

This has nothing to do with what I wanted you to talk about, what is related to what started the discussion. Frisium for seizures, Frisium, the only benzo used exclusively in neurology, and for good reason, it has no good anxiolytic uses.


Empracets do not contain caffeine, it is widely used, too. That's why they are not Tylenol #3. I had never ever ever seen Tylenol #3 (and anyway it was generic Ratio Pharm Lenoltecs 3, the same as the OTC 8mg #1's but with 30mg anyway, never ever used, except for phone scripts, it seems) which I got from another Maxillofacial Dentist through a phone script after explaining my situation where Dr.Brassard fuckin left me out in the cold when retiring, couldn't commute to that other guy's office which is very far inside my town, one would absolutely need to drive for 50 minutes to get there,didn't have a car then, was still one poor student, and it was just a general comment on a how the medical system is all politics and not much logic, nothing about benzos, which please stick to).When I had treatment, my maxilofacial dentist used Codeine Contins 150mg bid and Empracets 60/300x4 a day for me, so a hell lot of codeine in a day. I was suffering as much as someone scripted MS IR/Statex 10mg 2-3 times a day when withdrawing, maybe more, I dunno, it's all relative and hard to quantify and you know that. I don't know what it is that I said that was baffling about pills i've used for 2 years of treatment before the goddamn specialist retired on me leaving me in the cold reality of one hell of a detox. I was under such a regimen because he didn't want to perform surgery, saying there was 4% chances he could leave me with my left eye impossible to close due to all the nerves that are in the area. Now, please bitch, troll elsewhere. Clobazam is for neurology only, Frisium bitch!


Now back to clonazolam talk, I'm sorry guys, this wannabe doctor needed his ass whooped'.

I honestly have no idea how to respond to your posts. I was discussing why clonazolam tablets and powder being widely available worries me. For some reason that led to a tirade of abuse. People have differences of opinion on many matters but in this case I have no idea what opinion on what matter has elicited the responses fro you.

Your gatekeeper attitude to benzodiazepines. You seem startled to encounter libertarian thought around here. I bet you think pharmacists are awesome and totally needed, when a fax machine+computer could do the same job, remove their ugly building and give it back to nature and eliminate the whole profession. You just can't wait for all of these available online to disappear so that depending on your location, you will maybe have some new patients running to any doctor, not you, they don't care about you, you're just a cog in the machine so you can put them on a too short valium or librium taper,going down 25 to 50% increments when changing dose, triviliaze their need for benzos, recommend SSRI's and well, thankfully I think you aren't american because the negative qualifiers would continue to rain. 


Clonazolam has been around longer than phenazepam back then when all the disasters it caused happened. Vendors wised up, customers wised up, researchers have wised up mostly (not distributing in powder only). To me this stuff is a life saver as I am underdosed. So are many other benzo users who have been given the greenlight for long term treatment a long time ago.

You need to understand in today's world the fact that the majority of so-called professionals accept something doesn't make it good or effective. I'm wondering what triggers all the anxiety in people who then desperately need anxiolytics like benzodiazepines. Isn't it the culture we live in? Obviously it's hard to treat anxiety if the problem that triggered it is still there and will be there as long as this circus called "democracy and freedom" goes on. Yet there's absolutely nothing that can justify using benzodiazepines for "treating" anxiety disorders like social anxiety for instance. I've got no idea what in pjd555's posts made you so angry. You accidentally took DOB which you had thought was LSD for the same reason doctors are prescribing way too much benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Money.

There were issues before the DOB as LSD incident, but yeah, it sure did not help. I was scripted Seconal and Placidyl in tiny quantities before life altering in importance exams in the early 2000's, but Seconal was removed in 2004 and Placidyl in 2006. For some reason I find these things to be more fit to use as needed than any benzo for sleep (my insomnia since childhood issue). I guess I was a bit mad. These 2 songs are basically what I'm all about since a couple years :


Lagwagon - No Little Pill 


I'm fully aware it would be a lot better to not have to use. Anyway, back to the topic people.


I still think benzos should be served with no scripts like in some eastern european countries and Thailand. If alcohol can be sold freely, so should they.


Not only the lyrics of that Lagwagon song do I find powerful, but there's this one too that's more of a bridge in relation to what you said to me, I'll just post in the lyrics though :


Kreator - Material World Paranoia (1990)(!)


[SOLO - FRANK]


Dehumanization through industrialization

Bring fear to the masses of reincarnation

Manic frustration deterioration

Nature fights back for its own preservation


Concrete coffin breeds lunacy

Cold steel skeleton

Desperation in the factory

Crank out oblivion


Material world paranoia

Corporations rule the earth

Material world paranoia

Enslavery begins at birth


Power's illusion brings global confusion

A forgone conclusion of mind's evolution

Nature's destruction through massive production

A blatant example of mindless construction


Concrete coffin breeds lunacy

Cold steel skeleton

Desperation in the factory

Crank out oblivion


Material world paranoia


Don't dream about how life can be

Experience your dreams

Before this prefab culture wastes your life

Stay on the straight and narrow course

Material wealth is yours

But the promise of a better future is a lie


[SOLO - MILLE]


The promise of a better future is nothing but a lie

So, to be on topic. Eating grapefruit REALLY boosts this one. Makes the Valium boost a joke. I'd say on par with Xanax on how much it strengthens it, but this is better since it lasts longer and there's no need to redose as fast. 


Sometimes, I'm thinking of finding a doc who would put me on Flurazepam for insomnia, I'd be good all day. The few times I've had Dalmane 30mg gelcaps, I didn't feel like taking anything during the day, a friend's mom who's pretty cool is scripted 30 of the 30mg gelcaps a month and sometimes she's given me some sometimes just mentioning I had trouble sleeping, she put like 10-12 in my hands. This stuff lasts long as fuck.


And it's actually a partial BZD agonist, long duration...could this be the suboxone of benzos? Although I felt heavy for 14 hours even with my current 20mg valium a day tolerance from a couple 30mg gels before bed.

I agree with most of what you're saying here. Essentially problems such as anxiety, depression and lack of attention / hyper-attention are medicated because these are issues which stop people being "productive" within society (stop people going to work). The fact that so many people suffer from these problems it itself shows that these are not individual problems we are all experiencing, they are a shared problem we all have due to the way society is structured, and no matter how many pills we shove down our throats these problems will never disappear because after the drugs wear off society is still enforcing this pressure on you.


However, even though I am aware of this, I am also aware that these substances do perform a function. Saying "there's absolutely nothing that can justify using benzodiazepines for "treating" anxiety disorders like social anxiety" isn't true because they clearly do help people in these situations. They aren't a cure, because that would require a radical change in the way society is structured (which I am all for btw), but they do serve a purpose.

Essentially problems such as anxiety, depression and lack of attention / hyper-attention are medicated because these are issues which stop people being "productive" within society (stop people going to work). The fact that so many people suffer from these problems it itself shows that these are not individual problems we are all experiencing, they are a shared problem we all have due to the way society is structured, and no matter how many pills we shove down our throats these problems will never disappear because after the drugs wear off society is still enforcing this pressure on you.

No not at all. But I do feel (like I mentioned in my previous post) that many things are medicated or treated for the benefit of society rather than the individual. If you're going to work for example, and your boss is bullying you on a daily basis, then a legitimate response to that will be to feel anxious and maybe even depressed. If you undertake CBT and drug treatments they might help you cope with that situation, or make you feel better or think differently about it, but the boss is still a bully.


I dunno if this is making any sense..... I myself take medication (both prescribed and not so prescribed) and have mixed feelings about it all.

It does and I make a point of telling patients that their boss is acting in an unlawful manner and have personally written to HR departments ,with the patient's permission, to remind them that now they have been made aware of it a failure to take action to stop it renders the employer liable to financial sanctions which, in some cases, qualify for removal of the employment tribunal compensation ceiling and could result in a compensation order unbounded by any limit.

Back to the Clonazolam discussion. Have again taken 1 x 0.5 capsule today and it works as well as it did the first time. Think I genuinely love this substance.

Taken 1mg at once today about 2 hours ago and it's completely jiggered me. Definitely only doing 0.5 for future reference. Feel amazing but the chances of me getting anything done is far below zero.

You sound like an alright person, I told you from the start.It's a bit infantilizing though to be told man watch out for those 0.5mg clonazolam gelcaps! When you probably have a patient on 2mg xanax prn up to 8 tabs a day (extrapolation), let's say Ativan or Serax. I mean, yeah, people don't want things in powder, i remember back 4-5 years ago when I got my first bag of 250mg of etizolam powder (which I got the scales for), I studied chemistry, I'm a chem technician, a level lower than an engineer...by a manner of just one certain class I was unable to beat after 3 semesters where my schedule was empty except for the 6 hours a week of said course...anyways, my failures aside, nobody gave a fuck about it. One time I had 4mg flubromazepams pressed pellets on me and every pill head wanted some. I was told that powder like that was "bad presentation" and remembering telling the friend bringing me there "I wasn't a tupperware lady and I didn't want to sell anything in the first place"...that dude isn't my friend anymore. 


So yeah, I mean, you just became a bluelighter here, imagine people with upwards 500 posts start knowing what they're talking about, those that don't kind of get put in their place very fast, for harm reduction purposes but also because of some's (it's not as bad now) ingrained trolling, but since anononomous isn't a thing anymore I've seen changes in multiple communities where the tryhards at being annoying gnats have disappeared. Your insistence that RC benzos is a bad thing reminded me of some guy being happy GBL was now really difficult to find even when legal, like here. 


Seriously, benzos are not even a blip in the arena of danger to one's health. There is 2 supermarkets, 1 smaller grocery store and 3 Couche-Tards (kind of like 7/11's)in my neighborhood with enough beer combined to kill half the town. And I don't include the government controlled wine and liquor store, because it's a bit farther, past the train overpass so not in my neighborhood. Oh I forgot about all the cancer sticks too. I'm glad I stopped the cigs 5 months ago, gave me some confidence again that I can have some control over what I put in my body and not act by pure logic and end up like in that special Futurama episode where Bender asks what it would be like if he became human.


Well, he becomes insanely fat, has all the beers, all the pussy, all the cigars and dies. So obviously, only thinking in self-defeating use of logic isn't going to help one or others.

Benzos are a major danger to some groups. Once a person is approaching their late 50s they literally become an accident waiting to happen as they accumulate the ordinary but treatable conditions that come with age. The number of black eyes, orbital fractures  and hip fractures that are a result of interaction, efficiency of metabolism changes and motor skill loss combined with a benzo habit is frightening. Not to mention accidental repeat dosing of complete medication sets due to memory loss.

I prescribe it, rarely and sparingly, for epilepsy and certain idiopathic non-convulsive epileptiform disorders and epilepticus states of those disorders. There are some off licence conditions I can prescribe it for but only in small doses. Also, tolerance to etizolam is less burdensome than most benzos. Clonazolam with its sub-milligram action is an accident waiting to happen.

Clonazepam is the most effective benzodiazepine for panic disorder combined with agoraphobia in the 1mg every 12 hours dosing or 0.5mg 3 times a day. It was a godsend for me for many years before I switched to Valium which doesn't TOUCH agoraphobia to start a very long taper due to the time I'd been on benzos. Clonazepam is more effective than Valium in every way,not to mention it has an antidepressant effect not found with any other benzo and isn't considered recreational except by a very select few who get euphoric from it. It's a shame the UK doesn't recognize its benefits.

At its peak 95% of prescriptions were off-label.  Current guidelines simply include it in the list of benzodiazepines suitable for use as adjunctive therapy in the early phase of treatment. Guidelines in Canada state that benzos should be used at regularly dosed intervals for a short period of time and not used on an as needed basis. Roche do not market Rivotril as an anxiolytic and, as in many countries, its use as such is in decline.

 Are you serious? I would say that besides Lorazepam Clonazepam is the most prescribed benzo for anxiety in Canada. If i was going to bet i would say Lorazepam would be number 1, Clonazepam number 2 and with maybe Valium coming in at number 3. Temazepam would probably be the most prescribed hypnotic benzo. This varies depending on where you live in Canada though of course and i have noticed Valium and Bromazepam are prescribed alot more here then on the mainland. Probably because that's what old school docs like prescribing. In the UK i think Clonazepam is hard to get for anxiety but in Canada it's one of the first they will try you on. It is used as a benzo to take everyday on schedule and also to take as needed.


 Personally i don't think that long term benzo use for anxiety is that bad as long as the person does not abuse them or atleast keeps to just taking a few extra every now and then. I would certainly consider benzos safer then using say Seroquel or some other atypical anti-psychotic off label for anxiety. Also as someone who has been through both withdrawal from a SNRI like Venlafaxine is about as bad as benzo wd if not worse and SSRI's and SNRI's can take just as long or longer to wean off safely. As for Gabapentin i found that to be possibly the most physically painful drug to taper off. So i would say using benzos for anxiety is no worse then most alternatives as atleast you won't get type 2 diabetes from Clonazepam. I have seen doctors do really dumb shit such as prescribe high doses of Seroquel, give a patient 30mg's of Zyprexa a day resulting in Tardive Dyskinesia and cardiac problems, giving someone Chlorpromazine and even Haldol ffs to treat anxiety all because they did not want to prescribe a benzo. Despite these drugs having far more risks and Haldol is one they only even use in emergencies or if nothing else works in patients suffering from psychosis or mania.  I guess their rational for this is that anti-psychotics aren't fun at all but to a small proportion of people benzos are.


 I have been on Clonazepam since about 2005 for GAD as well as panic disorder as well as to help my manic episodes as i have bipolar disorder. It also helps the Trigeminal neuralgia i have so i do take it for more then anxiety although anxiety was the first reason i was prescribed it. I have been on 6mg's of Clonazepam a day since 2007 and except for when someone made off with my pills when i was in a shitty city in upper Canada i haven't run out more then a few days early and that only happened a few times and since it's no problem to get a refill a few days early on benzos that was never a problem. Often i don't even take my full dose of the month and having some left over is handy.


 Rivotril may only be officially marketed on the product monograph as use as a anti-Convulsant but it's primary use is in treating anxiety disorders. It also seems to be the go to benzo for treating Trigeminal Neuralgia as well as other forms of neuropathic pain. I mean they use Lorazepam as a go to drug for stopping seizures these days (well either that or Valium) in Canada but officially on the product monograph it is not indicated for this purpose. Despite Ativan for IV/IM use being a standard medicine in every clinic in Canada because of it's anti-Convulsant properties. Clonazepam is indicated for use in various anxiety disorders in Canada but for some reason the product monograph of Rivotril only lists it as a Anti-convulsant which is probably just left over from when Rivotril was first marketed in Canada. It is a good choice as a everyday benzo if you have to take them regularly because the long half life makes sure missing a dose or 2 won't hurt you that much (though it's a bad practice to skip doses especially if your prone to seizures) plus compared to the short acting benzos used for anxiety such as Lorazepam and Alprazolam (Xanax is rarely prescribed where i live for some reason) Clonazepam is less addictive. Unlike other long acting benzos such as Valium and Flurazepam aka Dalmane Clonazepam has no active metabolites which is another thing doctors like about it.


 So yes it is used quite often for anxiety in Canada and is going to be one of the first drugs prescribed to you for that purpose if a doctor thinks you need a benzo for your anxiety. Most if not all benzodiazepines posses some anti-Convulsant properties though Clonazepam and Valium seem to be the 2 most prescribed benzos to treat long term seizures. I guess Lorazepam's short half life makes it unsuitable for long term treatment.


 I don't see why people are so eager for RC benzos as the only benzo i have found to pack any euphoria is Temazepam. I have had ampules of Valium and vials of Ativan for IM/IV use and i didn't even get any euphoria taking those 2 IV. But oral Temazepam is great and i could and have eaten those red and blue caps all day. But then again i have noticed that in some places doctors treat any benzo like fucking Dilaudid. If i didn't actually have a need to take Clonazepam i wouldn't because i don't get any euphoria from it so to me it's no different then the Lamictal i take really. I don't know why that in some places i have been to they seem intent on not prescribing benzos and a ER in Canada's shitty frozen capital city was going to refuse to prescribe them to me even though i had run out through no fault of my own and had proof from a GP, shrink and neurologist that i needed to be on it. I think if i was going to scam a doctor i would atleast go for a decent opiate not a fucking benzo. Yet they hand out SSRI's and SNRI's like candy. Thank fuck i can't take either because of my Bipolar disorder both are off limits for me though


 I would rank Clonazepam as being very effective for anxiety although Valium at equal doses is abit more sedating but no doctor is going to prescribe 120mg's of Valium a day. Temazepam is also good for anxiety but sadly it's use is restricted to being a sleep aid only. Probably a good thing or i would be eating Temazepam all day ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Heh, he brought up the hip fractures. 


He's really reaching here, reminds me of the now removed triazolam (yeah, goodbye Halcion, glad I had you only once at least) that really focused on the dangers to the elderly etc. We're all aware of this here.


RC Benzos are more a good thing than a bad thing. It keeps me from being in that damn cycle I was in because I am underdosed (on purpose, I could ask for a raise, well, more like a switch, more likely to Bromazepam 6mg x3 a day to compensate the 20mg valium a day, I don't think he'd want to put me on 30mg of valium a day) and sometimes life's circumstances, especially things I cannot change, overwhelm me so much because well, now I know, thanks to clonazepam putting a stop to my panic disorder from 2007 to 2010, it made me think things through and find other ways to calm myself and also be able to think in different processes that allows for one not to be trembling in fear due to a feeling of lack of control/imminent death/country 'A' as the FBI calls it going all Samson on us when the eventuality the rest of the world gets sick of their barbarity inevitably happens. It helped me put away my fear of close contact with people of the opposite gender, I used to push away girls, even the pretty ones who would show interest in me, clonazepam helped me in so many ways. It was like a pause button for my brain which was stuck watching a horror movie.Then when I felt the addiction wasn't worth it anymore, because I felt TOO carefree and kinda zombified at 3.5mg a day, I asked, to the surprise of my psychiatrist, to be tapered down using diazepam, but I got stuck at 20mg because we didn't exactly use the Ashton manual, and then, it had been 3 and a half years I had been on ever increasing doses of clonazepam, after using for more than a year, there's no way that when I decide to leave the diazepam behind, from where I'm at, it's going to be 1mg at once every 2-3 weeks, and even have pauses in reduction, again if necessary.Thankfully the dosages of valium pills allow for 1mg reductions which is a plus. 3.5mg of clonazepam was converted to 55mg of valium for a week, 50, 45, 40 etc. and I thought I could do it. Something traumatic happened when I got to around 25mg in my life (just had to happen right then, didn't it?), well it happened to everyone's life, but it's not like they ever noticed,most of em anyway. So when I dropped to under 20mg of valium to 15mg, the drop in dosage was way too much and I had to call in sick and go to the ER to have things sorted out, had to tell the ER doc about all the antidepressants I took and why I stopped them(to his insistence). When he heard about my Paxil mania, he said, okay, we'll put you back on 20mg until you meet your psychiatrist again.But the whole time he was telling me "Anxiety is treated with antidepressants, ALWAYS". 8). 


So right now, at 20mg, on a threshold dose to feel ok and sleep okay, I do get bad days and good days too, where I take less, split a 10mg in 2 and have 15mg a day, or 10. The supplemental benefits of professionally (it is possible to know how professional X vendor is, I can't tell you how one can do this here, it would count as sourcing) of having these on the market for me to buy freely and take responsibly for those damn days where I needed 30mg to get by, or 25...I tell you never again do I want to live in a state of cold turkey benzo situation because a)can't refill b)can't go to the ER and hope to be helped, i'd have to invent stuff about losing my script etc. and at some point, I did that too often so I didn't go to an ER in years now (3) so that I won't be treated like the last time I was in benzo CT withdrawal due to not taking my script exactly as scripted (which is illogical like i said, the fact the dosage is rigid is what causes problems like this). Yeah, last time I went in because I had 4 days left before I could renew, the extremely stuck up female doc I happened to meet (not saying all female docs are like her, but they happen to be more strict and protocol abiding in all cases, which is a female trait) who said, "go back in the waiting room and wait until you seize out, I'm not not helping you. You abuse your script and I will tell your doc." 


They keep me and others from annoying these sanctimonious ER docs when experiencing the hell on earth that is benzo withdrawal. And with valium I endure it, because it's an endurable torture. Back when I was on clonazepam, at the dosage I was, and the fact I seem to metabolize it faster than usual,it does have a large range of metabolization, from the top of my head it was about 35 to 110 hours. Considering the vast majority of people who use benzos out there, don't take them everyday, and use them purely in utilitarian fashion, I say yeah, it's still better that you use that, than an opiate or alcohol to put yourself to sleep after using stimulants,psychedelics etc. Or just the occasional insomnia, without the insane annoyance that is of having doctor's appointments and trying to convince them that is not trazodone for occasional next-day delibitating insomnia. Before I got on that benzo train, my old school doc, who now unfortunately retired last fall, back in the early '00s he was scripting me Seconals, I would tell him how many exams I was scared of failing which happened in the morning the next day, and script me one dose for every night before such exams, such a trust was wonderful. When the feds removed all barbs except for a 2, useless for sleep, he used Placidyl for my educational anxiety caused insomnia, Placidyl was removed in 2006. I was using OTC Promethazine 50mg pills,diphenhydramine 50mg and all the shit things I could get when all those were gone, never asked for a benzo, until I was scripted 0.25mg xanax by him before sleep. 0.25mg didn't do much, 0.5 just calmed me but did nothing like what we wanted, so I got a script to the best z-drug we had, Starnoc (Zaleplon), used that for the occasional insomnia, especially as my issue is falling asleep, once I do, i'm a brick. Canada removed Zaleplon because I guess it came in gelcaps, which contained a snortable powder (yeah you could do that with Zaleplon, I'm sure americans here knwo that from whenever they had some Sonata). It would give this wonderful psychedelic euphoria and suddenly lights out, so of course you had to be in bed when it started to kick in. We only had Zopiclone and that thing is useless and tastes like what I imagine alien drugs taste like and we didn't have zolpidem until like 2 years ago, tried it, its not covered by my province's insurance so 44 dollars for 15 10mg sublingual pills, which also taste so horrible, I don't know what they were thinking, and its the only form in comes in, Sublinox 10mg Sublingual. It didn't even help me sleep when out of my mere 20mg of valium.


So benzos kill 2 birds with one stone....I could have lived with just one stone for one bird though and do as I did in the past with my anxiety issues, deal with it. Now I can't. So RC benzos are welcome to all the poor souls that have to live with benzo addiction, something that is brushed off as almost non existant by many doctors, or just a mere annoyance that goes away rapidly. It's just not so. Or else I'd be off them. That's why there is such demand, my case is surely not unique...


And, I have the official Health Canada benzo conversion + info charter from 2009 here, still contains outdated info like Halcion being there, but other than that, clonazepam is approved for anxiety issues. It says it's not ideal for insomnia (I agree), because you wake up still on it and that it is useful for some nevralgic pain. Which is why I first got it from a neuro, who told me, it's also used in psychiatry so I won't refer you to a psychiatrist," this + the Topamax will take care of your pain issue and also your anxiety issues (which were worsened by that damn medical problem not being found out for years, went through surgery, removal of perfect wisdom teeth and about 5 neurologists before they found out what was going on. That'll also make you doubt your sanity, if you believe in sanity anyway.


You're lucky you can still get a couple days refill early P_A, the pharmacy I go to (now, since the opiate addiction incident, where I go take my suboxone and have to fucking stand there like an idiot for 5 minutes for the pills to dissolve and due to my jaw and nerves being fucked, i can't even show them the underside of my tongue out very well, it won't go up as much as other people would), they're also hardasses (except for the owner, who I am so happy when he is the one working, that if in a worst case scenario, like last year, when I lost my bottle of valium commuting in the bus from my girlfriend's apartment to mine and was like 15 days in advance, I was lucky that when I called he was the one at work. The ghost looking ginger will not under any circumstances renew my valium script before the exact date and she's there all the fucking time. And the 2 new female, again, girls were most likely told "this one's on suboxone" so they never wanted to either.


At my old pharmacy before I was forced to switch, I was able to renew days in advance, especially when I was still on my mom's insurance and not the government's, I was still a student past 25, but her insurance didn't cover for such a situation, so it got more difficult then and even more later because as you must know, only certain pharmacies have the liquid methadone...which is the same brand name Metadol for pain except in liquid. Now that I'm on subs i could switch pharmacies, but my old one is now owned by a different person and he switched all the staff so I got no idea how they run the place. There's a smaller pharmacy not too far where I could switch, but they certainly would not have suboxone in stock and would need to order it. So when I do switch, it's gonna have to be a perfectly coordinated op.

 Actually according to Health Canada's drug product database Triazolam is still available in 0.25mg pills in generic form only made by AA pharma. Good luck getting a doctor to write a script for it though as it is the 1 benzo available in Canada that i have never seen anybody prescribed. Hell i have even seen Dalmane prescribed a few times but i don't know anyone in Canada who has ever been prescribed Triazolam. It does seem to be prescribed alot more in America for some reason while here the number 1 benzo hypnotic would most likely be Temazepam.

Yeah, I saw man. I don't know who AA Pharma is. Maybe it's available in one province or two still. But Quebec has nothing from AA pharms. Never saw anything AA-X mg if you know what I mean. It disappeared from RAMQ's list of medication pdf published every month in sept 2013, where it was still available as APO-Triazo (You'll see it if you search for removed versions of triazolam), when I had it, it was APO-Triazo, green 0.25mg pills. It's funny the stuff used to be available in 2mg doses when it came out (an older friend of mine remembers them as fondly as Seconals, which says a lot, he's 45). But yeah, good luck in whatever province where it is available to get it. My pharmacist confirmed to me they still have stocks of the Apotex ones but after those are gone, they're gone, he doesn't even know who AA pharms are heh.


That guy who's 45 had his Halcion script (brand name) in 2003 switched to Xanax bars, was scripted 8x2mg twice a day to feel equivalency...holy s...and I doubt that guy lies when he says they used to be available in 0.5,1 and 2mg as is typical for high potency benzos, at first.


My best friend's mom is scripted Dalmane, 30x30mg a month, it keeps her from drinking, so her doctor made a choice. The few times I tried it is because she's the coolest mom of all the friends I have, she gave me like 12 last time I visited, a while ago, she lives kinda far from here and I won't be this asshole friend who will nag his friend for his mom's meds ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


And yeah, more used in the US, I bet. Like all benzos, really. Here it seems to be not very popular to be into pharms, it even took a long time for opiates to catch on, my city was PCP and LSD and cocaine town for the longest time and even still to this day, had i admitted to shooting up dilaudid and not just snorting it, i would have lost all friends instantly, so it was always kept a secret. If you were a fan of Breaking Bad, if you ever want to go through a rewatch marathon, there's this episode early on when Walt accepts treatment and you see his pile of American orange pill bottles (orange bottles, only saw them on tv, so in american settings) and his damn annoying wife who's a major hypocrite through the whole series who won't let Walt even smoke weed while he has cancer, talks with her sister about their weed smoking days and later in the episode we see her look at the pile of bottles, and the others are blurred out in the back, we see her looking at the Triazolam bottle, have a kind of "no,don't" in a moment where she's stressed out. And well, they'll say what they want, tv if made well enough can feel very real, I felt her jonesing as in when I reach for an extra valium cos something startled me that day and for the better of myself and my gf, it's better I just overmedicate. Just a funny thing they wouldn't even show say his Ondansetron but the Triazolam was clear as day.


edit: MagicalKat777 : Funny, what you say about clonazepam having antidepressant qualities. Of course that's your own subjective feel for it, but what this official Health Canada(our FDA) Benzo comparison chart with equivalencies and info for each available in canada, is saying that clonazepam is the benzo most likely to cause depression in long term use. Alprazolam is the one that is said to have some, it's written this way "(?)Antidepressant Activity), meaning there's anecdotal data pointing to such. Another interesting one is that long term chronic use of bromazepam could cause bromine poisoning but that it is very rare and most likely to occur in liver impaired people. Heh, I thought such could only happen with people really overdoing DXM HBr. Anyways, didn't we collide with each other over this antidepressant thing not long ago ? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

They actually theorize that the reason clonazepam is one of the hardest to kick is because of its antidepressant action. 


[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3279721](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3279721)


I'm on my phone so I'm not going to quote it but it was something like an 84% response rate and it only took about a week to kick in.

Well, Clonazepam is a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, just like any other benzodiazepines. There's no special mechanism of action that would be responsible for antidepressant effects (which, at least acute, happen with pretty much every benzodiazepine, which is why they're rather popular among depressed/anxious people).

All of this adds weight to the fact they should stick to Frisium (Clobazam) in neurology, except for the neurologic pain issues like facial neuralgias where clonazepam indeed works well (I can back up P_A on this) although my issue kind of resolved itself with time, since it is related to a jaw accident, I had more chances that the nerve damage would get more tolerable one day.


But yeah, nobody is going to steal an epileptic's clobazam. It is totally impossible to get real benzo effect from it, it is more likely to do so with Oxazepam (and I need at least 3 of the 30mg white tablets to get a very short but intense bout of anxiolysis, it explains why it has to be dosed 4-5 times a day. P_A, have you noticed Lorazepam is more used on females in NL also? Because here all the girls except one who's on xanax i know on benzos are lorazepam, oxazepam and clonazepam. In that order, one sometimes helps me out when i'm fucked with her her Oxazepam 15mg pills...as nice as the gesture is, something I have to take 3 tablets at once to get somewhere with is quite something to ask many tabs of when I know too well how generous the person is to spare some of their benzos for me.


I'm reading how clobazam is used for anxiety too. Okay. Maybe for kids before dental procedures, I know my dentist uses 5mg valium for dental fear for kids over 6. I don't see how it could work for anyone with a real pressing issue. Alright, I'm done derailing the thread, truth maintenance achieved.


Clonazolam is really good and should be considered as an rx'able benzo in any case if any country is inclined to. Like Etizolam already is even if sold online. 


I wish etizolam wasn't the exception to the rule though. Where's my vendor that has temazepam or loprazolam? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Or in some vendor's logic, brotizolam, since it's not a benzo and they're playing it safe.

I've got a 100 pellets coming in sometime next week! I almost exclusively use benzos to knock me out after stimulant use. I've got virtually no benzo tolerance although I've got a good bit of experience with them. 1mg should suffice for this purpose?

Assuming the pellets are 0.5mg, then one of them might be all you need tbh. I only have experience researching with the capsules (which are also 0.5mg), but from what I've heard from other people the pellets kick in quicker. I suppose it depends what doses with other benzos you normally take for such purposes? 1mg Clonazolam will certainly do the job, but it might be a bit too much for what you need.


I also have 100 pellets appearing sometime soon so I'm interested to see what the differences (if any) are.

So it's that potent eh? I did order the 0.5mg pellets. I need 2mg of etizolam and 1-1.5mg of xanax to knock me out on a comedown. If I'm still quite wired but want to call it a night I'll take a bit more (3mg eti or 2mg xanax). How would clonazolam compare to those doses?

Personally I'd test 0.5 to see how it made you feel first (in a situation where you're not coming down and have a day to spare), but considering what you have been doing previously 1mg sounds about right. It will definitely do the job! The only reason I'd be cautious is because I've heard from peeps that 1 - 1.5mg has caused blackouts. Just play it safe mate. It takes roughly half an hour to kick in and full effects are felt after about 3 hours, so you could always try one pellet and see how you feel an hour later.

Took a 0.5mg pellet an hour ago, there's a mood lift, anxiolysis, but also quite a bit of sedation. The triazolo punch is real.

I'm living in the US and have been on a steady dose of Clonazepam for GAD since the 80s; except for a few years of detox and substitution with older non addicting and extremely less effective drugs a few times( notwithstanding Zoloft and time release Paxil, but they're only good for agoraphobia, and I have a combination. Also, I've been on Zoloft since 1993 and the delayed sexual evacuation due to less sensation is turning into anorgasmia as I hit my 50s and hormone levels change... And that bites the big one!)

For the past 10-15 years the drug called Pregabalin has been studied extensively and compared to differing Benzos. In all studies, once a higher threshold is reached the pregabalin is as effective as the varying Benzos!

Unfortunately here in the USA, unlike in practically the rest of the world, the drug pregabalin has not been approved at higher doses for anxiety. ( It's a for profit pharmaceutical motive combined with extremely long and costly FDA clinical trials that often after approval in the USA will give the company a short window to both recover its research costs while making big bucks for WallStreet and the executives; it ain't for the researchers, trust me because I've done research for a large Pharmaceutical company where the salespeople make higher salaries than the researchers who are coming out of college with similar degree levels).

Anyway, I digress!

....back to topic, sorry.

After years of combining Clonazepam with gabapentin, in order to keep the Clonazepam doseage lower,  I finally got my doc to start me on pregabalin at the anxiolytic dosage level last year.

I would urge you to plead with your doc, and insurance company, to let you try and slowly escalate up to at least 450mg per day of  pregabalin instead of just going online for more Benzos! This is,  if it's going to be a long term thing like it has and always will be with me. Pregabalin is very effective for GAD, and a tolerance with a desire to keep getting high by taking more does not develop.  In clinical studies published on Pubmed over the past 10+ years, pregabalin is the ONLY drug which one will find being as effective for anxiety using both short and intermediate acting Benzos; not even SSRIs over the past 26 plus years share that distinction!

I love the feeling that a Benzo gives me and wish there were no long term side effects, but a recent study indicates that long term Benzo use may be associated with a greater risk for developing alzheimers. Pregabalin is newer and not as well studied but it does not get me high and make me want more and then to wish I could increase the dosage because it feels less effective. It may very well also turn out that pregabalin could dispose long term users with anxiety to a higher risk of Alzheimer's, but time will tell and in the meantime one does not need to struggle with Benzo tolerance issues. Plus, pregabalin's biggest side effect is weight gain, and having been there on other non addicting Meds in the past such as Triavil, I can say that the weight gain "urge" given from taking pregabalin is no where near as strong and uncontrollable as with a neuroleptic such as the trilafon and the tricyclic that are the two constituents of the 1960s non addicting anxiety creation called Triavil; nor strong at all like with Hydroxizine, and low levels of thioridazine... A few more as well but they also fall into the neuroleptic or tricyclic classes of drugs.

If you need to be on an anxiolytic all the time and an SSRI will not do it all, as with myself, go the route of pregabalin before starting on a new Benzo( unless of course you just want to use the new Benzo as occasional "hamburger helper" for how messed up life can be with chronic anxiety!) Pregabalin is a C5 in the USA, BUT that's an overly cautious designation when compared to a C4 such as a Benzo. They might as well schedule Dextromethorphan as a C5 if they think that one will get high and abuse pregabalin

Result: Slept for 14 hours and had a few extremely vivid dreams. 0.5mg is way too much without tolerance, at least for me. Will go for 0.25 or even 0.125mg next time.

In that order, one sometimes helps me out when i'm fucked with her her Oxazepam 15mg pills...as nice as the gesture is, something I have to take 3 tablets at once to get somewhere with is quite something to ask many tabs of when I know too well how generous the person is to spare some of their benzos for me.

 For some weird reason i have noticed that women tend to get abit more out of Ativan then guys do. And yeah when it comes to women id have to say Lorazepam is probably the number 1 prescribed. I have forgotten how much a strong benzo like Clonazepam can affect someone. I gave 1mg to my dad when his leg was killing him one night and it knocked him solid for 10 hours and made him groggy half the day. I hate being this benzo tolerant but at the same time i cant say i have ever really craved a benzo. It does work well for facial pain though i have to say because i just don't get the awful spasms that lasted after the shooting pain had gone.

hello guys. providing you can get both etizolam and clonazolam, which one would you choose for coming down from stimulants? also, is 0.5mg clonazolam similar to 1mg etizolam? and are there any info on how clonazolam affects quality of sleep? i really like that etiz seems not to fuck up with deep sleep (unlike xanax). i would really appreciate your input as i am considering buying today to make use of special offer which ends today. thanks a lot.

My tolerance is moderate, but I took 50 of these between 9am and 4pm yesterday. They coiuld have been a placebo. I've tried them once, and that's it.

Moderate tolerance? The dose you had is equivalent to 2000mg of Diazepam; there's no way you didn't blackout.

Currently researching the pellets for the first time. They are light purple in colour and dosed at 0.5 like the capsules. So far they are working, but I am not sure if they are as good as the capsules. Seem to kick in faster but don't feel as functional. Could be purely a placebo effect (the capsules seemed to be more professionally made for some reason), or the fact I am tired after a heavy weekend, but they don't feel as smooth.


Edit: Few hours in and feeling nice. Think on the whole they compare favourably to the capsules.

After conducting more research, I'd say the dosage in the pellets is more inconsistent than the capsules. Some of them seem to be bunk as well. Had three today when I would normally have two as the second one did absolutely nothing.

My roommate took .5mg and was seriously benzed from about 4pm til he went to sleep.


I ended up taking 2.5mg and really felt nothing. This is the second RC that has apparently had 0 effect at recommended doses. So far Ive taken 2mg and in 30 mins will take another 2mg. Unfortunately my fav benz, xanax, is rarely available to me it seems like the only one that is effective.

Background: previous experience with clonazepam, diazepam and mexazolam. Moderate benzo tolerance until 1/Jan/2015, since 1/Jan only took 0.5mg clonazepam on 22/Feb.


On 24 Feb took 0.5mg Clonazolam, capsules received out of Sweden.


Mood: tired but not sleepy, watching TV in bed. 

Took about 45m to kick in I'd say but I wasn't keeping time. 


Familiar sense of warmth set in, increased focus. Short-term memory seemed somewhat affected, as sometimes it'd take me awhile to gather my thoughts. Got up and grabbed a slice of pizza, first steps were wobbly. Decided to go back to bed to eat and watch more TV. I enjoyed this for maybe nearly an hour and then gave in to the urge to sleep (the previous night I had little sleep). Slept for 6 hours, woke up and felt nearly the same as before falling asleep. Ate a bit more, went back to bed, watched tv for maybe 1.5hours and slept solid for more 7 hours!


Felt pretty nice overall. Similar to clonazepam but not quite the same. The dose felt heavier, I wouldn't say 0.5mg clonazolam = 0.5 clonazepam... maybe more like 0.5 clonazolam = 0.75 or 1mg clonazepam.


I didn't feel much euphoria, just a sense of a cozy "everything is right". No hangover. I reckon this will come in handy for stimulant comedowns and panic attacks (altho takes a bit to kick in).

I Cant wait for like a this New Clonazepam Analog to get more Reviews before I Buy it But it is Safer then the Knock your ass out with 6mg Clonazepam a day Tolerance Flubromazo-L-AM the shit comes in 0.25 MG Pellets and that is equal to 0.5 MG Clonazepam or Alprazolam cuz i find them in equally Potent but obvious they feel diff you may find one stronger but it is still same strength but I bet there is prob a slightly less cross tolerance from a new benzo possibly but more Like A Brain Tolerance Developing Stronger the Longer and most tolerance for benzo u use the most if you don't use more then like 3mg clonazepam with a 7 day break or equivalent like 120mg Temazepam is equal or 60mg diazepam is equal to 3mg Clonazepam and Diazepam is Stronger but ONLY WHEN THE NOTICABLE EFFECTS WHERRE OFF YOU GET AS IN  the strong 5-7 hours before it lasts for a long time mildly basically erasing anxiety best benzo for anxiety hands down if you Read the Receptors it hits. Nordiazepam but it DiAZEPAM produces that and then like Temazepam and oxazepam and some more dont know the order hence you cant sublginual and only swallow Valiums.

Got 50 - 0.5mg red pellets at 8am today. Took one along with 600mg pregabalin and 5mg diazepam, my morning prescription meds, and 1mg nifoxipam and 4mg diclazepam. Feel nice, i dunno if its really sedative for myself and tolerance but seems more promissing than most rc benzos we have. Got psycologist today at one pm, if it helps my horrible anxiety/aggorophobia then i will report. I will check a higher dose and see if it knocks me out later today to test how potent they are.

I recently received a 100 yellow 0.5mg pellets. 0.25mg provided some effects somewhat comparable to 1mg of etizolam. Redosing the other half pellet 4 hours later didn't seem to do anything more. Yesterday night I took 1mg after an AMT trip and within 30 minutes I could feel the sedation kicking in. 90 minutes later my motor skills were severely impaired and I was stumbling around the room. Had great difficulty keeping my eyes open. Music sounded fantastic though and I felt super relaxed. Passed out no problem whatsoever. Woke up this morning still feeling some effects (motor coordination, drowsyness). It's now been 14hrs since dosing 1mg and I still feel some lingering anxiolysis. 


Great rc benzo as far as I'm concerned although 0.5-0.75mg would probably be my preferred dose range from now on. 1mg is overkill for removing residual stimulation.

G'day folks! I've just got 50 light pink 0.5 Clonazolam pills in the post, I've just necked 2 of them 10 minutes ago and I've got a pleasant feeling that these are going to work ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I've got no benzo tolerance at all these days just a modest 300mg a day codeine phosphate habit that I'm going to lose with the help of these new little chaps.

I'll be back to report how they went.


edit, 10 minutes later. yep, properly mashed here, having a lie down seems like the best option, I can't believe that a 50-year-old grown up like myself can still be such a twat and not just take one to see what's what....

Is it normal for there to be such a variation in colour with benzo's


So far with these there are reports of light purple, light pink, red, yellow pellets / pills


Original capsules are yellow.


Is this normal when something new comes on the market? Like with Etizolam I only ever encountered blue pressed pills, and the pink pharm ones.


Maybe it's just down to my own inexperience, but it does make things very confusing!

Tried 0.5mg clonazolam to test. I was incredibally spangled after 40 minutes of ingestion. I'm writing this now as I wake up very chilled and a little foggy. I had the light purple ones, I would be careful with these ones!

I used to be on 8mg/day for myoclonic seizures as well as 16mg of buprenorphine, which has reported antidepressant effects as well.


They both definitely have antidepressant effects but the strain of addiction made the effects fleeting.


I detoxed from both and am in the biggest depression funk ever. I find it hard to get out of bed and go outside to do anything. Basic care is a chore and motivation is nonexistent. 


But by chance after detoxing from the klonopin I no longer have anxiety, just waiting for my brain to start firing on all cylinders again so I can live normally.

Yeah, I know about your case of TN, I actually suffered from TN type 2, the even more unknown form of it. Saw about 6 neurologists (and multiple visits to some of them before trying another) until they figured it out, had to drive all the way to Montreal to get a decent Neuro. I had managed to grab myself a script at the ER of clonazepam 0.5mg twice a day with 1 refill and the visit to that guy's office happened magically when I was going to be out of the stuff. I should have counted my lucky stars. The low-level constant attack I was under finally got away when I was then put on CodeineContins 150mg + a generic percocet(oxycocet) 5mg on top of it all, like I had originally. The whole problem started from an obvious trauma I didn't do anything about the day I turned 18, cos you know, we all think we're invincible then! But then that jaw specialist retired without warning and yeah, the rest's history...

This is,  if it's going to be a long term thing like it has and always will be with me. Pregabalin is very effective for GAD, and a tolerance with a desire to keep getting high by taking more does not develop.  In clinical studies published on Pubmed over the past 10+ years, pregabalin is the ONLY drug which one will find being as effective for anxiety using both short and intermediate acting Benzos; not even SSRIs over the past 26 plus years share that distinction!

Pregabalin is newer and not as well studied but it does not get me high and make me want more and then to wish I could increase the dosage because it feels less effective. It may very well also turn out that pregabalin could dispose long term users with anxiety to a higher risk of Alzheimer's, but time will tell and in the meantime one does not need to struggle with Benzo tolerance issues. Plus, pregabalin's biggest side effect is weight gain, and having been there on other non addicting Meds in the past such as Triavil, I can say that the weight gain "urge" given from taking pregabalin is no where near as strong and uncontrollable as with a neuroleptic such as the trilafon and the tricyclic that are the two constituents of the 1960s non addicting anxiety creation called Triavil; nor strong at all like with Hydroxizine, and low levels of thioridazine... A few more as well but they also fall into the neuroleptic or tricyclic classes of drugs.

> If you need to be on an anxiolytic all the time and an SSRI will not do it all, as with myself, go the route of pregabalin before starting on a new Benzo( unless of course you just want to use the new Benzo as occasional "hamburger helper" for how messed up life can be with chronic anxiety!) Pregabalin is a C5 in the USA, BUT that's an overly cautious designation when compared to a C4 such as a Benzo. They might as well schedule Dextromethorphan as a C5 if they think that one will get high and abuse pregabalin

Not calling you a liar in any way, but I thought Clonazepam came out in 1994. Maybe only in Canada. Nevermind if so ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Having previously used 0.5mg clonazolam 3 or 4 times for sleep, I decided to take 0.5mg to help with cocaine comedown.


The following happened:


I took 0.5mg enroute to my own home during a car trip (I wasn't driving) thinking I'd be nice and relaxed and ready for sleep when I arrived home.


So I get home, sit down on the couch and indeed I felt relaxed, cozy, comfy and ready for some well deserved rest.


Then I craved a cigarette.


I get up and realize I'm walking funny... but ok... put my sunglasses on, make sure I have the correct ammount of money... and proceed to go out for cigarettes. All I remember next is just "flashes" of me staring at my legs "I'm fucked I can't walk straight" as I stumbled up my street not able to walk straight and walking in what I imagine was a drunkenly fashion.


I wake up some 7 hours later in my bed and only realize what I have done when I see a fresh pack of cigarettes on the table.


Can't remember actually buying them, last memories I have are "frames" of me not walking straight.


I hadn't touched a drop of alcohol during the night. I now assess 0.5mg clonalozam to be closer to 2mg clonazepam than the 1mg I had previously thought. I urge anyone not wanting to black out or have memory issues to take this into consideration.

last week I took 1mg one night, felt great, slept great and felt great the next day. Took 1mg the next night and woke up with a broken phone and no memory of what happened. Had to fork out 120 for a new one because I didn't have insurance and couldn't explain how the phone broke. Felt like such a fool and now have to taper down using pyrazolam. I have plenty experience with benzos even at silly doses and nothing like that has happened to me before. Dont get me wrong, clonazolam is one of it not the best benzo I've tried but it needs to be treated with the upmost respect!

Hi all,


I've been taking Etizolam for a while now (about 18 months) I was taking eight 1mg Etiz a day at one point. I got that down to 1mg 3 times a day for the last 6 months, and for the last month I've been taking 2 5mg Diazepam a day and 1-2 Eitiz 1mg a day. I'm pretty experienced with Benzo's I've tried most of them at some point. Anyway, with the recent drying up of the Etiz supply, and the fact I've run out of Diazepam I ordered 20 1mg clonazolam pellets. Does anyone know roughly what dose of clonazolam would be equal to 1mg of Etizolam? And, is clonazolam ok to use say twice daily at said dose? Thanks in advance.


Edit: I broke a 0.5mg clonazolam into half, and then half again, so I took a quarter of a 0.5mg pellet. It may have been a bit more than a quarter as I was using a pill splitter. Anyway an hour in, and this may be placebo, but I feel very calm, I don't feel like I need any Etiz or Diazepam. I don't feel tired and my muscles feel relaxed. Like I say this could be placebo with the low dose that I took. I took such a low dose just to be on the safe side, I thought if I feel like I need more in an hour I'll take another quarter. However, I don't feel the need to re-dose yet. I'm surprised if I'm honest, my benzo tolerance isn't massive, but it isn't extremely low either. It's a nice surprise to know I can get 4 doses out of one pill. I only bought 20 so these should last me a while. I'm trying to come off benzo's all together and I think these tablets may just be what I need to help taper down. I'm currently coming off of codeine phosphate though, so I need to kick that habit first. I'm down to 240mg codeine a day from over twice that, and starting next Monday I come down to 120mg codeine a day. I'm going to stick with a quarter of a 0.5mg clonazolam twice a day for now. I might increase my evening dose to half a 0.5mg. But once I'm off my codeine these clonazolam could very well help me kick my benzo habit too.

Heheh, this indeed can happen, I've got quite the benzo tolerance, but 2mg of clonazolam and 8mg of flubromazepam (about equivalent to the 30mg of valium and 1mg of xanax I take in a day) but packs more of a punch, for the first time since I was drinking like an idiot when I was in grade 11-12, I passed out vaping with my e-cig. If it had been a real cig I don't know if I would be typing this right now. Be careful not-so tolerant people. These things are made so that one pill/gelcap/pellet whatever should be enough for a benzo naive or someone with a low benzo tolerance (say someone scripted oxazepam 30mg every 4 hours or .25mg xanax twice a day as needed). 


I wish I was there, I really do. When the supposedly insanely strong flubromazolam doesn't knock me out under 1mg. Clonazolam doesn't knock me out, I find it very productive, like clonazepam was, I take it to start the day, usually 1mg and it allows for a completely stress-less day, even when things that piss me the fuck up like news. These Republicans trying to screw (illegally in many forms) the White House's efforts to have a deal with Iran (and the other powerful 5 countries, which they seem to ignore). FUCKING REPUGS, fighting against piece. Just look at who funds those who are doing thise, BOEING, of course, inventors of the very lame, not working as shown bunker buster bomb and the shitty F-35 I'm glad my country passed the offer, our F-18's with computers as strong as Commodore 64's can kill people just fine. 


Seriously, I doubt a war will happen under Obama's watch with Iran, but watch out, whoever the next President is, except maybe if it's Elizabeth Warren, she has great domestic policies but is totally ignorant and follows AIPAC to the letter. At least Nuts N Yahoo didn't bring his Wily E Coyote bomb from when he lied to the UN. Even Mossad is telling him that he's wrong. He better lose that election or else i'm getting off the bupe and shooting up Dillies and laugh my way into oblivion.

These things are potent, they don't have the calming effect that Etizolam does - that euphoria, that halo that engulfs you. Clonazolam killed anxiety dead for me, went into don't give a fuck mode with regard to other people - I'm avoidant and hate being around other people, it rarely happens because I'm a carer but I had to go out and was oblivious to the world around me. 


Good long sleep too, took one for two nights and still feel the effects several days later - not the good effects, what I took it for but I'm definitely recognizing some residual emotions with regard to taking it, if you have a seriously bad situation to deal with it might be a Godsend, otherwise Pyrazolam would be an safer option.


Seriously losing count of all these benzos hitting the market, so far nothing beats Etizolam though.

I encountered a major paradoxical effect from these hard! with no recollection other than a police account and parents, I was an obnoxious prick around the dinner table, then proceeded to storm out with my car I couldnt legally drive. Must have driven for 15-20 minutes and then passed out on the major road into bushland.caused a fire alongside my car and then ran into oncoming traffic. I cant remember a fucking thing. My lifes on fucking hold cause of these little fuckers.

I've been on and off benzos for years, when I've been admitted into the psychiatric hospital they've pumped me full of benzos for the first few weeks. I'm currently trying to cone of Etiz and a bit of Diazepam (see my earlier post) I think that the safest thing to do with these tablets; is to first read this WHOLE thread, second; Work your way up gradually by taking half of a 0.5 or even a quarter of a 0.5 like I did, then increase slowly until you reach a dose you feel comfortable with. Even if this takes a few day's to work out it's worth the effort. I started off taking a quarter of one of these pellets the day I purchased them, followed by another quarter before bed. For me, personally, these pills are too strong. I woke up the morning after taking my first 2 doses and felt very wobbly and my thoughts were very cloudy, I felt relaxed but not in a therapeutic kind of way if that makes any sense. If you're going to try these just start off slowly and work your way up.

Etizolam was never special to me, and I can get it in powder form. It only really gave me a special euphoria when tongue-dosing when down in the dumps after a 48 hour dexedrine sex binge with my ex girlfriend. It was so overwhelmingly positive and all my body had this glow. Other than that, my legal scripts are more fun than etizolam (diazepam 10mg twice a day, xanax 1mg at bed time).

Glad you're ok and nothing more serious happened and I agree with your sentiments. This is meant to be a harm reduction forum primarily, so people need to know as much about the potential effects / side-effects as possible.


There needs to be a greater variety of dosages when it comes to something as strong as this (or Flubromazolam which imo is unnecessary). Personally I find 0.5 lovely. I've been taking them for over a month now and although it's guaranteed I've built up a bit of a tolerance (have had 2mg over the course of the day as it's a weekend) but there is clearly a need to have the pills pressed more professionally so each half contains 0.25, or just make them at that dose. I'm assuming funds are an issue when it comes to things like this. Getting 0.5mg pressed right is clearly an issue (definite inconsistency with some pellet brands) so 0.25 would be even more tricky.


Overall I'm still very happy with this substance, but I am slightly concerned regarding my regular use. If I've been doing between 0.5-1.5mg every day for a month or so (and will probably continue to do so) does this mean that if I stop the withdrawal will be life threatening or will I just feel shit for a week or so? Ideally I'd prefer not to die if at all possible.

After reading this thread and others SWIM went for it and ordered some from Sweden.  Effects were good the first day of research, what you would come to expect for this category of research. However 48 hours after the effects wore off, un-welcomed anxiety and depersonalization. Everyone is different I realize, this was my experience. This effect is not something that has typically come up in SWIM's research.  Fair warning.

Tapper off slow.  SWIM did ONE .5mg pellet.  36 hours after effect wore off, felt very weird - dizzy, anxiety, depersonalization.  Recommend having a "stand by" when you stop these things.  SWIM had bizarre after effects.   Everyone is different though, diff. brain chemistry.  Tossed my 59 pellets down the drain, moving on to something else.  SWIM didn't have a stand by, ended up going to a local vitamin grocer, picking up some Ashwagandha, 5HTP, and GABA to ease anxiety.  Good luck.

I'm in England so getting a benzo from the Doctor is impossible, if I asked for Xanax he would laugh me out of his office, think it's only available on private prescription because of it's notoriety.

I started last Monday....but now that I'm sober and out of this stuff...I kind of forgot what this job even entails.

SWIM had bizarre after effects.   Everyone is different though, diff. brain chemistry.  Tossed my 59 pellets down the drain, moving on to something else.  SWIM didn't have a stand by, ended up going to a local vitamin grocer, picking up some Ashwagandha, 5HTP, and GABA to ease anxiety.  Good luck.

When you say "something else" or "stand by" do you mean a longer acting benzo such as Diclazepam?


Thanks for the advice. What are the benefits of the Ashwagandha, 5HTP, and GABA you used? My knowledge isn't very good when it comes to things like this.

Is this a trick to get me to admt it was me who ordered them or have they generally looked past it? Vendor did say he was sending a freebie for my continued service so i assumed ethylphen or MXP or something that was taken out. From what I can see, even though analogue laws are against it, they don't seem to mind clonitraz. I am very suss at the moment. Any insights?

Floored by .5mg here after a short break from them! Please be careful with these tablets if you dont have much tolerance. 


Perhaps the vendors should offer a .25mg version.

I definitely recommend vendors to press .25mg pellets; .5mg Clonazolam is way to much for a benzo-naive person.

Sorry to go on a bit, but has anybody else niticed heavy sedation, which is almost unpleasant, in the first few hours of taking clonazolam which then subsides and is followed by euphoria and the anxiolytic  effects which make it geeat for general anxiety and recreation? 


I was literally stuck to the sofa but am now feeling all wobbly and the warmness in the back of my head.

Yeah this is the only potential downside to them. The first few hours can be tiring, but once you're over that hump they're very functional. Likewise this can be a problem when trying to sleep. If you have one an hour before getting into bed (or while in bed) it's fine but if you take one too early then you'll be up all night on an adventure you'll probably not remember....


The yellow capsules seem to be the smoothest in regards to these initial effects. The capsule itself and the bulk content must act almost like a time release mechanism. It's either that or a placebo effect caused by the fact they were the first type I researched and so I treat them as a benchmark. Only other type I have encountered which comes close are the green vendor pressed pills.


Like itsonlyme123 and iMatriX have mentioned, vendors should really consider pressing 0.25 pellets / capsules. I've seen a few people mention that they've been splitting pills in half or quarters but there is really no point in doing this. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong but unless these vendors have access to some very sophisticated / expensive equipment then there is no way that the 0.5 dose present in each pill is dispersed evenly.

It would also mean that pills vary a lot in the quantity of the active ingredient, with a 0.5mg being so small even to such an extent that some pills could contain no active ingredient and some had way more than 0.5mg. I suppose one could start with mixing the same amount of the active ingredient and binders, mix them thoroughly, then add more binders, mix again, and so on, and so on.

Unfortunately they are not at all water soluble from what i can gather, so you cant even put a pill in 5ml water and dose it that way.

got clonazolam, yellow chunky looking substance, sticks to the bag far too much a substance bought in such small amounts. (although that was generously compensated for) after allergy test which I think was actually slightly active I weighed out 3 mg (very benzo tolerant, 10 mg clonazepam) and took it, much stronger taste than etizolam. Slower come up but heavier buzz with more euphoria that tends to build over 3-5 hours before leveling off. This could be a disaster in the wrong hands.

This may be a lengthy report but I think an honest report on my experience’s with Benzo’s and how I came across this particular Benzo Clonazalam may help people make choices. The report contains information on taking various benzo’s and my experience of Clonazalam is towards the end of the report as it’s a rather new one on the market.

15 years ago, my Mother passed away and I went through a lengthy period of anxiety and sleeping problems. This was causing me sever problems at work due to lack of sleep and I sought help from my Dr.

He prescribed me 20mg doses of Temazapam for a long period of time. I started building a tolerance to this and he kept increasing the doses until it stopped working. On the arrival of a new Dr to the surgery my medication was reviewed and I was called in to discuss it.

The Dr was not happy to continue with my medication and tapered me off although once off it, I started getting very bad withdrawal and rebound insomnia. I made numerous trips to see him and he eventually swapped me over to Zopiclone. At that time the long term effects of Zopiclone were not known and it was considered a safe drug with no dependency. Boy were they wrong. When the Dr finally came to tapering me off Zopiclone I had bad withdrawal symptoms and was literally crawling the walls. The Dr Then started me on low doses of Diazapam which helped but I still wanted Zopiclone. I eventually discovered you could buy them cheap from the internet and so entered a new and rather dangerous period. A lot of my friends also suffering from sleeping problems were ordering these on line. 

I had convinced my Dr that I no longer needed anything and carried on ordering on line. Eventually the long term effects of Zopiclone become known and they were slowly withdrawn from importing to the UK. I had purchased a large amount but was very concerned about running out.

My friends had started to discover Etizolam and I started buying them. These helped me get off Zopiclone and I liked the euphoric effects. They were very good at helping my panic attacks. On receiving the news that they were being withdrawn I was feeling really concerned. I was scared to re-vast my Dr and purchased a large quantity in advance.

This site has helped me with advice from other users which are why I want to share my experience’s. 

I tried Flubromazipam and Nifoxipam. I didn’t notice a lot of difference with Flubromazipam but have found Nifoxipam to be quite helpful as the doses are very low. The prices are reasonable and although they don’t have the euphoric effects that Etizolam have they do help with panic attacks and sleeping at a very a low dose. 

I recently tried Clonazalam which is quite pricey so I bought a few to try. I found these measured up in potency to Etizolam Very euphoric results in about 30 minutes. Sleep comes for at least 8 hours on 0.5mg tablet. Be very careful with this one. I had no memory of doing anything for 24 hours after taking this. Rebound insomnia for 3 days after taking my last one. 

I don’t want to suffer any more effects of withdrawal and have now gone back to Nifoxipam. I only require 1 x 0.5mg tablet to help me with panic attacks and I find sleep comes naturally, as the panic attacks were causing me not to sleep. I don’t have to take these every night only when a panic attack comes on. I know everyone is different but I am hoping my experiences can help people make a choice. I think I am nearing the time now that I won’t need anything to help me sleep as I’m taking less and less in order to do so. The light of the tunnel is approaching.

So I tried 0,5mg Clonazolam yesterday and was fairy impressed. The effects started ~10min after sublingual administration and got stronger for about an hour.

Very anxiolytic and relaxing. Sedation was ok since I had a coffee inbetween but I guess higher doses would just knock me out cold.


Definitely more wothwile recreational wise than Diclazepam and Pyrazolam. Now to compare this with Flubromazolam.

These bad boys are too strong IMO, but I love them, everyone who tried one loved it and prefer them to diazepam. best ones out there don't waste your time  with flubromazolam, these have most recreational value of any benzo I reckon.

probably increased sedation depending on what dose of mirtazipine you are on

propranolol should have no major interactions

Hey I'm not taking Venlafaxine (SNRI) but I'm taking something kinda close being Zoloft (SSRI). 


Im also prescribed mirtazapine for sleep as i wake up multiple times every night. I went on for years like this until i saw a Dr.. Now i am on both meds I'm feeling alot better in many ways. 

This stuff is great for stopping me waking up multiple times in the night and if i do i can now fall back asleep much easier.

I only wake up once now sometimes and thats usually to go to the washroom. Usually i couldn't sleep after something like that now i can and wow so good to feel that now after years of hating my life because of getting no sleep every night. 


I wish i could use it every night but i just wake up the next day so groggy, out of it and this feeling carries on until the day is over -_-  so i don't use it every night as prescribed. Just when i need a good rest after a hectic week. So maybe once or twice a week. I only use half a pill - one makes me sleep for like 50 hours lol. Or if i woke up i would be drowsy all day. Half a pill already makes me kinda out of it and groggy. 


Ive also tried trazadone but found I still woke up in the night constantly. Nothing had changed when i was on trazadone as needed. Although it helped me sleep initially (something i don't usually have a problem with though) I couldn't get back to sleep still just like if i was on no medication. I kinda felt out of it too the next day. However, Trazadone didn't give me grogginess to the extent that mirtazipne does. 


After looking at all the drugs for insomnia and how often I actually use insomnia medication (as little as i can - Try and go to bed early instead) I decided the day after I used some mitazipine for sleep (and feeling so lethargic because of it) to obtain some clonazolam. 


If typical insomnia compounds don't work then benzos seemed to be the best "when needed" (NOT abused or taken often) medication for sleep from what I've researched. And "when needed" for me was once or twice a week if that. 

You have to have will power or you have to hate damaging your brain. I hated the brain damage part lol - I've seen too many people become complete bimbos from abusing benzos/ not using them in a medical fashion and i shall not be one of them. 


Why did i do this ? 

Well i know benzos are awful and its known they pretty much destroy your cognitive function if used regularly. 

However i need to use something like this once a week. So i figured it should be okay.... I hope lol. 


Anyways....

 Received my clonazolam. Looked like clonazepam lol.

I dont have that high of a benzo tolerance. Im not stupid and dont eat benzos up lol like candy smh. So I took half of a 0.5 tablet at first. Waited an hour. 

Not much. Slight mood elevation? I was already pretty happy though that day. 

So i pop another whole one. 

Feel kinda wobbly. Went outside. Felt kinda drunk Typical benzo feel in my opinion. No euphoria but body is nicely relaxed too, everything is calmer but you also feel stupid as fuck and kinda sleepy and apathetic... Music sounds meh. I decided to Smoke a j. Usually music sounds good with weed but not so much right now. 

Typical feeling of taking clonazepam but less sleepyness and muscle relaxation in my opinion.  Nothing recreational unless your in a small town or something and literally cant find anything else lol. The only benzo I've kind of enjoyed recreationally was xanax and even that wasn't that great. 


Not really a benzo person and imo would recommend you use opiates recreationally and sparingly instead if your looking for a high close to a euphoric, recreational benzo. 


HOWEVER. Im sure benzos do have medical/non recreational purposes and I along others have experienced them at times. 

For covering up extreme anxiety problems, attacks, phobias, insomnia, tapering etc. 

I have yet to feel recreational effects of benzos though... 

I myself have used the rest of the batch of the clonazolam sparingly as a substitute for mirtazapine aka remron . Using about once a week for a sleep. The rest of the time i try and go without pills and just sleep early, or deal with it. 


I get up more times in the night vs mirtazapine but i can still get to bed pretty fast from clonazolam. So i dont miss out on that much sleep like when I'm sober. When I'm sober its really hard to fall back asleep even after years of trying without medications goddamit. 


Despite waking up in the night more with clonazolam, compared to mirtazapine this doesn't make me nearly as lethargic the next day. Which is the only reason i am using it to be honest. I really hate the fact that I'm even using benzos but fuck i need a good sleep sometimes after days of not having one. Even though i feel that benzos give me the better sleep, according to studies though (which i can link if you like) benzos worsen your sleep and mirtazapine doesnt. Some think mirtazapine can even enhance sleep efficiency. 


Overall clonazolam should only really appeal to anyone who needs it for legitimate medical reasons. It doesn't really have any recreational properties in my opinion.

It enhances some drugs but thats not advised. Thats poly drug use and clonozolam is already bad for you as it is. Lets not forget its serious damage to the brain and memory even if used properly.   


And to answer the question - No there should not be any interaction. However their effects can be synergistic i guess if you're mixing drugs. 

As a result you might experience things like increased drowsiness from the more meds your taking, or perhaps more energy because you have more meds. Everyone reacts different. But id imagine some sort of synergy between all the drugs. Not sure if it would be meh or pleasant. Shouldn't be bad though.


So yeah there is an "interaction" technically but not a dangerous one. However you should discuss it with your Dr. still.  

I just say that its probably safe as many people are prescribed or using Benzodiazepines whilst going through SSRI or SNRI treatment including me and many other people on this forum.

yes they should be more than fine. 

If i were you i would try ordering a weaker benzos at first. This one is quite strong . 

And my oh my i bet lots will vouch for me here when i say that benzo tolerance is precious when you have it. When you have it try and keep it. 'Stay at the lowest dose that does it for you as long as possible . Dont be stupid and eat a bunch of them with no tolerance .

So many other drugs i take a few month break from using and I'm back to how it was in the beginning. Benzos never lol. Miss that. 


So just be careful. 

And make sure you're only doing it for reasonable purposes and please consider the consequences of benzo use such as rebound effects, and brain damage to cognitive functions such as your memory. 


I cant really tell you not to do them as i do them myself but it seems you are new to them. Not worth it b . Seeing this is harm reduction and all.

I think ive found myself addicted to these bloody things. How long would it take to start getting the withdrawals after the last dose? It could also be from the ghb though, but it feels different to ghb withdrawal.

I don't know much about the chemical properties of the drug itself, but judging from it's half-life (and what I'm assuming is a high lipophilicity judging from it's onset), you might start having dt symptoms 12-16 hours after using if you're a very heavy, high dose user (like equivalent to double digit mg daily Xanax dosing), perhaps 24 hours after, but you would probably be in full dt's by the 36 hour mark.

Currently coming off these after two months of moderate use. Was taking 2 – 5 per day (5 in very rare occasions, 2 more usually) and for the last few days had only been taking 1 per day. It's currently 40 hours since my last dose and so far have not experienced many negative side effects during withdrawal. Had slight problems sleeping last night, and feel a bit unmotivated and dizzy, but nothing approaching some of the horror stories I've heard in regard to similar w/d's.


I'm going to leave it til 48 hours then have another dose, then try not to take anything for 72 hours and see what happens. Maybe I'm being over-cautious but I'm inexperienced when it comes to benzos and I'd like to mitigate the more serious potential side effects if at all possible.

My reasons for staggering the doses as I have been doing is to decrease the likelihood of seizures and other such fuckery if at all possible. I'm not even sure that the amount I have been taking + the 2 month duration of me taking it is so severe that this is even necessary. If someone on here could give me a clear answer that stopping cold turkey wouldn't lead to something serious happening then I'd be happy to do it. Genuinely not bothered about feeling shitty for a while or even a long time, I just don't want to die if at all possible.  Also I don't feel like I'm mentally addicted to them (as I have been in the past) as I have no craving to do them, like I said I just don't want to have a serious / terminal physical reaction to stopping them.


However, there is also the possibility that I am mentally addicted and just talking myself into taking / managing them more effectively. The reason I feel I have been taking it regularly is that it's had a genuine positive effect on me in terms of my mental health, but I learnt a while ago that it's not helpful to be the sole judge over your own thought processes. When I smoked nicotine daily I was convinced it was helping me relax when in fact it was stressing me out, when I smoked weed before bed I was convinced it was helping me sleep when it was actually waking me up etc

I'm getting the biggest hard on reading this thread.. Oblivion, hit me up lol not often I find such a like minded Canadian on the net.. Anyhow, I plan on hunting myself down some of this Clonazolam as soon as humanly possible, my story with benzos is shockingly similar, down to the daily clonazepam dose we ended up on, and the holy grail that is Valium saved my ass (and a generous methadone maintenance doctor), but I'm lucky enough that he took my vitals, bloodwork, urinalysis (to make sure I wasn't the cause of my own anxiety via stimulants), and the rebound withdrawal anxiety from the 170mg methadone dose into account, and gave me 30mg diazepam/day. This is apparently an anomaly for this doctor/clinic, as I've actually been harassed and almost robbed of my medications upon leaving the building, because "nobody else gets special treatment" (really, the majority of these people are there solely to get high and don't understand why the doctor cuts them off after witnessing them fill the prescription, walk out the door and immediately sell or trade it, as many of you know MMT clinics run on reward systems for good behaviour and adherence to clinic rules). Anyhow, back on topic.

^^ Takes between an hour to three to kick in fully and then lasts between 8-15 hours. Personally Id say I prefer Clonazolam to either Valium or Etizolam but others will probably disagree.

I didn't end up taking a dose at 48 hours as I felt I could sleep without it and I think I experienced the worst of any negative side effects between the 40-50 hour mark (sudden pangs of anxiety, general sense of unease / dread). Going to leave it for another few days before I think about taking another dose just to make sure its out my system.

This is a wonderful benzodiazepine, and *Clonazolam* is my first taste of benzodiazepine use in years. My curiosity led me to purchase some of the blotters, as I currently lack a microgram scale, and attempting to eye-ball the dosage of a chemical that's incredibly active in even the microgram (µg) range seemed a little too much like tempting fate to lead me to homelessness, loneliness and unemployment.


After carrying out some research and placing an order, 100 pieces of blotter paper arrived and I waited until I had an evening free with nobody else around. Using scissors, I cut the small square, advertised as a 1000µg dose in half and then chewed it slightly before balling it into a soft, gummy ball and swallowing it. The piece of paper had a distinctly benzodiazepine-like taste - though *not* the pleasantly minty flavour I recall from my thorough use of clonazepam in the past.


I laid back on my sofa and got stuck into coding, occasionally glancing at the muted television in the background, which was showing a documentary I had only a passing interest in watching. Now, after approximately an hour had passed, I realized that I'd rather quickly become incredibly relaxed. Also, my feet and legs were actually tingling! This may be common, I do not know, but I've seldom experienced a drug-induced physical sensation rise any higher than my hips, lest it was a powerful opioid or a very large dose. It was very pleasant, and almost euphoric. I had never found benzodiazepines to offer anything remotely euphoric before, and I've a *lot* of experience with this family of drugs, used for their anxiolytic purposes.


The following morning, I awoke to discover that the drug was still producing minor sedation and relaxation. It's a pleasant chemical, but powerful, like a hammer. I'd rather slip into a warm bath these days than be knocked out with a mallet! %)


Perhaps when I've some more free time, I'll consider dosing again, but until then I'll be keeping this locked away safely!

The effects start ~10min after sublingual administration and get stronger for a longer period of time. You dont have to crush the pellet. It will dissolve fine.

Also do not take 2. One 0,5mg was definitely enough for me and I had a small tolerance. These are very potent, especially regarding lowering your inhibitions and memory impairment.

And do not drink any alcohol^^

Agree with this. Even if your tolerance is moderate it would be better to try 1 x 0.5 for your first time just to get a sense of the effects. When I tried 2 x 0.5 for the first time it floored me.

Hmm. I'll make note of that trying low, even though I have quite a general GABA tolerance. I was thinking 1mg to start, but better on the safe side. Just gonna have to be strict and not end up like I was with diclazepam taking a 35mg dose daily.

There's a bitch of a hangover if you take to much. Getting the dose right with this one has been difficult compared to others out there. I'd not make any plans for first thing in the AM. Esp if you redose. I'm still kind out of it 24 hrs after a pretty big dose, started at 1- ended at around 5-mg. That's a stupid, insane dose. I'd keep it under 1-mg until you know how it affects you.

Yeah I'll be starting out with .5mg sublingual. Planning to make a 1mg/ml PG solution and use a 1ml oral syringe for dosing. I've read that sublingual comes on in ~10min then keeps building. Any word on when peak effects are felt? Still would wait things out before attempting to up the dose though.

Thinking about ordering some, but unsure about how to dose these. My benzodiazepine/barbiturate tolerance is atrocious. My normal dosing of Xanax is 10-15mg at a time, and my normal dosing of butalbital is 500-1000mg at once. Have taken a gram and a 500mg of Butalbital in a day before along with 600mg of Temazepam and large doses of NMDA antagonists in the past.


Suggestions to dosing these with a monster tolerance?

Sorry if this has been asked and answered before. I couldn't be assed to read the thread. Anyway, how does this one compare to clonazepam proper? If there is any resemblance at all. I mean, structurally they aren't that similar, so it seems to me to mostly be the names that sound the same. Meclonazepam would be a closer analog to clonazepam anyway. But yeah, how do they compare anyway.


Also, what is the muscle relaxation like? I know all benzo's have it, but non in the degree that clonazepam does. It's the king of muscle relaxation imo. Would be nice if some one could compare the degree of muscle relaxation of clonazolam to another well known benzo.

Has anyone noticed this produces a "floral" smell after you've taken it? It might just be a coincidence, but both me and my partner are convinced that it's due to the Clonazolam. It's not a bad smell in the slightest, but if the Clonazolam is causing it then surely that's very strange for a benzo?

Yo great volkes of bluelight! I'm fully clonazoSLAMMEd right now, been for like the last 5 days....euphoric as hell...starting to talking this amazing girl name Christy ...uhhh she doesn't condone the biochemical reactions I choose to conduct under my skin. the only way I know how to have fun is to fill up my veins, my blood and my lungs ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


be good people!!! and treat this stuff with respect. I'd say .5 clonazolam = around 1.35 clonazepam.

I would imagine not as no other benzodiazepine has any sort of rush when administered intravenously. It's just instantaneous effects with a shorter duration of action, and a higher peak plasma level.

Benzos affect people very differently. Thats why some get KO'd by some Xanax and others get energetic from Flunitrazepam.

So you just cant generalize that Clonazolam or Temazepam are not sedatives. They are very powerful hypnotics *for most people* and the 0815-not drug user would very likely be fucked up as hell by 1mg Clonazolam and 1 litre of beer. I know I would. I'd even not dare to drink one beer on this.

Hell I was out of my mind after only 0,5mg with a low tolerance and asked myself the next day if I really did this and that...


There is a good reason why many people here rate these as very strong.

The previous poster was insinuating that the lack of sedation was due to having a high tolerance, which is not the case. I'm not generalizing, just saying that in my personal experience these aren't too sedative, and it isn't due to massive tolerance.

Clonazolam, like most benzodiazepines, is not water soluble. Snorting is a waste. Oral BA is extremely high and onset isn't that long either.

How do you know that the oral BA is high? There haven't been any studies on this Benzodiazepine derivative. Yes, most are over 90%, but Triazolam and Midazolam oral BA is 50% and 30-ish% respectively.

And would 2-3mg really be enough of a starting dose for me considering my Benzodiazepine/Barbiturate tolerance? Just took 500mg of Butalbital, and not hardly zonked at all. The NMDA-antagonism does have my face somewhat numb though. And while at low doses, 50mg of Butalbital is supposedly equivalent to 1mg of Alprazolam, but at higher doses, it's strength increases. Feels like I'm at about 12-15mg of Alprazolam, but 1,500mg makes me feel like I'm at about 40-50mg.

Got a bunch of .5mg yellow capsules today.  Took 1mg and an hour later  was very sedated but drank a strong cuppa coffee and was fine.  Felt  very mellow and NO anxiety.  Later in the evening took two more, had  more coffee, went downtown and saw a movie.  No memory issues.  Nine  hours after the initial dose, still feel really mellow.  I have a high  cross tolerance to benzos because I am a recovering alcoholic but this  stuff is mint for anxiety.  However, not everyone has my tolerance and I  can see how this shit could really wreck you if you took too much.   Will use this sparingly.  In my estimation, .5mg is the equivalent to  about 1.75-2 mg of clonazepam, so it's pretty potent stuff.  Pleasantly  surprised.

I had 3 of the 0.5 pellets last week and have nothing but positive things to say. Ate them on an empty stomach so the onset was about 45 minutes to an hour. Felt very relaxed, very heavily anxiolytic feeling of euphoria and that wonderful wobbly leg syndrome as I like to call it 2 hours later I had 4 more (my benzo and triazo tolerance is a lot higher than it should be. Never really felt very sleepy just calm and euphoric. Duration was about 21/22/ hours. A very pleasant experience, up there with alprazolam and of course clonazepam. I avoided all other substances apart from nicotine so i could really get a feel and give an accurate report. I would recommend them highly. Now of course if some of these posts are correct then they are a lot stronger then clonazepam and as zodiac speaking says if you have a low tolerance then be careful.

Hey guys...I made a thread about this on the reference board but figured I might get a faster answer here. 


So heres my story... I have taken clonazepam sporadically over the last 4-5 months. Besides only a few times I have taken usually less than .5mg at a time. I haven't really kept track of how often I've used unfortunately, I just know it has not been a daily thing. I was also taking ambien during this time, but I've taken it for long periods in the past and have had no withdrawal from coming off of it other than some rebound insomnia. Ran out about a week ago and haven't felt any sort of withdrawal from it. Recently I've been going about 3 days between doses or more, never really felt like I was withdrawing between doses. I am coming off of a 4 year long kratom habit, and am finally starting to feel much better again, but now I am starting to worry about this. I know it is kind of of hard to tell, but do you think I will experience any withdrawal? The last time I took it was Monday around 1 or 2 pm. I'll be coming up to 72 hours soon and am feeling pretty normal for the most part. Maybe a little anxiety, but that could be attributed to me worrying about this. How long do withdrawals from kpins usually take to begin? Thanks guys. Appreciate any help I can get here.

How do you do that, IV benzo? PG solution? Not interested either way.


Dumb question: if I leave 150mg clonazolam/15mL PG solution vial with a shitty foil lid cuz I lost it, does the clonazepam or PG evaporatequickler? This could leave an unsuspected supprise visit to wade into.


I started out with 2 sublingual, felt nice and elated, not much sedation (as expected). I wanted to up my dose and see I could hit some sedation (HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED), woke up with 2/3 150mg gone, a lost cap to vial, mild panic, made tinfoil makeshift passed out. Woke up with maybe a few ml left. I was stupid... sticking to the proper way next time around in a couple days once my receptors have a break.Curious how much is left int there...transported it to a proper container. This started on the 30th and I can still feel anxiolytic action to this point as I would with 2-3mg.


Again, play safe!

I must have had a bad vendor. I've got minimal tolerance and 1,5mg of this did pretty much sweet fuck all. Maybe I felt something, but weak enough for me to entertain that it was placebo. If you guys call this stuff strong then I got shafted. Weird; their etizolam was still solid not long ago.


I also ordered flubromazolam from the same vendor. 0,75mg - if I felt something, it was like I'd had a 0,5mg Xanax, no more. Two friends confirmed them as inactive in bioassays. God dammit.

To me clonazolam, if it doesn't come from small yellow gelcaps, is not worth it.

I'm hoping to give it another go, and have the vial out of my control with a like minded user wi- d-wsn't dare for benzos, bur able to work in daily dosing. Camt evem get in a car now, leave the deary, post accident. I'd prefer to be on a more controllagvle benzo, kpin i guess, just onw with longer half life. The first 1HR I remember of it was so FUN.. and ive done all the name brands minus kpim, etiz/diclaz too

Hey, so with FlubromazePAM it is normal since that Benzo takes a few hours to really kick in. As far as I know the sublingual onset does not vary from person to person but of course from different Benzos.

With Clonazolam I can feel it after ~10minutes but the peak is much later, also a few hours in.

But as I mentioned these Triazolo-Analogues are just so ridiculous regarding memory loss and amnesia. Like Professor said, I'd prefer some controllable Benzo as well.

These are just too strong and have massive abuse and blackout potential.

Had 3x0.5 today, can't say I'm too impressed i haden't done Benzo's in well over a year to last week but i did take a lot of both flubs last week so that could be the reason, or maybe because im tired from the gym, who knows

I do seem to feel them much more when im layed in bed watching TV rather than playing video games on my PC though EDIT- Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh, i had a earlymorning 6AM workout which fucked me up real bad, and every time i have a coffee and wake up a bit i start to feel these a lot more and feel no anxiety and general good mood, maybe it's because i use to take 8mg of Etiz a day a few years ago, so do not judge these on what i have posted!, ok my final dose has finally kicked in and now i feel great, i do not reccomend talomg 3x0.5 this just must be MY sweespot, i seem to have no loss of motor control or anything like that though, they just don't dissolve sub sub-lingual well at all

I've been using etizolam in low doses of 1-1.5 mg for anxiety about 2-4 days a week and occasionally more than that. 

It works pretty well but it's effects only last for around 3 hours and I haven't been redosing in order to limit tolerance. So would I be better off (in terms of limiting tolerance and dependence) redosing etiz in the afternoon or ordering clonazolam and taking a small dose of ~.25 mg in the morning that will last most of the day

Just wanted to add to the conversation that my experience thus far is that the yellow gelcaps seem legit.  Waiting on another package now, but my experience with the first was great.  I seem to be pretty sensitive to the sedative effects of Xanax and Clonazepam, and I think it's similar with Clonazolam, but sometimes that's not a bad thing (I often have insomnia).  However, if I take it with coffee or an energy drink, I can power through the initial sedation and after about an hour (so about 2 hours after initial dosing) I'm fine, and feel great.  Tolerances vary greatly with benzos, but I feel it would be accurate to say that .5mg of this stuff is on par with ~1.5-2mg of Xanax or Clonazepam.  But I haven't had any weird blackouts or doing anything I regret while taking it, just a very relaxing chill that lasts for hours.  Friends that have tried it have either said the same or that they just fell asleep within the first hour of it kicking in.  When I get my next shipment I plan on taking it before going to the gym, actually.  I've been out of going for months after breaking my foot late last year and my routine in the past (during which I managed to lose 25 pounds in about 4 months), I'd take benzos or Zolpidem on my way to the gym (walking), and then do about 20 minutes cardio and 45-60 minutes lifting and it just made the whole experience fly by and seem I dunno, more FUN.  I'd be curious to hear anyone's opinion about this sort of bizarre behavior; I guess it might sound weird to some but it's worked for me in the past.

I ordered 10 x 0.5. A bit curious. I received some dark pink tablets. I noticed that the vendor had only sent 9 and a half so I decided to take the half as soon as they arrived. It dissolved in my mouth quite quickly. Tasted salty. 8pm: I'm sat watching tv with my partner, I feel relaxed...content. Smiles.  I start nodding off. I'm in and out of consciousness. One moment immersed in the TV show, the next minute walking on the moon with an imaginary dog named Kevin. It continues like this - awake, dream, awake, dream, awake, until all I can think of is bed, so I excuse myself and sleep til morning. I feel quite good the next day, breeze through with no worries. I've not taken it since, although I plan to tonight. God knows what 0.5 will do to me, hahaha. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) . I must say though: on the evening I took half, I'd had a really busy day and I felt tired anyway, but I never nod off like that, especially when I'm watching a fave programme. I'm not sure I could use this during the day ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Btw, I'm a benzo lightweight - as you can tell, and I do take 600mg lyrica per day...

Will this stuff go into some 80 proof dark rum fairly easily? I've read the solubility is good in PG and 190% ethanol but I'm broke right now and already have the rum on hand. Anyone made a solution with 40% liquor?

Youre getting tolerance. Flub, the RC one I know at least, has a MASSIVE half life. too, I think. It could likely still being eliminated from your system. Taake a break or dose more safely. Former recommended.. also do sublingual ROA. I hear oral takes hours to kick in. Never tried it, I can attest for this stuff being awesome. Dont alprazolam, diazepam, diclazepam, etizolam, the flub RC and recently clonazolam. For euphoric benzos, clonazolam alll day. I cant wait to make my 10mg/mL PG solution and start dosing up by 1mg incriments. Also have a gram of etiz coming in the mail tomorrow too. CLonazolam was a ocmpulsive redoser for me, hence the blackout, Severe se controll this tine.


Ive never seen anywhere that sells pellets or blotters... just find pure powder or premade PG solutins, but I prefer to do my own to know I'm getting, say, 150mg in a bottle. When my guy sent my a sample of this powder he just got with my 1g diclazepam order, shit was off the hook. Loved the high the first days, the other two were blackness.

Bad batch? Im such a huge fan of this benzo, maybe try a different source.I had no hangover after my 3 day binge... actually still was feeling it some and blocked out the 250mg propylhexedrine i took later that day for a while. OTC meth analog if you didnt know.


I find it weird people start with .25 and .5mg and get sufficient effects. I had no benzo tolerance when I got mine (did have solid GABAb tolly from phenibut) 1mg of the solution I made from powder was fine, then I upped to 1mg more (all sublingual ) to get to my happy place. Then the comulsive to redose lead to prbolems. It's so fun using a 1cc oral syringe man. I wonder how this stuff would work rectally, but it numbed my mouth and I need my feelin down there,

I remembered that I forgot to take lyrica last night so the sickness may have been caused by that.


I went back to bed this morning and things have been good since. I actually feel quite chilled today

 I'll try it again in a few days.


Edit: I lay in bed all morning falling in and out of hynagogic reverie. Then I got dressed and lay in the garden pulling out weeds. I feel absolutely at peace with the world. I think it must be a lyrica/clonaz combo. I could be floating...


Strong urge to re-dose, but half is more than enough for someone with no tolerance. 


It's f**king potent!!

I've got 10 clonaz coming tomorrow (yeaaa!)


Managed to blag 14 zopiclone off my GP last week and have taken them since Friday....Sometimes it would take me two to get to sleep then I would wake up 4/5 hours later and have another. I also tested taking a couple of small doses during the day time for my anxiety. 


I don't rate zopiclone at all, I'm sure ambien is much better as far as z-drugs go.


Is this gunna have cross tolerance with the clonazolam I'm getting tomorrow?


Pisses me off that I seem to have a massive natural tolerance to benzo's....I've never had a habit with them or even taken them on the regular like weeks at a time however doses that should affect me simply don't. 


I'd say I indulged every week or so for just a day or two at most but sometimes I don't bother at all, however only for the first time using benzos did I feel them at smaller doses. I will be able to take this whole bag of ten clonaz tomorrow and hardly be affected, takes the piss.

So my new batch, I must be getting tolerance, cuz I mdeamy typical PG solutions with em, I dosed reepatedly ip to 10mg clonazolam and 25mg etiz oral, just felt a little tired.


Nothing like that first batch I astes a couple weeks back. I had a big of diclazepam since then, black oout and broke my vials (tragedy, I know), Im buble wraping them now.


One important question for dosing ROA. I hear oral takes a while to kick in while sublingual shits in 10mins then grows. Do I need to hold tat shit under my toungue the whole time? I cant talk or anything while holding liquid under there.

Now that I've had these lying around for a while now and I've experimented with lots of doses I can say that these really are very potent little benzos! I've got yellow 0.5mg pellets from a large UK vendor. I have a decent bit of experience with benzos but have never been dependent and do not have any tolerance. For me 0.5mg is actually too much and causes pretty bad amnesia and strong sedation that last up to 24 hours. Normal dose for me is a quarter to half a pellet (0.125-.25mg) and is sufficient to knock me out after a night out on stims (0.125 if I've been drinking, 0.25 if I haven't). On a normal week day even a "crumb" (roughly 1/8th of a 0.5mg pellet) produces notable effects that go great with a hit of cannabis or so, I can sleep very easily on this amount and notice little hangover effects the next day. A quarter pellet on the other hand will leave me feeling a little groggy upon first waking and a bit forgetful in the mornings (larger doses are worse). I'd have preferred if these didn't have such a long half-life, but all in all they are very cost effective and do what I want them to (give me sleep after stimulant use).

^^ Jesus, I hope english is a second language for you, well it is for now... Likely you're still ripped. Clonazolam effects last a relatively long time - well into the next day for me, at just 1-mg I'm too impaired to do much of anything safely for at least the morning, and sometimes into the late afternoon. It's not something I'd take more than once in a while. Tolerance seems to build quickly to the subjective effects, but the poor coordination and fatigue, etc... carry on regardless the dose, ime.


The powder is not to be fucked with, definitely as many, many times b/f has been said - microgram scale and PG solutions are the best way to go that I've tried or heard of, this stuff is way too strong to eyeball. Regardless you're skill at eyeballing... unless you have a huge tolerance and are OK with a possible knockout punch. 


Just licking the last little bit off the spatula I used to measure and transfer to PG solution boosted my first dose - I over did it, but only took 0.250-mg of the solution with a high tolerance, I must have gotten another 0.250-mg from the spatula, based on further experimentation that leaves me at the conclusion that 0.5-mg is enough for me, despite my tolerance, the first day I use this. If I use it a second day - with a day b/w to clear up - I already have to up the dose to 1-mg. From there the amnesic properties really kick in for me.

So whats up with this Clonazolam? I hear some of you say it is good and euphoric. Others have said stuff like 'its too strong' or 'it knocked me out all day' though i have a feeling they may have taken too much... SO is this clonazolam worth trying? Is it a good sleep aid, anti-anxiety, "Euphoria"?, etc.....and how long does a 1mg dose last - in effects??


Also, what is it that  I read from some people saying that they took just 0.5mgs and the next day were hit by BAD anxiety?? I don't understand how this is possible? are these people addicted and w/dig or is there something "weird" going on with Clonazolam??![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

I sometimes get rebound anxiety from a single use of clonazolam or etizolam. If I use it to sleep, I will not be able to sleep normal the next night. And that's a good thing. This makes it hard to get addicted. Too much downsides.

I don't get these side effects from Xanax or other prescribed benzos I once took btw.


To respond to your questions: clonazolam is perfect for sleep, 0,5 knocks me out (I don't have a tollerance). It removes all my anxiety if I have some. I only find it euphoric if I have anxiety and the clonazolam kills it. I generally like the feeling, but as mentioned before, the side effects are too big for me. 

If I use 1 0,5mg pill I will get a good night sleep and a nice carefree feeling for almost the whole next day.

I didn't feel like waiting on PG so I made a solution with Everclear instead. I easily got it to dissolve at 1mg/ml in case anyone is curious.

have the liquid (PG) Clonazolam version (0.125mg a drop).. Have yet to run a test on it but just want to know from all you guys who have taken the REAL DEAL Clonazolam if it is worth trying at least once and if so when? day, late afternoon, or night? or is it not worth even trying.. I ask this cuz some of these post say this stuff is too strong and has some weird "come-down" effect. Others say its got great euphoria and even a few people say its better then etiz!! (I find that hard to believe..))

Just because a particular vendor has a certain chemical synth, doesn't mean their product will be consistent in the future (because future synths may have impurities, the vendor may switch labs in order to save money, etc etc etc)


By the way, deep deep in the clearnet, only, will you find vendors that have a 98%+ purity product that is consistent, if it isn't you can search reviews of their latest "batches".


You never know (when buying yellow caps from a specific vendor) - if you are buying a consistent product, well, because it's not a pharmaceutical company producing it with strict guidelines (duh). so to be bias in your assumption, is totally wrong.

I found tolerance to build very quickly and for analgesic, euphoric effects to disappear, replaced with sedation and grogginess. I've suffered quite heavy hangover, with nausea and anxiety. 


I'm really spooked by this benzo. Think I might just get some etiz powder from the EU.

Potent, knock-out benzos and nausea/sickness. 


I think it's only an initial side effect (the nausea) but I'm concerned that some kid's going to take a shit load, knock him/herself out, then choke on their vomit. 


Must say: they've helped me recover from insomnia this past few days, but there were moments when I was a bit afraid to lose consciousness because I felt sick.

This one really doesn't agree with me. Had a batch a few weeks back, took frequent intervals throughout the week but whenever I woke up I always felt like I'd been kicked in the brain; not felt quite that gloomy coming from a benzo haze. Be careful folks, I know people personally who had seizures due to their excessive etiz use (during use, not while detoxing), this Clonazolam strikes me as having the same if not greater potential to cause some pretty horrible downsides.

and when you take a lot of anti-convulsants you become desensitized to their effect and increase the risk of seizing because your body depends on those anti-convulsants to not have suddenly have random seizures (I may be a Greenlighter in these parts but I'm no dummy). If you are taking a high-strength, high-dose benzodiazepine you desensitize your GABA receptors even faster, which I imagine increases the risk of seizing to the extent that a great deal of care must be taken when coming off such ludicrous doses.


Just sayin'


I worry about the state of hospital waiting rooms when the online benzo tap runs dry...

This here, LE might even enjoy those being available, I order some in my country as pellets and they don't bother, dogs smelled nothing, nothing here.


I mean other than Nexus (2c-B) (which never disappeared from the streets) was banned in 1994, last thing to be banned in Canada was some of the cannabinoids the US was going batshit insane about, oh and mdpv, obviously, goes into the same category. Also some weird strange obsession with banning Khat because arab immigrants like it (let's be honest, the Conservative government probably sees it that way).


Goodbye Harper, you're done in October.


And I'm veteran and I never take more than 2mg, it lasts me all day, it's perfect this way. 0.5mg feels like 15mg Tranxene if you ever had Tranxene, very functional, my stuttering is almost gone, at 1mg stuttering gone totally. I never used to stutter, DOB blotters caused this among other things (DOB Blotters were as common as LSD blotter in this area of the country in the mid 2000's). All long lasting effects except that, are gone, and it pisses me off, it makes severely under-qualified medical secretaries changing their facial expressions thinking I'm a dumbass. The 20mg valium I am on a day does not take it away strangely. The clonazepam I was on before for the HPPD did, but I tapered that away as much as I could.


It's possible for some people to take 1-2.5mg of this. Anything over is overkill though, same for rx'able benzos everywhere in the world, but in my country it would be reduced to Xanax and Rivotril. Midazolam's only available for IV for people having hardcore panic attacks and pre-op calming down fears you might never wake up again...There's triazolam in one or two provinces left, but not mine, I checked, never heard of the manufacturer so that bodes badly. At least I tried it one time, was given 6 0.25mg green brand name Halcions in 2002 or something. They were older people telling us to drink 1 beer with 1 pill and not anymore, that it was made to save on beer. Lmao, I was 16 or so we believed everything. Back then people on forums were telling me I had been roofied but eh no, flunitrazepam was never allowed here and mexico is far, and we didn't hang around with those people.


Oh me and my anecdotal stories ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

My expierences are also with 0.5mg yellow pills. Recieved a batch of pink/purple ones from a different vendor. Haven't tried those. Hopefully with less negative side effects. But I guess I'm just sensitive when it comes to benzos, Etizolam also gives me these rebound effects.

I just wanted to add my two cents worth regarding Clonazolam. Let me start by saying while I fiend for many things, I have never found benzos recreational at all. I have used Xanax legitimately for panic attacks when flying (although I can't even get that on script now so not sure how I will fly in the future), and Etizolam after a week of bingeing on stims (2mg is usually what's required for sleep).


Now back to Clonazolam. Wow. I have changed my view, I now *get* what it is that people love about benzos recreationally. I have occasionally taken 0.5mg sub lingually and after approx 2hrs I have the most amazing relaxed, uninhibited feeling in the world. Not sure why but I have never felt this from any other benzo (I've tried maybe 6 different prescription ones and a dozen RC ones).  Again, I was expecting it to be sedating like Etizolam but frankly I was underwhelmed by it's hypnotic properties. Mindful of my addictive personality I have tried this maybe 5 times over the past month or so with virtually the same effect - except I can sense a strong tolerance buildup (dosing twice in the second week it was noticeable).


One last comment. Just to reinforce what has already been said in this thread, I typically don't get 'blackout's when using benzos but I find little lapses of memory even at low doses with this one.


Anyway the harm reduction lesson here for me (and to others) is to tread lightly and use sparingly. They are (to me) amazing.

Haha, yep. I mean being benzo naive, taking one dose and then saying the bad night following was caused by the medium acting benzo (it's outta you). It's not, it's why you actually had benzos in the first place, your sleep sucks, naturally, right?


It's surely clearer than why now the vendor where I used to  get my etaqualone freebase is scared to sell it suddenly because THE LAW or something, it should be legal in here.

Clonazolam is strong it lasts at least 10 hours and has a strong amnesia component to it. Please don't take more than 2 mg. 3mg had me falling into everything and I had some scrapes and bruises the next day. TREAD LIGHTLY

Just wanted to leave my experience with this RC benzo.

First off well versed in benzo's and that's nothing to be proud of.


Anyways the pellets are .5mg which is great because any stronger especially for a newb could be very problematic. 

First time took about 30 mins with nothing to euphoric just a nice mellowness. What I have noticed over the past days about these things is one dose keeps me very social and focused, no stuttering or slurring which is important because I work 50 hrs a week. Its like Xanax but with less sides for me. 


Xanax just zaps me out, makes me crave caffeine and sugary/fat food. With Clonazolam hunger is usual and only need a slight boost like latte or redbull. I don't find them super hypnotiq but when I tried a couple the 2nd day I had them (Day off from work) was sluggish and had a bit of double vision. So I recommend spacing out doses very carefully and do not mix with alcohol like any benzo of course.


But in summary I actually enjoy the feel and functionality of these.  I can stay on top of my game energetically and mentally and though they don't make me pass out, falling asleep is pretty easy. wake up at like 6am with slight groggyness but nothing a cup of joe and oatmeal can't alleviate. 


Recommended and use with care and you shouldn't have any major issues, but with all benzos it varies from person to person.

Heh, they gave my mid 50's year old aunt 2mg valiums for fear of flying. 2mg before getting to the airport, 2mg when sitting in the plane and she said she was knocked out still once in the Dominican Republic. It's hilarious. I mean, even when I was benzo naive, 1mg of ativan wafers would knock me out for 20 minutes, 2mg clonazepam pills would make smoking weed very tiring and dull.


Hell does psychedelics change a person.

I usually keep reppeating small sublingual doses, hear it kicks in 10-20min... but whats oral like? And scienctific   studies done on this yet?

How is this even possible? ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

Only 0,5mg of this stuff made me forget half the day I took it and caused a pretty nasty rebound the next day including insomnia and so on. I wouldn't even dare to take 1mg...

This is by far the strongest RC-Benzo on the market and I can only agree with "the nod" and "shroomydan".


The potential WDs from it must be pure hell, even considering Benzo withdrawal is genrally considered the worst out of all drugs.

I've withdrawaled from 35mg diclazepam and 100mg methadone CT. Methadone was worse imo.


Called tolerance... I got plenty to last a long time and taper of. I just want more info on this. Metabolites, oral vs sublingual bioavailability, rate of onset for different ROAs. Im sure some is in here but I cant read it all.

I've made friends with clonazolam now. It took a few weeks. It was quite unnerving at first, due to its strength. Tolerance built up quickly and the initial nausea passed. Now I take 0.25 a couple of hours before bed a couple of times a week. It's very cost effective and it serves a purpose. Its next day anxiolytic properties have really come to the fore. 


It's a case of softly softly with this one.

I ordered 250 .5mg pills of this ,and I have not touched a benzo in almost a year now . My last go with benzos i was doing 12-20mg xanax a day ,but since I have no tolarance now to benzos where do you think I should start with this . I must also mention I use 300-500mg a day in Oxycodone aka the 30mg roxies just to stay out of withdrawls . Oxy gives me 0 buzz anymore ,but if I use about 300mg in one go I may get a slight buzz . Do you think breaking a .5mg in half I will be safe ?

Do not combine this with another depressant. You could choke on your own vomit, in fact this could happen on just a high dose. I and others have noted nausea on this when starting out with clonazol

Damn this sounds like a hell of a Benzo ??? How does it compare to Xanax ? I like the muscle relaxing effects of benzos which wheres off quick with Xanax unfortunately .

Clonazolam makes xanax look like beer with 3%abv. Its the strongest benzo I've come across either prescribed or otherwise. 1mg of clonazolam is like 6mg of xanax with an extra amnesiac and disco ordination kick

lol Sounds good to me ! So its actually euphoric ? Out of 15 or so benzos prescribed or RC never had a euphoric benzo. Never seen what everyone was saying when they said euphoric ;because no drug to me comes close to the euphoria of opiates my class and drugs of choice . Mainly what I like about Benzos is the muscle Relaxing effect which I always found to be better then actual muscle relaxers like soma that I have by the thousands . BTW lol the beer I drink is 9% hah. I don't drink watered down beer . I can drink 1 750ml 90 Prof bottle of RUM a day will this effect my tolerance to a benzo ? Of coarse I know not to drink with I have seen a friend almost die doing this with Xanax .

Clonazolam has a lot of muscle relaxation IME but it doesn't provide much in the way of euphoria unless you are anxious. It has a bit of euphoria but not nearly as much as most opiates

Yeah didn't think any Benzo would/ever come close to the Euphoria of Opiates , but in the long run I just want to take a half mg every night to relax ,and help me wind down ,and get to sleep . From what I am seeing on this thread that it will do ,and do good . Can not wait for them to get here ordered 240 of the .5mg pills .

Don't take more than .5 the first 24 hrs u have them. They can take a while to hit so don't take more if u aren't feeling anything after an hour. They last a long time too so you'll definitely be affected in the morning if u take them at night

Thanks for the tips man. So they take a bit longer to kick in then Xanax ? I am actually liking that they have a long half life . BTW I am going to be actually taking less then .5mg in the beginning due to the Oxycodone I take on the Daily .

I envy your Aunt, wish it did that to me. I guess it just reaffirms everyone's experience is different, I had the experience of running out off Xanax some 10 years ago and trying to get some to fly home from my (former) local family's GP. Instead he insisted I use Valium and that it would be ok. I took what he said, when he said, up to the max dose he said. No effect whatsoever, except those associated with my normal flying panic attacks (i.e. trying to fight the urge to get out of the cabin at 30k feet etc). To top off my experience, a crew member decided to lecture me on taking 'stuff' to fly mid attack. 

Since that time I've used Xanax and it just works. I've flown overseas successfully many time without more than mild discomfort. Devastated that it's now designated 'evil' in Aust... 


And just to bring it back on topic I again say go easy on Clonazolam. It's effects have changed the way I view Benzo's - lovely but I can see a dark addictive side waiting in the wings.

I haven't ever taken opiates/oids enough to get withdrawals but if any other benzos help with it I'm sure this would. I know it would at least treat the psychological aspect if it were me. If u have access to other benzos definitely go with those as I feel clonazolam is too strong to use for anything other than a strong stimulant comedown.

When I have some, I take 0.5mg sometime in the morning and 0.5mg at bedtime. I feel like a better myself when used this way, it's like having 1mg of clonazepam once a day. Not a huge deal, there's more people using these things correctly than not I'm thinking otherwise, well, we'd be hearing of phenazepam-like trainwrecks much more since everything else that came out after it (first being diclazepam I think?).


I'm not even afraid that flunitrazoLam will become available. Because I know people who had Rohypnol(flunitrazepam), legally, in Europe or in the US when it was legal or when on a trip to Mexico and it's largely overrated, the stories of insane strength involving anterograde amnesia (the same way clonazepam causes it) always involve booze. Clonazepam 1mg (the tiny pink ones, I know in the US there are fat like the 0.5 and 2mg green clonazepam pills, but let's focus on the more common tiny, probably the tiniest pills I was prescribed in my life (with Hycodan 5mgs) in existence and they melt in contact with saliva. They're perfect "date-rape" weapons  but of course the media hasn't decided to create hysteria about them, which is strange in a way considering clonazepam is the last benzo to have been approved here in '94, during the Rohypnol scare that probably caused it not to be released here, too. ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif) All this to say, these things are not smarties, be careful and nobody will get hurt.

Nope I just swallow the gelcaps. They're so tiny it'd be a waste of time to do otherwise. Also, nothing in this world is more disgusting than Zopiclone, never had the brand name Imovane but I hope that one has a kind of slight invisible kind of wax over it so as to not taste the pill as one is taking one. At least I never woke up and smelled like a barrel of chemicals from clonazolam (it happened randomly where the taste was everywhere in my mouth and my armpits smelled like the zopiclone pill a few times.

My housemates have been into clonazolam for about two weeks now (I had one once, I wasn't a fan), someone on alcohol and codeine (nobody knew) took two and is now dead. Obviously anyone reading a forum like this would be incredibly careful with dangerous interactions anyway so it's kind of redundant me posting this, but please please be extra careful with it and don't be tempted to mix it with anything dangerous.

Sorry to hear about your housemate ahint.

Do you know how much codeine / alcohol he had?


I would guess this pertains to recreational doses of Codeine/Opiates, but would like to be sure as I take a couple Paracetamol 100mg+Codeine 10mg tablets for headaches, taking them probably a few times after a couple of drinks + stims followed by 2mg Etizolam for sleep. 


Always taking care not to be drunk when taking a benzo/etizolam, but not giving 20mg of Codeine any thought, but perhaps I should..?


As I already ordered some of the 0,5mg Clonazolam pellets to see if they could be a worthwile Etizolam replacement, but will now be extra careful with these, thanks to your post.

I'm not sure the exact dosage of codeine, but it wasn't recreational, it was prescribed for pain and he took no more than needed. I'm not at all sure at the dose of alcohol either, only that his vomit stank of it, but he seemed sober earlier in the day and nobody saw him drink. It's possible it was something else causing the vomit to smell like that.

It's definitely unpredictable and it may be possible he died due to a completely different cause (he choked on his vomit sleeping on his back). If that ends up being the case I'll post back here to let people let know, I wouldn't want to contribute to superstitious scaremongering, but understandably based on what's happened I want to urge people to be as careful as humanly possible, don't take any risks you don't have to, I don't want this to happen to anyone else when it can be avoided. He was 26 and seemingly healthy with a huge tolerance to alcohol, plus he'd been on his prescription dose of codeine for a few days, this might be something that can happen to anyone.

The tylenol in his most likely tylenol/codeine combo pills reads to me like the most certain culprits (with the booze). Pure codeine pills I have only obtained for pneumonia related cough so...Alcohol + tylenol almost killed me once, I'd say the added clonazolam was an error, the codeine itself, not so much, if he was taking 1-2 T3 every 4 hours (typical script), the amount of APAP + alcohol is enough to cause liver failure itself.

The combination of irresponsible users and benzodiazepines does this a lot, doesn't really matter which benzodiazepine is taken.


"Not feeling it very much? Take another dose" and "A little alcohol won't hurt". Benzodiazepines are not very recreational on their own, if you try to chase a high that you'll never achieve it ends very badly usually.

Haven't noticed such compared to other forums. Bluelighters (which excludes greenlighters) are more likely to act in a non rash manner when it comes to drugs. I'm sure 33% of people here would be able to lay their own LSD blotter sheet from crystal.

Bah, I think that if one is scripted 10mg or 15mg oxazepam once every 3-4 hours will be able to stop "benzos" right away. That's imho though. Even when with low tolerance I could eat 2 30mg Serax (when the brand name was still around) and feel intense anxiolysis and euphoria....for 5 minutes, if you focus on it you'll lose it. No wonder it's usually scripted to be taken multiple times a day. If I was a doctor I'd try oxazepam 10mg every 3 hours on patients who want benzos. I'd feel the less preoccupied about getting someone in trouble this way heh.


Although I'd personally love to put my hands on European 50mg oxazepam pills ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Pure codeine pills I have only obtained for pneumonia related cough so...Alcohol + tylenol almost killed me once, I'd say the added clonazolam was an error, the codeine itself, not so much, if he was taking 1-2 T3 every 4 hours (typical script), the amount of APAP + alcohol is enough to cause liver failure itself.

The only two benzos I've tried are etizolam and alprazolam. I think etizolam is great (in moderation). Would clonozolam be worth trying for me?

^Not sure if you ment to type clonazepam or clonazolam. Other than it's rotten taste I really like this one, the only thing is that after using for a couple days my tolerance is fucked to the point I can't feel 5mgs of etiz.

Is benzo rage common amongst users here? or paradoxical reactions, interested cause it does this to me. Seems the anxiety free feeling makes me feel like i can do/say anything as i please. but its an amped feeling. I get this from many other drugs:stimulation from opiates, sedation/content from stimulants and cannabis, alcohol gives me energy and happiness as well. weird, the only normal reaction i get is from mdma and caffeine.

Yes, that can happen. You just get loose lips and feel like you can say whatever you want on recreational doses. Espcially happens with certain opiates. Like the other day, on 120mg of Oxy and some xanax and Klonopin I just went into a rage with a friend(not at him just talking about something, something I did have a right to be really aggravated with) but fuck I could not shut up about what assholes they were and how they use me alot sometimes, but then agian I guese I do with them too, but not really...I don't just give 60 bucks away for someone to get drugs when they say there gonna pay me back on a certain day, then don't, and there is more to the story...like how the fuck was she nodding out the day she owed me the money and she didn't have any..the money I was suppose to get maybe?

If you don't mind being whacked out the next day. Long half life, much like F-Azo in that regard but a little shorter and a little less noticeable but coordination will be affected without you realizing it until you fall or run a red light. This afterglow usually fades after 14-20 hours. YMMV. I wouldn't consume that stuff unless you have the next day to stumble around at least in the AM... be careful. Etiz is a better option for your purposes, or Xannys. 


Do not drive within 24 hours!


Be safe. Be well.

FlubroLAM lasts even longer. Afterglow at least 30+ hours. But it knocks me out at 0.25 mg orally after about 45 minutes. It could be another option for you.

It does. But it has the worst in dimished returns. I have a fairly high tolerance to benzos which probably didnt help but my response to this stuff was ridiculous. 1st time 1.25mg - floored for 6 hours, still feeling the effects over 24 hours later.


2nd dose 4 days later - 1.5mg - felt like less than a 3rd of the effect experienced on my first usage - maybe equivalent to 10mg diazepam max


3rd dose 13! days later - 2mg - all pellets from same batch of 25 - NO effect whatsoever. Weirdly tho, ive taken other benzodiazepines in the meantime with effects as good as ever. Its like flubromazoLam fries its own metabolic pathway, creating a permanent tolerance to itself.


Stick to the clonazolam, they're lovely. My personal favourite is still flubromazePam, but the pellets are really expensive and they take hours to start working

I have found that Flexeril Mixes beautifully with this benzo . Very strong muscle relaxation . Feels wonderful to stretch out . No euphoria or anything like a opiate ,but it feels good . I take 1mg clonazolam or 1mg Xanax my prescription basically which ever one I have on hand with 10mg Flexeril ,and my body is like jello . Flexeril is one of the strongest muscle relaxers on the market . Even more so then Soma ,but man I wish my doc would give me soma again , but hay Soma is good to catch a buzz with not much muscle relaxation , and Flexeril is true muscle relaxation with no buzz . So go figure .

I think its because I don't like the extremely long half life with clonazolam , and xanax hits like a brick wall in just a few minutes of taking it . Don't get me wrong though I do love clonazolam for weekends or when ever I can sleep in late . My opinion is 1mg of clonazolam is = to 1.2 - 1.5mg Xanax . I don't make a habit of benzos , and I am not a pro at them like I am opiates , but I like them every night to sleep , and to add to my opiates to top off my nod , but thats about it . To me clonazolam is a longer lasting xanax feels about the same , but the cons of it is it last super long , and takes a little bit longer to kick in . So I prefer my prescription of xanax .

I have extensive experience with all kind of benzodiazepines over more then a decade. But i have never been truely addicted, aside from minor discontinuation symtoms. Since i have access to all benzodiazepines i want, from my doctor, i never bothered with rc benzos. But this clonitrazolam has always interested me, since i read its synthesis on the rhodium archive. So i bought 25 dark pink 0,5mg pellets for an absolutely inflated price. My tolerance is rather low right now, with 10-20 mg diazepam or 1-2 mg clonazepam/alprazolam i feel like an optimal dose without much sedation, just anxiolysis, and a slight relaxation.


So this night i wanted to get benzoed out, like a nice 2mg flunitrazepam would put me. So i downed 1mg and indeed i can only repeat what others have said. Its hitting me fast on an empty stomach, in 15 min i was allready really off. Slight coordination problems, disinhibition, strong sedation and anxiolysis. The effects rose over the next hours and a half to a climax and lasted well into the next day. With another 0,5 mg and some specks of Ab-Chminaca on top of a cigarette the rest of the night became a blur and i fell asleep on the couch watching TV.


I repeated this the following two evenings, with almost the same results. I was really wobbly the next day, slept really long, but by the evening i could feel rebout anxiety i have never felt from any benzo before. Also there was a strong desire to redose , even in the morning.  I went one day without any benzos and could feel derealisation and sensitivity to sound when i was buying food at the store. So i weened myself down after all 25 pellets were gone with a short diazepam/clonazepam taper over a week maybe. I could hardly feel 2mg clonazepam at first, my tolerance went through the roof. But this would have been expected with the equivalent dose with any other benzo in this high dosages taken.

Your opinion ;because to me 1mg Clonazolam = right under 2mg Xanax . So unless there are some official documents somewhere proving otherwise . To me my body must react different then others cause I bought 240 .5mg Clonazolam going into it with what everyone else said that 1mg is = to 4mg Xanax ,and I even seen someone say 1mg Clonazolam is = to 10mg Xanax . What a load of shit . I wasted my money . Still prefer Xanax .


Most of the time I take 2-4mg Xanax 1 or 2 bars according to the amount of my preferred Opiate I took that given day. When I got the Clonazolam I went into it thinking it was some super super potent Benzo ,but it turned out I need a whole MG to even feel close to a bar. I admit it is a bit stronger ,but not as potent as everyone is making it out to be. Takes a bit of time for Clonazolam to come on for me also Xanax seems to have a bit more muscle relaxing effects . When I take a Benzo with my opiates to help the nod out I want it to work as quick as possible . 


Clonazolam is not worth buying considering I get 160 1mg Xanax free every month . Don't take everything I said wrong though ;because this is the best RC Benzo out there hands down , and I have tried 6 or so .

Hey there guys . I just gave my GF .5mg that i broke in half of this it should be around .250mg she took ,and she has never used a benzo before . She says she feels good and is giggling a lot laughing and things now ,but she says she feels real dizzy . I think thats conman for a lot of benzos right ,and it will go away soon hopefully . 


Any advise here would be much apreciated . I take 3-4mg of this stuff and just get extreme muscle relaxition abit hard to walk and such ,but I am not tired at all from it, but I have a high benzo tollarance . Trying to get my GF to try new things like benzos and opiates is hard. I just trying to help her relax and sleep better ,and see what all the talk is about these drugs ,and I never give benzos or opiates in high amounts to her . As a joke though months ago i gave here 1 10mg oxycodon and she was high as a kite considering I take 540mg of it and just get relief from withdrawals . She claims she does not like the way opiates feel to her when apparently she was high as a kite and all over everyone. How could someone not like opiates . LOL

I got some .5mg pellets coming in. How does one of these compare to, say, .5mg clonazepam or 10mg diazepam?

They are stronger, cause more amnesia and kind of a rebound. Beware with no or a low tolerance. These little fuckers are no joke.

To me these have no recreation value . I took .5mg when I first got em and got a slight relaxed feeling then about a hour later a went to bed ,and had the best sleep I have ever had in my life . There not much stronger then xanax for me because .5 felt just like 1mg xanax minus the slight buzz and rush I get with xanax . My GF took some last night and clammed they mad her dizzy ,but other then that she had the best sleep ever and also wondering how somethings got where they where when she got up . She has no benzo tollarance so I only gave her .250mg I would need most likely  3mg to get any good rush ore other good effects that xanax gives me

Worth noting that you have a pretty high benzo tolerance ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Anyone else is likely to being knocked out by doses higher than 0,5mg. This seems to be the general consensus.

Way stronger than .5 clonazepam, much less muscle relaxing than diazepam, also much less hmm, I don't know, valium puts me in a great mood, has antidepressant qualities, I couldn't say that about clonazolam.

Hey guys what do you think I took .5mg of Clonazolam @ 9:00 last night do you think it would be safe to get drunk tonight around 11:00 ? I usually drink about 3-4 25oz beers 5.5% alc content .


EDIT: I also want to mention I have been taking before my last dose anywhere between .5mg to 3mg a day for the last several days .

Just take it easy, it's not difficult to find yourself more "drinkish" than you feel if/when the alcohol potentiates the clonaz or is active metabolites (if it has any). It's got a long half life, I believe about 100hrs, check this thread for more accurate half-life info, so I'd expect some added effect to your alcohol, possibly significant - a feeling of fatigue will help indicate this. 


My biggest suggestion, please take seriously - do not drive, even if you only have half a drink. It's not worth the potential costs. I mention this b/c you may not realize your speech and or other coordination is compromised until you have a problem.


Be safe.


Edit: that's a lot of alcohol, but don't assume your alcohol tolerance is going to be much of a factor. I'd keep it to a drink or two for the first hour or so, if you're not on your face, you're safe in a harm perspective as long as you don't fall, trip, play with fire, drive or have crazy sex on the rooftop. Let a friend your drinking with know that you may have a benzo reaction to the alcohol, just in case.

Be careful mixing this or any benzos with alcohol. The other day I took what would normally be a moderate dose followed by a one small shot of weakish moon mixed with cheerwine soda on the rocks and passed out until ~7pm. My dumbass should have known as I had a bad habit of drinking on xanax. This benzo by itself is usually never very hypnotic but add a tiny bit of alcohol and I was out for a good 7 hours.

as much as i love these, they are probably the most addictive rc benzo, after only a few days on them then stopping the rebound anxiety is strong and quite unpleasant compared to others like flubromazepam which i can take for a couple of weeks and stop and not really get any rebound/wds

Excellent post, sums these little fuckers up nicely. I have never had a benzo like them for a heavy, nasty withdrawal after just a short period of IME moderate usage.

Does anyone else experience an onset period that can range from 1-3 hours? Has anyone been taking them successfully on top of p450 inhibitors? I am wondering if they require first pass metabolism to become active. 


Or do RC vendors just have a hard time dosing 500 mikes consistently? Because I'm getting varying onset times and apparent potencies and I can't figure out what elements of my behaviour such as diet or use of things like diphenhydramine are affecting this.

I took one .5mg pellet last night (and redosed another .25mg a few hours later) and WOW. New favorite benzo maybe. I'll write a full TR when I get off work.

PSA: These little fuckers are strong as hell!


I''ll give a full trip report when I'm not so benzd and tied. But yeah I would say these .5mg tablets are about as strong as .75mg-1mg clonazepam. They certainly feel different though. I think it's safe to say I enjoy this one more than clonazepam, maybe even diazepam at this point..


But yeah...very strong anxiolytic, has both euphoric properties will likely make you really sleepy so maybe drink some coffee, or do some speed if that's your thing. Very, very nice benzo. But at the same time, these are stupid potent...I wouldn't give more than .5 to a benzo noob. Do not drink on these, do not drive on these, and especially do not drink and drive on these. Irresponsible substance use is a huge thing that's holding a lot of people back - and yes I do include myself in this category, although I went from taking 5-6 bars per day to having a stash that I only touch for comedowns basically - no more than two or three times per month for me, but as far as selling them the profit margin is abusrd.


Anyway I done been ramblin long enough. 


People of Bluelight need you to all know that this stuff is stupid potent. I'm on 1mg right now and I just took some dabs and I keep falling asleep. Tomorrow I'm gonna bit a do a reading on this one which is sort of a love child between clonazepam and flunitrazepam. I love learning about drug chemistry and the like.  But yeah these feel nice, 10/10 would take again.

Just please start at .5mg. M tolerance is ridiculous at the moment.

Mate you are treading very dangerous waters taking that kind of dose of a untested drug, not being tested aside that is a massive dose and if you don't get on top of things quickly you are heading down a very slippery life threatening or life changing slope. Please be careful.

I don't know if I believe hardly any of the trip reports on rcs that are written around the time they first come out. 

I had this impression when I read a whole bunch of amazing trip reports about ethylphenidate that were written on bluelight in I think 2012. Mostly the ones near the beginning of the ethyl mega threads. then I received a gram of it and found for myself that it was one of the most good awful drugs I've experienced. the trip reports did not match even closely. So I continued to read through the threads. as time went on the glowing trip reports faded as the "I hate this chemical" reports increased.

I recently was reading about clonazolam on reddit and ran into something that angered me. the owner of an rc vendor was offering free samples to people who would write great experience reports on bluelight as compensation. 

So I won't take an rc trip report for a grain of salt from someone who isn't a known and reputable bluelighter.

it's a shady business. 

I hope I didn't waste my money on these. I see a lot of reports telling people to smoke weed with them which is another red flag. that's an old trick people use when they want a drug to have strengthened placebo effect

Well here, try taking 5mg and then when you 'come to' a few days later, you can come back and tell us all about how wrong you were :D


Jokes aside, don't take more than .5mg of these without a tolerance, and don't do anything silly.

Bluelight informed me by email that someone posted in this thread and said, but I can't find the post.


There's 0.25mg clonazepam pills. They're sky blue in colour. Just like there's 0.25mg xanax. Google image it, look it up on canoe. Here in my country PharmaScience (a generics company) definitely makes them, it was on their site when they allowed anyone to look at their catalogue...


Just googling or whatever enginer you wanna use, type in clonazepam canoe (canoe is some canadian news/magazine about everything online, the serious kind of publication, that's where I get all my info about opiates inactive ingredients to know if I had to need a SteriFilt or not for whatever that was not dilaudid I was gonna shoot up.

close.. they make clonazepam in .25 but not Klonopin. Klonopin brand name only comes in .5, 1, and 2mgs. therefore all generic formulations of it in the United States also only make the same. in other countries clonazepam is made in .25mg. I believe Rivotril is made in that dose range.

There are 0.125-mg sublingual clonazepam in the US. I know b/c I had a bunch when I tapered clonazepam several years ago. I'm back on a therapeutic dose, and tapering again, but using diazepam this time. Elderly and liver compromised individuals often don't require doses higher than 1/8 mg. Clonazepam is a wicked potent benzo, but it's longer onset time gives some people the impression it is weaker than say, Xanax. Not at all... Not ime.

Just got my first order of clonazolam this evening. for the last week or so I have been dosing etizolam of various doses daily. Anywhere from 3 mg to as much as 10. These are TOWA script brand and ocasionally home made pg solution. Today I have had two doses of the pills - 3 mg each. One was 12 hours before I intend to try the clonazolam the second dose was 6 hours before I intend to try it


I previously was dosing benzos daily (2-5mg) off and on for years - that ended about a year ago, I have noticed the same branda and less mg of etizolam doesnt do nearly as much for me this time around as it did before.


Enough rambling. Basiczlly. I want to try this clonazolam tonight but don't know if the 6mg of etiz ingested today plus what appears to be a decent tolerance that I have to make the experience not worth it.


Do I stop taking etizolam for a few days and then try the clonazolam?


Or what dose should I take based on my tolerance to these other things to enjoy it?


Sorry for a rambling first post. After a frustrating usps screw up and finally getting the stuff, I am very eager to erhmm research.


Thanks for reading the advice,

- yN

Yeah it's called Rivotril in canada, people call em rivos, never saw the brand name ones irl by Roche,*correction, I did see the .5mg brand name Roche clonazepam, they're brownish, light brownish...walnut, yeah* only the PMS-clonazepam 0.25mg (PMS meaning Pharmascience, a very well known generics company in canada....they also make the extremely useful 50mg Histantil you can ask your pharmacist for, there used to be 25mg, which is what i was buying, but they discontinued them. I get a bottle of 30x50mg for 11 dollars and change of these bulky dark blue pills with only PMS etched on one side, nothing as to what it is or what dose.


Ooops, going offtopic here, just gonna end with, the whole world calls it Rivotril, Klonopin ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Get with the times! Canada is kind in the middle when it comes to meds and rx meds, between european and american situations. I still can'tbelieve they took out your Nitrazepam for no reason at all in 2005 and the whole Rohypnol is evil thing when almost all of Europe scripts it. I gotta say the orange (probably .5mg?, I'd reserve it for the strongest dosage of 2mg like for Valium) brand name Klonopins with the indented / carved out K look pretty cool, not as awesome as brand name american Roche Valiums though with the V looking like a heart in the middle of the same kind of blue...Here we can't even have 10mg valium, N/A, brand name that is, sure generics, we can do that but. But I've in my hands and system and seen every dosage of clonazepam in brand name form here and none of ours have that carved out K either, I guess it would be an R if they wanted to do that here. 


Even back about a decade ago brand name Dilaudid 4mg had a stylized D "which made em too attractive" according to Purdue and somehow changed it to a boring old regular D.

i believe everyone to be careful with these, especially those with benzo withdrawl sensitivity. i consider myself quite unaffected by the majority of benzo withdrawl, but these are on another level.


do not take more than 5 days in a row, doesnt matter on dosage as with even small doses daily, i felt very unpleasant after with the rebound anxiety, shaking/jittery/nervous/tired/no motivation.


just thought id let you know before you delve into this one.

ya well that's true but even though they are clonazepam they are still different pharms. I believe he was referring to the tab Klonopin tablets. 

you are correct, Klonopin is imo one of the most potent benzos and deff my favorite. it even has action at gaba b. curious if clonazolam does as well. anyone have definite info on metabolites of clonazolam?

I just got my Klonopin refilled today and my clonazolam pellets have been "in transit" for days now without update. looking forward to reporting on synergy between clonazolam and Klonopin.

if I took clonazolam for five days like you said and stopped, do you think my clonazepam would be strong enough to stop any withdrawal complications?

I'm concerned that maybe if clonazolam is as strong as people say that it could cause massive down regulation of gaba receptors which would be a huge problem possibly leading to dementia with overuse.

yeah i think your clonazepam should be ok, ive used many different benzos when stopping clonozolam to rid the horrible rebound wds and they do the trick, as long as you have something. im talking about just stopping with no benzos left at all, it can be tough

Hi there. Complete novice here. I have no "habit" but like taking 3fpm. The other morning, I did a couple of lines of 3fpm and then popped a little pink pill (clonazolam) at 1.30pm and then sort of blacked out until 8pm. I then woke for 2 hours (my gf says) but have no recollection of this. I then went to bed at 10pm and fell asleep (blacked out?) until 7am the next morning but felt brilliant.

Is this normal behaviour for clonazolam?

Does any of the above sound like I was dangerously unwell?

Am I ok to use this stuff after a day of 3fpm?  I just want to avoid the insomnia 3fpm gives me and just "knock myself out" like this?

Is that dangerous?

If you have no tolerance, 0.5mg can be too strong, take half a pill.


Many people take benzodiazepines after stimulants to diminish the crash and be able to sleep.

After the initial "yay I got my stuff in the mail" day or two where i take 1.5mg to 2mg a couple times a day, I've only had 1 capsule of 0.5 a day since then,everytime. The crappy 0.25mg flubromazolam pills going around are weak it seems, I need .75 to 1mg of those british f-lam pills, while swedish made flub-lam 1mg gelcaps work like mad, but without the amnesia that can be caused by this one(more on that later), did that last time and when i fell back on all that valium (script) and xanax (script) I saved, valium was taking care of me correctly, only one time did i fuck up, and thankfully it was a small order of 30 caps only, but i ate em very fast, and suddenly I had to take an extra 10mg val from my 20mg up to 30 to be okay. So yeah, be careful, I find it causes anterograde amnesia like clonazepam too. Sometimes I wake up realizing I'm sitting in my bed and vaping my e-cig and had no recall of going from lying to sitting to picking up e-cig on the rolling desk with my second monitor and turntable. Its never happened to me to lose memory (although when i tapered the 2x2mg clonazepam script (i asked my psycdoc to do so, which surprised him, and he's pretty cool with me since I defended the fact I was stuck at 20mg when I said, you're weening me off too fast now, didn't see him in 3 years, all I do is call the pharmacy who calls his office and they renew the scripts automatically by fax, we have no need to see each other until I decide to taper off the valium, one mg per month at a time..i'm that sensitive to the wd's). I lost my train of thought here though lol...


As I was saying, I always was the one who didn't collapse from alcohol (i did have my shares of vomit inducing drinking games though..), the one who freaked out the least from psychedelics, always having a good time, mdma was great too, the only time I had a real E pill (pink pill with an heart on one side, SEX etched into the other side, i scared off a female friend of mine when my eyes got to rollin' haha, i told her it was a normal feeling when the euphoria was large and it was. 

And finally, I never fucked up property, hurt people, hurt myself and any general mischief from benzos, but i could see it happening with like 5mg of this stuff, so indeed be careful!

Yeah I'd like to echo all the 'be careful' sentiments...


This benzo is stupid potent. I think it's a far stronger anxiolytic than clonazepam and even alprazolam, while at the same time having stronger muscle relaxing properties than diazepam and maybe even some of the barbiturates.


The amnesia isn't quite as bad as phenazepam, but it's roughly on par with an equivalent dose of alpraz. 


I think it's safe to say that it's at least twice as strong as clonazepam, dosage wise. So do be careful. If you're a benzo noob, start with maybe .25mg. If you have a decent amount of experience with benzos then .5mg would be perfect, and I wouldn't recommend going beyond 1mg unless you just feel like faking asleep, or entering the 'danger zone' as I like to call it (blacking out and doing silly things)


But don't get me wrong, I love em. Despite the potential negatives I listed, it may be me and my girlfriend's new favorite benzo. We like to take .25mg each to start, and then throughout the course of the evening take lots of dabs and redose .125mg periodically.


Only problem - originally I was just gonna get 30 .5mg pellets to test them out. Then my orders for some different shit (1pLSD, 3fpm, 3meopcmo) from a different site didn't come through, so I just decided fuck it I'll get 90 Clonazolam pellets. So I ordered 45mg instead of 15mg as I originally intended.


Well I placed the order wrong, and ended up getting 90mg instead of 90 pellets! That's 180 pellets!! (which by the way can be split into halves, or even quarters, and still be effective) :O that's so much fucking Clonazolam! I try and have the self control of a Tibetan monk when it comes to benzos because I know how evil they are. But still, you NEED the self control of a Tibetan monk in order to have 180 of these fuckers lying around without anything bad happening. With great power comes great responsibility. Be safe out there everyone ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

These days I have my girlfriend keep my rx's away from me and dispense them to me, hiding it really somewhere I don't know of, because believe I looked once in a panic attack (which is rare for me these days to have, panic attacks that is, i'm a GAD person, panic attacks i only had issues with when I was smoking freebase...i'd have them when NOT on the effects of the smoked cocaine though....awful stuff that freebase too, it hurts you as much as benzos, in a more in your face fashion, your wallet empties, you max out credit cards, get credit cards to buy more fishscale to turn into freebase and hear the exciting and reassuring rice crispies sound coming from your cigarette ash filled pipe with the now freebased high quality cocaine sitting right on top. Once you master the ritual (the right way of smoking and of using the lighter....we have to do this here cos there is absolutely no crack pipe sold here even in head shops, they have meth pipes...but I never ever saw crystal meth, it just doesn't exist here, it's all methbomb pills or powder, the powder they normally press into pills with a bunch of crap like caffeine and leftover sudafed. Gettin carried away here, but yeah, as you said I B Profane...gotta take control or if you can't, give it up completely (like I do with my valium and xanax scripts and have the gf control em, same with RC benzos, but these we usually  split 75/25, she doesnt need benzos to live..her ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)

I've been thinking about buying this. It's between clonazolam and flubromazolam. They come from the same vendor I get my Etizolam from. I haven't heard anything great about flubromazolam so I may have to get some clonazolam. 


It seems like most users seem to prefer it over Etizolam. Plus Clonazolam is an actual benzo where as Etizolam is not. I really want something with a longer half life because I am flying through my Etizolam and Xanax script. Thoughts?

Thoughts? Sure... 


TL: Keep a realistic sober eye on your intake. F-Azo is superior ime, but seems I may be in minority.


Ok...


1. Watch dependency, all the new threads about benzo w/d are appearing for good reason. More and more people are abusing a class of drugs with horrid, potentially lethal withdrawal if they suddenly get cut off, so if you've already got etiz and Xanax, do you really need more or just want more? I'd understand if you're looking for something longer lasting to replace those...


2. Flubromazolam is superior to clonazolam, ime. But the effects last a good 20 hrs for me at 2-mg/dose (factor in a 3-mg/day clonazepam dependency). I prefer FlubroAzo, esp., with a strong hit of acid... I think my only score of C-Azo is weak, so my experience may be skewed.


3. People will argue back as fourth about which is "better". Their only real uses are stimulant comedown, comatose like sleep and self-medicating anxiety. Or getting "high" and chilling out - but I never understood that, probably b/c I have serious anxiety issues.


4. Chasing a benzo high leads to nothing good when done long term / frequently


5. Tread lightly, rehabs are going to get slammed soon with people begging for help for RC benzo dependency. Esp., when the DEA cracks down, but that could be years... Or your parents catch on. Kids theses days... (Not directed at anyone posting here, a general comment/observation)


6. Use your head to your advantage!


7. Don't take 'scripted benzos on top of potent RCs, enjoy one. Taking multiple benzos is only going to jack up your tolerance even quicker. Plus, you'll want those scripted benzos for when you come off the RCs, stupid potent that they are (the two new Azos...)


Be well. Be smart, benzo dependency sucks, or perhaps you already know, and choose to keep going. I'm trying myself to not go that route, so i apologize if i come of as condescending. I just don't want to see people posting about benzo w/ds where it could be easily avoided by not chasing the very elusive high. 


^^In that statement is a lot of hypocrisy, if you read my posts from a few months ago, I acknowledge this... 


If you genuinely need a benzo, best to have a quality dr supervise, and control your intake. That's where I'm at today, but it's difficult to avoid the pull of taking just a little of an RC for extra relief, but i don't require it. I do get the compulsion to use these though.


I favor legalization of all drugs, that said, I'd probably classify benzos with opioids and meth wrt to dependency issues and acute highly intoxicated consequences. I'd have similar disclaimers and taxes for treatment centers placed on each substance when sold to consenting adults... The stories of car wrecks, people driving states away, ending up in jail, etc... All without a shred of a memory about the events - that genuinely scares the fuck out of me. But that's just me. 


One opinion of billions. Hope that gives food for thought as you seek out your favored medication, I really do get it. I'm in the middle of it too everything above applys to me as much as anyone.

Thank you I appreciate the time you put in to provide me that incredibly accurate answer ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) unfortunately we will have to just assume I have been there and done that. 


Been battling the benzo addiction for almost five years now. Went into a rehab, they took away my benzos and replaced them with Neurontin and seroquel. Now I am back to my old ways trying to wean myself off Gabapentin. 


You are the first poster I have seen to speak highly of flubramazolam over clonazolam.

^Both have their pros and cons. I find clonazolam recreational in a manner similar to xanax but also like xanax I can't sleep worth a shit on it unless I have it with a drink. F-lam is provides a good nights sleep while being less recreational.

I don't know about packages going into the US, but the only package I ever had seized, using canadapost's tracking site, many times it would say my package was sent for further"processing" which is a polite way of saying postal inspectors consider sending it to the CBSA, then often less than 10 minutes after, it says it's back intro transit, except that one time it said that the CBSA (Canadian Border Service Agency) seized it for examination. It was a very assraping loss too, let's say the price of playstation 3 these days, because the vendor didnt have credit card processing anymore so, his price in GBP with my puny canadian money, fees for currency converting then finally the Telex fee (bank transfer). That happened in october last year, I got a letter from customs 3 weeks ago about the package lol. Saying "the package contained tablets of flubromazolam, which is a controlled substance, so it was seized by border patrol at the airport since itwas from the UK. I can file stuff to get it back, and its frustrating...i'm 3 maths classes I was unable to pass to have a BSc, I tried to beat the first one about 4 times....pure maths just bore me to death so. But if i had a BSc in Pharmacology like I was aiming for, I could come up with a valid reason to get the stuff back.


But I won't. They acknowledged it wasn't a chemical that would send me straight to jail like if had a package of PCP pills (older canadians will remember these, although they were called THC/TH pills), just that it wasn't legal to import here.


Well fuck you guys, I received 220 1mg capsules of flubromazolam from a much better vendor with a cardboard letter kind of deal where you can't shake anything or touch anything that feels like a pill inside those black bags that make x-ray machines see nothing suspect. So yeah, fuck you Officer Nice.

well it passed through and I'll have it tomorrow! I think customs is worried about bigger things than personal usage orders of legal drugs. 

anyways I have question. clonazepam and flam aren't anything like phenazepam are they?

I received a gram of phenazepam and mxe a while back, and let's say it ruined my life. I blacked out two months of my life, ended up in the er once and a psych hospital twice. I would take unmeasured finger dabs because after the first dose I didn't feel anything so redosed then three hours later I lost all inhibitions and just stated taking more and more of it often in a black out. my girlfriend took my kid and left me because she said I was nodding out for a month and she constantly had to check if I was alive. my neck is damaged from my head hanging down so much and now I think the majority of my bz receptors are fried. I have to take a while script of alprazolam now to feel good(not dick sizing, it pisses me off). although for some reason my rx of clonazepam still works for anxiety every time I take it. even a .5 sublingual helps. good bless kpind. 

but anyways, all of these problems because I wanted to try a new anx anxyolitic I knew nothing about (sorry about the spelling I'm not dumb but crashing off ethylphenidate on a couple days without sleep). 

does anyone expect clam to act like this or is it safer? I have such a high benzo tolerance that half an rx of 30mg temazepam and I just feel slightly relaxed. so that being said, any advice on a dose that will have me feeling nice and or come down from large stim binges?

please don't compare it to etizolam because I never had it. about etizolam being a thienobz (sp), isn't zyprexa the same class? I've taken zyprexa and it had zero positive effects that resembled anything if a benzo.

Etiz is great because it's functionable. I don't think you'll be dissapointed with clam tho I used to be scripted cpam and like clam better but it's not something to do if u have things to take care of because it makes you seem obviously under the influence withmore than .5mg. Although cpam tastes like heaven compared to clam, thats a huge downside to clam its the worst tasting benzo and prob the worst taste of any chem, i cringe when any amount gets to the bitter buds at the back of my throat


Don't be around ppl who you don't want to know ur on anything with this its much stronger motor loss than any other benzo

thanks shroomy! I have a huge tolerance to anything gabaergic abd today I just want to get really high because I'm taking the last of my ethylphenidate and I'll need to get high to forget about it. 

I'm going to leave with a picture of my drug breakfast at 6:20 am so you can maybe gather what you think a good dose is. it generally takes me close to 20mg+ of xanax to get high, and when I get my prescription of 30 30mg temazepam I always eat half of the rx and rarely feel high. like I said I think my gaba is completely burnt from all of the past phenazepam overdoses and from drinking.

No, nothing like phenazepam, especially clonazolam which is not much of a sleep inducer/hypnotic, it is more of a very powerful anxiolytic. Badly measured doses of flubromazolam...hell the 1mg pink capsules of flubromazolam I obtained, yesterday I had 2mg with an OTC promethazine pill (50m) and I'm still groggy after waking up 12 hours later. 4 capsules of 0.5mg equaling 2mg will chill me big time, but isn't as strong of an amnesic like its cousin clonazepam which easily creates anterograde amnesia with just a 2mg pill for non habitual users. I guess if i had taken more flubro-lam yesterday, I couldn't see straight. It's already hard to keep focused on what I want to type..I know my limit for this stuff will be 1 capsule, as it easy, but, since summer is arriving and the huge outdoor parties and concerts for the St-Jean-Baptiste (Quebec National Holiday) on the 24th and Canada Day on the 1st. They will come in handy when a nice trip on a tryptamine or phenethylamine. I never did any phenethylamine except for 2C-I. I'm hesitating in between Methyllescaline, Proscaline, Allylescaline, Escaline (I got no idea how similar or dissimilar these are to mescaline, but it must be close enough, I want to experience the mescaline head space and trip at least once in my life, I had about 250 LSD trips and about a hundred shrooms trip and 30-40 aMT trips or 2c-E  because the only place that stocks what I want the most, 4-ho-det need you to print a form and rescan it and send it to them, with my signature and shit...so I hesitate, as for tryptamines i might end up trying are either 4-HO-MET or 4-HO-MIPT. I'll probably end up buying a little of a phen and of a tryp. Phenethylamines are usually less prone to cause paranoia/bad trips unless we're speaking of aMT, because that one's a winner. I want to keep the flubromazolam capsules and use my regular rx instead and save those for really bad times, comedowns and such.


So this is kinda of a cross-board posting and even if a compound is said to be causing anxiety in the second part of the trip. over-thinking negative thoughts, unable to sleep at all like 4-aco-dmt did 3 out of 4 times, I only enjoyed myself the first time, because I guess i wasn't alone, even if friend stupidly dropped etizolam powder on his finger and then had to lick it all, so he spent most of the time sleeping on one of my couches. I was pretty pissed off it was MY etizolam baggie, he probably had 15-20mg at once, the idiot.


Anyway with these flub-lam 1mg capsules, I say bring em on, it would cancel any bad trip in about 15 minutes. But I sure don't want to do 4-aco-dmt anymore and even if i wanted 4-ho-dmt...well...no need for the internet, at least for me ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Sounds nice, I think my next order will be off the flub. 

I just received my clonazoLAM! it arrived in a stealthy package, witty a vacuum packed silver bag containing 4 plastic zip bags with 25 .5 mg pellets each for a total of 100.

pic: [imghttp://pho.to/9TTxN    [/img]


so to begin with I took four (2mg) to start out with. 

I hope it feels good and didn't take a long time to kick in.

my tolerance is so high that it's hard to get high in most benzos after smoking a bowl of high 

 po muchtency we'd

This is the strongest benzo I have ever seen, in regards to decision-making and effects that you can actually feel.


Compared to nearly all benzos, this one diminishes any common sense and you will NOT care about anything. However, it's the best feeling the world.

id recommend not buying large quantitys of this stuff, its not like etizolam or other rc benzos. this is like a real full blown benzo with nasty wds after not very long of continuous use.


i only ever buy 10 at a time stop me going overboard, just after 4 days i need to take one to function normally..


this is a real nice benzo dont get me wrong but watch out, stay safe

Hey guys just FYI i found out the hard way ;but clonazolam stays in a womans breast milk even 4 days after last taking 1 . I had a large amount of PFBF ,and Oxycodone in me ,and after sucking my womans breast for a while about 30 mins later I could not breath at all . So I had the ambulance called ,and went to the hospital , I told them I use benzos often ,but have not used in a couple days ,and I use opiates everyday . Well they shot me up with Flumazenil ,and nalxone after ,but they said the Flumazenil is what saved me so apparently it was ;because of benzos in my wifes breast milk . Be careful guys .

i dont even know what to say to that. You know they sell milk at the store right...had to say it. to each their own as they say. Personally if your drinking enough of your wifes breast milk it got you high id find a new fetish bro. But all jokes aside you dont think that it was that you were having trouble breathing bv of the opiates (and as extremely potent one of them is) and the fact that 30min of tit sucking could easily be the cause of the trouble breathing (obviously you were not completely unable to breath or youd suffocate before the ambulance even got there). And if that really did happen where you oded on clonazolam the way you described naloxone would save you more than a benzo antagonist since benzos alone cause way less respiratory depression if any at all and are much safer in general.

Decided to take advantage of ChemTheory's 50% off everything offer, so I ordered my 100 Clonazolam for £15. Package arrived next day but the pellets seem so much weaker than other vendors which I have used which is a disappointment.

I don't understand the original application of meclonazepam as an animal anti-fungal or dewormer. How does a simple  benzo do that? Sure clonazepam for instances can be used for other things than anxiety and is used a lot in neurology for seizures of certain kinds (up to 20mg a day(!)). Like some others are sometimes script only for muscle relaxation when things like cyclobenzaprine and orphenadrine are contraindicated (so many people on SSRI's so throwing tetracyclic antidepressants, which cyclo is although not used for depression at all, like how Desyrel is never used for depression. Only other options are zanaflex and benzos (we dont have soma here). So some people get low dose valium, the 2mg ones as a muscle relaxant if they have zero tolerance it should work I guess.

I think this might be my new favorite benzo. Anyone else agree?


But I've only tried Xanax, Clonazepam, Valium, Lorazepam, Etizolam and Phenazepam so my experience is limited, there may be a few gems I've yet to sample. But for real, can anyone name a benzo that beats this one in terms of overall kickass-ness?

^Im seriously loving this one. I'm usually able to moderate myself fairly well with benzos (once a week max or so) but since ordering these I found myself taking them more frequently than I'd like to. No bueno.


This benzo offers the best of EVERY world. It's every bit as sedating and 

muscle relaxing as some good ol Valium (and it lasts just as long if not longer), but it has the nice jolly hypnotic anxiolysis of something like Clonazepam. I think this is also the only benzo to give me actual euphoria, the only other one being Etizolam. Plus, the amnesia seems to be on par with an equivalent dose of etiz - the least amnesia inducing of the whole bunch.


Plus it's wicked potent. .125mg (quarter pill) will make a hellish day at work pass by in a breeze

I prefer Nitrazepam/Mogadon the most of all benzos, it's still around here,5 and 10mg tabs....had 10mg tabs only once and not from a doctor, its the only benzo I never managed to get from a doctor, I even managed to get halcion scripted for fear of flight (a .125mg while in the airport, a 0.25mg before take off, if it wasn't enough, the next time I could have 0.5mg before take off. It was great to depart from Germany and suddenly wake up in Canada,didnt even react to the landing part.


If i ever find someone with Nitrazepam again, I'll have a good stash for optimal trade, even if only 5mgs, which I had more than once, but not often either. Nitrazepam is so fully euphoric and a strong hypnotic, you wake up, but not too groggy, at least, with not more than 20mg and you get residual anxiolytic effects that last practically all day longl

This is definitely a potent chem if you get the genuine article. First  time tried took 1mg as I do have a bit of a tolerance. It kicked in  about 30 mins later. I agree with previous posters about the euphoria.  It was great. Like a warm blanket feeling of life is great. When that  wears off you feel nice an relaxed. Would 100% advise moderation. I.e  small amounts and I would say from personal experience do not take for  more than two days in a row. If you have already done this then please  taper. 


The second time I took it I got carried away. Three days  later I had no memory of the previous days at all. Came to sitting in a  bed in friends house with no idea of how I got there and thinking it was  the tuesday when it was really thursday ! Don't know how much I must  have taken but must have been in excess of about 5-6 mg if not more over  the three days.

Started to get dependent on these. The great next-day anxiolytic properties followed by a nagging, crushing rebound anxiety the day after that, was tempting me to re-dose too often. Anyhoos, I've spotted it early and am using some diclazepam to bring me back to my senses, lol. Oooh, watch out for this beastie.

Agreed with mildo, I say stay away from pressed "pellets" and get yellow capsules. They might both say 0.5mg, but the pellets are inferior chemically, while I'd bet a lot of money whats in the yellow capsules is 99% pure.

Edit to add: How long after my last line should I take a Clonaz if it is indeed good to stop my coke binge?

Basically any benzo is good for a coke comedown, but I remember during my year where I blew over say the price of a used Audi from 2003 (staying away from mentioning money amounts as per BL policy), I was turning it into freebase almost all the time, sometimes leave me 2 tp 4 lines to snort. I'd have zero horrible comedown from that coke, I suggest drinking a moderate amount of beer, it actually potentiates coke, and prolongs the high if you smoke self-made freebase. I fondly remember when I was drunk enough and smoked enough bowls, I would snort a few lines and would fall asleep in an euphoric state. 


Good coke just doesn't give one a bad comedown if you had enough and you're okay with putting the brakes and go to bed, the comedown should be minimal or even fall asleep in an euphoric state.


ps I do not condone any cocaine use, I really want to emphasize on that, the kind of people who deal with that, like my dealer for that awesome delivered to your home fishscale from wow..been 5 years+, he told me not to call anymore with zero explanation. And he's a huge motherfucker, although very nice, not the kind of guy you want to irritate, and they're not helping their own irritativeness(sic) with all that coke he was snorting. It's way too expensive, I took a year worth's of semesters money, only passed 1 out of 2 of them, during the summer in between semesters, my habit got larger and larger and once I failed my freebasing from shit coke from someone I only called when my good connect was not available, and I was there, thinking of all the money I threw at the shit, I got so fucking mad and never did any ever again since then.

Well these are weirdly coloured xanax, looks like 1mg footballs but they're not purple. Also I never saw clonazepam that looks like this, they're white like the 2mg ones,  but I remember that even though when I was scripted 2mg twice a day of clonazepam, the pills were bulky but not THAT bulky. And motherfucker, when I was scripted 150mg lyrica 3 times a day, (these 300mg look way cooler)for my trigeminal neuralgia type II (which is getting less problematic with time, guess the doc who retired on me without warning who was scripting me my opiates and muscle relaxants was right, I didn't believe him because,uhm, isn't the body slowly dying past 30 year old, where physical issues appear even more), or maybe my 20mg script of valium covers the muscle relaxation I need for my jaw bone articulation, the more the nerves will go into this dull boring pain in the area. That's the only reason I haven't started my 1mg less per month or so, i'l try 3 every 3 weeks for the 19-18-17-16mg a day increment, because i'm sure I'll hit a wall at 15mg and be stuck for a while again. It's no big deal according to Dr Ashton.


On topic, sadly i'm out of clonazolam, but at least my source isn't about to stop selling it. Clonazolam doesn't give me much muscle relaxation compared to say valium (or Tetrazepam, which we should have in this country damnit, it's almost totally inactive as a benzo, only used for muscle sprains and such in most of europ), they still script benzos for muscle relaxant effects though if the bunch of crap they try first doesn't work (cyclobenzaprine, robaxin, zanaflex (which is kinda ok), orphenadrine, flexeril (kinda ok too, made me sleep like nothing else when I out of benzos) and Baclofen, which is almost only scripted to people with MS. I might get some, my back needs it badly, and my gf can give a good massage but she says I have so many "knots" in my upper back it's very straining on her hands.

Wrong thread dude.


I'm still curious about how this was used on animals only first as anti-fungal? I'll make my research, although, I have no need for meclonazepam, the 25 or so vendors I know of do not offer it.

been using Clonazolam for a few days now about 14 .5mg pills in 4-5 days with 4 1mg Flubromazolam pills here and there to in between . Will I have bad WD just stopping now. There was a couple days I would mix 1mg of clona with 1mg of flub at the same time . It seems now on the 5th day I dont even feel them anymore . So I want to stop for awhile . Mainly started them to help with opiate WD ,but I was over that in 3 days ,and still kept taking the benzos .

There shouldn't be any withdrawals after just a few days, but coming off from a opioid addiction you'll probably not be in the best mood ever. Stay strong!

Drug tests check for metabolites of pharmaceuticals. These are not shared with Clonazolam (it metabolizes into 4-Hydroxyclonazolam and 8-Aminoclonazolam iirc). Read [Characterization of the four designer benzodiazepines clonazolam, deschloroetizolam, flubromazolam, and meclonazepam, and identification of their in vitro metabolites](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11419-015-0277-6).

Heh to the guy who said he mixed 2. Just for the hell of it, I had 2mg xanaxm 2mg clonazolam and 1mg flubromazepam, triazolo hat trick! :D


Although, I would have preferred a baseline provide by either my valium script or some flubromazePAM, while its stil  time, next payday i'll get as much as I can afford in 8mg pills as I don't know any non-UK places that sell it. At least we still got powdered etizolam over here.


I'm out of clonazolam though, that's mostly why I posted here....I think I prefer it to flub-lam which when take I more than 1 1mg capsule per 24 hours, I feel like when Seconal was still available (mmm seconal, they removed it along all good barbs in nov 2004, at lest I had the chance to get a script of 15 a year for 3 years of it), but without the euphoria seconals would produce. I'm still on the upswing from a real bad idea, I fucked up while attempting to do this thing I thought I had perfected where I was able to take half the powder in the gelcap and close it back. So waking up at what, 8pm more than 17 hours later, I was so knocked out, it felt like an antipsychotic, so I ate something then went back to bed,  it's better now.


Even if I was taking 2mg of clonazolam, I didn't get this feeling of well..for the first time ever, I know what a benzo hangover is, qne i'm on benzos every since 8 years and 2 months now.


It took me forever to type this and I'm sick of correcting typos. Just sayin' respect how strong that thing is, the flub-lam, I'll keep them for days when I'm out and refill day is in a good while or when a psy trip is unpleasant,

Damn is it only me that does NOT bother doing this. I would maybe do it with a psychedelic that works better when smoked (freebase DPT oil > DPT Hcl by far for example). Everyone's everywhere I go is mixing stuff in PG. And I say that as someone who makes his own e-liquid (for my e-cig).


I have a kind of concern too regarding PG but not for that reason. I stopped smoking 7 months ago now, switched to vaping, I buy some pre-made liquid, mostly 18mg, 24mg is too strong for me and 12mg too weak. What's going on in is after 3 months after my last smoke, my lungs should have stopped pushing out all that crap that I spat out all the fucking time, I need a trash can to spit in next to me all the time, and thank fuck I work from home, because since about may, I get this constant annoyance of my sinus and or throat to be full of phlegm, and I have to the really disgusting to everyone's ears. Problem is that the stuff is so sticky, it's so difficult to get out. I bought a Sinus Rinse kit, helps a little, sometimes after using it something will get expelled not by my own control out of my nose. Anyway, if it's not my sinus that are full of phlegm, when I actually managed to spit out what was there, soon my throat will be the place where I got a shitload of phlegm and i'm constantly clearing my throat, its covered with the same extremely sticky mucus, which when I manage to finally spit out is totally white, but sometimes it has some pink specs and some, mostly when I manage to expel what was in my sinuses, something that feels solid will come out and it will be black and green like in the couple months where I first started to stop smoking.


Sometimes both areas are full of that sticky shit and it's hard to breathe until I manage to spit something out. 3/4 of the time it will just be white stuff thats so sticky running water in the sink wont get it in the tide down the hole. I tried tons of stuff, brand store desloratadine, cyclizine, brompherenamine+ pseudo pill, that one helped but not for long, so I resigned myself to ask for the OTC 50mg Histantils explaining my situation, pharmacist agreed and he scripted me 30 like usual. (be warned, promethazine + bupe is awesome, but do not add a benzo to it, at least not a uber strong benzo like flub-lam).


So yeah, is this PG that is causing this ? or the vegetable oil? most juice contains both PG and VO, and someone told me on a e-cig site that PG can cause phlegm. It's so fucking annoying for me and also my girlfriend, who although understands its not my fault, its really annoying to be around me since this started.

Took 0.5mg Clonazolam (at least I think I took the right dose, it says 0.1ml/0.5mg on the bottle so I pulled the plunger back until the little black pointer was at 0.1mg)  30 minutes ago, put on some Pink Floyd, and i'm starting to feel real nice. I like this stuff already. Also, I took 200mg Caffeine, 500mg Phenibut, and 25mg Tianeptine before working out two hours ago but I take all that daily. My benzo tolerance should be low, even though I abused them in the past currently I haven't taken any in the last week. Not sure if Phenibut is cross tolerant with c-lam. Either way we'll see where the night takes me im working on getting some weed tonight to boost the buzz. Maybe add another 0.5 c-lam and one beer later on. It's the weekend i'm looking to get fucked up tbh. I will not drive no matter what though. I don't plan on using this stuff to get wasted in the future, just use as needed for my anxiety issues. I don't want to get addicted but man I have 150mg of this stuff left...holy crap that's a lot lol. Might have to trade some away with my friends for weed or whatever else they may have. Anyway, bottom line I like this benzo a lot so far.

Also I never saw clonazepam that looks like this, they're white like the 2mg ones,  but I remember that even though when I was scripted 2mg twice a day of clonazepam, the pills were bulky but not THAT bulky. And motherfucker, when I was scripted 150mg lyrica 3 times a day, (these 300mg look way cooler)for my trigeminal neuralgia type II (which is getting less problematic with time, guess the doc who retired on me without warning who was scripting me my opiates and muscle relaxants was right, I didn't believe him because,uhm, isn't the body slowly dying past 30 year old, where physical issues appear even more), or maybe my 20mg script of valium covers the muscle relaxation I need for my jaw bone articulation, the more the nerves will go into this dull boring pain in the area. That's the only reason I haven't started my 1mg less per month or so, i'l try 3 every 3 weeks for the 19-18-17-16mg a day increment, because i'm sure I'll hit a wall at 15mg and be stuck for a while again. It's no big deal according to Dr Ashton.

> On topic, sadly i'm out of clonazolam, but at least my source isn't about to stop selling it. Clonazolam doesn't give me much muscle relaxation compared to say valium (or Tetrazepam, which we should have in this country damnit, it's almost totally inactive as a benzo, only used for muscle sprains and such in most of europ), they still script benzos for muscle relaxant effects though if the bunch of crap they try first doesn't work (cyclobenzaprine, robaxin, zanaflex (which is kinda ok), orphenadrine, flexeril (kinda ok too, made me sleep like nothing else when I out of benzos) and Baclofen, which is almost only scripted to people with MS. I might get some, my back needs it badly, and my gf can give a good massage but she says I have so many "knots" in my upper back it's very straining on her hands.

The klonopin pictured are yellow and .5mg.  I believe they are sandoz or qualitest brand. The xanax in the picture were not 1mg but .5mg. I can't remember off the top of my head which brand they were at the time, but I think they are the ones with an s then a number. The same brand that makes the rare green triscored bars. 

And about you referring to muscle relaxers.. as you can see in the picture, I am rx'd baclofen 10mg for muscle spasms in the cervical spine area. Thus med cause a terrible physical dependency that rivals that of bz wd syndrome if not worse. While this may all seem of topic, please stick with me.

I received 100 .5mg clonazolam pellets in the mail. It came in 4 packages of 25. I got into the first package that was clearly labeled with a picture of the clam nomenclature along with a pic of the molecule. Completely legal as analog laws only cover analogues of schedule 2

You known I like this stuff a lot its a solid all around benzo very strong but after you've had major Heroin, cocaine, lsd, and mxe problems in the past I just don't how any Benzo can be considered recreational and euphoric in the slightest. Maybe its just me though. I Just feel numb and tired. Nothing special even tho this took.me.forever to type out.

No benzodiazepine will ever be as recreational as the drugs you mentioned. Those with low self esteem and anxiety like them a lot, but at the end of the day..it's not going to fix your problems and only causes even more of them.

Well said benzodiazepines have always been therapeutic medicine for me and not much else. My self esteem is fine these days but I can see these being a god send for my anxiety disorder only when I get tolerant to the overpowering sedating wobble effects. I was stupid to get my hopes after reading all those reviews about people feeling euphoria from this. I felt calm and anxiety free but not much else noteworthy. I think the come on was the most recreational part and even then it wasn't too great. Hell I couldn't even sleep more then 6 hours after last nights dose even though I'm still feeling wobbly this morning. Going to the gym soon hope I don't fall on my face lol. 


Basically I think I rather take flubromazepam or etizolam for anxiety I don't need nasty c-lam withdrawals. C-lam is solid but I just don't understand all the hype. Good benzo med and not much else. Also keep in mind I was addicted to clonozepam and etizolam in the past. Currently I'm addicted to 500mg Phenibut a day plus 25mg Tianeptine. Who knows if those meds interfere with the c-lam. Still good to have this out there on the RC market for the benzo experienced.

I was just thinking since I take 500mg Phenibut a day maybe 0.5mg of c-lam is way to low a dose for me. I just feel kind of meh after taking .5mg. If I were to take say 1mg more will I be ok? I don't want too much sedation because I have some shit to do today. I don't want to lay on my couch doing nothing all day. Also, is there anyway to combat benzo sedation. All I have is caffeine pills, Sulbutimane, L-Tyrosine, Tianeptine, and Pramiracetam. I wouldn't say this c-lam is moreish except for that euphoric feeling that I'm chasing which I haven't felt yet. Or even just that content feeling. I just feel like a tired zombie so far.


Edit: Smoked two blunts and had two blunts since posting that felt good and social. A bit sedated but the weed kicks me right out that sedation for a bit. I still cant tell if I took too much c-lam or too little. Anyway enjoying cole slaw and fried chicken from Royal Farms.

okay so I'm new here but I have a  Question. I've taken a yellow gelcap about two hours ago and haven't really felt much. Is it because the gel caps could act as like time release? Sorry if I'm wrong I'm just confused because people say .5 has then on their ass and I have no tolerance and barely feel anything.


Also I forgot to mention I had taken 250mg flub-PAM for two days a week and a half ago. Maybe that can affect it?

I have use last weekend a moderate amout of heroin and after cleaning my room found one pink c-lam pill. I only ingested the 0,5 mg but was nodding off hardcore, like from no other benzo except maybe flunitrazepam, if i take one pill only.

These are strong, highly addicting and have the worst rebound symptoms of any benzo i ever took. Even from one pill i felt bad as they wore off two days later. Even having a small panic attack as i needed to piss at the sub doc and faked the UA like i always do(without any fears).


Today i found another one behind my PC as i changed the grafikcard, and was happy like christmas, this shows how addicting they are. The postal service strikes for 3 weeks allready , for that reason i cant get more now.


But i fear if i order more (preferably powder), my usage would quickly escalate, so i am not sure if i will order again, and how much. Watch out, i can see this become dangerous.


What is ECP?

This is the truth man ,and I have had many benzos . Very Addicting I took 30 of them in 2 and a half weeks . Anywhere from 1-2mg a day . I was ripping the caps apart ,and snorting them . Well long story short I am out ,and now on the 2nd day of WD ,and actually last night slept a bit more then the first night but it was most likely ;because I found a few empty caps that had some tiny amounts of powder left in them I swallowed . The first night without I was twitching pretty bad with some insane anxiety worrying I was going to have a seizure . I am hoping like most benzos after the 48 hour mark the chance for seizures is half . Ill post tomorrow what tonight is like . I have some pretty weak muscles to . Mostly my legs feel like giving out in short walks.


BTW: Every morning it was like a ritual with snorting 1mg . It would hit so hard almost a head rush . Very relaxed feeling . I had grown from getting to tired on them they actually didn't make me sleepy anymore . I would snort 1mg ,and drink a few cups of coffee every morning ,and thats how my day started . Sad thing is I have 120 of them on the way now . Hope I can control myself ,but I will most likely use all 6 of the 250 0.6mg squirt PFBF nose sprays (if you don't know what PFBF is its a fentanyl analog) first before working on the clona . I really enjoy this benzo though more than any other ,but I still like my opiates way more . I am so glad that opiate WD is much easier then benzo WD or I would pay much more hell each month as I WD from opiates almost every month . I started out by using this benzo for opiate WD ,and told myself I would only use for three days to get through the opiate WD ,and boy was I wrong . I was gonna put the rest up for a rainy day ,but that didn't work out to well .


EDit again: Don't mix this with any opiate . I also almost died by mixing this with a fent analog . BLue lips ,and was nodding like no other . Want ever do it again . My wife was not home so I would not have been able to be saved by naloxone . I had a high tolerance to PFBF to 21.6mg of PFBF a day ,but my benzo tolarance at the time was low .250mg of clonaz would have put me on my ass. I underestimated how strong this benzo was I was new to it ,and went into it thinking I could mix the same amount of it as I do xanax with my opiate of choice at the time .

I am really considering switching over from Etizolam to Clonozolam. For one, it is an actual benzo, unlike Etizolam which is a thieno. For two, I really want something with a longer half-life.


Between my Etizolam and my Xanax, I find myself having to redose constantly, making my consumption a bit more difficult to manage. And neither one helps the other in terms of withdraw ime.

Me porsonally I find Etizolam to be not as strong at all . I think .5mg of clonaz is like 1.5mg of Etizolam . Clonazolam is way more compulsive to me also ,but this may just be me .

Be forewarned.  As someone with EXTENSIVE drug usage history myself, over five years and several months clean off a former hardcore IV heroin/speedball habit - still dabble in psychedelics and benzos, am a daily weed smoker, but my benzo tolerance is moderate - if taking alprazolam, I have gotten up to regularly taking 4-6 mg/day at least, lately when I take benzos I will take a mixture of etizolam + diclazepam (and have experimented with adding clonazolam to this mix).  I usually take about 6-7mg of etizolam, along with 4-5mg of diclazepam.  If mixing clonazolam, or even if taking it on it's own, be VERY FUCKING CAREFUL.  I have tried all of the conventional prescription benzos, all of the non-conventional ones (flunitrazepam/rohypnol, midazolam/versed, etc.) as well as all of the RC benzos thus far (including those I named plus flubromazolam, flubromazepam, deschloroetizolam, nifoxipam, meclazepam, pyrazolam and a few others I can't recall offhand) and this is by far the strongest one of them all that I have yet to try.  This shit makes me experience retrograde amnesiac effects at doses of clonazolam *alone* of 3.5-4mg (consider my tolerance, folks) and despite the fact that up to a certain point after ingestion (roughly T+2.5-3 hours or so) I am incredibly social, outgoing, friendly, trusting/naive (very strange for me as I consider myself highly street-smart and wise to most people's bullshit) and will often wake up roughly 12-16 hours or so after last recalling myself checking what time it was.  When I awake I notice that I have invariably ALWAYS began some new huge mega-project around my house of some kind, gone shopping and bought ridiculous shit, lost personal items and then found them, and have had conversations with people in person and even applied for grants for my business/managed to acquire a lucrative contracted deal for my company (a conversation with this person who went for the deal I have ZERO recollection of this happening, whatsoever).  


I should note that I have epilepsy (resulting from a traumatic brain injury) and I can't help but feel that this in some way fucks with my already wonky sense of balance and tendency to have freaky, random, whole-body intense muscle jerks/spasms, some of which have led to me slipping and falling, almost as if I was nodding out on heroin or something, and smashing my face into my dining room table.  This was on 2.5 mg and a .5 gram joint of some Purple Urkle.  Please be careful guys, this is not one to be taken lightly.

^You either have a ridculously high tolerance or your product is bunk. Don't know from pellets but can confirm that this has a rotten, nasty taste that is very distict from the bitterness of other benzos when in a solution. All three sources I've tried had the same exact taste and it is fucking terrible.


Edit:I see you ment .5mg instead of 5mgs. The gel caps seem sketchy to me. I feel much more comfortable making my own 50mgs/10mls solutions or even buying pre made ones. I wouldn't suggest making your own with this one unless you've had a lot of practice.

It's a great benzo but if you don't respect it's power you can really ruin your life. I can handle massive amounts of benzos.

I received 4 packages of 25 .5mg pellets (pink). 

I received them one afternoon after doing a couple bags of dope. Long story short I got into one of the packets and now I am up on charges (3 felonies, 6 misdeanors). I want even conscious when I was charged. I was in the back of an ambulance while they were digging through my car wracking up bogus charges. For example I have a charge of possession with intent to deliver on the clonazolam. What a bs charge! Clonazolam is legal! The analog laws don't apply because it has to be an analogue of a schedule 1 or two substance. I was charged with possession with intent on lsd. It was urine in a medicine bottle that my girlfriend had stored for a personal matter but in her incoherent clonazolam ramblings she confessed to her bottle of urine as being an lsd analogue. Wtf LSP? Anyways joking aside my life can be ruined. They loaded me with crazy ass charges and I wouldn't harm a fly not sell drugs to anyone.

I'm not saying clonazolam is a bad drug , in just begging you to respect it and start very low, even if you have a tolerance. Benzos have a narrow therapeutic range. Maybe you take. 25mg and get sedation and anxiolysis that is perfect, then maybe you take .5mg and black out and wake up in a hospital or maybe not wake up at all. 

If you don't have a scale and don't know chemistry enough to make a pg solution to dose properly, stay far from the powder. 

This can turn out to be a beautiful new benzo that is there for us when our irresponsible doctors decide to abruptly stop our rxs of clonazolam for no reason, or we can end up with another phenazepam situation. This is why i beg of you all to please be responsible with this Chimg

I feel you are really minimizing a whole class of drug users by making such a narrow generalization. Benzos are a miracle for aborting difficult psychedelic trainwrecks, healing the mental agony caused by some stim comedowns, and even potentiating other drugs. 

While what you said is true to a point, if you don't face your anxiety without any chemicals to numb it out, you will never realize who you are and what role your ego plays in building the fake you this compounding the problem until dementia sets in. But that kind of stuff can happen when any medication is abused for its therapeutic effects.

Less is more with this stuff. I took .25mg last night three hours after binging on H all day and felt fucking amazing before getting great sleep. Took .5mg this morning felt fine all day. Last week I was taking 1-3mg per day and was a stumbling useless mess.

I get mine .5mg from Sweden to ,and they are the tiny yellow caps ,and I can assure you they are not bunk at least the site I buy mine from <snip>. Enjoy your blackout . I find they take a bit longer to come on swallowing them ,but breaking the caps open 2 or 3 .5mg caps ,and snorting them almost gives a head rush . This is after building a tolerance to the sleepy effect benzos give though .

Great thread, so much subjective data it's hard for me to glean what I need when I myself have my own subjective data needs for these such things.


For those familiar with flubramaZOLAM: would you say this is similar, due to its long half life, so that when taken late at night during the beddy-bye hours it produces basically an unreconcilable hangover effecting a more or less total wasted following day? This I notice with flubramaZOLAM (at dosages around 0.125-.5 mg administered around bedtime). In that regard flubramazolam is not something i tread lightly unless it's for daytime benzo land.


FlubromazaPAM, which IMO is the best of all these newfangled RC benzos, lasts a shitload long time as well but doesn't leave one feeling groggy and foggy headed the next morning day even though the drug is still clearly working. It just goes on keeping you feeling nice and faded, albeit the best of the buzz has long since passed. Never found it all that sedating either tho nor producing too much brain fog like the flubromazolam has me done.


Now this CLONAZOLAM seems like it sits subjectively somwhere between the two for you people. Take it late at night and it is a ride but then one risks a blackout due to its narrow dosing window. Yet is the following day is ruined a la flubromAZOLAM in which you can't seem to shake the fuzziness, or is it more foregiving and gentle on the wakeup and consciousness in general as flubramAZAMP and the traditional benzos, valium, temaz, etc. (except for alprazolam, which I'd always considered to be the hangover benzo and worst for almost all purposes). 


Basically I know it has a prohibitively long half life for recreational useage as well as narrow dosing window but does this stuff ruin your following day the way flubromazolam will if taken too closely to bedtime? Don't plan on making a daily habit out of this but flubromazolam has pretty conclusively showed me that it's no good for treating insomina under any conditions, not even in stim comedown recovery. Seeing where clonazolam fits in, though the perils of addiction i am well aware as concerning this subject (regular benzo use).

I find just one 0.5mg to be very functional, yes i'm a daily user, legally since 2007, but I don't have a large habit when only relying on my rx scripts, which is what I do, I take the RC's when I don't feel like 20mg valium will cut it that day, for multiple kind of reasons. I won't put myself back on the large tolerance that was that 2mg of clonazepam upon waking up and another in the evening...So yeah 0.5mg isn't supposed to knock most people down. If you're a 100lbs girl, there is chances you will fall asleep, or if you're a kid...but I see someone give an RC to a kid, they would end up in the hospital and i'd sneak in and unplug the morphine drip.

Probably fillers yeah. There was a theory a while ago about vendors making bitter benzodiazepine pellets so people (especially children) who somehow find them and think they might be sweets don't eat a handful.


Personally I kinda like that taste though lol.

If even the generic makers of the diazepam i'm scripted to, Apotex, don't bother making the pills taste like shit, I doubt grey marketers would do the same. Although diazepam's taste is very very mild. No benzo has ever tasted as awful as xanax. 


Well no benzo. Because, Zopiclone takes the cake as the worst taste of all time.

My self esteem is fine these days but I can see these being a god send for my anxiety disorder only when I get tolerant to the overpowering sedating wobble effects. I was stupid to get my hopes after reading all those reviews about people feeling euphoria from this. I felt calm and anxiety free but not much else noteworthy. I think the come on was the most recreational part and even then it wasn't too great. Hell I couldn't even sleep more then 6 hours after last nights dose even though I'm still feeling wobbly this morning. Going to the gym soon hope I don't fall on my face lol.

Good benzo med and not much else. Also keep in mind I was addicted to clonozepam and etizolam in the past. Currently I'm addicted to 500mg Phenibut a day plus 25mg Tianeptine. Who knows if those meds interfere with the c-lam. Still good to have this out there on the RC market for the benzo experienced.

Hah, when i'm kinda close to nodding, which can happen when I mix in hydroxyzine or promethazine with my morning bupe and morning dose of valium and xanax, I get into this autotyping mode. You're the only people I can speak about this stuff to. All my friends either only smoke weed (which I can only have a tiny bowl of these days, something happened, I think that surprise DOB hit back in '04) that makes weed (but not hash and hash oil, so it's the multitude of different cannabinoids in weed that make me freak out with bad tachycardia. One of the main reason (that I didn't tell my psychiatrst when he evaluatedme back '07) I'm on benzos was to be able to smoke weed and be fine. And my other friends now either left my hometown (and Canada is a large country, if someone moves to Alberta, well, they're 2 time zones away) or are still true to themselves like me, but have girlfriends and kids now. I survive on my second specialty (online assistant sysadmin, I studied enough related to computers by myself since I was 6, my dad buyin me all the computers and gaming consoles I wanted and repeatedly saying, "go to school longer than I did, yeah I make a lot of money but I have no life and a large part of my pay goes into a house I'm only in once every 2 weekends in", so I took his advice and pulled 3 years and a half out of 4 for a Pharmacologist degree (would also allow me to be a pharmacist), but there's 3 damn math classes I never passed that I need to finish to get my real diploma.


So yeah, this is kind of self-therapy, some of you people are more useful than expensive psychologist (psychiatrist visits are paid for in the great white north, not so with psychologists. So fuck giving 75 dollars for 45 minutes to havea friend to talk to.

Well, it's the same main chemical in it.Yeah it does taste like when i chewed on a 2mg bar. I always chew my benzos, but with the 1mg brand name footballs, i just chew it with my front teeth and get minimal taste as I chug the stuff away with water or a softdrink. Softdrinks make benzos kick in faster I find, if you have an empty stomach anyway. Not recommended to drink softdrinks unless it's like Pepsi Throwback with real sugar, which is the only softdrink I ever saw in a long time without HFCS.

Well, I went ahead and bought one bottle of Clonozolam and one bottle of flubromazolam. I couldn't decide which one to buy, so I plan on trying both to figure out which one is more functional. The Etizolam and Xanax is just not cutting it for me any more, and I find myself constantly having to re-dose throughout the day and night due to the short half-life of both.


I am hoping something like one of these two compounds can perhaps help me to kick benzos for good. After two years of this, I am ready for the addiction to be over. I see on this forum a lot of posters are just using these drugs to get high. Although this has been my intention in the past, I must say as a warning to all that this is the kind of thinking and action that got me where I am today. I hate being dependent. I can't live without something to keep me calm and content.


Sorry just venting. Any input on whether or not my plan seems like a good idea is greatly appreciated.

Well my Clonozolam and Flam arrived in the mail today. I'm going to go ahead and take .5 mgs of Clonozolam before I go back in to work and see how it goes.


Hopefully it will aide me in hopping off of this Etizolam train and kicking these benzos for good. I have noticed most of the posters here only talk about using these RC benzos recreationally.


Anyone have any experience using them responsibly to treat anxiety, or to taper off of shorter half-life benzos/thienos like Xanax or Etizolam?


Wow Clonozolam tastes bitter as all hell. Reminds me of how Xanax tastes.


Update: I really like this stuff. Very euphoric, muscle relaxant properties. Feels like an actual benzo unlike Erizolam IMO.

Okay here is something I find odd about this solution. My Etizolam and flam solutions are completely clear, and you see no powder or anything floating around in it.


My Clonozolam solution is yellow and I can actually see white powder floating around and kind of just chilling on the bottom. Is that a manufacturing error or is Clonozolam just generally harder to dissolve? 


They all come from the same source.

Thank you roi.


This chemical certainly does pack a sense of euphoria, one that I do not think I have ever felt with any other benzos. Only functional in very small doses, like no more then maybe .5 mgs every 10 to 12 hours maybe? I am just guessing. Hopefully someone with some actual knowledge/experience with Clonozolam can throw in some input. 


I don't think this would be the best tapering benzo, because I enjoy the effects too much. I see the potentiality for disaster being strong in this one, especially if you drive or have important things to do. I would say this is easily the most potent benzo I have come into contact with. This is coming from someone that takes two milligrams of Xanax daily, along with any where from 3-5 milligrams of Etizolam.


Maybe Flubromazolam would be a better alternative? I have read through this forum and the opinions seem to go back and forth about it.


Either way Clonozolam is a gem for sure.

I am surprised this thread is not more active. Does anyone have experience using this to taper, or just for taking for GAD on a daily basis, similar to Clonazepam? What were your dosages?


Also is there a Flubromazolam mega thread? I can't seem to locate one via search bar.

I'm gonna get this very soon I think, I'm tired of paying street prices for Klons and xanax all the time it gets pricey. I gotta be careful beause of my Sub doctor, but my insurance is gonna run out in a few months anyway with it so in a way I'm just like screw it, I can use the alchohol mehtod or if I decide to shoot low dose amounths I cout have enought for another two years...that or just bit the bullet and go on done' since I feel a ful agonist woud help me more than a partial agonist since when I was using Oxys/hydro/Morphine/dilies a never felt a need to get benzo's, athough I woud get like 10 once in a blue moon just to get them....kinda rambling, haven't really had any Oxy in something like 4-6 months and snorted 4 20mg Roxis at 6:30, then shot 60mg at 1030, along with 3mg of klon this morn 3 before work and 2 when I got home( I haven't been taking my subs cept about 800mcg a day the past 4 days getting ready for the litte roxi. Kinda pissed, was suppose to get 12 but only got 7, wanted some for my day off but got pissed and just did them today. Anyway, ya I would like to try this with my subs at .5-1mg a day with my Sub instead of buying off the street..if it was up to me I woud have a few ounces of all the benzo's online just to have,(of course I woudn't take them all, just would be nice to have,lol.

I am extremely interested in hearing more of your personal take on this RC, as we are in the same boat.   If there are any major/minor details you think I could benifit from  I would be forever grateful.    I truly need to stop this madness.  I just spent $1,750 on xanaxc in teh past 4 days.   It's absolutely absurd!   I  MUST stop this now!

Are you the guy who made the post a while back about using diclaz to taper from etizolam at like 11mg a day or something? 


I take two .5mg etizolam doses throughout the day with 1mg at night usually. I know the doses are extremely low, and I could quit with only minimal discomfort... but I don't want too. I just can't deal with being completely sober right now. Can't smoke, drinking again (been 5 years sober) is something I am getting closer to doing, and that would be a disaster...


Thinking about ordering some clonazapam bc etizolam doesn't last all that long. Taking like a .25mg dose, would it leave me functional the same as etizolam does or what?

Hey guys, I'm new here, and an experienced user with opiates and somewhat with benzos. I'm 19 years old, and hope to have a long life ahead of me. 

I was a junky (mainly hydro's and shooting roxies) for ~6 months and then cleaned up. I used benzos at party's and that sort moreso than I'd like to admit.


Recently a friend introduced me to RC benzos and I received a vile of 30mg Cloanzolam dissolved in 30ml of propylene glycol. The solution had a strange solvent smell to it, but I drew up a ml and mixed it in a red bull. Drank the 1MG over about 30min and bengan to feel calm, happy, and relaxed. But not quite where I wanted to be. Took another 1mg, and blacked out. 


Now here's where it gets scary. I woke up with a half ful boody insulin needle, belt loose on my arm, and a dose or 2 missing from the bottle. I can see where I shot up, and it looks like I hit the vein, but its incredibly swolen and slightly tender. I'm worried of the safty of injecting PG? I have never injected benzos before but new they should be IVable in a correct PC and water mix. Am I ok, if I injected 2ml of undiluted PG and I'm somewhat worried. 


Word of advice, dont fuck with stupid potent triazol benzos unless you read up 100% before doing so and never inject them. This C-lam is still affecting me almost 24 hours later and I had to call out of work cause I can barely walk straight.

I'd go get checked out if I were you - cause it's swollen and tender, really, and cause I've only ever read about people injecting a PG/water mix. Better to be a little embarrassed and make sure nothing is wrong than for something dreadful to happen man. Stay safe.  


Clonazolam imho would be absolutely awful as a tapering drug, it's ridiculously euphoric. 1 month into what was a very long etizolam addiction and they were ruined for me. 1 month taking Clonazolam and they were very nearly as good as the first time I took them (1mg of Clonazolam had me absolutely flying at a time when 10mg+ etizolam didn't even touch the sides, go figure) 


 They're pretty much the perfect example of a recreational benzo in my opinion - way more fun than any other I've ever tried. Which is exactly what makes them dangerous to do more than a couple times a month, max! Fortunately I've been off them for a good couple of months now, go me ^-^

Been lurking on and off over the years. Bluelight is definitely the bible of anecdotal substance use. I feel compelled to thank you all off the bat for building this place, and I feel bad for my first post being not a contribution, but a question for my own personal benefit. So yeah, I'm acknowledging and apologizing for the selfishness right now.


With that said, A friend has dabbled with benzos, namely alprazolam on and off over the years. Never taken any for more than 15 consecutive days, though that 15 day experience with (2-4mg/day) alprazolam left him feeling pretty shitty for the three days after his last dose. Nothing life ruining, no fear of seizures, just really anxious and a bit detached. It passed.

So, this buddy of mine has tried etizolam for a few consecutive days but wasn't entirely enthralled. Clonazolam turned up and seemed to provide much more in what my bud was looking for. One .5mg does the trick for the whole day, taken at about noon or so in two .25 doses. he wakes up feeling very rested, clear headed, and his dexterous job goes as smoothly as it ever does. I realize this could be attributed the afterglow effect, but he honestly feel much more normal the next morning as opposed to still lightly buzzed or euphoric. Normal is the best word for it. It has been about 4 consecutive days since use began. He's tried sticking it out from a morning dose, waiting until late afternoon to take my next to see if he feels any WDs but nothing happens beyond mild irritability and a little extra dose of manageable anxiety. He plans on take a solid 24-48 hrs off on Monday and Tuesday to see what happens with a few days worth of downtime. 

I'm asking primarily because most subjective encounters with similar situations come from people with a long list of added substances in the mix, and so I'm reluctant to take them at face value with that in mind. I'm looking to hear from folks who are not already in neck deep, or people who were in a similar situation but wound up buried by this shit. The long and short of it is, I've been unable to find anecdotes pertaining to isolated use of C-lam in small doses over shorter periods of time. I'm happy to be referred to any links and such, and I do realize that is has been briefly covered, at least in part, by members here. I'm simply looking for pretty specific, responsible opinions on the matter. I want to know opinions on safe, light, semi regular use of the substance, if it's at all possible, and what intervals at which I should break up consecutive use. 


I will add that I have no other substance abuse habits save for weed to help me sleep. No alcohol, no nothing. very active, in good shape, etc.


Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you kind folks. And yes, I've ready EVERY post on this thread, twice.

Thanks y'all. I made a doc appt. For Tuesday with my GP. (Who knows of my past drug use) the swelling is about the same, and I think I must have missed the vein. Propoetlyne Glycol is a  pretty safe compound, but I still fee more comfortable getting this looked at by a doctor.


Last month, my friend, (no benzo tolerance) took 2 0.5mg Cloanzolam pills and totaled his car, broke his neck and arm, and the cops found a half a joint in his car so he was arrested for that and lost his job. 


again, I must warn 


DO NOT FUCK WITH TRIAZOLM BENZOS

DO NOT DRINK/DRIVE OF THESS!!!!!


My friend totaled his car and broke his neck, back, and arm. He took 0.750ug of FlubromazEPAM and could have killed us bit

I don't think any triazolobenzodiazepine could possibly be suitable for tapering. I can imagine clonazolam may have a half-life similar to alprazolam (~12 hours at most). Compare with triazolam which is very short-acting and compare 2'-chlorobenzodiazepines with their non-chlorinated counterparts. The 7-aminoclonazolam metabolite shouldn't have a longer half-life either.


I'm actually quite interested in clonazolam's effects, I always wondered how it would feel when I was still taking clonazepam but now that I'm off benzos for almost 2 years, I don't think anything might be worth ruining it. 8)

Yea, the euphoria and "Don't give a fuck" mind set is strong.


Every time I took it, I'm like damn... guess I have a tolerance all the sudden? (and I shit you not) --BOOOM-- euphoria just slams you right in the face and a big ass grin pops up on your face because it's too much for you to handle ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) then progressively, the black out slowly sets in (sometimes).

So most stand to agree Clonozolam is shitty for tapering. What about flubromozolam? I got some of that too but have only been messing with the Clonozolam. I was trying to use it to taper but yeah, too much recreation.

 Too strong at low does, whereas flub is a bit 'weaker' per say, it would be a more viable option as you have much-much more control over your dosages.

No, your friend did not do any of this. Not from 0.75mg of FlubromazePAM as you insisted in capitalizing for emphasis, probably to differentiate it from flubromazolam. 0.75mg of flubromazepam is inactive, practically. The smallest pills are 4mg, and even people with no tolerance would have trouble finding much of (a very long to kick in too) half of that (the 4mg are scored and actually break in 2 unlike the 8's). Please do not shitpost and invent stories, at least if you do, make them entertaining.

Is flub-pam even active at .750ug? I thought clonazepam was active at .25ug... and flub-pam is much weaker.


I think if you took 10mg of flub-lam or 7.5mg of clonazolam, this is possible....

This while a bit unlikely still, my non benzo scripted friends need 2mg to start losing memory of events. After that he spoke of a different chemical with the suffix in CAPSLOLZ so as to warn people about the dangers of 0.75mg FlubromazePAM. Maybe he's genuine, maybe he's freaked out to what happened to the person in the car accident or it's all a troll post. I just had to correct this misinfo. Hope if the guy at the hospital with broken bones walks again and after a while will actually enjoy the opiates he will be taking for a very long time.

**Clonazolam Advise and Using IV with PG and Water Mixture**


I has extensive experience with both Etiz and F-LAM and spent 7-months clean after w/d's like hell complete with the most incredible hallucinations. I got up for about 20/mg of Etiz and 2.5 to 5 mg of F-LAM per day for 8 months straight after building tolerance for 7 months prior - brief background to clarify experience.


Main reason for posting and creating new account to comment: street cred - moderated several pgp only source boards and admin several pgp only source boards, 1 of which is the most prominent today.  Unfortunately I had to distance myself for several years for personal issues. I recently received 100mg/10ml clonazolam in a PG solution and noticed .1/ml is a solid recreational dose to start with after being clean for 7 months.  Crucial part here to set rumors straight as SWIM just did this.... .04mg with .2ml of water shaken in regular 1/ml diabetic syringe.  Shook contents thoroughly and IV to large vein in crux of arm (make sure it a large vein so NO miss can be done - must not miss). I felt effects with 3min tops and became even more relaxed and sedated although was already under the influence, but SWIM plans on trying again tomorrow morning to confirm its effect as I had already dose 1/ml sublingually.  


All things considered, PG works great for IV as long as its balanced with at least 20-units of water in a 1/ml syringe.  Shake vigorously to achieve homogenous mixture and make sure to use a large, dependable vein as to not miss... **MUST NOT MISS **(Makes missing a crack/vinegar shot seem eeeasy).  It was successful, no burn and noticeable effects within 3-mins tops.  However, I will not try again as I it's extremely harmful and abusive.  Please, please, please respect this compound for its potency as I'm sure you're all aware.  But it takes it to a whole lot of conscious and careful planning to make sure not to overdose when using IV or any other ROA for that matter.  If you can sublingual/oral is the best ROAr as I just IV to experiment, save supply and set record straight from the misleading comments on this board.


I have had expensive 15+ year experience in entheogens, pharmacological research, psychedelics, and other "harder" substances and I simply can't stress enough how dangerous these can be. You absolutely must know the proper handling/metric and dosing procedures as well as the tools necessary to accomplish accuracy/practice to ensure you're on-point. It can be extremely dangerous and I'd Never share with anyone aside from my fellow students/lab partners working on the same in vitro research for our upcoming dissertation and masters completion.


Safety and quadruple checking is crucial, please be safe out there ladies and gentlemen. I'd love to catch up (ill try calling when I get a break from clinical studies and treatment of my clients).


Bless you all and stay safe!


PS Edit:  Forgot to mention... I suffered from multiple seizures after using large qualities of F-LAM over 1-5 years continuously and I did suffer at least 2 grand mal tonic clonic seizures.  I was OK and thank goodness I wasn't driving or at work, but with that being said PLEASE be careful with that substance.  The seizure rumors are the blunt truth.  Mine came from the F-Lam, not the etiz although combining such large quantities of each chem had its own effect/influence.  F-LAM has been proven to induce seizures in the past and must be taken in an extreme controlled setting.  Please dose accordingly and don't get drawn into re-dosing in such as habitual fashion.  Be safe ladies and gentleman and best wishes towards successful research.


2nd Edit: In response to ics432'sost's above... he speaks the truth about potency, but the half life is more like 10 hours for clonazolam.  MUST exercise ultimate accurate measurement when performing in vitro research....

Thank you for that extremely detailed and intense post.  You are literally just the person I am looking for.   We both share in common having seizures when coming off benzos (I've had 4 -2 the first time, 2 the second time coming off).   I have a Xanax habit now of somewhere around 20mg a day, taken at once, normally in the early evening.   I don't get high off them, or even that relaxed feeling I used to get.  I am using them now solely so I don't get sick and have seizures.  I have tapered down from even further absurd and probably unbelievable doses to most members of upwards of 100mgs a day.  So now I am at 20mg a day of xanax in one dose.  In your estimation, what would be the equivalency in Clonozolam.   I am receiving (hopefully - god I hope hopefully tomorrow because I am extremely low on xanax and money) 300mg of Clonazolam tomorrow in two 150mg per 30mL PG solution.  Can you give me an honest estimation on where to start?  I've put probably over 50 hours worth of research time into reading stories and accounts of Clonozolam and want to use it to taper off xanax (to avoid seizures, and hopefully not a suicidal withdrawal like the other times).  From my research, .5mg Clonazolam can be equal to as little as 1mg Clonazepam or upwards of 4mg of Clonazepam.   I am almost begging you on my hands and knees for advice on how to accurately dose this compound.   My guess would be to start with 3mg -4mg?   Keep in mind last week there were days I was eating 60mg 80mg of xanax and went about my day as usual (work as a bouncer, family life, etc) without anyone noticing anything.   


I am really hoping to hear back from you.  I do not plan on IVing this, and want to try sublingual first.   Your reply is extremely important to me and I do hope to hear from you soon.


Thank you from the bottom of my heart my friend.

I am still extremely eager to hear  about your experience with Clonazepam, as well since we both are looking to taper.  If you could reply with any further details of effects, duration, overall feeling, etc....basically anything about your experience I would love to hear.

When you get sick of that misery (having 20mg xanax at night only to be able to sleep and feel normal and not fall into seizure), I'm sure your generous doctor will be able to switch you to valium or librium in massive quantity and taper you away. At best, be switched to Clonazepam, it's actually a seizure med too, and its max dosage is 20mg and lasts much longer than xanax and is as strong/difficult to get off of ( I got off clonazepam with valium, not entirely, still on 20mg valium, but from all the 2mg clonazepam pills I was eating, it felt like a huge cloud I didn't even know existed in my brain disappeared... This is not sustainable and we can't really use RC benzos as a crutch, they're almost all bound to be banned, in all countries? Most likely not, Phenazepam is still welcome in Canada, and the only vendor I know who has it sells it in powder, along with Alprazolam powder, yet, a really safe site, according to the now defunct safeorscam. There will be no way to verify new vendors other than that sketch forum chemsrus, which while not being flooded with gay porn, suffers DDOS attacks and the like. It's still the place and only place I found a discount code for a place I've used a long time.


I just made myself sad about the safeorscam thing.

Ok so everyone is talking about how estremely potent this stuff is. It might well be but it also might well be not. I cant tell it could be my benzos receptors are messed up from phenazepam abuse and daily klonopin use. I complulsively redose this stuff and even wake up early to dose. For example, yesterday I had 10ml .5mg/.1ml vial and 5ml .5mg/.1ml vial. Most of the ten ml was taken in one day. Yes I got highg off it, Unlike any other benzso. More like feeling drunk. I actually get agression from it too. My girlfriend and I are constantly fighting after I take it. Here is a picture of what I took yesterday: 

![376e4e36_l.jpeg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.share.pho.to%2F376e4e36_l.jpeg&hash=ddb5949ed22bbda2c773c1b88d6fc7ed)
 .

I must have taken 40 mg yesterday which is crazy and this vendor always has quality products. What is wrong with me? Did I downregulate all of my receptors?

And also if anyone can address the aggression issue.

Can't help ya, didn't know some goof decided to sell liquid clonazolam, it's bound to be imprecise, at best.


I get mine from the people who introduced the product, small yellow barrel like caps, thats what you want, or maybe not and your bzd receptors are fried and would benefit from a break, one that would be survivable with a GABA-B drug, GHB, Baclofen, Phenibut...

What can i say about this very abusive life destroying drug. I fucking love it. I find if you pop enough pellets you completely let loose. Punching holes in walls, abusing family members because they don't understand what a bunch a cunts they are. What ever you do, you must not IV anyless than a gram of Heroin(transcendence). I found heaven, god literally was a 6ft syringe full of 'mophine' he said "do you really want this?' Well ofcourse! This must be heaven, how about it? The prick gave nalaxone and epinephrine the selfish prick, he then preceeded to laugh, coming too i realise it was a nurse laughing at how i had shit myself. 


I'm now hoping to exchange my soul for a lifelong supply of diacetyl moprhine. Satin maybe?

Pam lasts a very long time. Pam can be taken in doses that cause no "like" effects, You can take half a 4mg pill, easily split off 2mg. It's a drug who's required dosages and length of action makes it useful for tapering. Compare with Val and Librium, not hard to see the similarities.

Well this stuff really seems to be causing quite the uproar...


I got some a while ago to comedown from rolling, stims, or something. Haven't had a reason to use in the two months since I've gotten it and from reading all this I'm questioning if I should even keep it around. I find no pleasure from benzos and seems to be real easy to blackout which doesn't interest me at all.


Say I do eventually use this to come down from some kind of stimulant, total benzo novice, .125-.25mg should suffice, yea?

When you have a habit like mine taking a break is not doable. If I were to stop taking benzos for a day I would lose it . It happened to me before whene I ran out of my klons early. Well now my doctor cut me off my klons abd everything else so Im withdrawling from a SHIT load of stuff.,  The clonazolam is helping keeping the clonazepam and temazepam withdrawal at bay but not completely alleviating it.

If you ask me, clonazolam feels more like chloral hydrtate than any other benzo. Now Ive had pellets too that were very good and felt theh same as the liquid.

I know the liquid is legit. He just gets a pg solutions and makes it out to .5mg/1ml so that kids dont get their hands on the powder and instantnly od. He even incluses a measuring syringe with it. Sorry about my yypiong I cant see, Im on lyrica ,daxm, suboxoone, clonazolam, , neurontin,

The aggression you mentioned above is normal for some. When I'm on Xanax I'm a huge dick to my girlfriend. The color of your solution interests my as I've had clonazolam from 3 different vendors 2 of which when pre made vials and one 500mg bag of which I have been making my own solution...getting to the point all of the solutions are very yellow instead of clear like every other BZD solution I've come across. So does this one have any significant anti-seizure properties like clonazepam?

By that I meant using taper benzos + many comfort meds on top. It's what keeps me from feeling in the extreme annoyance that is tolerance half-withdrawal. If I keep to what my psychiatrist scripted me : 20mg a day valium, 1mg xanax, even that with my bupe isn't enough. I at least need the opioid boosting anxiolytic antihistamine hydroxyzine or promethazine, got a script to the former for 100mg a day, which is a whoppin dose when it comes to that med. But no, don't read me wrong, I didn't say CT benzos, I know very well the insanity caused by about day 5 of having no 20mg valium at least, when it left my body completely, not forgetting Valium actually helps the painful reasons I was scripted opiates round the clock until I was abandoned by the system that is just now starting to make amends...


My friend who's scripted a very weak benzo, Oxazepam, is in the same boat, cos he's scripted a large dose, 120mg every 4 hours, 200mg at bed time. He found some solace with a GHB and Baclofen and reduced his dose without even asking for a taper, which with oxazepam would not mean better benzos like valium or yeah even librium in multiple 25mg doses is superior to oxazepam, just thrown some random thoughts. Getting a GHB dealer might be difficult for some and Baclofen and Phenibut are not easy to get for some people for some reason. I wish you see the light man. Once I was out of anything for 12 days and I thought I was gonna lose it, pharmacy didn't believe me that I lost the remainder of the script in the bus, cos i'm on bupe, so obviously I'm scum and I lie all the time. Thing is before I was forced to switch pharmacy (methadone liquid program is only at certain pharmacies, I could switch back to what I want now that I'm on bupe though...I keep pushing it because it could mean days without bupe as those without liquid methadone tend not to stock Suboxone much. 


Take care, I know the Pain, believe me.

I wouldn't take some of the negative posts about this thing here with more than an ug of salt.Flubromazolam is the one people gotta be wise about, thankfully its mostly sold as 0.25mg pills, but there's also 0.75 and 1.25mg flub-lam tablets on the market, and then there's the 1mg pink capsules I obtained. I went overboard a few times and woke up lying down random places in place, last time I fell down out of nowhere, no recollectionof even feeling whoozy or anything, just that suddenly I wake up in a stupor with my computer chair, down, with me, lying with my legs in the air on the place where your ass should be, the corner of my bed's wooden mattress container poking in my neck, I felt it and I was way too faded to care until' i gradually came back to some sense and got myself out of that ridiculous position. And then I get pain in my upper back and I go hypochondriac when they're obviously from these falls on flubromazolam (more than 2mg a day is what it did to me, even if taking .5 by taking half-capsules' content here and there, thinking I was doing ok, but soon enough, if something bothered me in the day, I'd eat a whole cap and then those 3-4 events. And yes, 0.125mg is wise, it's the first strength of pill when it comes to Halcion, triazolam, what every triazolo benzos are based on.


Clonazolam never had me pass out without recollection of getting benz'd on purpose first hand, never.

The color of your solution interests my as I've had clonazolam from 3 different vendors 2 of which when pre made vials and one 500mg bag of which I have been making my own solution...getting to the point all of the solutions are very yellow instead of clear like every other BZD solution I've come across. So does this one have any significant anti-seizure properties like clonazepam?

It must, having been on clonazepam, from a neuro's script(at first) of 0.5mg bid until the last year where it was 2mg bid, I sort of find this kind of...well mood stabilizer effect that clonazepam had on me. Of course I don't have the equipment nor the subject to do a Ki binding study at my home, but clonazolam also does seem to stop the tremor my left pinkie and the finger next to it naturally started (no drug to blame) if I've been typing a lot. Only clonazepam put a stop to it when I got some from friends after getting rid of it through taper and only revisited it. Clonazolam puts a stop to it too. So it must work intensely on the temporal lobes too. I'm scripted Mirapex for that finger thing now though, also helps with falling to sleep faster.

Well, you haven't tried that many benzos in the past, so your friends only tried 1 one or two. Your experience shows you haven't had Triazolam or Nitrazepam before, both available through the pen of a doctor. Halcion (triazolam) is definitely, insanely more re-dosing prone than other benzos, lasts 1h30 max, feels like clonazolam but like if you had 4mg of it with a 0.25mg pill, all compressed in that tiny window of 1h30, maybe 2 hours. Normally people fall asleep and don't do nothing though. Who told you clonazolam was IV'able? I don't follow this PG trend, which is supposed to make it injectable? Still there's no point in IV'ing benzos? Outside  my clonazolam comes in gelcaps at 0.5mg. I never had to split the dosing unlike the Flubromazolam gelcaps I have right now which at 1mg are insane, just insane, it brought back all that made me love benzos. I picked my cell phone and called all of my friends, whether it had been 2 years I talked to them or not since I got flub-lam. 


Let's say that when I got on ORT, first the dilaudid and hydormorphcontin IV'ing...had I revealed that to any friend, I would have been made a pariah by ALL of my friends except maybe one or two, who never IV'd, but know I'm no dummy and what I've studied in. Then when I got on methadone I had a girlfriend for 2 years, cocooned with her and my dexedrine script for when some action was needed, and then when I got on suboxone, the stuff makes me antisocial and I'm working again so there you go. My benzo scripts weren't making me social like how they help killing social anxiety normally. Flub-lam is so strong it makes me actually enjoy spending a couple hours with a friend/get out of my bubble. The only shame is i'm never ever gonna get these 1mg caps ever again, they're outta the market.


Also, spending so much energy just to IV a benzo....with such results ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)  Stick to eating your pills, unless midazolam/loprazolam pills you lucky euros.

At best, be switched to Clonazepam, it's actually a seizure med too, and its max dosage is 20mg and lasts much longer than xanax and is as strong/difficult to get off of ( I got off clonazepam with valium, not entirely, still on 20mg valium, but from all the 2mg clonazepam pills I was eating, it felt like a huge cloud I didn't even know existed in my brain disappeared... This is not sustainable and we can't really use RC benzos as a crutch, they're almost all bound to be banned, in all countries? Most likely not, Phenazepam is still welcome in Canada, and the only vendor I know who has it sells it in powder, along with Alprazolam powder, yet, a really safe site, according to the now defunct safeorscam. There will be no way to verify new vendors other than that sketch forum chemsrus, which while not being flooded with gay porn, suffers DDOS attacks and the like. It's still the place and only place I found a discount code for a place I've used a long time.

I only wish this was doctor prescribed, and no doctor in thier right mind is going to give me to dosages I need to maintain.


I took another 10mg of Clonazolam and I  suppose maybe I am starting to feel it?   I am every so slightly having coordination problems.  Very slight slurring of words, etc.  


So this kinda sucks that I went through a 1/3 of a 30mg bottle of nothing to write home about.

Ok guys I Just got a call from the methadone clinic I was trying to get into today saying To come in Monday to start on my methadone maintenance program . Will they see clona in my piss or blood ,and deny me my methadone I need really badly . I almost didn't get into the methadone clinic today because when I drove there the lady told me where not accepting any new patients ,and told me I would have to drive two cities over to get to a clinic accepting new patients . Well I called the lady back after looking all day for a methadone clinic closer ,and she felt sory for me having to drive so far so she talked to the DR / manager of the clinic and somehow managed to get me into it. So yay on that I am just worried if they will see this benzo . I am sure they will start me on a low dose of just 30mg so do you think with my tolerance to clona this benzo 2mg aday ,and it just keeps me out of benzo WD It will be fine to keep taking with the meth ? Or should I start a taper plan with the benzo starting now ?

Glad to hear you're getting into the clinic. We aren't allowed to discuss testing.


I'll share my experience with several clinics: on intake it was always revealed I'd used many other substances the prior week, they always, w/o exception, told me to either produce a prescription or not to use X,Y & Z again or I'll risk my status.


That said, if there's one class of substance that US clinics tend to hammer down on it's benzos. You likely know this already.


Just do what they ask, be honest and if they deny you admission, return when you can meet the criteria. I hope that helps. Methadone is a godsend for some. Maybe bupe though would be a better avenue as there's often a little more leway with what else you are prescribed.

If you got a bottle of the clonazepam, or even better, docs do that, some charge like 20 bucxks to write you a letter saying that your tolerance to clonazepam happened much before your need to go to a methadone clinic, that you wouldn't help the patient by removing the benzo but actually harm him or her even if give methadone. Then the deduction from the doctor on why you needed clonazepam everyday. It is 300% better if the clonazepam was scripted by a neurologist for seizures.

The DO test positive, at least clonazolam and E-tiz will test positive for benzos and it's a 12-panel test since the facility doesn't take UDS lightly.  It was a ballsy move on SWIM's part, but he was diligent and careful to dispose of the test in a safe and effective manner.  Please do whatever necessary to obtain clean urine (SWIM recommends clear test - google them) as it's cheap, works for both men and women and arrives in discreet packaging in a timely manner.

I use C-lam daily and had to swap to Diclaz to get a positive test so I could a taper.


It has something to do with C-lam being a novel benzo and as such it doesn't metabolize into anything like many other benzos.

Diclaze is pretty sweet IMO. It's not too recreational but has Some pretty decent muscle relaxation and I find it great for sleep. Its a god send for those who are not able to acquire Valium to taper off these RC benzo's. I did a slow six month taper to get off of high dose etiz and it was fairly painless. I was only able to stay clean two months due to a stressful job but so it goes. I've been taking ~3mgs of this daily as an etiz replacement since you don't have to keep re-dosing like you do with etiz. I'm about switch over to diclaze and taper my way down again(hopefully this time it sticks)

This is not intended to be an arrogant reply or to start a disagreement, just pointing out some cases that conflict with the above post. I write this in the spirit of healthy, HR focused debate.


While there is a lot of truth to the above, there are legitimate exceptions. Let's not 'ban' a drug b/c of it's properties of addiction and w/d syndromes, nor its potential to fuck up cognition over the long term (spoiler alert - this is why I favor clonazepam for most people.)


In the past people: turned to alcohol and/or other drugs that led them to continue to be or become worthless to everyone. Kill themselves. Go insane. Learn to live with it. Live a life of agoraphobia, paranoia, fear and constant anxiety. Become recluses which as we kind of know tends to drive most people somewhat insane. 


Some find a safe alternative that is also a mild intoxicant that can be effectively used to relieve anxiety - cannabis!


Medically, best practices as of today dictate that for most people with mild to moderate GAD/Panic/other psych issues, benzos are to be used short term only (a month, maybe two), at low doses while concurrently working in earnest, and at the right time, with a trusted and skilled therapist or religious leader - thinking Buddhist meditation, mindfulness through spiritual or religious means, etc... - and deal with anxiety in daily life through the techniques these people are trained and successful at teaching others. This is the current ideal, intended use of these substances per their FDA approval, when we speak of treating anxiety spectrum disorders. 


Anti-seizure, hypnotic, amnesic pre-surgery usage is different, and very valid. But that's not what we're discussing.


A small portion of all people benefit greatly from benzos taken indefinitely. Primarily, to my knowledge, to use them to function and maintain their integration to society at large - to be able to get out the door without panic attacks despite years of HQ therapy and every other effort to try to get by without them. 


This usually requires years of hard work and lots of tries with various psychologists/therapists to determine. Solely working with a psychiatrist, if you're in the US - you will likely find yourself offered a potentially harmful,possibly successful SSRIs/SNRIs. Sometimes these do not work as well or come with life limiting side effects that for them benzos do not. Sometimes they work "great" - in quotes b/c I know nobody for whom this has happened but have read of such cases.


This was my case - I tried everything else that I and my therapist and psychologist felt reasonable before determining long term benao therapy was required for me to live a fulfilling, socially integrated lifestyle. I am now tapering after decades taking one of various benzos at a time, chronically. I continued my work on handling anxiety without benzos., with a wonderful therapist. I've tapered before and turned back into a hermit, unable to drive, socialize, even make a phone call. No shit. I have great hopes that my current slow, very gentle taper will allow me to be free of benzos, but if not then I have no problem with lifelong clonazepam treatment. 


Lifetime treatment with a benzo is possibly the best route for a small portion of the population - a much smaller proportion than those chronically prescribed benzos today. I'd favor Klonopin for most of these this situations, but these cases should be definite outliers. Not the norm, as it is today.


Otherwise, best to let them be, they aren't good for getting high. The best use I can think of "off label" is for sleep, again very short term, and to treat people with severe, acute or chronic PTSD. We do not need our returning soldiers to continue to blow their brains out b/c they do not have access to good therapy, something other than SSRIs and all the other hassles of dealing with the VA, to not be offered a benzo to see if it will help, Thank all the benzo abusers out there for this situation. 


So, yeah, fuck unnecessary use of this class of drugs.

I didn't mean to offend anyone, it's just that being dependant on a drug to "function" causes more problems than it solves. Especially when it comes to self medicating with benzodiazepines.

Just curious, do you plan to take benzodiazepines until the day you die, numbing as much emotional pain as possible? I can only imagine this prolonging the "healing" process a lot.


Does therapy not help you at all?

I'm sure that everyone who is currently dependent on benzodiazepines will give you a different answer.


Personally, I would really like to get off them completely. As effective as they can be in the short term, all they've really done in the long term for me is mess with my baseline anxiety levels and screw up my memory. However, as I'm sure you know, it's extremely difficult to "just stop taking them" - if only it were that easy!


Allegorically, it's like you asking someone "just curious, do you plan on smoking cigarettes until the day you die? Are you aware that you're doing more bad than good? Have you tried therapy or other means?" Every cigarette smoker will answer your question differently, because their decision will ultimately arise from countless complicating factors. And that decision, medically speaking, is none of your flippin' business! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Personally, I feel like I've tried everything. Yes, therapy and natural means can help quite a bit, but they can only be so effective against the sheer horror that is benzo w/d. I have tried cold turkey (protip: never, ever do that), I have tried tapering with Valium, I have tried substituting with Gabapentin and Phenibut and sleep aids...but no matter what I do, it seems like I can't get below the level of 10mg Valium per night (which is roughly equivalent to .25mg Clonazolam IME.) It is very possible to suffer through the tapers and live to see the other side, but the real issue there is the PAWS. Benzos have a very intense post acute withdrawal that I'm honestly not sure ever goes away. Of these past 5 years, I've been completely benzo free for 4 months, but then got back on them after noticing little to no improvement. Benzo withdrawal, and the (seemingly) eternal post acute withdrawal, made my life a living nightmare where I withdrew from school and work for a semester, suffering general and social anxiety to the point of agoraphobia. After suffering through living hell for 4 months every day, I bit the bullet and got on a small nightly dose, which has helped me immensely (at least in the short term.) To me it makes complete and total sense why somebody would choose to stay on these drugs for life. And it's really sad, but it's something that we shouldn't judge others for.


Plenty of folks are just like you and me, except they have to take a pill every day to function. When given the choice between "take this pill every day to function" or "not be able to function at all" - I'm sorry, but for a lot of people, that's not even a choice. Source: BZP addict who doesn't abuse his meds and is tired of the constant stigma, even among presumably open minded drug users.

I'll need to make a massive order thursday on payday. Stuff's getting banned mid august in Sweden....this makes me very sad. I was accepting that the 1mg flubromazepam pink caps I got was a one time very cheap thing. But this, I was using since more than a year to use very little of my rx's. 


I'm gonna have to risk myself buying adinazolam from China, once that place has their credit card stuff working.

However, doses must be kept to .5mg to 1mg to avoid looking completely zonked and/or losing control if you where to be operating machinery or driving (basic FYI here, but makes SWIM feel better to spell it out).  It has been speculated by chemists that lam (F-LAM) has a much greater tendency to cause seizures during w/d VS PAM such as diazapam.  SWIM has not yet read any peer reviewed research studies on the topic yet, but SWIM receives info from extremely knowledgeable and experienced sources, not just SWIM.

Good example: think of Breaking Bad when the MA content is 99.8%+ purity which is infinitely more potent then say 95% purity.  SWIM can attest to this personally.

And I B Profane, my rx for valium is 20mg a day and i get 15 xanax 1mg a month to prevent me from taking more valium, its perfect cos its short acting and will put me to sleep. But since a while I'm mostly stockpiling my rx's, due to having a source for clonazolam that is very cheap and I got enough to survive my surprise mega strong and cheap flub-lam 1mg pink caps I got from a site I never use at all who had a sudden fire sale due to it getting banned in sweden.


Anyway, the only way I'm getting off benzos, as to minimize the PAWS, too, me and my psychiatrist have decided that once I'm ready, since I've proven in the past being able to taper down 4mg clonaz a day to 20mg valium, started at 55mg valium a day, then 50 the next week and so on and if I felt discomfort hit hard below X dose, we would stop there. At 20mg, I'm at a low dose enough, to start taking 1mg less every i dunno yet, I'll have to re-read Dr.Ashton's book which is online. But thanks to Valium coming in 10, 5 and 2mg pills, which can be split in two, it's gonna be an 19 month process most likely. It's the only rational way so I don't suffer too much. Once the f-lam is gone, i'm gonna start spacing days where I think c-lam and when I take just 0.5mg a day (currently 1.5-2mg), I'll bring back the Valium in, just one 10mg, and I'm scripted double that. Eventually I'll have no RC benzo,unless the benzo gods make adinazolam "buyable" for me, I don't like Western Union and that crap, gotta wait for the place's credit card system to work and i'll be getting a gram of that and I'll have at least a year. But I won't use it for keeping wd's at bay, I'll use it like Xanax, it's the superior Xanax with a brand name Upjohn decided never to sell for some reason, too efficient antidepressant wise I imagine? would make SSRI's irrelevant? Who knows.


When I taper off the valium, I'll have a pile of it, sure it's gonna be hard taking 19mg, but I'll tell my psychiatrist then so he scripts me 10's, 5's and 2's so I can do it. I just can't wait to even do it. But not yet, life situation requires me to be an anxiolytic to endure the madness around me.

Having never taken any benzos/analogues before would this be a good choice to take to calm/help sleep on a DOM trip?? It seems most people recommend having benzos at hand. I plan to only use them to help with sleep after the bulk of the trip is done, or are there better alternatives? Thanks

Melatonin can help falling asleep. Obviously benzodiazepines as well. Just don't make it a habit, it'll bite you in the pooper.

I didn't intend to minimize the horror of benzo dependency, believe me I know... I'm tapering with help of professionals. I just needed to point out that not everyone can just get through crippling anxiety without therapy accompanied by a benzo- short term.


Where I and others got fucked was with physicians who prescribe these when you ask for them but don't have you take them as they were approved - temporarily.


I think we can all agree with this, can't we?

Ill look into Melatonin although it seems it prescription only in UK so probably harder to find than most illegal drugs! Ill have a browse of the usual places. It would literally only be for when I decide to take DOM, I can sleep pretty easily after LSD and thats my normal choice. Would be at most once  every couple of months.

This is why I was ever interested(just slightly in benzos to start with, make the uncomfortable kind of lingering all brain thoughts are drained yet you're still rolling around your bed at 6 am after taking a strong long lasting psychedelic, and I'm just speaking of LSD. I had a surprise DOB trip which left me with HPPD which led met to the cure to HPPD from a Neurologist (clonazepam).....Anyway, LSD is candy compared to DOM, which at least you know is DOM and surely not dosed in the 60's/70's way when called STP in the streets. So yes, go ahead. I just wish you never get HPPD, because I was once like you, a psy/dissociative kind of person only, then maybe too much LSD and a surprise DOB blotter left me with effed up vision which clonazepam cured, 0.5mg twice a day.When I saw a psychiatrist because my GP had retired and he was scripting me 15 Seconals a year for pre-exam insomnia/anxiety in college, then Canada removed all the good barbs in oct 2004, was switched to another old school sleeper, Placidyl, 15 a year only for my impossible to control lifetime insomnia, where I would get some sleep at least normally, but when I had very important exams at 8 or 10 am the next day I was doomed. That only lasted 2 years, Placidyl was removed in late 2006. But what's important to notice is here I was scripted a very strong pleasant as fuck barbiturate, Seconal, but I respected, just took 1. Knowing that taking 2 could as well kill me.


Went a bit into my personal history because your question resounded with me, the many times I wish I could just call my weed dealer at 6 am cos he was scripted 1 2mg clonazepam a day, and he would just give some to me most of the time, but nope, I didn't have any. So don't worry, enjoy your DOM trip lucky you, it's illegal, so like DET and AET I don't think I'll ever experience it.

Actually, no I can't. My script was clonazepam .5mg bid, the original one, for HPPD,which you have to take for a year certainly. Also, a script prn for panic attacks with short acting benzos as long as no abuse happens is very common, and okay.The 4 weeks max thing is for daily dosing.

So don't worry, enjoy your DOM trip lucky you, it's illegal, so like DET and AET I don't think I'll ever experience it.

Sounds harsh. Yeah I purchased them as DOM at 5mg a blotter (its actually printed on the tab!) rather than being miss sold them as LSD (the horror I can only imagine! although I do have all reagents to help out). Aside from getting addicted is Clonazolam pretty safe at the 0.5mg range? It would probably be more like once every 4 months to be fair as im not at all short of Lysergic and dont intend to ever be haha!


Thanks

That's pretty cool DOM blots. Yeah 0.5mg is like maybe slightly stronger 10mg valium. Don't sweat it. Maybe the trip will turn in a way where you won't even need it, by the end of LSD carreer I could sleep on a couple of blotters 6-7 hours later if I had a 6 pack with it. You won't get addicted from a single dose if you decide to take it. Happy trails ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I think I've been misunderstood, TRO - I'm not all critical of the way you've used benzos. Rather, I feel it is completely appropriate. My suggestion that benzos be used short term is for most people. Some people need them long term, possibly for life, be it prn or daily.


I have no argument with anything you've written, in fact I think you're quite articulate and on point.


Hope that clears that up. Thanks

I was thinking about something earlier today. Clonazolam is (put very simply) the molecular love child of Clonazepam and Nitrazepam yes?


I see no reason why Clonazolam and Etizolam wouldn't be able to have their own molecular love child. Seriously, the effects of etiz mixed with the long half life and more sedating properties of Clonazolam? I'm already sold. Hey chemists, get on this shit. Lol

I tried Clonazolam for the first time the other night after a wee stim binge, just a single 0.5 tablet.. They don't half pack a punch ay. Abuse potential for these are ridiculous, as are most benzos I guess. I'm just grateful I don't see the recreational side to any of them..

Hey folks, would the yellow gel cap 0.5mg Clonazolam cause a blackout in somebody with zero tolerance? How strong is it in comparison to say, Alprazolam? Where does 0.5mg of Clonazolam land equivalent to Alprazolam? 


I've read the thread and it seems a lot of people are getting absolutely blasted with this stuff, but didn't see anything on dosage comparisons except to Clonazepam (With which I have zero experience). Would appreciate any answers, thanks.

I am determined to get off these benzos. They have done nothing but crush my soul spiritually. The drugs are not fun anymore.


I woke up after drinking a few beers and taking about 1 mg of Xanax plus clonozolam 1 mgish.

My girlfriend couldn't wake me up, I was cold, my pulse was low, and I was coughing up blood.


I don't know about you guys but I'm out. Have to try at least. My Xanax script and Flubromazolam is all I have to taper with. I'm worried because f-lam seems to have a lot of bad reviews, but clonozolam is just to addicting. 


Can't stand getting out of bed in the morning, a bone crushing depression that leaves once I get moving and take my medicine, but I feel like I am on the edge here.

Cosmic Giraffe,


Firstly, good for you!  I admire that.  


Regarding the alp. script, keep taking as necessary to help with the long half life of clon as you'll need it. 


F-LAM is the 1 to be more concerned about and it mostly depends on dosage and frequency really.  Basically, it's got an enormously long half life so you'll want your alp. script for that as well, but don't up the dosage by any means.  The main concern with F-LAM is it produces grand mal tonic clonic seizures depending on use and frequency.  I know this from personal experience and will never, ever mess with F-LAM again.  I suggest obtaining the proper equipment and PG to measure out .25/mg per 1/ML of PG and halving that every 2 weeks.  It's going to be rough, but check out my 1st posts here for a good idea on how dangerous it can be.  W/D hallucinations from F-LAM alone (again, dosage/freq. dependent) made LSD look like ginger beer   Maybe discuss the situation with your DR and request a script for clonidine which is an anti-seizure med for safety reasons.


Also, exercise is KEY as well as is eating and keeping hydrated with water and essential vitamins like B6... etc.  This will have you feeling much better within less than 1 week if you have a high metabolism.  Again, personal experience.  Keep it up good sir, you're not alone!


Regards,


B-G

Clonazolam and alprazolam is bascially the demon love child between those two RC/legit benzos.  I've read it's the closest you'll ever get to trying the Lemmon 714's from back in the day.  You must be thinking triazolam because of the triaz ring it contains which increase potency regarding clon usage.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but was just reading about this and it was a looooong day at work.

Just so we're clear here, clonazolam did not cause you to cough up blood. If you either smoke cigs/weed or both, might be a time to cut down, weed alone is fine, cig alone is bad, cig+weed = very bad. You're just making another generic easily detected not totally honest post here. You need a normal long duration *pam benzo if you've been doing this more than a month, which means a doctor.


The blood from the coughing could even be cancer or a tear in the oesophagus from coughing too much. Let's be clear, benzos do not cause spitting blood. Fuck's sake people will be anything but realistic about what is wrong with them. You chose to buy rc benzos, very strong ones, you didn't buy some diclazepam, which you could buy and taper from in one buy, nah, you went for c-lam and f-lam, which means you think you're hardcore.


Ever had flubromazepam before you got these? If you never had a regular benzo, one that its name nds with pam, and went straight to *lam, from your doctor. If a doctor tried to script xanax first shot when thinking of benzos I would be like, 0.5mg bid right? or maybe 0.25 up to 4 prn? And certainly it wasnt a triazolam script so, its just like you had a triazolam script in larger quantity in a way, clonazolam being pretty much clonazepam with the triazolo chain of triazolam replacing the usual skeleton.


Yeah you're in a bad situation. It's not benzos fault.

Wow. You're a condescending asshole.


I didn't blame the benzos. Half of the shit you just typed I can't even understand because your words are all broken up into fragmented segments.


I bought these because I thought I was hardcore? No, I bought them from the same source I got my etizolam from because I thought they would help me taper easier and not dose multiple times a day.


I don't know where to get the pams. And I did nothing but share my experience. Never once did I say the clonozolam caused me coughing up blood. I was seeing what people thought, and was completely honest throughout the entire post.


You BZD out right now bro or what?

I actually do have about ninety .5 mg Clonodine that I've been saving for emergencies. I haven't even messed with the f-lam yet so I may just not at all since it sounds so dangerous.


I've been taking the clonozolam for about three weeks. Maybe 1 mg to two mgs per day,  so I figure I can taper down with that along with my Xanax script and I should be okay.


All these flam stories scare me, I should have never involved myself.


Going to see my doctor tomorrow. Maybe I can get switched from Xanax to clonazepam to taper.


Also I take 200 mgs a day of Lamictal for bi polar, which I know is an anticonvulsant, so that should help me too I think.

I would say they are almost equipotent. 1mg of clonaz =1.25mg alprazolam ime. Take that with a grain of salt as I have not had xanax in awhile.

You noobs will make me unsubscribe from all threads goddamnit. I've seen questions answered on the same page where the same question appears again, meaning that the same q&a could happen even 4 times in the same page.

Gentlemen! No fighting in the war room! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


So I kinda like Clonazolam a lot but I'm thinking about switching from Clam to Etiz, because the super long half life of Clam makes it hard for me to remember stuff in the morning. But at the same time, the long half life of Clam makes it so I'm less tempted to dose frequently...thoughts?

Don't. Just don't. If you have to take an RC benzo etizolam is definitely your safest bet. That's just my experience. I had the exact same thoughts that you're having, about dosing less frequently and such. Clonozolam is a lot more euphoric then Etizolam.


It's become an issue for me, but that is just my experience with it. I have been told by several that Diclazepam would be the best RC if you want something with a longer half-life. I would like to find some so I can taper good and proper. Anything with Pam is good. I'm going to ask my doctor about switching me from Xanax to Klonopin.


Oblivion has a lot of useful knowledge, but damn man you don't need to be so blunt about it. I didn't buy the drugs because I'm "hardcore".

Looking for some help here. Alright, I ordered clonazoLam 50mg in in a 10 ml pg solution. so .1ml pg = .5mg clonazolam. I take 3 mg of clonazePam a day (been on that for a year). I went though the clonazolam in a bout a week and a half. i was taking .7ml every dose. so about 3.5mg of clonazoLam a day and my tolerance has skyrocketed (btw never blacked out once). I also ordered 300mg of etizolam after i went though the clonazolam to taper off of it but realized i should have gotten diclazepam instead. To get my needed anti-anxiety effects i need to take about 10mg of etizolam plus my 3 mg of clonazepam. I want to come off benzo's completely (going to talk to my psych about it next appt.). But yesterday I didn't take any etiz or my prescribed clonazepam and felt fine but that might just be the clonazepam lasting up to 2 days. But i've never felt like i've withdrawn from benzos. What is your personal opinion on what i should do? Yes i know i was stupid but i really just want to get off these fuckers. Any info will do.

First post, but have been researching this thread for awhile - great information.


I have gotten myself into a stupid position and will admit I am an addict. To start off I was addicted to heroin for about a year and was able to get clean from it about two months ago. I used Lyrica and Xanax during the opiate WD period. After the initial acute opiate WD phase was over, I stopped the Xanax but continued the Lyrica as I enjoyed the high and was not aware of the dependency issues associated with it. My Lyrica dosage was quite insane, in doing any where from 600mg-2000mg daily for about five weeks straight. Eventually my source dried up and I was forced to cold turkey the Lyrica, but to be honest I didn't think it was going to be a big deal and thought I could handle it. I mean it couldn't be worse than opiate WD,right? Boy was a I wrong.


Starting about 48 hours after my last lyrica dose, I was in was experiencing extreme anxiety, cold sweats, shakiness and the worst insomnia I've ever had. I thought I had the flu at first, but after doing some online research, I realized what I had gotten myself into with the Lyrica. I could not go to doctor as I am currently unemployed and did not have health insurance.


Enter the Clonazolam. I started dosing 0.5mg Clam twice a day, and with little benzo tolerance this killed my anxiety and was finally able to sleep. I told myself I would just use the Clonazolam until the Lyrica withdraw was over, believing it to last no longer than a week or two. Boy was I wrong again. I did not begin to feel relief from the Lyrica WD until after four weeks of being completely off. Lyrica was quite honestly the hardest drug I have ever come off of, and that's including opiates,benzos and SSRI's.

So that brings my where I am today. I have been taking Clonzolam daily on average 1.5mg, 0.5mg around noon then 1mg before I go to bed, about 12 hours after the first dose. I am trying to taper down by gradually reducing both dosages, to just 0.5mg x2, then 0.25 mg x2. I got down to the 0.5mg x2 for about a week then tried dropping to the 0.25mg and of course the insomnia hits me like a truck and after tossing and turning for 5 hours in bed, I give in and dose another 0.5mg to finally fall asleep.


I am currently back at dosing schedule of 0.5mg twice daily, 12 hours apart. I have been stuck here for a week, trying to research and figure out the easiest way to get off benzos completely. PLEASE advise me in what I should do. Should I switch to a longer half-life RC benzo such as Flubromazepam or Diclazepam? Or will these just shoot my tolerance even higher. Also, I am located in the US and currently it seems like all US based vendors only carry Etiz or Clam, so would probably need two weeks to get flub or diclaz. I have about 30 0.5mg Clam pellets left.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. THANK YOU!

I can't find any vendor in the us that provides pams, and I am sketchy about ordering something from China or Europe.


I'm in a rut so to speak. All I have is -lams and from what I have gathered they appear to be useless in tapering.

I've toyed with f-pam for tapering and don't find it ideal even though it stays in your system longer than diclazepam, I find the latter optimal for tapering.

Here's my trip report 


0.5 taken on empty stomach 


Seeting: Currently recovering from an abcess / swollen lymph nodes / infection been bed ridden on and off for 3 months 


First few hours lots of euphoria and being extreamly relaxed 

Decided after 2 hours 2 go to sleep. 


Had the deepest most amazing sleep 

Keep having same dream where I'm me before my injury ( I was a bodybuilder) 

With my friends meeting this sweet girl going traveling all over the world and when I wake up I go back to sleep and relive the dream to like the next chapter 


It was an absolutely amazing dream 


Woke up and legit started crying on an off for a few hours because the dream was so amazing and my current situation is so bleak. 


Anyone tell what this feeling of sadness is? 

I'm not one to cry at anything usually. Or have theese kind of feelings 


Maybe because the dream was felt so Real and that's what I should be doing now but obviously can't because of this Fuking sickness pissing me off now just want to get healed

The source I use is a top source on a very popular board.  There is zero question the quality isn't the issue.   As I've mentioned earlier, i can take up to 100mg of xanax at once.   It's absurd and I pray for when my judgement day comes and I have to come off.

mankind: If I were in your shoes, I would check myself into rehab as soon as possible before something really bad happens.

Tapering down these absurd amounts alone at home is nearly impossible and you will need medical supervision due to the seizure potential during withdrawl and such.

One good step would be to avoid these highly potent Triazolo benzos first. I mean 0,5mg of Clonazolam wrecked me hard and caused the strongest rebound I have ever experienced with benzos from one single dose.


I wish you all the best.

Thanks to a good friend of mine I was a able to locate Diclazepam, and it should be here sometime next week ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


I can't wait to taper and get off this stuff once and for all.


I am done messing with these triazolam benzos, I don't even know what I am going to do with this 50 milligram bottle of f-lam I haven't even touched.

Finally took the plunge and ordered 50 x Clonazolam after reading good things about them. 

They arrived today.,normally I take benzos in the evening to help with sleep but I wanted to try these out asap. 

I took 0.5mg at 11.30am and within an hour I was nicely chilled out.  Did not feel as if I needed to sleep and added 10mg diazepam & 1mg etizolam and 2 bags of gear (heroin). Not to be advised but i have been a daily user of heroin for about 15years now bar some short breaks. 

All in all I had a great chilled out day and will certainly order more Clonazolam

I heard it's great, just a death wish. 


I've lost a lot of close friends. 


That's why I can't mess with heroin. Though stuck on benzos I may as well have.

Thanks for the input,


My current doctor will prescribe me Diazepam, which is probably the best to taper with. The thing is though, I'm not sure if I want to be tapering off benzos while going through my schoolwork. I'm studying environmental engineering, already stressful as hell, I can't imagine a long brutal benzo taper on top of that.


So, I'm stuck on benzos, but as long as I take the same dose every night I should be fine. I take .25-.5mg Clonazolam per night, and I basically have to choose if I want to be dependent on Clonazolam, Etizolam, or Diazepam.


And right now Clonazolam is seeming like the best option. Best subjective effects IMO. Of course, it's been a while since I had good ol Diazepam or Clonazepam, so it's hard to gauge.

Depends on what you're tapering from


Are you tapering from Xanax/Etizolam?


**Than i would taper with Diazepam or Clonazepam**


Are you tapering from Clonazepam/Lorazepam/Bromazepam / other long half life benzos


**Then i would taper with Chlordiazepoxide (Librium)**


Ive been around the block a few times with the tapering of benzos and have found that Librium is the most effective IMO.


A very small dosage of librium, while it may not get you high, will starve off widthdrawals and is handy to have around.


And most doctors , are willing to prescribe it. 


and some useless info: Librium/Chorodiazepoxide was the first benzodiazepine ever discovered!

"Chlordiazepoxide was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized and the discovery of chlordiazepoxide was by pure chance"

and quick question,

if im a person that prefers clonazepam, would clonazolam be the best RC benzo for me?


etizolam reminds me more of xanax but more hypnotic

IMO yeah. To me, Clonazolam feels like a mix of Clonazepam, Etizolam, and Diazepam.

Torn between Clonazolam, Diclazepam and Pyrazolam. At a roughly equipotent dose, can anybody tell me the differences between their effects?


I'm not looking for a heavy hypnotic or something that's going to make me drowsy, just after a very nice chilled and relaxed feeling.

Diclazepam is definitively the most hypnotic but it is also good at working in the backround  allowing one to be functional for work.

Strange, as I pile up my valium rx, and dont really get the chance to pile up the xanax one (I'm given them weekly, so 7 1mg pills...too easy to be like,oh fuck it).

I say strange because of days relying on flubromazolam less and less (now it's all gone, forever![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)

So, despite having read quite a bit about the downsides of taking benzos for extended time periods I tricked myself into thinking that a steady dose of clonazolam would make my summer more enjoyable. I guess it did somewhat, but the decision to take it daily was of course not up there among the wisest decisions I've taken.


Anyway, I've been on it for 2 months in total now. During the first month I took around 3 mg per day and from there, through the second month, I've been tapering gradually. I'm now at 0,375 mg per day, ready to go down to 0,25 mg tomorrow. The way I take it is one dose every 12th hour, so my current dosage is 0,25 in the morning and then 0,125 in the evening.


The reason I'm writing all this is that I'm planning to switch to diazepam before I take the last dose and I would be grateful for any advice on this. One issue here is finding the proper dose equivalence. People seem to be in agreement that clonazolam is significantly more potent than clonazepam, some claiming it's twice and others three or even more times potent. That should put 0,25 mg in the range of 10-20+ mg of diazepam.


My current plan is to first get the 0,25 mg dose steady for at least 2-3 days and then start at 15 mg diazepam per day (10 + 5) and go from there. Does that sound reasonable? Does anyone have experience with switching from clonazolam to diazepam?

That sounds reasonable. In my experience, a single .5mg pellet of Clonazolam is about as strong as 15mg Diazepam. YMMV though. It's better to err on the side of caution with these things.

Depending on what the person is addicted to, if you follow proper procedure, theymight have to take 25mgx5 or 6 even if they choose the Librium way out for the first week, I think that's what my psychiatrist said when we got rid of my 2mg clonazepam x 2 a day addiction, I chose the Valium part because nofuckingbody has valium but me :D I've traded .5mg clonazepam for 25mg Libriums, used for a friend who was tapering alcohol and at the time i had a small habit, 1mg clonaz a day taken into 2 doses, with Topamax  on top which made me stop feeling the need to do drugs for the sake of it (that AMPA activity...I got tons of jars of never taken Topamax...I should put them to use someday, I doubt even if they are mostly from 2012 it'll change a thing). 


But yeah Librium at 75mg is cozy so even if weaker a bit than your dose of what you wanna get off of, I remember when i was on just 1mg of clonaz a day, Librium was so fucking cozy, 3x25mg and I slept away 2 days and had some of the best sleep in my life, of course most people do not get to have the 25mg ones, for alcohol withdrawal, but he kept shaking until he had 50mg weened away with the 10 and 5mg capsules. It's dosage is also perfect like valium for tapering, except with valium, when I decide to taper a bit again (@ 20mg a day) I'll be able to go down by 1mg at once at my own rhythm more or less, we'll try to follow the Ashton table as much as possible unless i feel like I can go faster. Although 5mg librium is pretty much 1mg valium.

Hehe, I didn't think that either. And you're right diclazepam gives me the kind of sleep only diazepam can or could, it seems ideal to get off the hard stuff which is why I ordered a hunded 2mg pills because I'll never again be able to obtain flub-lam, at least, not in the fom I had it, the chemist making them is a genius if he's got just a small lab, compared with 0.25mg wine coloured pills...no way, even eatin 2mg of these would not bring me anywhere close to half of those pink caps which are gone forever :/

I went though the clonazolam in a bout a week and a half. i was taking .7ml every dose. so about 3.5mg of clonazoLam a day and my tolerance has skyrocketed (btw never blacked out once). I also ordered 300mg of etizolam after i went though the clonazolam to taper off of it but realized i should have gotten diclazepam instead. To get my needed anti-anxiety effects i need to take about 10mg of etizolam plus my 3 mg of clonazepam. I want to come off benzo's completely (going to talk to my psych about it next appt.). But yesterday I didn't take any etiz or my prescribed clonazepam and felt fine but that might just be the clonazepam lasting up to 2 days. But i've never felt like i've withdrawn from benzos. What is your personal opinion on what i should do? Yes i know i was stupid but i really just want to get off these fuckers. Any info will do.

I blame these PG solutions, it's not normal to go through that much clonazolam, which already on another longer lasting non-triazolo benzo in the background. Unless since they are bastard children of clonazepam and triazolam, I don't see how.


I'm glad to see that, for once, someone finds etizolam rather meh. I also need doses people call crazy for it to work. It worked best after a whole night of teh secks with my ex gf while we would eat tons of Dexedrine to keep going. Then once I caught the bus for the long ride home (1h30) or so, thankfully a bus stop was right at the beginning of the street where I used to live. Anyway I got home and tongue dosed some powder etizolam, the only way I bother buying some when I actually do, and it would melt away all the post-stim anxiety, and we would go on marathons trying to push each other to the limit with the Dexies, so it meant I probably ate 125mg over the span of a couple days (got 10mg spansules and 5mg IR,stacking spansules and taking IR's when one was thinking they were over and done with it, a bit like my prescription said, take 2x10mg in the morning, take 2x5mg IR if needed at around 3 or 4 pm, it would depend on how much work i had, but I got sick of taking the stuff everyday even if it DID make me more efficient.


Sorry for the tangeant, but I get extremely pure (98,9%) pure etizolam powder and it was the first RC "benzo" i ever got, never found anything great to it when speaking of the doses pill taking the prescription pills with dosages of 1-2mg doing the job. I have a scale which is able to measure 0.01 easy but it hasan extra number but it keeps fluctuating with most substances, so I wouldn't use it to measure stuff other than downers.


Speaking of downers, my Etaqualone vendor stopped selling it, citing unclarities in the laws....I verified and Canada only bans Metaqualon and salts thereof and no others, weird. I loved etaqualone compared to most people, since it came in freebase, it was best to eat a small baseline amount like 200mg and the smoke it like crack, that complete body euphoria where ALL my muscles felt like they were being massaged by tiny angels...of course, like crack, or anything smoked while freebase, the effects were short and sweet, speaking of 5 mins max. Just adding to my frustration to the fact my clonazolam order that is coming is my last...we'll see if Adinazolam escapes china, because i'm not ready yet..well maybe I will be after that large clonaz order,to start taking my rx's again and maybe have a taper going on, after I get away from the strong stuff with diclazepam.


It's a crutch yes, but people don't understand I can just not take them like they did when their doctor scripted some bullshit antidepressant and if benzos are involved, it was to counter the SSRI/SNRI initial feelings of mania, thoughts of suicide and such. Like a friend who moved to MTL with me back then for college, was given paxil 10mg and 4x 0.25mg xanax. To stop me from going mad after a single 37.5mg Effexor XR (I'm def bipolar if SSRI's/SNRI's all cause me to go into mania), I had an angel that night, I went to my friend and started drinking and drinking (just beer) to make the feeling go away, which it didn't, I had pupils the size like if I had done a 10-strip of 'ciid, so his mom, whom I knew had them but never asked for them, noticed how I couldn't stop moving my legs and my eyes, asking me if i had shrooms or something like that, she's a cool lady haha, and she gave me 8 to 12 30mg Dalmanes, shes scripted those when her psychiatrist gave up and said here take these once a day it'll replace alcohol and save your body organs. I think I had all of them but 2, and that did put a dent into the mania, but not completely, such an amount of flurazepam s hould have knocked me the fuck out really fast, she offered to me the couch that turns into a bed in her and I fell asleep maybe 5 hours later, slept 10 or so, drove home, and then threw away the Effexors...I still can imagine the taste effexor would summon everytime i would produce saliva, and it was almost in the league of zopiclone, its got that metallic taste thing going on,theres no way  I was going to take this shit. Paxil was easier, actually put me in a great mood at 10mg,but it didn't make me take care of things I needed to do, it made me happy with just going in the wrong direction, and when they raised it to 20mg, I still had the 4 0.25mg xanax a day but would go through the 120 jar so damn fast and it still wasnt doing much other than make it easy to be a dirtbag in my words to other people and feel zero anxiety about it, you know those things you think about someone but in the sake of politeness and not starting shit, you swallow your words, well it Paxil, inhibitions whats that? I'd even look at what could have been a Crips in the metro with a crooked smile (jacknife and metal-made knuckles my friend gave me when he knew I moved to Montreal). I stopped taking them after the day i threw all of ex gf's shit out the windows of our our third floor appartment, as I would not hit her, like she did, about 10 times, until the last time I felt small blurring of my vision and she was hitting me where she knew I had pain issues (tmj disorder + tmj neuralgia, which Paxil kinda dulled out. Thats why they push antidepressants so much, it dulls everything out there, and if you're not bipolar, I guess you'll enjoy having everything dulled out, when I hear about how my mom was on Cymbalta for fibro-like pain I was losing my shit, but couldnt stop her...apparently it worked, her doc had her go up to 90mg, which is not approved, and of course of all antidepressants that work with pain (some tricyclics are way better, Nortryptiline is surprising in its ability to put one to sleep and kill some nerve pain, she managed to ween herself out, skipping days, then taking 60, skip a day, 60, etc. then it was back to the 30mg pills and doing the same, her doctor found her smart for it. I don't know maybe.


I just realize I'm sleep-writing, I'll post as is, there's probably something related to the thread in there, sorry guys, i woke up because i was hungry and being very benzd...which is the last time in a while, I gotta be careful but what i got left until I got my last pack of clonaz caps.

If nothing was stopping me, nothing will definitely stop any of you. So I won't lecture. All I'll say is in 32 years, this is the first thing I've ever underestimated. Including a way overdosed first trip. I barely feel Klonopins, I cant take enough ativan to feel em. I only take 3 eti because 4 seems too much. But at least I can feel it. This shit. I don't know. The difference could have been me licking the syringe after my .3mg dose. I've got a lot of shit to make up for now. I know everyone is different, but I underestimated this. I plan on trying again, when no one is home in lower doses? I dunno. It's crazy as fuck.

Then don't go and buy flubromazolam sold in doses larger than 0.25mg...there were 1mg pink capsules at a time far away (2 weeks away you still could get some, somewhere), makes clonazolam candy.

Congratulations, you've done the dumbest thing I read on bluelight, in recent history.


This seems like an invented story just to add to the scare factor.


If real, what were you THINKING? This is so unreal ridiculous, both the dosage and the story. You intentionally had 62.50mg of clonazolam then warn the kids. Congratulations again, you're winner.


Also, >250mg of alprazolam.


You deserve whatever happens to you.

> 			Hi guys, newbie here--I apologize if this is the wrong forum for this type of discussion.  I have a very important message, and only had time to skim the rules.  If it is in the wrong forumn, please, moderator, kindly move it to the correct one.  I have been a long time reader of posts and information on your site--since about 2006, but just now worked up the guts to post this story--heck I have crippling anxiety even talking to strangers on the internet.  Anyways, It involves the research chemical clonazolam, and my story of compulsively taking over 120 pills (0.5 mg) in one day.  I received the capsules from a reputable vendor which I shall not name, and there were roughly 125 total pills.  I received them at around 3:00 on a Monday.  By Tuesday evening, I was completely out--a total of over 60mg clonazolam.  That would be like taking at least 180 mg clonazepam which sounds suicidal (even though that was not at all my intent).  I started small, as I have heard that 0.5mg clonazolam equals anywhere from 1.5 to 3mg clonazepam or 2-4 mg alprozalom.  I can certainly attest to those potency equivalencies.  I took one pill, set a timer and kept a diary.  45 minutes later, I took another .5mg, and 15 minutes later I took another .5mg raising my total to 1.5mg.  Due to the drowsiness, I quickly drank a couple coups of coffee.  I then popped a few (3-4) pills at at time raising my total to around 3.0-3.5mg.  This is when things get hazy.  When I "came to" from my blackout, I luckily received no injuries, but my car had some new damage on it when I went to the garage as well as holes in the drywall from pulling in too close (depth perception altered)  I had NO intentions of driving under the influence--to the point that I locked my car keys in a double locked safe and disconnected and removed the car battery.  That apparently didn't stop me.  Fortunately, I was not involved in any accident, because I wouldn't be able to live with myself if my stupor state caused harm to another.  The damage on the car was not bad--just a couple dings.  Not sure what I hit but it wasn't hard thank goodness.  I clearly wasn't pulled over--A DUI would not look good as I am applying for careers using my CS bachelor's degree.  Anyways the point of this story is that for me, tolerance rises rapidly to the effects of benzos.  There have been times when I have taken 250 mg alprazolam, I kid you not, in one night and woke up with bruises all over my body.  It's like I try to moderate it, but then that compulsion kicks in and I lose myself.  I assure you that the dosages I have taken are in fact accurate.  I'd like to find someone else who has taken dosages that high. Fortunately I have only been a semi daily user --using at most 10 days at a time before cold turkeying it everytime.  
> 
> 
> 
> Well, I usually don't experience withdrawals even after borderline-lethal amounts of benzos being abruptly quit; however, this morning (one day after my last dose) I began shaking uncontrollably and had to call an ambulance as I thought I was going to have a seizure and die.  I was having brain zaps, starting to fall but catching myself, and had a heartrate of about 180.  They gave me a prescription for 12 xanax 1mg pills until I see my psychiatrist next week.  I am ready to taper off this shit.  I have done it before, and beaten the usually weak and overrated withdrawals, but this time I thought it was it.  I mean quitting cold turkey the equivalent of probably 180 mg clonazepam taken in a day is crazy.  Please I would love to see others post doses like this as well as success stories for beating it.  
> 
> 
> 
> Fortunately, I have always had very weak withdrawals compared even to people who tapered.  I have never seized after all these withdrawals over the years, but I believe if I hadn't gone to ER today, I would have had my first seizure.  I am sorry for the long message, but I wanted to let people know (and most of you already know) what benzos, their blackouts, and withdrawal can do as well as let the community know that some tolerances seem to be infinite.  Funny thing--I've never tapered--always cold turkeyed it, and my tolerance would drop down to base--I mean feeling 1mg xanax.  Then that same day would rise to where I needed 25mg xanax for example.  I can control myself on any other drug, but benzos are the monkey on my back that I want to compeltely rid--which I had for several months and things were going great, but I screwed up and thought I could control it--I can't  It's not tramadol or oxycodone I am dealing with--to me those are very controllable.  But these benzos, especially the euphoric and moorish clonazolam damn near killed me.  I know this is a frustrating introduction for a new member, but I would appreciate it if someone could provide a similar experience with ungodly benzo tolerance like mine and what they did to conquer benzo addiction and stay away forever.  It's hard with a legitimate social anxiety disorder, but even through all this, I have been exercising and walking 10000 steps a day for health.  I'm a good guy deep down inside and want to have the power to stay the fuck away from benzos of all kinds.  I can take tramadol which seems to work wonders for my anxiety, but that is really all I should take.

I guess it did somewhat, but the decision to take it daily was of course not up there among the wisest decisions I've taken.

I'm now at 0,375 mg per day, ready to go down to 0,25 mg tomorrow. The way I take it is one dose every 12th hour, so my current dosage is 0,25 in the morning and then 0,125 in the evening.

> The reason I'm writing all this is that I'm planning to switch to diazepam before I take the last dose and I would be grateful for any advice on this. One issue here is finding the proper dose equivalence. People seem to be in agreement that clonazolam is significantly more potent than clonazepam, some claiming it's twice and others three or even more times potent. That should put 0,25 mg in the range of 10-20+ mg of diazepam.

> 
> My current plan is to first get the 0,25 mg dose steady for at least 2-3 days and then start at 15 mg diazepam per day (10 + 5) and go from there. Does that sound reasonable? Does anyone have experience with switching from clonazolam to diazepam?

I would say 20mg of diazepam at least, do not drag the taper out as a few months is not that long really as it takes quite a while to get a really bad habit. Good luck with the taper dude.

What's up people? My I just want to add my 2 cents to the overflowing pot of evidence that clonazolam is a really silly-strong drug. I took .5mg about an hour before doing some heroin (which I was addicted to). Being that I rarely indulge in benzos, my tolerance was low and I became severely intoxicated. I could not keep my eyes open. A few weeks later, I was suffering from heroin withdrawal and working as a pizza delivery driver. I had a few .5mg clonazolam tablets laying around so I ate 1, thinking it would help me work and combat withdrawal. Well, it did help, but I backed out of someones driveway into oncoming traffic. Luckily, it was just a fender bender and no one was hurt. I was arrested, though, and taken to the hospital to get blood drawn because there was drug paraphernalia in my car. I don't remember feeling too fucked up, but to say that clonazolam had nothing to do with it would be a misguided conclusion. The next day I decided to get clean for real and have been since. I just wanted to add my experience because there seems to be a lot of other people who think they are fine to drive on this drug and wind up getting into an accident.

I want even conscious when I was charged. I was in the back of an ambulance while they were digging through my car wracking up bogus charges. For example I have a charge of possession with intent to deliver on the clonazolam. What a bs charge! Clonazolam is legal! The analog laws don't apply because it has to be an analogue of a schedule 1 or two substance. I was charged with possession with intent on lsd. It was urine in a medicine bottle that my girlfriend had stored for a personal matter but in her incoherent clonazolam ramblings she confessed to her bottle of urine as being an lsd analogue. Wtf LSP? Anyways joking aside my life can be ruined. They loaded me with crazy ass charges and I wouldn't harm a fly not sell drugs to anyone.

Very helpful info and thank you for sharing. I am expecting a shipment of flubromazolam and clonazolam this week, which I've never tried either, and I will def start at minimun and am really keeping these on hand to see which is best for breakthrough panic attacks (I'm now out of insurance so going to the dr to get my regular scripts may no longer be an option).

Gonna go off on a little rant here - 

Yeah i agree, i had a friend that would do something similar to this, he'd get a bunch of Xan bars , like 20, then he'd take them all and get drunk. He'd wake up at parties and not know what was going on, thinking someone stole his Xans...


A few years later he shot himself in the head while coming down off of drugs, after a gf broke up with him. 

He was my best friend too.

His father would purchase him Xanax off the internet.. (rather than going to a doctor, who may or may not prescribe what he wanted)


Good thing he never found out about RCs.


Granted he was one of those spoiled type of kids, with both parents as lawyers ,

And granted that i stopped hanging out with him because he could not stop the cycle of drug abuse and partying, he was still a good guy who never bothered or hurt anyone in the entire world .


But- someone, if not another one of his friends because i stopped chillin' due to everyone winding up dead, in jail, or on drugs (and i didnt wanna be around that) - could have said something. His father could have done something. His father purchased him 3 different vehicles after he wrecked them all. He started with a Mazda RX 8 , he crashed that, and his father buys him a 50th anniversary Corvette.


I mean his father coulda done something for him. His friends coulda done something for him (yea i tried, i tried to help all my friends)


But i figured out after a while that even after giving them #s to suboxone drs, and trying to help them in every way possible, they were never going to revert to their former selves. 


Its unfortunate as all my friends turned into d bags......


But honestly I know i am better off for not hanging out with these types of people.


While not hanging out with them, i managed to start a business, and get myself off of oxycodone/hydrocodone (and suboxone, but i had to go back on it & take a very very low dosage of sub (1 to 2mg) as i have very bad TMJ)


My ear dr(s) prescribed me baclofen, flexirl, soma & meloxicam (mobic) {mobic , can give you ulcers very easily! fK that stuff.}

NONE OF THESE MEDICINES WORKED!!!


So i had to go back onto Suboxone & ClonazePAM.


Soma & Flexirl made me feel awful! It didn't help the pain at all and it gave me that "somnolence" feeling. Where you are very tired but you cannot sleep . 


So yea, after going back on Suboxone & clonazepam, my pain has subsided, clonazepam works 1000x better for me for muscle relaxtion, and sleep.


Suboxone also helps tremendously with the pain.


Etizolam, also works EXTREMELY well for sleeping. It also helps with the jaw pain, like clonazepam.


So in my experience, if anyone has TMJ, try a benzo instead of a muscle relaxer.


Anyways, thanks for reading ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Looking forward to trying Clonazolam and the other new RC benzos however i wish there were more US to US vendors.

Don't fucking redose unless you want to black out for a day or two. 1.5mg without a extremely high tolerance is already insane.

Hey I've been reading through this thread for the past week and have read all of the concerns and advice many people have given. I have lost my xanax prescription a few weeks ago due to a family member of mine stealing/abusing and selling them. I was prescribed .5mg twice a day. I have excluded this family member from my life due to stealing my medication and making me lose my prescription. I also take Zoloft 150mg a day, but this doesn't help with my anxiety or depression at all. Every time I tell my psychiatrist that it doesn't work for me they just keep upping the dose. Whenever I tell someone about my panic attacks and depression they say it's only a temporary feeling or because of recent negative events in my life. Could someone give me some advice on where to get these and what doses would work for me? I am 6'3 and weigh 175 lbs, and 20 years old. please feel free to email me if you are willing to help, I'm just sick and tired of other meds not working. I also take 20mg adderall xr once a day and have abused them up to 800mg in one dosing. Please, I don't want to be dependent on adderall or SSRI's, both of which have had negative effects on my life. Thank you if you actually took the time to read all my bitching/complaining. Could someone just please help me find an alternative to these SSRIs ?

Hey Profane


I am very responsible with a ton of experience with Benzes.... Cold turkeyed 8 mg Xanax or 8-10 mg of klonopin a day... Haven't touched many since tbh. a..that was two years ago. I read this entire   entire thread waiting for them to get here. Some people said they were bunk... others strong and potent. I tend to trust myself way Moe than the kiddies who mostly hang on these forums. 


I'm 39 btw.... the kids crashing there cars, ending up hospitalized... burning the house down.......................... There 15 yr olds

Thanks for your replies. Taking .25 + .125 mg clonazolam* was already a bit of a rollercoaster (I started to get "mini-withdrawals" 3-4 hours before each dose) but when I went down to .125 + .125 mg clonazolam, I really started to feel like shit, so when I switched to diazepam I ended up taking 25 mg on the first day. On the subsequent day I took 15 mg and then tapered rapidly, dropping 2.5 mg per day. I took the last dose (5 mg) a little more than 24 hours ago, so I guess I'm in for a treat during the upcoming days. I take magnesium supplements to aid my recovery, valerian for the anxiety and melatonin for sleep. I might cut the valerian though, since it supposedly acts as a PAM and thus may end up prolonging the withdrawal symptoms.


Switching to diazepam gave me a huge relief. I've been able to lead a somewhat worthy existence in the last couple days and it almost feels like another drug class altogether. The difference between short- and long-acting benzos isn't at all something new, I know (I've tried a few different benzos), but I've never built up any sort of dependence on them before so it just dawned upon me extra hard I guess. 


*) These dosages are tentative. I had 1 mg pills acquired from an online vendor, so ~1/8 of such a pill isn't exactly guaranteed to be .125 mg. A clonazolam dose of .25 mg does seem to be around 20+ mg of diazepam however. It is very potent.

I find meloxicam to be the only nsaid not to give me IBS-like symptoms. Celebrex of course doesn't,but, I wish we had these black box warnings here in Canada. If you tell a doctor Celebrex is dangerous just like Vioxx you'll get some bad stares most of the time. But that's okay, if I'm in the ER and they don't want to give me opiates (when I could have them, I'm in the Sub jail, which I'm going to get out of temporarily, I have some serious surgery that needs to be done, I'm not even sure of the parameters yet, but the surgeon did tell me on the phone that she will have to get me off bupe until i'm in withdrawals, because I'll most likely end up on Morphine (high dose), Hydromorph Contins and such for a while, there's no way around it. It's gonna be a wild ride, I even have to probably take less of my valium script and not have some for some days before surgery, so the anaesthesiologist won't have me choke on my vomit while on midazolam and probably some propofol as they're afraid my script to benzos is an issue that much, that IV midazolam will go right through me...yeah right, I'm only 20mg valium a day, 1mg xanax bed time. Suboxone makes me feel a lot less positive than when I was on methadone, then I was allowed to keep taking 10mg of valium, then later upped to 20 again as I lowered that stuff out of me rather quickly. I got severe TMJ disorder too, which was caused in a freak "accident" in a hardcore punk mosh pit, which also damaged nerves as pieces of bone from my jaw scraped the myelene (the thing over your nerves to protect them, like for electrical cables) so I have small areas where nerves are unprotected. That's why I'm truly a pain patient who was badly treated after the guy taking care of me retired. I tell you, old docs are the best, they're not scared to script you what you need for such conditions, but the government is having trouble keeping them past 65 even with all the bonus money, especially specialists. It's scary when you think that in my city of 250 000, there's 2 neurologists. And I'm lucky enough to have one who can keep me as a patient, see him every 6 months. The old man also got rid of my HPPD with clonazepam, which was a godsent, then...

Ugh, I'm frustrated.


So I give my friend $80 to place an order for 90 .5mg Clonazolam pellets. I currently have about of these 40 pellets remaining from my last order, I can verify that these are strong and potent.


Well, about a week ago, I give my friend $80 and I give him specific instructions "please buy these soon, they WILL sell out and then we won't be able to get as good of a price on them again."


Well whaddaya know...they fucking sold out before he got a chance to buy them. Several days after I told him to. How unbelivably lame.


So now I have a few options. The site that I currently buy benzos from and trust the most is currently carrying liquid Etizolam, liquid Clonazolam and liquid Flubromazelam. I think I want to get the Clonazolam, but has anybody tried the liquid f-lam and if so how does it compare? I could also try my luck at buying pellets from another site, but man, I'm a little bummed that I'll probably never be able to get those super bomb Pinzor brand .5mg Clonazolam pellets again :'''(

I've done it many times before, I just prefer having pellets to liquid for several reasons. It's easier to transport, keep track of, give a few to a friend just to hold on to, etc etc...but ultimately, I like how when I take one pellet I know that I'm getting roughly the same amount each time. Powdered benzos vary wildly in their consistency and potency, but these Clonazolam pellets are some of the best I've ever come across, and it would be a tragedy to never see them again due to a friend's mistake. Oh well, such is life as an RC benzo drug addict lol :/

Don't kid yourself.  A couple years ago my dad slammed into a parked bronco going 80mph running from the police in his brother's sport car to the point that the entire wheel of the bronco was in his passenger seat. All thanks to xanax. He's 43 now. Benzos can get the best of anyone.

I am so excited to try this one! I was supposed to have received clonazolam, fluroprazolam and pyrazolam 3 days ago, and I'm getting it tomorrow and im now out of town!!!! Haven't tried any of those. I LOVE xanax and etizolam. How do you guys think they compare to those two?

Totally underwhelmed by Clonazolam, Pyrazolam, Diclazepam, Etizolam, Flubromazepam and Flubromazolam tbh...


Would much much rather take 10mg Diazepam over any of these any day... I thought Clonazolam would be my saving grace. Guess I'll try a different vendor (UK) but the one I used is notorious for the quality. 


I just feel as if I'm missing something.


A pint of beer would just put me in a better anxiolytic state.

I don't know why I don't find xanax all that strong at all, almost sugar pills. And I pay the extra to get the upjohns.

I'd sleep right now if I didn't wake up for some sweets (I gotta have some bloodtests done...give me diabeetus now and I think I'm gonna go back to IV'ing Dilaudid. With all the nerve pain it brings...

Yeah xanax affects us both in a BAD way. Benzos are going to be the end of him I fear. A year or so later he was still "a little buzzed" of ~20mgs of ativan at 6am and was at the top of the staircase when he fell and back flipped down the steps and smashed his head on the tile floor, fracturing his skull in in 3 places and snapping his arm in half. He was in a 5 day coma yet when he got out it wasn't a week before I found him all fucked up on xanax. If he didn't just break his zygomatic bone I would've punched his dumb ass. He's doing better though

Rybee: 

That surprises me with Clonazolam because even with a low to moderate tolerance only one 0,5mg pellet knocked my ass out. And also gave me the worst rebound I have ever experienced...

If you don't have a tolerance legit Clonazolam pellets should rock your boat hard.


Like I have written before, these Triazolo benzos are very potent stuff and not for me and imo should be treated with even more respect than the classic non-Triazolo-ones.

You didn't get the correct Flubromazolam/pam then, god. I'd trade my valium script for a flubromazepam script (flubromazolam is just too strong, maybe you only had those 0.25mg pills? Those are not really what 1/4 of a pink 1mg gelcap is...and those 0.75mg and 1.25mg tablets apparently) Flubromazepam is like bromazepam and flurazepam in one first you get the anxiolysis..takes a while to kick in I know....and then you sleep sleep sleep sleep, so damn deep, and you don't dream, unlike with valium where yeah, it still works after all these years (now close to 6?) but that doesn't mean I won't get messed up dreams. Btw, a real dose of flubromazepam is about 24mg, it's something to be dosed like temazepam, yet the strongest pressed pills are 8mg, overcautiousness.


Also diclazepam...are you sure you even had it? Feels like valium, but 2mg = 25mg or something, I miss those purple little buggers, which thanks to the canadapost cuts, I still don't have, yet the bar on the site (you have to follow a cursor and a bar to know "where" it is now). I normally get international mail the day after it reaches Montreal till it travels here. I'm certain to have my stuff tomorrow. It's just that valium makes me way too sleepy to work if I use it as my GAD first defense, better to use it at night like I used to. As for Xanax, eh, the psychiatrist gives them to me weekly, I couldn't take more than 7mg at a time even if I wanted, he's "concerned" because I'm on bupe even if I am on a fuckin waiting list for the pain clinic.


Pyrazolam is a waste of time though, most people will agree. And most people seem to really love etizolam, I can get it in powder form inside my own country...and...meh..lasts too short, it's like how I don't find Xanax that great either.

I work with my computer in a field where I didn't get a degree, just had to know the right people. But it's great to work from home, for sure. I've been on welfare before, because I had a disability, so I cashed in 1200 a month, not the meager 530? (I'm thinking of the people who were on welfare who were weed customers back then....hmm, yeah, it raises a bit, but people who have no medical issues and just don't want to work or have a job under the table not to pay taxes to the province..sure don't get that...and they get picked randomly for questioning each monthand also country but the fed has no control over welfare). It wouldn't even have insulted me when I actually was on disability welfare to be told "I'm probably on it". Yeah I paid taxes for it so I deserved it then.


It's funny, my ex's ex once showed up at her apartment to cry like a baby to have her back, I was upstairs and lmao, then I got down and because he didn't see a car parked in the driveway (I parked it elsewhere, she told me her ex was batshit and could start breaking shit outside her house when she didn't let him in) and he was like, "he's got no car, you're fucking a slacker!" lol.


Your story is unbelievable child. And if it is true, well, might as well...

Also, what is a form member? 


he even entered it this way when typing in the reason why he was editing his post...I suggest just deleting it, egads, I'm not sure greenlighters can do that


I'm not trying to go overkill on this guy, but mostly on the general vibe of the thread since US people can apparently get their hands on it now. Obviously the retarded dosing, the extreme exagerations about the strength (0.125mg? really?) This isn't triazolam. If 0.5mg should be 0.125mg of this, I guess triazolam should be reformulated as 5 times less highly dosed pills of 0.025mg and 0.00125mg.


All these hyper warning posts from nobodys from the US, with 1 or 2 posts are obvious attempts by the faggot LEO's who watch this site at derailing/discrediting a product I think should be commercialized immediately. And it's not just because it's my opinion, the worthy posters who have posted before, who have tolerances to start with, are the people who should be looking to try these things, you know what, if you want to start benzos, maybe go to the fuckin doctor, and recite the IT-10 or DSM-IV, well pick at least 3-4 symptoms out of the bunch that apply to you. If you want this stuff for reasons other than anxiety or insomnia not covered by pills anyone can get easily from a doc, even an ER doc will script a month worth of a low dose of a benzo if your story sounds true enough. If it doesn't, it's most likely that you don't need it, don't know how to engage doctors (here in my country, they're paid with my money, so I treat them as employees, if you don't do what I say, I can go to 3-4 other doctors in the next week. It takes real suffering to actually need this class of drugs every single day. I can understand those who want something for opiate withdrawal....I suggest sucking it up, it's 4-5 days of hell, yeah, but that's it, a benzo tolerance means, getting rid of the insanity of its withdrawals mean at least a few months until you can leave your house. 


Better than being on  bupe or methadone and be in a form of healthcare prison, where rotating nurses will repeat you the same questions before even seeing the doctor, who also rotate, and ugh. No need to go further with this post I think my point is made. Scare posts from 1 posters who are obviously from the US with their incorrect English and borderline retarded expressions and reverse-scare posts where some dude is proud of taking 15mg of clonazolam and is telling us live they're redosing and expect respect should die in a fire. Because we know who you really are.

Not being a douche, just stating things and would like to see this thread get back to normal. Maybe diaf was pushing it, but sometimes....this is why we can't have nice things, know what I mean?

Hmm..no? Maybe you spend too much time outside this summer without protection (speaking of cream) ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I'm a bit disappointed with the 0.5mg pink/wine coloured pellets I have found instead of the now banned in Sweden clonazolam that I used to get from there in yellow gelcaps. They work, but as I used to take 1.5mg in the morning, it would last me until late in the afternoon, now I have to take it 3 times a day. 


Also I've obtained new 0.25mg flubromazolam pellets, even taking 4 will feel like half the pink gelcaps which were 1mg.


Thankfully I have a boatload of diclazepam to taper away from these things, I didn't get much of these pre-pilled, if I do next time it'll have to be pure powder. Plus diclazepam in quantity sufficient enough for me 4-6mg it provides good sleep almost as good as valium and it turns into lormetazepam in your body...god I wish I could obtain that one and loprazolam, maybe brotizolam too oh and nimetazepam...

Clonazolam WAY more potent than..The Almihgty XANAX....BUUHHHAAA  the RC Benzos don't have that kick/rush/faded/cool as ice like traditional benzos. especially Xanax . but do serve a purpose...not much euphoria, but still put you in great moods and relax you. 5/10 rating and I've tried clonazolam and flubromazapam...If youre looking for anything like Xanax...Etizolam is the closest..I get blister packs of etizest and Etillam is the ONLY way..cheap and I've found a reliable us to us vendor... stay safe Xanax=Etizolam

Flubromazepam (if you wait for it and don't complain, yeah it takes 2-3 hours to kick in) and especially flubromazolam are way more euphoric than xanax. Xanax just leaves me with a weird feeling. I got some euphoria maybe for the first month, I'm scripted 1mg brand name xanax, but only given 7 a week because of paranoid psychiatrist, yet he scripts me, the third most euphoric benzo that never stops being euphoric Valium, by monthly 10mg twice a day so 60 when I pick it up.


Nitrazepam and Temazepam make Xanax look like a lame orgasm that lasted 8 seconds. My god I love Mogadon, yet only managed to get a script for 15 of the 5mg ones once, a guy had 10mg ones once that i know and he gave me 3. Just splitting one in two allowed for 2 15mg doses and dear mother of god. You know Nitrazepam is actually stronger than flunitrazepam, right?


I detect a lack of experience..could be wrong though.

A real dose of flubromazepam is about 24mg, just to clear things up.


I'd say have some Nitrazepam and you'll discard almost everything, but I think they off Mogadon in the US, not sure, no valid reason or panic about it either. It's always been difficult to get both sides of the border.


Clonazolam pellets suck compared to the yellow gelcaps that now are impossible to obtain. There's a clear difference and the swedish chemists are motherfucking Heisenberg and the british clonazolam pellets could as well have been made in a shake and bake manner if it was possible to make benzos that way by Badger.


I hope you saw the show but yeah...


Also even the british flubromazolam pellets changed colours from dark wine and not really round pills to almost white pale pink, at least those selling the 0.25mg. See the guy who had the 1.25mg flubromazolam pellets with 2 score lines, they also make 0.75mg pellets. Maybe that should be your next route to really have an idea.


Or get a script of Nitrazepam 10mg at bed time, short term, make everything so your doctor knows its a temporary situation nobody gets a 365 days a year script of nitraz.


Not difficult to invent or magnify stressful situations enough that evoke not sleeping at all for 4-5 days in a row, that you tried trazodone, hydroxyzine, seroquel 25mg and nothing works or maybe you sleep 1 hour..Not saying you don't feel Xanax better than me, but 2 years after having a script, I'm much happier on Valium refill time, it doesn't stop working like xanax does, even when I take breaks for a couple weeks. At first it's great, its the first benzo i was scripted to take off the crazy edge SSRI's can give to some people, so I had 2 months worth of 0.25mg xanax to be taken 4 times a day back in 2006, then I had a whole year without benzos and was put on clonazepam for HPPD and wow, now that was something great for the GAD I was developing just then, but Valium at 20-25mg a day is still better. I of course tried them up to 1mg at once and god did they hit. Now they're just a nice addition that somestimes work. :shrugs:


Sternbach the dude who invented Librium and  Valium and Restoril (Temaz) and others is to praise/blame for 3 of the rc benzos, they aren't unreal ;P He created flubromazepam/lam and diclazepam.

yeah the clonazolam I got were the pinkish red pellets..those  are crap? in your earlier posts you spoke of yellow gelcaps I believe. they must be better, i'll do full in depth research of the 6 that should be here tomorrow. I got the green Flubromazapam 8 mg. in your experience are they okay too, I rate 5/10 on 16 mg

They're not exactly crap, but they're certainly not as pure as the yellow gelcaps that were available for more than a year were. At 0.5mg these knocked people out even some with a small tolerance. At first 2 of them put me in a really relaxed more long lasting than any other triazolo benzo I ever tried space. Those pills, I need to have 4 or 5 to get there...either less pure or not really standardized doses. It's a shame the vendor who had the yellow gelcaps can't sell em anymore (the country where they were situated banned them on the 15th.

I just got some laboratory grade liquid Clonazolam :D


I tried some last night, it was very good and knocked me out hard. Tonight, however, I chose to take the pellets, because I feel like it's easier to control my dosage that way. Still, it could be useful in tapering if I figure out just how much is in a single drop...oh also, it tastes like burnt rubber. The nice thing about it is, it kicks in a lot faster than the pellets, I think ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I remember it having a very nice come-up, and then not much else.


I tried to take .25mg but I ended up taking closer to .5mg. Oops, lol ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Damn, lucky, especially the bottles I saw..have lots of doses if a .5 / tsp, the bottles seemed to be 150ml or larger. But they were only pictures by braggars on 420chan...I have a good 40 or so index of safe stores, half of them in the UK where the pound is now more double the canadian dollar...so hm, I'll wait before buying anything in the UK for a while, ain't like it was last year at 1,58.


Probably the best way to go a bit crazy and then go easy.I suggest getting an oral syringe, they give em at the pharmacies normally, just need to ask for one.

I have the blood red ones and they work well. Will definitely be getting some more before the ban comes in, on a bad day when Etizolam isn't going to do the trick they are just what's needed.

Yep like me, 7 years of non alcoholic non druggie, just really scary scenes with my parents, my dad's screaming and my mom's screams while they told me to go back to the basement when I tried to intervene because he was throwing her in the walls holding her by the neck to make her stop screaming at him to do this or that. Plus abandon neurosis (neurosis is still a relevant term in the ICD-10, which here in french Canada, the doctors often disregard the DSM as crap and use the ICD more. Plus the PTSD half americans and canadians close enough to NY suffered, especially the millenials like me who were 18 in 2000, quite the message that the future Clinton was promising us and humanity in general was not to be, just as the opinion in western countries was taking the palestinians side...then boom and the rest is history, they had most people hate people they don't even know from arabs dancing because of a marriage, not celebrating 911 (it was pushed into canadian french news too).


Plus, I am bipolar. I can't take antidepressants, period, an ER doc once tried to convince me anxiety is treated by antidepressants and benzos were only used for a month to fight the bad effects of initial SSRI intake (which apparently for some people, does work, hell it worked when the very first time I was helped mentally with 10mg paxil and 4x 0.25mg xanax a day, not enough to feel anything nice from it. As soon as they upped the dose to 20mg, the xanax was like if i was not taking it and I was sent into hypomania and then full blown mania, made me lose my job, my girlfriend and apartment 500km south of my hometown, had to go live back with my mom, I had been there 3 days earlier to celebrate my birthday. When SHTF, my fucking doofus of a stepdad had destroyed my bedroom's walls to make the basement larger, it wasn't enough to destroy the small apartment we had under the house and lose revenue, they destroyed my bedroom to make i dont know what...the original downstairs bathroom was already installed somewhere until they realized the foundation was cracked (hidden vices), and then since there was renovation, I was told it was city inspectors who visited who said this couldn't be used as a bedroom because the window out was too small..and indeed it was. So I had to leave the house where we saw the college I was going to from my mom's kitchen window (the teacher's tower), took 8 minutes  of walk to get there, but I couldn't live with my mom, so instead of getting small 1200 dollar for a year student loans (had my parents never divorced they were considered too rich...at 60k a year combined) for me to get anything. My mom had made sure when she divorced to get a house close to a college (this is a college town for sure) 4 of them and one of em is a large university) for me and my brother. And it ended the day I decided to leave to another college for a 1 year specialization in petrochemistry, they knew I was coming back...so for 3 years more I lived in the basements of people renting to students who at least had internet, the first place didn't even have clothing cleaning appliances. anyway, 2 other such student housings owned by regular people and all my health issues and the fact I always want to go back to my mom's house ( I had to for 6 months last year because she needed an extra rent (my brother left so I had his bedroom, which was mine at first...anyway, which was on the main floor) because of monetary issue (dumbass boyfriend of a stepdad or whatever lost his business and was 50k in the red and he forced his failure upon my mom because of these fucking automatic concubine laws that count you as a couple even if the girl is your friend only (that was weird when it happened to me and the person was not my girlfriend), so, I paid to repair her house's roof so her 2 apartments on top of the house were rentable again. Sacrificed myself for a person who won't still treat me with respect yet it feels horrible not to live with my mom and  brother and if that guy never arrived in our lives, I would never have got myself into as much problems and my bipolar wouldn't have been triggered so hard had I had a stable life situation, which I don't consider having since I'm 10 years old. Now the last 4 years are fine, i'm doing well, except for all the health crap, but at least i'm on bupe, which has some painkilling strength and zanaflex for my facial muscles spasms on the left side of my head. 


I wish I never had stopped taking Topamax though, Topamax and Clonazepam annihilated my HPPD and most of my head pain (it's not really headaches). It just made a lot of food taste bad, especially sodas, and I lost 20 pounds I had in excess when on Topiramate. I got tons of jars, maybe starting to take some again could be an option, I don't know. I already take an anticonvulsant (well, 3 with the benzos), Mirapax for RLS/boosting benzos at night so I don't wake up at 2 am and it works.

At first it's great, its the first benzo i was scripted to take off the crazy edge SSRI's can give to some people, so I had 2 months worth of 0.25mg xanax to be taken 4 times a day back in 2006, then I had a whole year without benzos and was put on clonazepam for HPPD and wow, now that was something great for the GAD I was developing just then, but Valium at 20-25mg a day is still better. I of course tried them up to 1mg at once and god did they hit. Now they're just a nice addition that somestimes work. :shrugs:

Etizolam is a lot like Xanax to me...benzocrack, lasts too short, is only awesome at the end of a stim binge where it will create a huge euphoria almost IV dilaudid rush of pleasure and loss of worries. But that's with me putting the tip of my tongue in powdered etizolam.

2-3mg seems to be my dose, 2mg for recreation and 3mg for the 3-FPM residual stimulation. Go through pretty much 25 0.5mg pills in 2 days, not good.


EDIT: 5 days, dam time flies but I was up for 2 nights high on 3-FPM, got to control that and not binge on 3-FPM.

I'm on benzos everyday since April '07. At first it was very potent stuff (clonazepam) from a Neurologist, then a psychiatrist just said "we'll knock 2 birds with one stone) and upped the dose.


This to say, with my almost decade long, struggle, I will admit, I use them half for neurological reasons and anxiolytic/insomnia reasons (goddamn you Firefox, it is a word). Don't get too worried, with RC benzos, depending on the quantity you have, you got major control over it. Taper away as soon as the honeymoon is over, or you will regret it. Worse than an opiate addiction (well on par with IV use when it comes to health risks). Watch out bro, you don't want to be on an infinitely long taper like i'm doing (Yeah BLighters, saw the psychiatrist, I have 10,5 and 2mg valiums here, I'm on 19mg a day for 2 weeks and then 18...it's on, no longer prolonging the inevitable with the 20mg dose a day where I stopped). Me and the psy have decided that all I need really since the benzos have long put the brakes on my anxiety issues that they did give me the break my brain needed to work on my anxiety levels myself, identify what cranks it up (I basically no longer read/listen to world news, even national ones I'm starting to phase out, if I want change I'll do it from the bottom up in my community, I gotta stop worrying about things I can't change, which I do now, what I can change is myself, first, and get rid of the poisons in my body, thankfully I wasn't on methadone more than 11 months, but it did make me gain 100 pounds and switching to suboxone stopped the weight gain but it has its own drawbacks (I need hydroxyzine or promethazine to endure the nausea it causes me) plus I'm getting cavities (which I'm getting fixed tomorrow) in my front lower teeth from 2 years 1/2 of putting these pills with their lemon and lime extracts (not sure what they were thinking, the American orange tasting pills with just citric acid wouldn't have caused this). People speaking about methadone fucking up teeth are full of shit, but suboxone directly impacts teeth due to the very nature of the pill itself.


Anyway, as I was saying me and my psy came to the conclusion I only needed benzos for my proven insomnia problem, and once I get under 10mg of Valium,I'm getting a Temazepam 30mg script prn. And I'm past finding benzos recreational. 


To the point : strangely when I had the yellow 0.5 gelcaps of clonazolam, I only needed 2 to 3 a day to replace my valium which I was stocking up, it was great. When I tried the pills...nah, weaker. If it wasn't for Nordic countries being so teetotal (and often in advance by years in RC laws compared to other places for some reason...they had freakin 2c-t-7 banned before the "Erowid Accidents" to put it mildly over there in Scandinavia) I'd probably be using the yellow caps, I didn't have a problem where I thought I was taking too much with these, as they lasted almost all day, I'd take 2 when waking up, and another one in the evening, sometimes not. Those pink pills are weak, so it should be easy if disciplined enough to take a bit less, chummer.

Think it's my duty to warn people about this RC, I took them for 5 days in a row and already am getting withdrawal. Be careful of this benzo, try to avoid it. I took big doses first few days but done that before, so it must be the c-lam as I've never felt cravings for benzos before and I'm suffering from a long term benzo addiction. This one is way to strong, first benzo I felt high on. Withdrawal similar to alcohol withdrawal but worse, already coming off valium didn't need this in the mix. Thank god I have my quetiapine to mask some of the symtoms. Oh and was only 25 0.5mg pills in 5 days, still a lot though.

Define binge. Also 5 days?


I had benzos before having an neurologist script me clonazepam .5mg bid everyday. It was Temazepam 30mg due to working at night and I was living in a dorm, a brand new one with our own rooms. Only thing that sucked was cooking yourself some food, 2 ovens  for 55 people per floor...it was easier to use the card-activated laundry appliances. Had a small fridge in our rooms but that was for stuff you could eat right away, I was at the opposite end of the kitchen which blew ass, then you had to unlock your locker, take out your cooking stuff, and of course it was too small.


Anyway, living so far away from home first cracked me, and I scripted a low dose of paxil, 10mg, but even that made me realize I was bipolar because I would spend all my nights up without any fatigue, totally manic. So the doc scripted me Xanax 0.25mg 4 times a day to dial down the initial effects of SSRI's. It worked, but the times I abused Xanax a little, (would take 8 0.25 at once for 3-4 days) and going back to my normal dose wouldn't cause withdrawal. Same as when my weed dealer was also selling 2mg rivotrils(brand name clonaz up here) and I'd use it with my best friend with weed and booze for a week in a row and had zero withdrawals.


Usually it takes 3 weeks to 4 weeks to develop tolerance, and even then, it has to be high doses of potent shit. Had no issue stopping to use Temazepam 30mg when I was put on day shifts again after a month of hell replacing someone who was working at night at the supermarket. Even if it had been 5 years, was unionized and was making around 13 bucks an hour for working at night (13 an hour was much more 10 years ago). Also, add up student grants and illicit activities I can admit to now, moving weed and cid, I was doing really well. If your situation is shit I guess it's easier to concentrate on how you're out of a benzo 5 days later and "totally withdrawing".

Took 4-5mg for few days due to 3-FPM then only 0.5-1mg each night for few days. Also I've never had benzo withdrawal symtoms like this, even when lowering my valium dose. And I also got the blurred vision as well. Feeling better now, didn't expect it to last a long time due to how short I used for.

The binge is not as important as the period of time yyou have been on benzos. I would binge 20 MG xanax then go back to the norm. Did it for 5 years had to get medical detox.  It took two weeks to get through Wds and that was at the betty ford shakedown.  They take Obama care now and if you have a good hmo (blue sheild) you get a 30 day free luxury detox. Foods great, swing pool, wild geese and tons of other wildlife.  In the middle of the desert. I recommend anyone who can pull off the free stay to take advantage. 

Rant over

Valium is working lol

Hello again everyone. It's been a while since I have been on here but I could use some of your help please.


I have been using 3-fpm for a few months now, sometimes, a few doses every day, sometimes weekends only, sometimes weeks off it. Everytime I use it after 6pm at night I find that I just cannot sleep and I have had very good success using Clonazolam (The  0.5mg pills.....I find half a pill is enough, approx 0.25mg...... a full one blacks me out) and it works great for sleep. At the moment I am unable (from my trusted vendor) to obtain it any. Can you good people recommend me a similar benzo that will do a similar job? 

I'm not looking for a high, just something give me my 6-8 hours sleep and wake up feeling ok. Thanks for any advice, it's appreciated.

As someone with no benzo tolerance, even a quarter of one of these pills (0.125mg) is enough to spark me out! Not finding it as enjoyable as diazepam however... the warm fuzzy feeling seems to be missing. Maybe I haven't given them enough of a chance yet.

You may well be right. I'm only going to be using this clonazolam for coming down off stimulants several times a year, so for that I can tell it more than does the job and I'm happy.

F-Lam fucked up my tolerance so bad i can take ten of these at once, once these last three are gone I'm done with Benzo's they just dont do fuck all to me because i used to be addicted and my receptors have never truly resest because every few months ill take a Benzo or two

how does clonazolam pair with adderall or mdma or blow? i like stimulants but hate the anxiety they come along with, i like benzos but i dont like feeling like im about to pass out so i am trying to find a nice equilibrium between the two.

I personally wouldn't take it with MDMA except for maybe the come down but otherwise it goes great with straight stims. Just watch out as taking benzos with mxe and stims during both the binges and the come downs is how I developed this shitty dependency. I had been a recreational benzo user for 5 or so years before these rc's came out and never did become dependent.

This is straight out the nicest benzo going; real euphoria; some find 0.5mg strong - I find it nice and totally functional with no amnesia - ususally another 0.5mg later but here the dose response is really very steep and it can get messy so go easy on them. The green pellets were absolutely top notch but out of production to be replaced with blotters which should be as good.

Sorry i was having trouble posting as a new user here. I was off benzos totally until this came my way as it just ticks all the boxes for me. Flubromazolam is just way too ridiculous and takes too long to work so you end up taking more and more and end up so trashed you forget what the hells going on. So i tried this and diclazepam next. After doing the same thing...taking way too many and forgetting if id took etc i finally worked out clonazolam 0.5s were made for me! I think they are fantastic but they give me terrible amnesia. I doubt i could work on these. I dont know about chemistry much but just from the user perspective i think they piss all over diazepam but each person seems to have a fav benzo. Im on subutex and pregabalin too and smoke weed and i get a better goof/gouch than on heroin. Diclazepam is hard to quantify a bit like flubromazolam as it takes hours to get  its full effect. Clonazolam however seem to work quickly enough. In 2hrs you feel the anxiolotic and sedative effects and by 4hrs you feel the hypnotic effects...if you havent fell asleep that is!

A mix of diclazepam and clonazolam in small doses is quite a whack but dont try if you have any responsibilities like a job or kids or you have to drive! In other words dont unless you are used to both seperately first. I fell asleep on a bike outside my mates house when i was texting him to let me in but managed to text $$#@@&_%%5555=÷?112xgfhh. That was 2hrs after redosing a 2nd time the next day on both.

Clonazolam are extremely potent and a bitch to come off. Ive came off benzos twice after being addicted for 5 1st time and 10 2nd time but these bitches have got me stumped. I am surprised though as ive cut down now to 1/2 a pill a day and i still feel such a great anxiolotic effect, sedative and hypnotic not so much but with a smoke of weed i do. Compared to diazepam which i think are crap now i always wanted to quit them due to the tolerance issues. Clonaz however seem to last over 24hrs if you dont be too greedy. Diazepam just dont work after a while and are just needed to feel normal with little effect. Clonaz just seem to work on me!!!!!

Pregabalin potentiates benzos so much that before i found out about rc benzos and had been clean off benzos for few years, i fell asleep after someone gave me a 2ml diazepam! I was accusing people of having fake diazepam etc when i occasionally got a couple for recreational use. Thats how i got back into benzos as they were like turboed with the pregabalin. However i soon got to not even want them anymore as i couldnt feel them so gave up. 

Then i was introduced to all the rc benzos. Ive tried most of the available ones but clonazolam seem to just be the perfect package for me. The potency just doesnt compare to diazepam. I really would not swap 1 0.5mg of C,lam for 50mg diazepam. I think comparing benzos is so subjective anyway it is almost pointless but i understand why people ask. I am terrified i wont be able to get them suddenly i would be so up the creek without a paddle!! 

Can i ask one of our chemistry experts to explain please what is the difference between the half life of c/lam and the duration of effect (ie how long i feel the effects)

Thanks

Hi. I'm on Kolonopin 1mg 3x day. I have wicked bipolar anxiety and have nasty panic attacks. Since switching from Valium to Kolonopin I've had no attacks. My life is chaos right now and it does a good job of keeping me calm. I go see my dr tomorrow and I'm thinking about having her put me on hydroxizine. First, I'm a chronic pain patient and I take Oxycodone ir 15mg 6x day and Opana ER 20mg 3x day. I thought the hydoxizine would help with the itchies and occasional nausea and additional help with anxiety. Also, I've been reading how hydroxizine can potentiates opiates. I know it just adds to the sedating effects of anything but that's perfect for me. So I'm kinda leaning for it. My dr won't have a problem with it. Thought I'd run it my my blue light friends. What do y'all think? Let me know and hopefully this goes thru. All week I've been posting and when I'm done I hit post and it says I'm not logged in and it's all erased. We'll see in a sec. Thanks

So Clonazolam has become increasingly hard as fuck to find and get a hold of, so I may attempt a rapid taper.  I've been taking about .25-.35mg per day. I plan on tapering from that dose to nothing, understanding that it will be quite uncomfortable but much better than cold turkey. I wonder what the best way to go about this is?


I currently have 23.25mg of Clonazolam left, in pellet form. I also have 3mg Klonopin, 15mg Olanazapine (which I hear is a strong theinodiazepine), some antihistamines for sleep and some alcohol to saturate the GABA receptors. I'm trying to get more comfort meds to make this taper easier. Realistically, how shitty is this about to be?

Kolonopin saved my ass yesterday from a massive panic attack. I felt it coming quick and took 2mg and 50mg of hydroxizine and put a rag on my head and it was fine. I don't know where I'd be without it. I'd prob be inpatient somewhere. I find the hydroxizine blends well with the Kolonopin. I don't wanna get addicted but quite frankly benzo addiction is last thing on my mind right now. Anyway, thought I'd share that.

Olanzapine is "technically" a Thienodiazepine but it DOES NOT substitute for benzos, as it does not affect your GABA receptors, instead acting as an antagonist at your serotonin, dopamine, adrenergic and histamine receptors - in other words, a powerful antipsychotic. If you look at the structure, you'll notice it is much closer to the atypical antipsychotic Clozapine than it is to Etizolam or various benzos.

It will take me a while to get into see my psych. He said that he is willing to prescribe clonazepam but not diazepam, because apparently diazepam is more likely to induce depression? I'm not sure if he's 100% right on that, but he could be, and frankly I'll take what I can get. Beggars can't be choosers.


So yeah, I'm down to my final stretch of pills. I have 30mg Clonazolam, 10mg Clonazepam, a very large amount of Gabapentin, Kava, antihistamines (for sleep), some olanazapine pills (which I understand are not benzos, but could probably help stabilize me a bit if I end up freaking out, plus I hear they work for insomnia.) I also have lots of weed. And bourbon, of course. I also have about 100mg of Flubromazolam liquid coming along the way :D and I'm working on acquiring a few Xanax bars, and other various sleep aids.


So I should be set for a while but I think the party's over for me, benzos have just been getting harder and harder to find and I'd rather have my benzo habit be overseen by a licensed practitioner of medicine, rather than by a kid who only has a vague idea of what he's doing (me). I've been on them for 4 years, understanding full well that they fuck with my memory and my baseline anxiety, but the withdrawal is so brutal I've been too scared to kick them for good. They're a great safety net, but one hell of a double edged sword.


It'll be a long and bumpy road but if I can get to the point where I'm taking 1mg Clonazepam per night, as prescribed, I think I'll be in a good spot.

good to hear you're tapering your benzos, IB. the bourbon, however, is a bad idea when tapering. if you really want to do this right, you really need to stick to one or two long/medium acting benzos where you can accurately monitor your doses. you can do that with whiskey too, i suppose, but really alcohol is a bad idea when tapering.


but when you're down to your 1mg clonazepam, just think how sweet the bourbon will taste knowing you're not risking seizures or having to scrabble around for benzos for the hangover anxiety.


i'd even recommend getting off them entirely. in my experience, long term benzo use is only trouble.

Wow, bourbon and benzodiazepines. That could be bad. Unfortunately my benzo use is long term. I have bipolar and severe anxiety disorder. The Kolonopin has been a lifesaver. Last 2 days I felt panic attacks coming on and took 1mg of Kolonopin and 50mg of vistaril. Wards them off. I go see my shrink in a few minutes which is good cause I feel depression ready to pounce. I'm already on 1200mg of lithium but we'll see what my options are. I take Latuda 80mg which is high but if my bipolar gets out of control I see and hear things. I am a bit worried about Kolonopin long term use like addiction but for now they're saving my ass. I think taking responsibly their great. I never got the whole abusing benzodiazepines. They just put me to sleep if I double up. But their not to be messed with for sure. That's all. Be safe out there

^I agree. This is the only benzodiazepine that's completely wiped out good chunks of my memory and made me make a fool of myself on. The urge to redose and blackedout-ness of this one is strong! There's also been a string of polydrug overdoses among users that I've known to start dabbling with this chemical. I don't know if there's any relation or causation there but it's just something to take into account. Anyways, due to the very high risk vs reward ratio, I'm staying far away henceforth. Not really much therapeutic potential imo.

I already said it, also in the Flubromazolam-Thread, and can only repeat it and agree with the two posters above:


Clonazolam and Flubromazolam are no joke and I flushed my last Flubro-Pellets after having an intense rebound including anxiety and insomnia from only rare use of small doses (0,5mg Clona/0,25mg Flubro). Clonazolam was even worse when I tried it back then.

These Triazolo-Benzos fuck people up beyond recognition and have a very high amnesia potential even in low doses. These are like the Benzo-version of the Fentanyl Analogues even if the comparison is flawed.


Take care guys.

i have a thread on this question thats been on my mind for a while. can you use table sugar and mix it with clonazolam as a way to measure clonazolam dosage? i tried this last night and it worked. but i was wondering if this could be potentially fatal or have me blackout. thanks for any help or critisim

I agree with what's been said. I get 3 1mg Kolonopin a day and I'm on a sched. I'm allowed to take 2 if I have an anxiety attack but I don't mess with them. I find that I still had anxiety so I started on vistaril and it's been a great combo. I was at my pain dr this morning and she gave me a script for naltrexone shots in case I have severe respitory depression cause of being on high doses of pain meds and benzodiazepines. I drank heavily for 20 years and I'm glad I never messed with benzodiazepines while drinking. That's when the problems start. One time in all those years I took a Xanax bar while drunk and went out and drove in a blackout and couldn't find my car in the morning. Plenty of spots in my apartment but I parked at restaurant across the street. When I was in rehab last year I would say at least 5 out of 20 dudes had a problem with brnzos and booze together and we're all in there for court cause they did something stupid. I take 15 meds a day and I try to be responsible with all of them. I wish I didn't need Kolonopin but my panic attacks are nasty and when I was on Valium I had them all the time. Since switching I haven't had any. Beginning of a couple but Kolonopin and cold rag on head saved me. Please be careful with all benzos but especially Kolonopin. Be safe

^Pardon me but this thread is about Clona*zolam*, not Clonazepam/Klonopin but no problem. They get confused a lot.


^^Regarding mixing Clonazolam powder with sugar: This is very unreliable and dangerous!! Don't do it. Just dilute a known amount in Propylene Glycol so you can dose it per volume.

Clonazolam is pretty much sold out everywhere, China has apparently banned over a hundred drugs. Looks like they will bring an end to the RC scene before the UK Government ban next year. Best to stock up some Diclazepam ready for a long taper.

Profane: What do you like about them? Just curious because I would prefer every other Benzo over both of them anytime. Different tastes I guess, or do you have a large tolerance?

I tried this a half year ago not really knowing much about it besides it being a benzodiazepine. I've done benzos several times before, but never on a regular basis and i think it had probably been at least a year since i did it last time so my tolerance was at zero. This shit was crazy potent though, easily the strongest effects i've experienced from any benzos ever ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) I'm not sure how many mg i had, but i think 6-7*0,5. It was a horrible experience. It was nice in the beginning, first 2-3 pills, but me and my mate apparently kept re-dosing, although i only remember that we took 3*0,5 each. We were able to count from the pills the day after that we had taken much more than that.


The night of ingestion is mostly a complete blackout for me. I don't even remember how i got home and i'm sort of amazed that i did. I woke up in my bed the day after, but my whole room was completely torn apart. My glasses were smashed, my speakers were lying floor, my television knocked off of the table and lying on the floor. My labtop was completely destroyed, the screen totally shattered as if i had been dancing on top of it the night before or some shit. In the kitchen my refrigerator was pulled out from the cupboard, cord ripped out of the plug, and lying on the floor. There was food and beer and broken bottles everywhere 8( I couldn't remember anything at all and I still can't. It's completely blank and gone. I have no clue what happened in there, i just woke in a complete mess. Horrible really, never ever doing that shit again!


Something interesting to note about it though. The day after when i woke up in all that mess i could still feel some of the effects of the drug. These were actually nice and relaxing effects. I slipped back and forth between sleeping and being awake. The interesting part was that i was not sleeping deep at all, but i was still dreaming, like real lucid dreaming even with lucid auditory effects, but i was still conscious and aware of this state. This gave it sort of like a very slight psychedelic twist to it. I think it was close to 48 hours after ingestion before the effects/aftereffects had faded and diminished so much that i could no longer feel it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Anyways, be careful with this stuff, be careful when dosing and be careful not ending up overdoing them. I'm sure these are also extremely addictive especially for those of you that have already taken a liking to other benzos.

Classic wacky benzo blackout antics ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). And that's not too surprising at a high dose cause it's got A medium length 14-18 hr half life and will take a while to totally clear your system. It probably suppresses your deepest sleep stage, allowing you to get more rem stage sleep and dream crazy dreams.

Loved this stuff when it was first released. Even got myself 250mg powder which i eventually flushed down the toilet thank fuck. Broke my phone and took family out for dinner randomly on this stuff with very little memory of the actual events. Cant imagine how royally i would have fucked up if I kept that powder!

Just wanna echo some of the warnings/experiences people have had with this compound.


I have had probably 10-15 or so experiences with Clonazolam ranging in dose from .5mg to 4.5mg, each of these was done with zero tolerance to benzos (More than a week or two between I'd say, except for 2 days where I took .5mg each night)


This is an intense drug. My 4.5mg experience wasn't intentional, I blacked out after 1mg into it and woke up to find I'd eaten much more. This is your typical benzo blackout and redose, I suppose. I think what led to the issue was that I had been mixing it with amphetamine to keep myself awake, which probably led to an over pronounced sense of confidence that I could handle my doses, which I obviously couldn't.


My other times with .5mg and 1mg were okay for sleeping, but not functioning. I was pretty gone on those doses for around 12 hours. The next morning would be foggy if I took it later in the evening.


The one thing that really disturbed me about clonazolam is the addiction potential. If I took it two days in a row, which I did twice, I had rebound anxiety for about 3-4 days after it. The day after the doses was fine, but 48 hours later I would have intense anxiety that was present all day in a very jittery way, as if I'd ingested too much caffeine too quickly. The rebound anxiety was so pronounced I could see somebody with actual anxiety problems getting sucked into this stuff very deeply. It's worth noting I've never had this issue with any other benzo, although my other experiences are limited to alprazolam and etizolam. Even after week long binges on etizolam I didn't have this kind of rebound anxiety. Something about Clonazolam just doesn't feel right to me, I don't think a single dose of a benzo should have this kind of addiction potential, yet this one does. Weirder still, Clonazolam isn't even all that pleasant. There is some euphoria, but it's action seems to be majorly hypnotic. It's mostly a blackout drug, which I guess you'll enjoy if that's your thing, but if you're researching it for euphoric effects or general anxiety relief you'll probably be disappointed at it's zombifying effects.


Be extremely cautious with this one, folks. This may be something to avoid entirely for people with serious anxiety issues or risk of addiction.

As has been said many times, please do pay the respect that Cloazolam is due. It is extremely potent and personally i find it hits me better than any scripted benzo's i have tried. If you have little experience with benzo's then i would advise taking no more than one 0.5mg pellet to start off with. 0.5mg should be plenty for a benzo naive person to feel the full effects of this drug. I have some experience with scripted diazepam, temazepam and also tried eitzolam and nothing has hit as hard as Clonazolam.


It gives me a real mood lift and makes me more chatty than i normally am but it also gives me strong amnesia where i cannot recall who or what i was talking too or about the day before. If i take one 0.5mg in the afternoon then it does provide me with a fantastic nights sleep. I've not mixed it with alcohol and i suggest you don't either as you never know what kinda mess that could end up in.


These little pellets are very potent indeed so please do try and give them the respect that they rightly deserve.

Hmm all this alarmism is weird to me. For about 10 months I ordered the yellow .5mg gelcaps, when that avenue died, I didn't have much clonazolam afterwards, some of the pills once, but wasn't the main purchase (and were much much lesser than the yellow gelcaps).


When the availability  of it disappeared for me, I just started taking my valium script again that I was stockpiling. The fact it's much weaker even at my legal 20mg a day was hard to endure for maybe 3-4 days. An opiate withdrawal or going from shooting Dilaudid to snorting would have been a lot more intolerable.

Quick update.


IV'ed 0.5mg (I can't be bothered waiting the comeup, i know right. H turned me into a needle junkie.)


Much less euphoria.

Lots of muscle relaxation.

Pretty chill.

Muscle relaxation is there.

Music appreciation is there.

Bit of a meh, not really interested in much though as its 4.40am.


Maybe another day.


Oh and no more live trip reports, just thought I'd better while I remember it.

Shit I rember one day I had a bottle of PG solution with 1mg/ml c-lam and was already fucked up on some booze and a few c-lam pills. My genius of a brain decided it was a great idea to fucking IV 2ml of this shit. So my half blacked out self loaded up my rig, tied off and tried to hit a vein for a good 5 min. Fianaly got it in, and woke up the next morning with blood all over my arm and the syringe bloody and almost half full laying next to me.

This and F-lam are serious shit. I took both (separate times) with a serious tolerance (6-10 mg clonzepam/day) at 1 mg for each, each time and after 2 hours of stellar euphoria, blacked-out both times. Apparently re-dosed both times also (though i've no recollection of doing it). Tried again later at 0.5 mg clonazolam, and later 0.25 mg flubromazolam, was underwhelmed both times at the recommended dose. Apparently there is a very thin line with these, even for an experienced user. Be careful unless you've been on a daily benzo regime for a long time, and even then, use caution. Blacking out and finishing off your stash is a very real possiblity if you cross the line. I've avoided these since (also, because withdrawals seem more pronounced even from short binges)

My hunch is there are people with these drugs reporting inaccurate doses. People claim they took ~2mg, well if those doses were weighed accurately they probably took exactly 1/5 of the approximate dose they said they took guys.

Both clonazolam and flubromazolam were put through irresponsible and rigorous high dose testing for 3 days, fake me and my fake friend had 50 reds and 70 pinks. It started off one of each at about 3 pm thursday, memory loss till Monday. Wake up already awake watching TV with a different fake friend at home who thought I was normal? I immediately panicked and called my other intoxicated fake friend who spoke to me in slurred speech and made no sense he must weigh 55kg he is small and skinny so it probably lasted longer for him.


Imaginery me checks my phone and texts and find out I have FU***** up, texts to family, people I work with and some girls.... They had such bad spelling you would've thought I had drunk a litre of vodka to drown my sorrows and for some reason I must've thought I should text everyone in a group chat what I am doing quoting 'vibe takinvc scomeee drtugssa'


Imaginary me got away with all this by saying my other imaginary friend had some qualuudes and we took them because we thought we were cool, as Wolf of Wall Street had just come out. Everyone found it hilarious instead of worrying.

My dose was from a PG solution so I doubt it was inaccurate. Like I said I just think the recreational window (similar to therapeutic index) is thin for these. You take an average dose with a tolerance and it's nothing special. Take double that (i.e 0.5-1mg vs 2-3mg) and you could lose enough of your short term memory to compulsively re-dose (possibly without knowing you're redosing, a la phenazepam)


I think flubromazolam is truly the dangerous one though - I have no evidence to confirm that it was not the culprit for my disaster experiences with both these being available to me at the time.

All I can say is that I used it to help with the side effects from a pv binge a while ago. I used about .5-1mg about 4 times a day for the first day or so and when the 10 day binge was over about 100mg was gone. Dont ever use this in conjunction with stims because Ithink the biggest issue was that I wouldnt notice how fucked up on the clonazolam I was while I was all wired on pvp but if Id let myself come down the clonazolam would just hit hard and I enter blackout mode quite quickly. After the binge I got rid of the rest of the clonazolam and didnt think that this short binge could produce w/d nor have I ever experienced benzo wd so when the w/d hit me I thought that some gbl I took earlier that day poisoned me. This is because I had been off the clonazolam 3 days taking gbl that I had just received from a new chinese supplier and it wasnt until I stopped dosing the gbl for a day that I was convinced that something poisonous was mixed in with the gbl. I couldnt concentrate enough to follow a tv program for 10 seconds and I kept trying to get a grip on reality by trying to find something I could recognize as a familiar feeling, but even my family seemed like they werent familiar to the point where I spent hours just listening to them socialize because it all seemed so unreal. I was absolutely fear ridden that had done permanent damage on my brain and cant believe now that i didn't realize the more rational reason for my state of delirium being rebound effects from my massive clonazolam binge. Being poisoned was all I could think about in my state of intense anxiety provoked by the intense depersonalization I was experiencing. Finally I went home and was able to calm down enough to decide to take some etizolam i had stashed away which brought me back to reality. I have never been so relieved in my life to come out of that terrifying state the clonazolam put me in. I took etizolam for about a week at 1mg 2x day and didnt have any wd after.

Contemplating getting some clonazolam. It sounds like a great benzo, but also a good way to fuck myself up. I'm also considering trying a-pvp, just a little bit. Ugh I'm walking a thin tempting line.

Don't. It is not worth it. Together with Flubromazolam these are the most self-destructing Benzos there are. Just check the horror storys. Same with a-pvp.

Together it would just wreck you up. Better get something lighter.

It depends on if you're someone taking benzodiazepines all day every day or once every now and then.


See I have a few grams of benzos here and haven't used them in weeks - it's definitely possible to use them responsible.

Thank you that is good advice. I've heard the horror stories of Flub especially and I'm sure this chem has just as many. I'll probably make a more responsible choice and get etizolam and 4-FA. A-PVP i was just considering because I've never tried it. Probably not missing out though and I LOVE 4-FA probably more than I would A-PVP. On the fence with clonazolam or etizolam though. Etizolam is definitely more useful and clonazolam apparently more recreational. We'll see I'll definitely keep responsibility in mind though.

IF you never tried a-pvp absolutely do not decide to. You cant even get it in the US anymore unless obtained from some street dealer which I never have done and Chinas ban includes it so it most likely pretty scarce in the European nations as well. If you end up liking it which is very probable and can find a steady supply you will one day wish you had headed my advice. I absolutely promise you that.

I have a source, I feel it will dry out eventually so I thought about trying it before the ban. There's no way I could become addicted I don't have the money. I'm just not sure whether to get MDA, 6-APB, 4-FA or A-PVP with the money I have.

I finally got a source again after the source of the yellow little gelcaps dried up, they are blotter papers heh, which to me is funny, the drawing on them is cooler than most of the blotter (lsd) I handled in life, which was usually just random little drawings on each, either red on white, blue on white or green on white, lots of reference to punk music (DOA logo, Sid Vicious, also funny ones like an anti-syringe symbol) but I'm rambling here.


With blotters, do you gotta keep them under your tongue for 15-20 minutes like LSD then you can swallow it?,  I know it seems like an obvious question but I don't know, I  never Sub benzos ever, I tend to chew the pills and then have a drink of whatever i'm drinking at the moment.

Lol so british LEO attracting people with their least terrible horror stories turning this thing like if it was the devil's downer.


There's 3-hydroxy-phenazepam out there. I don't mind, since it is dosed pills, not pure powder. Am not about to try it but I sure know it's there. Same with Nitrazolam, looks like the douches who have it do not want to sell it to Canadians. Which sucks. Nitrazepam is one of my fav scriptable benzo.

I tend to agree, when used with great respect and caution, these extraordinarily potent benzos (c-lam and f-lam) can be useful and recreational. For first time users (of these drugs specifically, not benzos in general) Should take half the recommended dose first, then on a separate occasion try a little more until you've found a proper dose (IMO). You can easily go from feeling nothing to 7 days later and a train-wreck behind you if you redose too soon or overshoot the mark - which is very easy.

The most useful in a utilitarian way drug class there is. More than the amphetamines where sometimes you feel like you're dying or lack oxygen (that skin prickling) 50% of the time you're on them, but nah, your doctor scripted them so its fine....yeah..

Took 3 times clonazolam (1mg each time)... and I did black about every time !

Thankfully I rarely redose, especially downer... so I succeed to not redose (or I don't remember to ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Well, 1mg is just way too much if you have no tolerance. I forgot half the day on even 0,5mg.

I said it many times but this and Flubromazolam should just vanish from the RC-Market. There exist much safer alternatives which do not have that extreme desaster potential, at least not in such small doses.


I never had such problems with other Benzos but I flushed my remaining Clona- and Flubromazolam pellets after blacking out and experiencing the worst rebound symptoms ever.


Stay with Etizolam, Diclazepam etc. and just ignore these evil fuckers.

Man this one just keeps causing horror stories as well as f-lam.... These should not be used except those with a tolerance and experience it seems and even then that is dangerous as the blackout threshold seems extremely low and that could easily lead to redosing.

I was remarkably surprised once the trainwrecks started pouring in - I never experienced anything remotely like the usual benzo'd bad ideas and subsequent blackouts.

F-Lam however was an absolute abomination, I have months missing from my memory.

You've been heavily abusing drugs for years and it didn't cause any good, any plans to quit entirely?

^ This

But seriously, lay down the drugs and start looking for help. 

Everything I have read from you(foolsgold) is about you abusing the shit out of pretty much every drug you lay your hands on. 


Lots of people on bl abuse drugs obviously. Many of them as some kind of self medication, some others just for the sake of it. 

A few, you being one of them, absolutely _destroy_ themselfs in no time with _everything_. 

Of course some drugs will take a toll on you quicker than others. But the way you do it every drug will wreck you FAST! 


Eventually you have to lay down the pipe!- metaphorically speaking ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I am serious about this. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Clonazalem, however you spell it, is the devil. Etizolam is too, but clonozalem is even worst. It only takes a little to do damage. I am afraid of what I might do on it and what I have already done and have no recollection of. You could easily end up in jail or in the most horrible predicament of your life or even dead because this drug takes complete control of you. It might sound stupid, but it feels like a demon possesses my body when I take it and that demon makes me do things I would never ever imagine. Oh! I forgot another horrendous thing about it is I tweet while on it and don't even remember. I tweet anything, embarrassing things without even knowing until I'm sober. I've also texted people and direct messaged people without even knowing it. It's scary to look back at things I've said to people without being coherent. It makes me talk to anyone and completely tell them anything. Amnesia is a huge problem and I'm pretty sure I've had a seizure before because there was a bite mark on my tongue and it hurt. I'm scared it will be the death of me.

I just remembered one time while I was high on c-lam, I gave my little brother 2 pills. Thank God he only took one 0.5 pill because that ONE pill completely made him fall to the floor. Seriously, he flew backwards on the floor and like he passed out then woke up really quickly. He had no benzo tolerance and I wasn't thinking when gave him one. I would never forgive myself if he ended up in the hospital.

You're absolutely right. It feels like the drugs are all I have now because even though it's dangerous, it makes me happy and feel social. When you suffer from severe depression and anxiety, it's like a Godsend, but actually it's a nightmare in the long run.

I've noticed that Klonopin has never made me react this way. Klonopin only makes me sleepy and it's boring. Etizolam and c-lam are highly euphoric. It makes you feel like you're on top of the world, like mania. So there's definitely a huge difference between K-pin and these RCs.

Sorry for posting a lot in this thread, but I want to add that cravings are unbearable! It comes in waves and you feel like you desperately need it if you go a few days without it. I'm ready to pull my hair out when the craving comes over me. I'm expecting a package soon and then I'm kicking this stuff because it has consumed my life.

It really wasn't that much euphoric like stims are for me. Probably because I have been on kpin for six years for Gad.. I thought at first it was making me very talkative but then the tiredness came on and I just passed out. I will say that .5 blotter is stronger than 1 mg of klonopin. So there is def a difference.

I got this salty taste in my mouth and it maybe the ink or the clonazelam. Today instead of taking my twelve o clock pill I took a blotter and really it just feel like a klonopin mixed with a little talkativeness. But nothing profound. So coasttocoast how did yours come in. Blotter, powder, or pellets which I heard where the worst form.

I wonder why pellets are considered the worst form. I looked on the package and I was also mistaken about the strength. I always assumed it was .5, but it said .7. I took two and felt good. There was a radio show I always wanted to call so I called because I wasn't as nervous before. They were clownin' and making fun because I was slurring. Haha It was fun and a good experience. Then I had some good food, feel asleep. Nothing crazy happened.


So why are pellets worst? My supplier is out of this world. It's always the best quality.


Today, I'm going to stick to Etiz, that might be more euphoric than C-Lam actually. The world just feels right when you're on it. Shit, I might find a guy to take me to see "The Witch".

If they bottle said .7 I know where you got them and they are IMO the most reasonable pellets to use. I only once had blackout experience like that but mine was straight sleep inducing. But once I figured out the dosage that never happened again and I used them responsibly for daily anxiety.

Yes. If you use them responsibly, I believe there will be no problems. I seriously was binging on them at one point and that's where trouble comes. I had the mentality that I didn't care about my life. Now, I'm going to take it easy with my new stack of Etiz and c-lam. Have you tried etiz?

Can anyone definitively say whether Clonazolam will show up on a drug test?  I am waiting for a police report when I got arrested months ago when I was doing TONS of clonaz a day.  I haven't been able to get a definitive answer.  


clonaz is truly nutty shit.  I can't remember years of my life, nor do I want to with all the embarrassing shit I did.

Just picked up 50mg/5ml solution of clonazalam from a reputable dealer. Confused and have a few questions


**OK so I just received my a research package today and must say shipping was very fast. That was great. I got a little plastic bottle and an oral syringe. The oral syringe is 1ml so a full one would contain 10mg. (Solution is 50mg/5ml remember)


There are 10 "units" to the 1ml (.1-1ml) on the syringe, so just half a unit would be the .5mg dosage I am needing for my research. (My research subject has no benzo tolerance) I was so scared to overdose but measured very carefully and squirted under subjects tongue. 2 hrs later it's not feeling much but a little relaxation. So I decided to do another .5mg. Same thing, not feeling barely anything. What gives? I've triple checked my math on the syringe and just halfway to the .1 should be .5mg but i'm getting no effect. Any one else shared this issue? Am I wrong with my math? P.S. should the tip of the oral syringe be empty or full when dosing. I assumed empty Please help. I dont want to go squirting this in my mouth willy nilly. I just don't understand, I thought this stuff was super potent (Etiz has me wobbling all over without a care in the world) Thanks all.

Hi. Got a question. I use about 7 to 8 mgs of etizolam to get high. I've got a bottle of .5 mg clonazolam (yes clonazolam not clonazepam) pills laying around. How many mgs of clonazolam would you say equal 7 mgs of etizolam? Or, how many mgs of etizolam equal .5 mgs of clonazolam? I cannot find an answer to this question.

Clonazolam is much stronger than Etizolam in my experience. It will blow you away. Whenever you take clonazolam for the first time, you want to start low. One pill could do well for you. 2 probably wouldn't hurt because you take such a high dose of Etizolam already. Take 1 or 2 (no more than 2!) and you'll see it's like double the strength of etizolam. That's why you have to be very careful with it because it's much easier to black out on it.

How many mgs of clonazolam would you say equal 7 mgs of etizolam? Or, how many mgs of etizolam equal .5 mgs of clonazolam? I cannot find an answer to this question.

I have boring ass Klonopin right now and this is making me wish I had a bottle of clonazolam. 2 of those pills and I'm floating on top of the world...Lots of fun. It can cause black out on its own with a high dose, but drinking on it at all will pretty much guarantee one.

I don't know, and being passive aggressive isn't going to help anyone else answer. Clonazolam is pretty powerful, it's best to start low and work your way up.

I think one mg of clonazolam is a good start when i take 7 or 8 etizolam at a time and don't even get all that high.

The US is very slow with banning benzos. After all these years, etizolam is only banned in a few states. Even phenazepam isn't banned in most places!

Which are? There's Etizolam and the scam that is deschloro-etizolam. There's some nice ones for RX in other countries like Brotizolam, but this one is banned by name in Canada for some reason, and Canada is pretty kind when it comes to RC's too, we got what, some jwh's, some CP's serie cannabinoids banned, MDPV and of everything they could ban Khat. 4-MMC and Methylone are still legal, just not one canadian store sells them anymore, or sometimes they got like 24 hour sales without warning, like they did with MXE, since MXE is close to PCE but legally could be arguably legally classified as not close enough. Canada is a country where in some areas, PCP, PCE and PCP-y are all found in the same powder called "pcp" so that's why PCE is banned since eons ago.

Clonazolam is seriously potent in my experience. You think you are fine and then even .25mg later you are drooling on the floor. Alongside etizolam (in very high doses) it is the only benzo where I have experienced real blackouts and lost whole days during which I was apparently up and communicating. Now order them in 0.25mg tablets, seems like the most sensible dose. Definitely not the ideal choice for tapering, too euphoric and potent, half life to short. Send your tolerance rising fast as well. But fun!

This stuff is just too strong to mess with, especially in powder form. I blew through a 1:1 mixture of clonzolam/PG in a matter of days acting like a dumbass at work and at home. Then I got 100mg, which promptly DISPPEARED with 3 days of my life and an EMBARRASSING meeting at work. I am lucky I'm not in jail or dead. This stuff is insta-idiot for me, even in low doses! The blackouts happen so quickly. No more. I got a call from my boss asking if I was okay at which I had to answer I have some bad stuff going on in my life and that the anti-anxiety drugs were the cause of my behavior. In truth, I'm just a moron and this one is too much for me. I find this substance very difficult to use responsibly, especially once under the influence. And that's coming from years of alprazolam, diazepam, clonazepam, etc. use.


Tread lightly.

I got 25 1mg purple clonazolam pills. Probably for the last time ever, also had never seen this strength per pill, which is perfect, i'd always take 2 0.5, but 1 1mg is enough.


There's something coming my way I already have a little of from the UK probably for the last time too, norflurazepam 5mg pills, they are amazing, and ready about the 68x times stronger anti-clotting effect of flurazepam which would make this also pretty stronger than aspirin for that purpose....I guess it's even healthy to be having some of it in powder right now for my nights :


[Benzodiazepines inhibit human platelet activation: comparison of the mechanism of antiplatelet actions of flurazepam and diazepam. - PubMed - NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2990062)


My other options for benzo rc's are in continental europe for now, all the stores from the UK I know who said they were moving havent been giving much info, and they started the process of being accepted into another EU country more than a year ago white as bread britons (not racism from my part but it should help em).


Cloniprazepam, norflunitrazepam, thats what I could obtain in theory. What pisses me off the most is that I LOVE NITRAZEPAM, and some place in hungary has Nitrazolam and will NOT send to canada.


I forgot how much I enjoy clonazolam, probably the best rc benzo ever so far. There's also diclazepam because, if all I could get was diclazepam, we'd be really happy...which makes me think...that stuff's cheap as f...

^That is because you have a very large tolerance to Benzos in general from what I have gathered.

Non tolerant individuals get seriously fucked up from 0,5mg and even when I had a medium tolerance 0,5mg was enough to appear obviously intoxicated.

This stuff is no joke, same with Flubromazolam. I experienced very harsh rebound symptoms too after only using it for like 3 days and could not sleep, got startled very easily and my anxiety was through the roof.

I stick to non-Triazolo-Benzos from now. Never had such problems with the classics.

I seem to be the only one where rcs have no effect on, I ordered 25 x clonazolam .5mg pellets and was sooo looking forward to trying them out, took 4 tablets, major disappointment, same as flubromazolam, diclazepam, flubromazepam etc..... I have to take 10 x 1mg etizolam to either get a little high, either my tolerance is ridiculously high or im getting dud tabs, what do ye guys think? xxx

So I can say with 100% certainty that at both low, and extremely high doses of clonazolam, it will NOT show up in a drug test.  This is both in a hospital setting, AND having urine tested by a state police lab.

So in other words, you're in a constant GABA-ergic and opioid-fueled stupor and you're wondering why even larger doses of potent triazo- benzos aren't working right?

I can say with certainty that, if a urine/blood test is administered at a hospital/state facility, clonazolam will cause a false positive for alprazolam. The two obviously have a related metabolite.


I know this because my friend wrecked off the side of the road several months ago. She was knocked out on impact, had broken glass in her head, and her brain bled. This was all caused by a clonazolam OD.


When she got to the hospital, they immediately tested her for drugs. Several days later, she showed a false positive for alprazolam.


They used this evidence to create a bunch of bullshit charges that cost her out the ass and got her stuck in jail for almost a month (until her publuc defender finally got her bail reduced from fucking 25 grand, which was only that high because a couple of her charges weren't even close to legitimate). She had a kid and no job, so it was already hard enough for her.


She came very close to death because of this substance. She was pronounced dead at the hospital, but "cane back life" after she came out of the coma. This drug caused her brain functioning to slow to the point where she was considered clinically dead and had been since around 8 hours before the crash even happened (by the time she'd gotten plenty of them into her).


I, also, have personally had no good experiences with clonazolam. It lasts far too long, is stronger than necessary, and will leave you in a blacked out state for days on end, popping pill after pill with no worries about the repercussions.


Oh yeah, the repercussions are much worse than just poor decision making. The wd is horrible, the worst out of all available benzos/thienos. The effects are very powerful, however, the  wd is worse than heroin and xanax combined. I was forced to stop cold turkey after a couple weeks of daily (heavy, blacked out, idiot type doses, which were generally around 1.5mg throughout the day and then all out at night) clonazolam use because it was my car she wrecked, so I had to move back in with my parents to afford to fix the damage to my car, where, of course, my dad found my pill bottle immdeiately and flushed it. I experienced severe nerve pain, delusionally thought invisible entities were going to end my life in my sleep, and was extremely shakey. Luckily, I had an excuse to take off from work and allow my mind to heal.


My friend had issues with seizures while wding in jail, but she had already done considerable harm to her nervous system by oding on meth/crank multiple times within the last few months before the accident; I can't attribute that solely to clonazolam. I personally didn't have a single seizure and never have. If I ever did, I'd be the first in my bloodline to have one, though.


Overall, me and a couple friends went through 45mgs in a couple weeks (maybe not even two whole weeks). Barely remember anything at all from that time period, but ended up getting several charges while under the influence.


If you're going to choose to use this benzo, I've found it more useful at dosages around .125-.25. Minor effects can be noticed at just an 8th of a single pill (half the size of .125mg).

Sure.  I ended up in the hospital for an OD and nothing showed up.  Later on I was arrested for DUI and had to give a urine sample.  I was shitting myself thinking I was going to get additional charges for having an illegal drug in my body.  I spent months worrying.  I found out from my attorney only my subs I was taking at the time showed up on the drug test...oh, and oddly enough Benadrly.  And I know for sure I hadn't taken any benadryl that day so maybe the clonaz showed up as benadryl, which actually can help my case because my lawyer is trying to say the benadryl made me drowsy.

*Random thought*


The trainwrecks in this thread are very much at odds with my own (thorough - used recreationally, as maintenance/therapeutic and also as my dedicated taper drug when I ended my BZD dependency) experience and such tales have not come to my attention within EADD, or rather the UK-dominated sub-forum. F-Lam is infamous as an abomination against all that is holy, unholy, and indeed pretty much everything, that induces amnesic blackouts with unrivaled disaster probability - did anyone who rode the pellet-shaped-train right off the rails with C-Lam actually get the tabs analysed?

The apparent endemic nature, the sudden prevalence of such tales, the terrible publicity surrounding F-Lam, the similar potency and the inconsistency surrounding detected metabolites makes me really quite suspicious... ![:sus:](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/suspicious.gif)

I felt like I was going to have a seizure at any given point for seriously like 10 days. Shit didn't subside until about the time I got out of jail.

They did keep me on med watch for about a week though.

 I agree with you. I've never used any clonazolam unless it was already placed on blotters or tablets.


 From what I gather, most people who have horrible experiences with it either had powder, or were not used to the strength of these new thienos.


My first ever experience w clonazolam, I took a .5mg dose (while sleep-deprived, in hopes of falling asleep), but ended up blacking out, getting in a fight with a gas station clerk over a pack of cigarettes, and ended up in jail.


The cops let me off easy because I told them the truth about what I'd done before the incident and that it was a huge mistake. They dropped most of my charges, but left me with paraphernalia (brought down from poss of controlled substance, dwi, reckless driving, disturbing the peace, and paraphernalia).


The only time I've ever had cops be lenient with me and not use the info I gave them to lock me in jail.

These kinda stories are always so hard to believe.


I mean when people take 4+ mg of clonazepam with some beer for their first time maybe. (4mg of clonazepam is stronger than .5 clonazolam, by a bunch).

Nothing. And typically it's a giant rip-off. Buy powder and a bottle of propylene glycol and make a 1:1 solution yourself.

I prefer clonazolam pills. I know exactly the dose I'm getting and don't have to measure it myself. Never tried the liquid, always seemed dangerous to me.


Speaking of clonazolam, thank God I'm able to get an order of pellets this week. It makes all the difference in the world. It can turn a shit day into a good one.

With an oral syringe, it's not. Not more than when one is prescribed codeine or hydrocodone syrup, you gotta measure your dose with that little syringe. But yes, the prices I've seen for syrups of these are out there expensive. Only advantage is that a bottle of liquid is less suspicious than pills, even if the content is legal.

Anyone here do the blotter. I'm interested in the pellets but the blotter does pretty well. It's .five and I'm on three mg of klonopin a day so if if I stick twenty five blotter on my tongue I think maybe I'll be in trouble lol

Being on clonazpam for six years plus Xanax for one year and Valium for three months doesn't help the fact that I do want that warm feeling. One time I drank a glass of this sweet red wine and took one mg of klonopin p. I blacked out for three days. I was with a whole bunch of gay ppl so I have no clue what happened. That's why I always say be safe with benzos. Klonopin is a beast if you have zero tolerance but if your anxiety is so bad you can't get out of bed it feels like mdma to me. My flesh feels lighter. Ppl touch me and my muscles aren't stiffened, ah, such a good feeling I miss.

I do know what you mean about the crippling anxiety. Even though I've been "mostly clean," there's still some days I can't get up unless I have some benzos to guarantee my day is going to fly by and it'll be worth it.

That's all I can find is the liquid on the clear net. Haven't ran into powder or pellets except on DNM for way too much. 


Mixing GABAergic drugs is really bad advice. That's practically asking for a blackout.

I was with gay ppl, that is what I mean. I don't know what happened but back in 05 I was fresh meat. I'm not judging. I live with a gay couple I just don't know what happened so you have to see it from my perspective that anything could of happened.

I've been going a bit heavy on these new Benzos and I wondering whether Diclazepam/Diazepam/Flubromazepam would best to manage my withdrawal(s)/taper? I've been experimenting for a few months now, initially just once every few weeks on Flubromazepam, Diclazepam (Which worked great at 1 mg per day for the couple of weeks I used it during a time when I had no Diazepam available for my taper. Back then I was on 10 mg Diazepam per day and felt relatively stable, but far from anywhere near comfortable.


Sorry I've rambled (Blame the Clonazolam!) and the Grammar Grammer spelling etc ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Anyway, The last Month or so I've been taking anywhere between -

Clonazolam; 1.5mg - 3mg per Day.

Flubromazolam; 2mg - 3mg, maybe once or twice a week.

Etizolam; 5mg - 10mg, maybe just at the weekend, twice a week at most (Both brands - Etizest & Etilaam)

Flubromazepam; 16mg - 40mg, maybe once or twice a week.

Diclazepam/Diazepam; 1mg - 5mg/20-50mg Maybe once every couple of weeks (Saving it for my taper)

Meclonazepam; 24mg as a one off test; felt zero effects. Thought it was obviously tolerance I have, but no, I gave my friend who has zero tolerance 12mg Meclonazepam and he also reported no effects.


Out of the RC Benzos I haven't yet tried.. I have some Metizolam, Nifoxipam, and N-Desalkylflurazepam (Norflurazepam) due this week as I want them a try. Especially as I used to Love Flurazepam (Dalmane) I think 30mg?? for the few Year period when it was available to me. Beautiful Benzo, as is Flunitrazepam and Lormetazepam.  


*Note It's now been nearly 2 hours since I took the Clonazolam (3 mg) and I'm definitely feeling it. Fancy taking some Etizolam though, as a couple of days ago I took my Clonazolam 2.5mg) waited around an hour and then consumed 5mg Etilaam Etizolam Which I initially thought were bunk as the previous Saturday 10mg didn't touch me. But combined with the Clonazolam they felt perfect. Maybe it was chance and I hadn't given the Clonazolam enough time to kick in..?? But usually I'm feeling it after 45 minutes. Anyway, within 45 minutes I felt as good as I can remember in a long time off Benzos (I'm just taken to take some 5mg of Etizest (5mg Etizolam - 2 hours after my dose of Clonazolam) now to see how they react with the Clonazolam compared to the Etilaam)


As you can see I'm in a little deeper than I'd like to be. My idea was to go clean for a few days (The Flubromazolam should carry me for a little while, and I aslo have a fair bit of Flubromazepam in my system which should hopefully shield me for a few days) Then in a few days/ when withdrawals begin to kick in, start taking 20mg Diazepam daily and see how that works out, give it a week or so to see where I'm at, that's if 20mg is enough to keep me out of acute withdrawal, or I may take Diclazepam 2mg per day, maybe alternate days with the Diazepam. My guess is 20mg will be too low a dose. The problem I find with Diclazepam is, it leaves me feeling more depressed than usual, and I know Benzos are not good for this, especially high doses, but even 1mg per day completely killed my sex drive/ability to get an erection.


My guess is I'm in for a ruff ride to say the least, especially as a lot of these newer Benzos are super strong and there is very little long term research into their effects. Can't say we weren't warned. My worry is my Diclazepam/Diazepam will not fully cover the withdrawal from all these new Pam's/Lam's.


Any ideas/advice on a taper schedule>? I know I'm in a bit of mess and should have learnt by now..


I once used to binge on 300mg Xanax over the course of 24 hours or so every weekend, for a good many months back in spring 2010 (Upjohn 1mg Alprazolam with the 0.9 imprint on them) Then in the summer I reduced my intake to daily 10 - 20mg for around a Month and then went cold turkey. That was my first Benzo withdrawal Cold turkey and I'd injured me hand at around that same time (Squashed Radial Nerve - I lost control of all movement in my left hand for weeks so I was signed off work. So I could at least try and ride out the withdrawals during my time off work. I can remember vividly; I took my last Benzo on 24th July 2010, spent the next 3 weeks of insomnia, Paranoia, hypersensitivity, hyperexcitability halluciinations, rebound anxiety, derealisation, loss of balance/coordination, headaches, sweats etc etc.. You get the picture.


One last thing: I Love Clonazolam, but has anyone else noticed any side effects such as extremely dry mouth.


Sorry about the essay.


Happy Easter Happy


just about to begin yet another Benzo taper after several previous dangerous and foolish cold turkey attempts from long term extreme abuse levels of various Benzos. One of them cold turkey's from a 20 - 30 mg a Day Xanax (Alprazolam) 2 Month or so binge (Bearing in mind I'd previously cold turkey'd off ridiculously high doses ofTemazepam (Brutal) and Diazepam, Alprazolam & various other Benzos etc etc..


The 20 - 30 mg a Day Xanax habit 'cold turkey' was the first time I'd ended up in hospital due to my Benzo use. Long story short, I completely lost the plot. Hallucinations, delusions, tremors, complete loss of reality, I didn't know the difference conscious and sub conscious if that makes any sense in a nonsensical way??!! I couldn't hardly walk, talk or even move my arms by the time I was taken to hospital (9 Days after the cold turkey) I was having to be spoon fed for days before I decided to ask my family to take me to the hospital. I should have went much sooner really in hindsight. Anyway, by far the most traumatic experience of my life by a long way! There is a lot more to the story but I'd be here all night..


Anyway, this past Month or so I've been enjoying some of these newer/just found/released Benzos, especially as my tolerance was fairly low, due to me tapering from the 30 mg Diazepam per day I was taking back in October 2015, down to 5 - 10 mg per day/every other day or so by December. I purchased a load of various 'newer' Benzos with Clonazolam being the most effective (Although saying that; The Clonazolam I tested around 1 hour 15 minutes ago is having little/reduced effects than normal. I took 3 mg - 6 x 0.5 mg pellets which usually have me rocking, but I'm feeling like that tolerance has finally caught up with me. They were the last of that batch of Yellow 0.5 mg pellets which I've had for a few weeks and mantained a decent level of effectiveness (Suprisingly) 1.5 - 2.5 mg every night or every other night always done the job. Sometimes alternating between different Benzos.. 


*EDIT - This is all jumbled and incomplete. I messed up when I was trying clear it all up. Apologies

They don't do anything more, it's the same chemical in the liquid that's in the pellets. I find it kicks in faster, is less suspicious, and far cheaper than any pellets or pills I've come across.

I have been on clonazepam for about 1 year, I was at 2 mg a day, I've tapered down to 1 mg over the past few weeks. I am seriously worried because of all the horror stories I read. I want to taper off this and be back to normal. I would give anything to go back in time to last winter and undue this, Does anyone have any advice? on tapering, what to expect, hopefully something positive

I would order some phenibut powder. There's a great source, but I can't tell it. Get some capsules if you don't want to taste it, it's disgusting. If you've never had phenibut, measure out 500 mg first. 1 gram might be ok for you, but start low. Phenibut takes like 2 - 4 hours to really kick in. When I'm out of benzos, I take a small dose of phenibut like that to help me feel safe from seizures or deadly physical problems from withdrawals. 


It sounds like you're pretty much in the clear. Just get the phenibut, a scale and take only the phenibut when you're ready to jump off the 1 mg Clonozelam. Take only the small dose of phenibut maybe a week, then stop the phenibut completely. You'll be out of the woods with physical problems, but PAWS can set in and it SUCKS!!!! That's what makes me go back to benzos usually. PAWS (post acute withdrawal syndrome) sets in and that's all mental. You should look it up. I usually end up reordering because I can't think or function for shit going through it. Good luck.


Oh also I've heard people say order Baclofen. Baclofen comes in pill form and it's similar to phenibut. So if you can get some Baclofen, that will help you jump off C-Lam too.

For what its worth, clonazolam didn't put her brain in that state, the car accident and the glass in the head might have something to do with it.


Sometimes I just wish Loprazolam would become available in Canada, I wouldn't need anything else. Best.Benzo.Evar....well that I had once at least. Had it twice, once orally and the second IV'd..it can be IV'd like midazolam iwith just water and a quality filter. My god. Maybe because I was high as hell from 25mg of OXY IR but I'll always remember that time as special and am pretty mad that there is surely no old benzos coming here, if a new one shows up in the pharma world, we might get it, or not. The latest ones were ProSom and Xanax, we only got Xanax, I'd kill to try Estazolam, a hypnotic? Never used almost? Makes it easy to be scripted then if its not one thing coming out of the mouth of patients often, etc.


Nevermind insurance, benzos are dirt cheap.*

Although I am aware of my own addiction, I would not order benzos and have the risk of having my package seized (its all that can happen, not scheduled high enough here in canada) if I didn't already have a yearly script of diazepam since what, nov 2010, which was an attempt at a taper, but it was too rapid, going from 4mg clonazepam to under 20mg valium at the pace we were going was not possible for me. Still, I consider myself 2/3 (in equivalence) less addicted to benzos. I don't tend to buy very large amounts of RC benzos and don't touch my valium and restoril script at all when I have them, other than the odd mix with reduced dose for both substances, 0.25 flub-lam with 0.5mg clonaz. Or one of my favourite combos, bromazepam from my friend, 9-12mg with norflurazepam...it brings out the nod from my suboxone. But I've always consciously been more aware of others, like when I was heavily in psychedelics, i'd talk down people going into delirium/bad trips and I'd be able to step over my own high to take care of them, even when snorting PCP lines and walking like robots, I took care of my friend who had the bright idea of drinking a 1.18L (a 40oz me thinks) of 7.1% beer with the PCP, he was all over the toilet, I was helping him when close to the p-hole where things seemed longer if i looked away or smaller if I looked close, like the toilet he was puking in.

Somehow one of my posts got deleted here that's strange. All I did was agree with a mod who's saying that he hasn't seen much problems with clonazolam.


Although his opinion on f-lam is a bit exaggerated, there is truth to it, theres no point in taking more than .5 at once, I wish the dicksizers who say they were taking 300mg xanax at once every weekend (and not get extreme withdrawals in the supposedly sober week) would stop with their horror stories. You got what you wanted, most people will have to buy from countries with a mail system that is not as good as the british one and the difficulty in obtaining eith c-lam or f-lam (or f-pam, or whatever) after the 6th of april in theory will be happy and agree with that Nazi looking person responsible for this blanket ban that makes no sense where toothpaste and capsacin could be considered illegal (you can get a script for capsacin but no need for it literally). If only Canadian vendors had balls and sold something else than Etizolam powder. (not a big etizolam fan, but I will be giving the etizest pharmaceutical pills a try in one of my last transaction with a british store, we'll see. Apparently they're second tier compared to Etilaam, but these have disappeared.

I guess you may be referring to me when mentioning the 300mg Xanax binges? I wasn't 'Dicksizing'. I was trying to put into perspective how bad I was on Benzos, and how far I'd come. (10mg Diazepam per day) And what is possible next... How I can feel myself slipping back down that route of abuse - hence the record of Benzos and doses.


I'm sure you can empathise a little due to your own previous attempt(s) at tapering (4mg Clonazepam - 20mg Diazepam) that even you admit was too fast for you to cope with. Yet as you say, you " feel 2/3 less addicted " So how less addicted does that leave me feeling.. It doesn't matter because it's completely relative.


I'd say it's a bit harsh to blame my behaviour for the people in other countries being unable to source Benzos/Pharmaceuticals? I understand the actions of people who abuse (Most of us on Bluelight) has an effect on drug laws, drugs in the mainstream news, and mainstream opinion etc..


I'm not proud of my levels of drug abuse, infact, many find them hard to believe. I wish I was lying! Bluelight is about the only place I've ever really been able to talk about it, as I feel we share a lot more in common than anyone else I've spoken to. Even saying that, I've yet to find somebody who can truely relate to some of my experiences.


Quite a lot of envy come across in your post. I can't help being British, just as much you can't help being Canadian (Or a Canadian Citizen at least)


Also, as for Etizolam, I find the Etizest much better than the Etilaam.


Stay safe.

Structure looks a bit tasty to me, nitrobenzodiazepines are a major winner IMO. Never had flunitrazepam, but nitraz is lovely stuff, I don't find benzos recreational really per se. usually, but a few 5mg moggies down the hatch and I'm a happy bunny for the rest of the.


Never had clonazepam itself, but just seeing that nitro group makes my mouth water in anticipation ^_^


Medically though IMO benzos aren't great really, tolerance/dependence/addiction wise, I'm heavily biased though, as a die-hard devoted fan of chlormethiazole, which I've taken for several years now a couple of years without establishment of physical dependency. Surprising for a barbiturate-like GABAergic, considering its so bloody powerful stuff, far more recreational potential than benzos.


RC heminevrin analogs, now those I'd LOVE to see this old, yet wonderful hypnotic agent expanded and developed. Only analogue I've tried is the one in which bromine is used to Cl. Its active and modification of one single step in the typical rxn used to make chlormethiazole. Haven't explored it fully as far as could be, due to the potential for fatality in OD, given its barb-type rather than benzo-type activity at GABAaRs electrophysiologically speaking. But likeable enough at regular chlormethiazole dose levels or a little more.

I have 1mg pills of clonazolam and while I try to split it into halves or even quarters, I still always manage to black out. Not necessarily a big blackout, but I can never remember at least the last hour of the night I took them. From my limited experience with benzos, I'd say that it does remind me of clonazepam, but it's much stronger. If kpins get you buzzed then these get you completely fucked. I don't find clonazolam to be particularly sedating either, they give me a sort of energetic, euphoric buzz. Kind of like being piss drunk but without the gross impairment. It's hard to explain, but any benzo user will know what I mean. I'd definitely recommend volumetric dosing for this one. Overall though, I think it's a great recreational benzo, very fun, VERY strong. 1mg is major blackout zone if your intolerant or only mildly tolerant.

I can't wait to get paid tomorrow and order more C-Lam or maybe I'll try a different RC. C-Lam is acting weird with my brain now. No euphoria and kind of makes me angry or something. Still trying to figure out this new feeling it's giving me. It's not as nice as the first few months I've been on it though.

I was forced to stop cold turkey after a couple weeks of daily (heavy, blacked out, idiot type doses, which were generally around 1.5mg throughout the day and then all out at night) clonazolam use because it was my car she wrecked, so I had to move back in with my parents to afford to fix the damage to my car, where, of course, my dad found my pill bottle immdeiately and flushed it.

I just read this same story on Erowid. I've been on ventilators in ICU after taking only 3mg of this stuff...I did the math wrong when I dosed and didn't realize until a half hour later.. They could not wake me up and I was breathing so slow they had to put me on an aspirator. This drug is extremely potent. But being the addict I am. I just dosed .5mg clonazolam from a PG solution. I'm hoping this goes better because waking up in ICU with tubes down your throat is scary as fuck.


[https://imgur.com/gallery/Z0jTg](https://imgur.com/gallery/Z0jTg) Proof. Be careful dosing this drug. It is extremely potent and low doses are enough to get you into some serious shit.

Would it be dangerous to take 0.5mg clonazolam given I'm already on 1mg pyrazolam? I don't have much of a tolerance but I need to knock myself out to sleep, which clonazolam always does for me.

My tolerance to Clonozelam must be out of this world. I feel NOTHING. I went from falling on the floor and blackouts to feeling NOTHING! I don't want to keep eating the bottle., but it seems like I could swallow the bottle and still feel NOTHING!!! So disappointing.

Doesn't anybody ever take their clonazolam and etizolam at the same time? I've read a thousand posts and i haven't heard one person mention combing the two. My tolerance is quite high so maybe i wouldn't notice some kind of thing occurring where the thienos kinda work against each other but I highly doubt that's the case like with certain opiates.

So why no mentioning of people mixing their clonazolam and etizolam? Especially from those who claim to have such high tolerances? I guess the main reason for asking is I don't wanna feel like I'm wasting my etizolam and clonazolam.

I have mixed them before. I have my Klonopin from my pharmacist today so I mixed that too! I do not recommend this to newbies. So basically I combined 3 benzos. I still need a potentiator to make it stronger. I haven't been able to get my hand on Gabapentin to potentiate it..

  damn how do you guys let your benzo tolerance get out of control so fast?you must be looking for a high because out of 3 differen benzos, the dosage i started taking it for anxiety still worked after a year or so of using..klonopin and etizolam...boggles my mind why people  look to get high off benzos...such a dangerous way to get a little buzz.. especially if you have chronic anxiety that you need the benzos for..

Klonopin doesn't give me euphoria or a high feeling at all. That's why I use it to taper. I have major depression (treatment resistant), agoraphobia and anxiety. Etizolam and C-Lam made me want to go out and have a good time. I was up for anything. All fear was gone. I was happy to be alive again and I could talk to anyone. It's easy to judge "why people want to get high off benzos?" You don't know what it feels like to not be able to live my life, but I finally felt on top of the world until it stopped working so well.

Ya you guys well some of you are going thru benzos like crazy and need to stop. Really! Your going to trap yourself in a place you wished you never gotten yourself into. I mean that. I am still working on lowing my tolerance where three mg a day of klonopin is enough for my GAD AND OCD. So please take in deep consideration that these are RC and not benzos from a doctor. The vendors are just trying to make a buck and you may end up killing yourself or someone else because one, your actions and two, their greed.

I am still working on lowing my tolerance where three mg a day of klonopin is enough for my GAD AND OCD. So please take in deep consideration that these are RC and not benzos from a doctor. The vendors are just trying to make a buck and you may end up killing yourself or someone else because one, your actions and two, their greed.

You're right benzos can cause depression. Years ago, when my tolerance wasn't high, I took klonopin and felt bummed out for some reason. I'm not taking extremely high doses anymore because it doesn't work anyway, but I'm not worried about coming off. I'm going to save my klonopin and keep that for taper back up. Plus phenibut really helps with any physical withdrawals. I've been binging on RC benzos for months and haven't had physical withdrawals yet. BUT PAWS SUUUUCKKKK!!! Sets in a week or two without benzos. No energy, motivation, unable to function. You feel like a zombie.


I need another recreational drug besides benzos, but I don't know what.

Clonazolam is the heaviest Benzo or even drug I ever took. I'm a heavy hitter   I was using about 6mg of this shit a day for awhile. Not to post anti-drug shit on a drug site , but these ruined my life with less than 200 0.5mg pills. Six mg of this shit, no other drug needed . even cigarettes I didn't care and I smoke alot. They had a time distortion and almost psychedelic feel, fantastic muscle relaxation, not a fuck could be given. The problem was , the not a fuck given was so good that things like work, girlfriends, responsibilities start to fly out the window . all that mattered was more Clonazolam. I won't lie, its the most euphoric long lasting heavy downer I ever used. Even heroin doesn't hold a candle to this shit. But, you will ruin your life in very short order with this shit. I remember getting fired for coming to work wasted, and all I cared was that bottle of pills there . then I ran out. I.was fine for about two days . then I started withdrawing hard . i white knuckle it, till day 3 at night I had a seizure and broke a bunch of shit in my house , came to and was shaking and shit. I went to the e.r. they said if I didn't come in I coulda died. I got 12 klonopins to get off this shit. Clonazolam. Yeah, its crazy fun but its a crazy dangerous Benzo.

This is the heaviest Benzo made , it has recreational value out the ass but I don't see anyone using this responsibly. Your gonna pop those first few, its gonna be real good, then your gonna pop a few more and this drug, your an full on addict in about 2 days. Its just too good literally that it majorly sucks ass

Wow she had that for 2 years AFTER quitting? Hell no, it's already hard to live, I couldn't keep living like that. Kratom doesn't do much for me because I think benzos jacked my tolerance up to it, but I still might give it a try again one day. It's just disappointing when I take it and don't feel anything.....or hardly anything.

My best moment on them was going to work so high I couldn't remember my bosses name, that and somehow falling over a solid wooden end table and breaking it, oh i also decided to sharpen knives on about 60mg PG solution clonaz, there was blood everywhere the next day. I got fired from 4 good jobs on this shit. I am getting to go to rehab now. I get to go work at shitty temp. services that pay nothing and send me all over the city for a few hours work. Clonazolam is the drug that took me down. I beat addictions to cocaine, alcohol, opiates, even speed long time ago. I fucked with Xanax too back in the day, even it just can't come close to matching this drug for havoc. This is the drug that, out of a druggie career kinda guy like me, knowing all I lost to the time I wasted on those drugs, this is the drug that literally I can't even pretend to function on and it's the end. My drug career ends on this one and that's finally that

Whoa, I'm sorry it had you that messed up and made you lose 4 good jobs. I don't even know what heroin feels like, but this stuff feels soooooo good, I imagine it's close. It can definitely get you into some horrible and dangerous situations though. 


I've been through all kinds of embarrassing situations with this drug, but now, my brain is so used to it, it doesn't make me behave in a risky way. It seems to only numb me for the most part now, like Klonopin. I sucked all the fun out of it from binging. I'm glad you decided to be done. It still works to calm me down I guess, but the dangerous situations aren't a factor anymore. It feels like taking a regular benzo, no euphoria anymore.

  YES, i made sure and asked her 2 more times and she said it lasted around 2 years, the Paws from benzos..i also suffered Paws for around 2 years after i came off methadone..its just brutal and i know what u mean, life is hard enough as is WITH these pills...i think this is why the relapse rate is so high across the board..recovery and counselors seem to rarely bring up PAWS and how difficult and agonizing it can be and how LONg it can last..had i know what id feel like coming off methadone i dont think id have ever tried..

If it's been 2 years, I wonder when does it ever end or does it? I can't just cut benzos out of my life forever if that's the case. I better stay with a psychiatrist who will give them to me because now I'm thinking about years ahead and what if I can't order them online anymore? I can't rely on ordering it online forever anyway. My worst fear is not having a roof over my head in the future or if I have to make drastic changes in where I live in the future, I'm going to have to kill myself instead. Seriously. I can't be on my own with my mental illness and I don't want to move somewhere I don't want to be. This is just future worries.

Short answer is dont do it again and apologise profusely that you were still under the effects of prescribed sleeping pills that you took after waking in the early hours thinking you woukd be OK in the morning..... It Worked for me numerous times, but I also got fired numerous times for the same thing after the excuse had passed its expiry date, so to speak.


I have a "sideline job" fortunately.

I'm officially in rehab today thanks to my irresponsible use of Clonitrazolam. I'm glad, I've been abusing alcohohol. Coke, other things for years. Its not these pills fault I'm there. Its that I can't stop doing any addictive drug if I have a supply. This stuff would be an ideal Benzo for a responsible user, but its so strong that someone like me it's a train wreck. Strangely, I could always handle klonopin. Like function, go work, and nobody noticed I was on it. Xanax too to an extent. On Clonazolam I literally fucked up everything I touched for the whole time I used it. It still has me thinking about it though , at the sweet spot of about 8mg I have never felt better from any drug. I used about 45 mg the 1st time responsibly, but when it ran out I had some pretty hefty withdrawals coming on. I just acted sick, kept going to work and promised myself I would flush the next 90 tabs that were in the mail. Soon as they showed up I dumped them out. I was like, if I eat .35 this anxiety will go away . I had work in three hours. I musta had 5 more at least . At that job I was standing there eating raw pizza dough in the middle of the busy rush. This was job 2 gone, I had lost job 1 munching Etizolam at work previously. Job 3 was a dishwasher only gig, this time I had eaten 50mg Etizolam powder , and two 8mg Flubromazepam caps before my shift. I got bored about 4 hours in and just went home. Job 4 I had moved to my new town with my girl, everything going great I decided to order 150mg Clonazolam pg solution to celebrate. I went to work, slurring, couldn't remember my bosses name. Broke all kinds of furniture falling over it, don't remember, and yes tried to sharpen a set of crazy sharp professional chef knives after about 75mg of Clonazolam. My girl found me, I was in our original apt. we were moving out of. There were piles of broken furniture, blood, and wires I had somehow ripped out all over the place. I can't justify or sustain this behavior . I tell you guys this story because it's nuts for one, but two, if you have any kind of addictive personality leave this shit waaay alone. I am lucky I'm not in jail, or seriously hurt..All I know is that I would compulsively redose and completely black out. Be careful folks, I'm glad my Benzo ride is over. Ive had other addictions, but none that just powerslammed me into stopping.like this shit. Yes I've done crack, and heroin too. These pills though, are what sent me to rehab  and good enough time too I'm a monster with the substances.

The only case I think there isn't is those who for some reason take astronomical doses of these, and instead of doing like what I would do : fall asleep for a long ass time, and   have a paradoxical reaction and do a lot of stupid shit, getting them prison or worse. These people kind of deserve it, when I read "I took 25mg clonazolam have no tolerance lol, whats gonna happen?" and these type of posts, is why the governments even became aware that there might be some problem, and everyone else pays because of these...people.

Astronomical doses isn't the only problem. If I take high doses and don't feel anything, that's that. If anything, it's just a waste of pills. I'm not out getting in trouble with the law or bringing attention to myself. There are people who get fucked up and do crazy shit and blackout on only 2 of these If you don't have tolerance at all. So I don't think it's only people who take astronomical doses who are going to make everyone else pay. It's gonna be the ones who end up in the hospital or jail or something else insane that draws too much attention to this drug.

> 			I'm officially in rehab today thanks to my irresponsible use of Clonitrazolam. I'm glad, I've been abusing alcohohol. Coke, other things for years. Its not these pills fault I'm there. Its that I can't stop doing any addictive drug if I have a supply. This stuff would be an ideal Benzo for a responsible user, but its so strong that someone like me it's a train wreck. Strangely, I could always handle klonopin. Like function, go work, and nobody noticed I was on it. Xanax too to an extent. On Clonazolam I literally fucked up everything I touched for the whole time I used it. It still has me thinking about it though , at the sweet spot of about 8mg I have never felt better from any drug. I used about 45 mg the 1st time responsibly, but when it ran out I had some pretty hefty withdrawals coming on. I just acted sick, kept going to work and promised myself I would flush the next 90 tabs that were in the mail. Soon as they showed up I dumped them out. I was like, if I eat .35 this anxiety will go away . I had work in three hours. I musta had 5 more at least . At that job I was standing there eating raw pizza dough in the middle of the busy rush. This was job 2 gone, I had lost job 1 munching Etizolam at work previously. Job 3 was a dishwasher only gig, this time I had eaten 50mg Etizolam powder , and two 8mg Flubromazepam caps before my shift. I got bored about 4 hours in and just went home. Job 4 I had moved to my new town with my girl, everything going great I decided to order 150mg Clonazolam pg solution to celebrate. I went to work, slurring, couldn't remember my bosses name. Broke all kinds of furniture falling over it, don't remember, and yes tried to sharpen a set of crazy sharp professional chef knives after about 75mg of Clonazolam. My girl found me, I was in our original apt. we were moving out of. There were piles of broken furniture, blood, and wires I had somehow ripped out all over the place. I can't justify or sustain this behavior . I tell you guys this story because it's nuts for one, but two, if you have any kind of addictive personality leave this shit waaay alone. I am lucky I'm not in jail, or seriously hurt..All I know is that I would compulsively redose and completely black out. Be careful folks, I'm glad my Benzo ride is over. Ive had other addictions, but none that just powerslammed me into stopping.like this shit. Yes I've done crack, and heroin too. These pills though, are what sent me to rehab  and good enough time too I'm a monster with the substances.

  please fill me in on what you like about high dose benzos?for me, i just black out and fall asleep..is it just about complete escape from reality or what?i mean, i have anxiety pretty bad at times and like small doses of benzos but even they tend to make e tired and slow..definitely not a happy buzz for me..maybe my brain chemistry is different, i dunno..

It was only those Belfort. Those Clonazolam are euphoric as fuck, its not like any other Benzo feeling. A high dose of any other Benzo basically just sucks. but c-lam is very recreational, it had an intense euphoria , a nearly psychedelic feel at those high doses . You just felt fucking good, its not like Xanax or klonopin somehow this Clonazolam is euphoric as fuck, and it's not that hypnotic you won't pass out so easily.

Oh, but I tried the other benzos too in these doses which were not even fun, just blacked the hell out. Powdered Etizolam blacked me out, and so did Flubromazepam I had gotten all the way from England sent over. Those benzos were not fun. Clonazolam, yeah it was fun

No, I could stay up on like 8 mg, it was the most fantastic drug feeling I ever had. I dunno why c-lam didn't black me out. I heard someone say they are as close to a feeling as old school quaaludes they could get and I believe it. I would stay up all night, like I said no booze was even needed or cigarettes and I smoke. It was sadly, good fucking shit. I never got this feeling from other benzos, just blacked out. I had unbelievable withdrawals after a few months of this, I had to go to the e.r. they gave me klonopin to taper they had no idea what c-lam was.  The last time I had it though, I ingested 75mg I think I spilled the rest it was a total of 150 PG solution. I literally broke furniture and almost cut my finger off, I don't remember any of this. I have not had those good times ever again with this shit, just compulsive redose and blackout city. Fuck clonazolam

  haha yeah something isnt right here..75 mgs this guy dosed, i dunno..maybe he had high natural tolerance lol..but yeah i can imagine his withdrawals were horrible if he was dosing 8 mgs clonozolam daily or close to that..most people consider 0.5 mgs of clonozolam equivalent to 2 mgs of klonopin so..heavy duty shit..

No I didn't have a high tolerance to 75 mg, I blacked out and compulsively redosed that much. This was only one use and the last time. I'm not here to brag, drugs have destroyed my life.. Yes the withdrawals from 8mg a day would probably have been fatal, the e.r. doc immediately gave me lorazepam 2 mg as soon as they read my vitals. Then they gave me 6mg a day of klonopin to taper off. I did. I tried cold turkey , by day 2 I was pouring sweat and felt like I was in the electric chair. I had insane vivid half asleep dreams, and I had a seizure. Even on 8 mg, I was in the house alone. I couldn't type or barely walk, but I remember those nights. I was fucked up severely, but I would sleep it off and for awhile go work in the mornings , take a few mg to stop the withdrawals . I'm an addict, I use like an addict . I was originally taking Etizolam that I ended up getting fired for being wasted at work, then I started the Clonazolam at my next job which lasted about a month. Its a haze last winter, just binging on RC benzos and losing alot of jobs and friends. Still, I remember how excited I was when those boxes would be in the mail. I discussed this with my treatment counsellor, I said well anybody would dose up like this given access right?? No he said, only an addict uses like that. Its true. No amount of anything I take is enough, glad I'm not dead. That being said , to the responsible users, yeah 1mg of this shit is alot and be careful, don't do it consecutive days and if your a known addict dont touch it, this one will burn you down hard and fast.

You should be ok. I started noticing rebound effects after about two weeks of using it 2-3x a week (at dosages varying from .25 to .5mg) but I was using other benzos during that period too. As soon as I experienced rebound effects (which were moderate, but luckily only lasted a day or two), I quit the benzos and experienced no wd. I do have a noticeable tolerance to benzos now though and it was never that bad before clonazolam.

Clonazolam is clonazolam, regardless of blotter/pellet/powder. However, it sounds like you're taking too much. Try 0.25mg.

Blotters are quite dangerous as they can be unevenly dosed leaving some blotters with half a dose while others have two and with clonazolam that's a disaster waiting to happen. With liquid solutions as long as you shake them before measuring a dose you should be OK, but shelf life isn't guaranteed. Be very careful who you buy from and make sure they are reputable

  That's the problem though, I don't feel anything after I take clonazolam..zero anxiety relief or relaxation but if I lay down I might black out..today literally nothing happened, not even sleep..I have to believe these blotters are very under dosed..

If "0.5mg" knocks you out, it's certainly not underdosed (as actual 0.5mg knocks me out as well).

+1 it's both very easy to make very accurately dosed blotters and very easy to fuck it up completely and end up with the dose per blotter varying a lot from blotter to blotter so one of  his  0.5mg blotters is actually 0.25mg, one is 0.5mg and one is  1,5mg.... all from the same sheet right next to each other.... so once he'll get a low dose one and not feel anything and next time he'll get a high dose one and black out/fall asleep (although for me clam isn't that hypnotic so I would probably black out while staying awake which is even worse since that's when you do stupid shit without even remembering anything.... flam on the other hand will just knock me out so I won't do any stupid shit but just sleep).

I just took .7 clonazelam 40 min ago. It has a creep on effect . I felt like I took 2 2mg clonipin. I took another 10 minutes ago. Haven't felt that one yet but the first one is continuing to progress. I'm sure I will feel awesome bc I sing to have a high tolerance to benzos even when I go without them for several weeks but this is just really for my PTSD and anxiety and honestly just to feel better and be more motivated because I've been depressed and they seem to help with that with my antidepressant medications to be more motivated to do things. So I would recommend just taking one pins or pellet that's from **<snip>** and they are .7 of lam. Then I think the full peak reaches as 60 minutes of potential . Now that I took the other. I will let yall know how it goes after I feel that one, which starting now. It honestly it's like a Xanax as in strength and shorter half-life and it also feels maybe like a mixture of colanapins and with added energy I feel. But that's usually because benzos give me energy. But it does feel different from klonipen but honestly it feels better.

Omg these benzodiazepines are crazy. I started methadone maintenance after ordering 100 clonazolam .5mg pellets and 100 .25mg flubromazolam pellets. Things were ok until I started on the methadone. I quickly got my dose up to 90mg and was taking pills with it. I don't remember much but my family felt that they were losing me. I was a complete mess. Talking nonsense.. Nodding and drooling.. Burning cigarette holes in everything from clothes to couch cushions... Getting arrested... The only thing that saved me was my girlfriend taking the pills from me while I was nodding and at the same time my clinic cut my dose in half for "sleeping in the waiting room of the clinic". Man was I sick from taking a 45mg methadone cut in one day which should be illegal... The terrible withdrawal I experienced could not be explained but it was only then and after a few days that I started to regain some mental clarity and was able to see the pain in my family's eyes as they looked at an adult baby pretty much dying in front of them. 

The problem with these pills is they don't kick in until a few hours after dosing. So redosing is really common because the user either thinks he could handle it or he thinks he is not getting high for whatever reason. By time the extremely potent benzos hit it's too late and when mixed with an opiate like methadone or anything else pretty much, a myriad of terrible events can happen in the users life, including possible death. So please use caution and don't redose. You are playing with fire and no matter how big and tough you are, fire burns.

^There's a reason pretty much everyone on this board warns against mixing opiates and benzos (especially methadone and benzos).

What's the best way to taper off of about a 3mg/day(1mg 3 x a day) clonazolam dependence?  The negative consequences with memory and just generally making me feel lazy and lethargic aren't worth it.  I ordered diclazepam because I know it's a long lasting benzo with the least potential for abuse(it's definitely not fun or euphoric) and possibly good for weaning off of other benzos.  How would you convert the ashton manual to such a dependence in this case?  I have no insurance so going to a doctor for valium isn't an option and I want to continue my active life... academia, especially.

Tried clonazolam for the first time yesterday. This is the only benzo I have tried that I would call euphoric and euphoric it is. I would say the euphoria is on par with a strong opoid. Can see this being very addictive. Gonna take some serious control to just chip away at it. Wonderful chem though in my opinion.

Does anyone know what other solvents will dissolve clonazolam? Propelyne glycol seems to be the most talked about but it's kind of a one trick pony -- you have your solution of PG and clon and then you're stuck with it; PG doesn't evaporate, it just becomes a sticky mess. I read [here on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzodiazepines/comments/47bayy/anyone_know_if_clonazolam_is_highly_soluble_in/) that some folks say it will dissolve 10mg/ml in isopropyl alcohol, but I'm skeptical since it's well said that it's insoluble in ethanol. And yet I've had this on a blotter paper product before, so there must be some evaporatable solvent out there that will dissolve this. I've not read every post in this thread but I've been looking around here and the rest of the web, so what am I missing? anyone got any ideas or experiences outside of PG? much appreciated, thanks!

Maybe he's born in '88 too though. It was a light joke, but people who go on about taking 100s of mg of benzos active at 0.25mg have poor judgement to start with. All their reports are almost : "see how I have no judgement, those RC benzos should all be burned into a big pile!"

Received 5 grams of clonazolam powder from a relatively shady Chinese supplier. Small crystals and powder of a pinkish hue. Not soluble at all in water, decided to make a .5mg per ml solution using isopropyl alcohol. Initial .5 trial on another relatively benzo tolerant individual looked promising. Self trial induced a bit of euphoria and calmness, feel strange when walking. All in all an enjoyable experience, product is good and ready for the rats.


EDIT: If this substance is actually clonazolam (at this point it could be a number of benzos/triazolos) I don't understand how someone could black out and talk shit on half a milligram. I could imaging blacking out while drinking on this but isn't that to be expected? People are honestly in some cases much too stupid to have access to powerful and cheap substances such as benzo derivatives/ fent analogues and the myriad of other mind altering substances sold online. That's just my two fents though.

I was on Reddit rn and a guy posted how he can only buy 20 mg of clonazolam at a time because he doesn't trust himself with larger amounts. Jesus Christ if you're not confident in your ability to do what YOU want, DONT order it at all.

I order myself small amounts of flub-lam, fonazepam, c-lam or diclazepam, like 30 of each, if I can't get powder. For some people it might be a good idea to get a starter kit, like 10 clonazolam, 10 f-lam, 10 pyrazolam, 10 etizolam. It would likely lead less to addictions that will be hard to explain to a doctor as to why you suddenly need 2mg of clonazepam or something twice a day and say you've been buying these "branded" calming products (hint hint) and found out they contained benzodiazepines available in other countries only. There, I think I gave the best phrasing to get yourself out of a possibly deadly (and only because it is possibly deadly) sudden benzo withdrawal.


I order shit but I got 3 benzo rx's...helps me to stock them, I like to mix some of them, but there's no point in adding valium or lectopam (brand name for bromazepam up here) to f-lam or c-lam. F-lam with temazepam is out of this world amazing though. Especially when I'm at the point where listening to political podcasts (that present even more real reasons to find this repeat of 2004 of an American (s)election so ghastly it fucks with my head big time. When you're a Canadian and you would prefer Trump to the crazy, cross-eyed, drugged-up (likely on coke and benzos) with a more and more looking like he's dying Bill Clinton (it wouldn't be a third Bill term, the guy's dying).And all the DNC shenanigans...especially 2 days before Sanders quit the democratic party, he was roughed up, there's picture of this, on the last day of the convention, where he looked like he was gonna throw up surrounded by the Hitleries, sick to his stomach. That deal he made with her to try and get the most real Democrats (centre-left, left people, not red humanitarian hawks with a D on their name. Dick Durbin, I'm thinking of shits like you), was certainly over after his own secret service goons attacked him and that's why he had this gash on the right side of his cheek. He was either roughed up with punches or with a blunt weapon. There's the pic out there, it's very funny because the pic comes with the person who posted it on Facebook with her text under. And then it was scrubbed from all Bernie forums apparently, and I trust Ed Opperman on that. Yeah, anyway, it's a real upside down world when a Canadian, prefers Trump to be President. I have no say in it, but the guy isn't threatening all forms of life on the planet, hasn't called Putin "Hitler", I guess with all her emails, she didn't know that almost everyone by now know about Godwin's Law. Those FOIA caused by that hero of a investigative journalist Jason Leopold (despite his current neocon employer) caused emailgate, he's a fuckin FOIA machine. If she's President and just listens to all these neocons who are making a comeback, rebranding themselves and now are fine with Democrats, well, the cancer with the Democratic Party...If she thinks she can antagonize Russia without causing worldwide death of 99% of species on Earth, I'll be benzin' myself stupid for the next 2 years. Although, with the Sanders voters revolt, who decided not to even vote, some are going for Jill Stein (green party), but third parties can't win because of that stupid electoral college thing, which originally when it was made, made sense, there was one guy going on his horse in South Carolina up to Washington in all states when all communications were still by letter/courrier. It made sense then, it does not now. And those primaries are baloney, the open ones are great, the closed ones are anti-democracy.


Alright, the benzos got me rambling time for bed. While I put on Bad Religion - Slumber

I'll just remind people to be very very careful with this compound as it can very easily turn on you as it did me. Be very careful of your dose as even 100 mcg can be quite potent leading to a reduction in coordination, slurred speech, and judgement impairment that can very easily lead to one overestimation ones ability to handle a dose that can lead a blackout that ends up lasting multiple days due to the very long duration of effect this compound has while it also can literally reduce short term memory to the point one acts purely on impulse leading to a high likelihood of being influenced to compulsive redosing as this compound has a very highly likelihood of causing such desire. 


Idiotic benzo intolerant and naive only having a very limited set of experiences with minor doses decided that it would help to have my first stockpile that was 76.mg to tackle Suboxone ct withdrawal. The plan was ct and keep myself knocked out dosing minimal amounts titerating 100 mcg only taking 500 mcg in a 12 hour period until I was ready to be without opiates. That lead to endingvup the morning after receiving it the day before in the afternoon blacking out without a single memory 4 days later where I became a complete monster as all my bottles up stress exploded after sucking what I thought was not much that I could manage after spilling it into my sheet. I was terrified as I woke up four days later having to spend the next two asking the people I know I'm my building what I did after realizing once I woke and found my room a mess with my dog missing (luckily at my parents thanks to a concerned neighbor) only after explaining myself because those I knew and caused problems for had chose to ignore me besides expressing strong feelings of anger and rejection with me until they realized I understood how foolish and stupid I was to attempt using benzos while deciding never to use benzos, liquor, or anything really to just mask physical issues hopes to improve my will to live without taking the concern of how they affect ones thoughts and behavior by denying the possibility o understood of being so detrimental it makes things worse than having nothing. Luckily they forgave me as I've never experienced that kind of situation before in my life.


Again I recommend everyone who decides to use such powerful benzos even if tolerant to think twice and take the necessity of responsible moderation seriously before they regret it as I do.

Aha Jesus I understand what you're saying about having less on hand leading to less potential for abuse. It also really depends on the situation and your own head. I personally didn't order 10,000 hits of clonazolam for personal consumption, and I could see how if someone was using it to medicate for some self diagnosed problem of theirs, how having a variety and less product could be good. I just can never justify buying 100 hits when 10k only cost like 400 usd

Yeah it seriously depends on your situation. I am seriously benzo naive person and I've only had 2 bars and 2 valiums before yesterday when I tried approx 400ug of "clam". I use benzos occasionally for recreation but right now I'm just concentrating on comparing the potency and subjective effects of batches of the same substance between different Chinese vendors. I think if I ever found my life shitty enough to start abusing to take the pain away, or found I had an "anxiety disorder" i seriosly wouldn't touch this shit. I think benzos are the cause of a lot of anxiety out there even when someone's not dependent and that's a recipe for disaster. All in all I think that at the end of the day, medicating can be more habit forming than recreation because the second you say you need something for a legitimate "problem" you'll need it that much more. Maybe I'm full of shit who knows.

I've not read every post in this thread but I've been looking around here and the rest of the web, so what am I missing? anyone got any ideas or experiences outside of PG? much appreciated, thanks!

idk where you heard it's insoluble in ethanol, because that is definitely wrong a 10 mg/ml solution in 90% ethanol is very easy to make, just dump the powder in to the ethanol and stir a little (same goes for flubromazolam and norflurazepam).... you can almost certainly go higher but idk the limit since i've never needed anything stronger than 10 mg/ml (I have made 20 mg/ml norflurazepam in 90% ethanol and the vendor I got it from said it should go to ~80 mg/ml)


and if we are talking about benzo solubility nifoxipam hcl powder will dissolve in acidic water, etizolam supposedly dissolves in vodka

Mixed 50mg worth of clam solution into a batch of mellow blocks. Took them to a party and gave them away for free, have no idea how many I ate because I woke up in my bed. I asked my friend who took me home and he said that he did but he doesn't remember driving, and he crashed his car into the curb. I'm sure this chemical has some nefarious uses.

I strongly disagree with this notion. Regardless of whether the drugs are in my drawer or halfway across the world, if you want to do something you're going to do it. I don't plan on using close to enough to have physical withdrawals. MAYBE once a month or some shit. I just think it's a little silly to blame large amounts on hand for ones addiction.

What you did is just incredibly reckless, giving out free benzos to people who most likely drink alcohol is extremely dangerous as mixing CNS depressants can kill you and increases the risk of a black out

And driving a car while intoxicated is just plain stupid and endangers others

Don't do it!

I imagine benzos to be the third most dangerous (and not because of their effects, but the withdrawals, especially for somebody like me, who even though was rx'd small doses, but that kept climbing, it was of clonazepam, it's the only benzo used for nerve pain, so when I told my psychiatrist, who I first started to see in 07 that I was scripted 0.5mg bid of clonazepam for facial nerve damage pain, he said well, I think you have GAD and Bipolar I, so antidepressants are not for you (after telling him my very bad experience with 5 months of Paxil...at 10mg it was alright, but they always insist on making the dose larger, even the GP who scripted that then, at 40mg a day I started to have extreme mania and violent impulses, not needing to sleep for days, having just one small meal a day, it was like being on speed/meth without the extreme euphoria, still some euphoria no matter what was happening was going on, I think all the LSD I've taken has made my body reject those SSRI poisons. I was one day on a starter dose of 37.5mg Effexor XR later, I forgot to say the psychiatrist said, well, you're already on a benzodiazepine, I think 2mg a day should hit 2 birds with one stone. It made sense and did.


Anyway, one day on that 37.5mg of Effexor XR, I had LSD-large black pupils, was feeling nauseous so much I had to buy some dimenhydrinate, just 15, and at the end of the party I went to, I had taken about 10 Gravols (the name for Dramamine here). Can't tolerate SSRI's/SNRI's. The only antidepressant I can tolerate is Moclobemide (Manerix), it's a reversible MAOI, it's not available in the US, I bet the FDA dopes imagined people were going to go after it to get DMT trips without the plant MAOI, pharmahuasca. I did try it, but that was not the reason I asked for something so atypical, it came out in the early 90's here and never was very popular. I felt happy on it, boosted my clonazepam and whenever I had opiates (it boosts the effects of both kind of drugs) but a kind of fake happiness I could feel in the back of my head, that particularly at that moment, when on those 6 months I was on welfare after dropping out 3 years into a 4 year BSc. program (some are 3 years, some 4 here), but it made sunsets look as great as when I was a kid, it did help but I didn't take it more than 2 months, even if it boosted benzos.


So I got a lot of time to learn to be wise with benzos and even then I can be reckless if I have a bad day. I can see how some people....my old opiate hookup said in his stupider young days, when he saw my full 60 count 10mg diazepam bottle, that he would eat a script like that all at once. Funny though how he never ever was an alcoholic and never drank more than 5 beers in his life. But yeah, I never gave him any dose of an RC benzo, never mentioned I had them, he was and likely still is on massive doses of hydromorphone through both HMContins and Dillies, he had an oxazepam 30mg script he would just sell me the whole bottle for almost nothing, which although oxazepam sucks, takes a long time to kick in and doesn't last long, 90-120mg when it kicks in is intensely anxiolytic. Judging by his behaviour, his doctor likely did not script him those for nothing, but at least he did not have a benzo addiction, he would not be able to control such an addiction. So, yeah, some of the crazy scare stories here can be true, but there's an overload of them, in a time where clonazolam is rather difficult to obtain compared to some years ago are totally phony. I don't see the same bashing on f-lam or even rx benzos which are much more common and some are just as strong as clonazolam, or others if large doses are taken, are no different.

Well, I got me my favourite RC benzo, after correct-dose f-pam (for me, it was 24mg, my step-dad had one of the original hard as a rock 8mg and fell asleep on his couch watching TV and was woken up by my mom when she started cooking herself some breakfast before lunch, I know my step-dad has sleep issues, so when I visited 2 years ago I gave him a few green 8's, and he said he had to use a knife to cut it in two). Flubromazepam was added to schedule III which only included benzos we have here and rx benzos in other countries, F-Pam being the only exception, too bad.


Anyway, clonazolam should be made an Rx med. At 0.5mg-1mg in 2 doses max lets say. It doesn't make me want to sleep, at those doses, and all residual stress I can still feel on some other benzos or without the headaches Xanax give me when taking more than 2mg. Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm set for a long long time, and it's not powder so I will use it smart, which I did with a 100mg bag of f-lam, but f-lam while stronger, really, the strongest benzo I ever had, is a hypnotic that should only be used for sleep. Clonazolam keeps the long-haul, not as long but close of clonazepam, the first benzo i was on for 3 1/2 years (went from 1 to 3.5mg when I asked for a valium taper, which got too fast and I asked to stop it at 20mg for now, that was in 2010...anyway I was pretty proud of reducing activity at my GABA-A benzo subreceptors by 2/3 (3.5mg compared to 20mg valium, you do the math).


I hesitated first posting here or in the flunitrazolam thread. Since I got the clonazolam, I put aside the flunitrazolam and only had 1 out of the 2 bromazepam 6's I'm supposed to take a day. Well I think I unlocked the mystery behind fluni-lam, in an experiment, that I don't intend on repeating...much, I took a single 0.5mg fluni-lam pill after suckling and downing 1mg clonazolam, and the hydroxyzine for my birch allergy and there's birches everywhere here, goddamnit, it's the only thing that works well, but it's also used as a pre-benzo sedative in people with anxiety issues and also for boosting opioids, I fondly remember how in the first year it made the bupe give me nods with the 50mg Atarax.


Anyway, 1mg of clonazolam would not have me wake up in bed, with my glasses right in front of my office chair by itself, flubromazolam did that, once I was basically nodding so hard from bupe+hydrox+flubromazolam, I was nodding my nose on the front of my desk, where it ended, thankfully it wasn't the corner. I remember being basically unable to stop nodding this way a year and some ago banging my nose on the desk, trying to stay asleep despite my inability to think clearly. I had a little scab on my nose, I was hitting it real hard it seems, the scab became annoying so I removed it, showing a line shaped small injury still. I said no more than 1mg flu-lam with my daily 0.5 to 2mg clonazolam. Ended up doing it again, but then forced myself into senses and stopped it, still banging exactly where the injury was, Took 4-5 months for the red line to go away.


Anyway, the lesson here is, flunitrazolam, if used wisely (0.25mg-0.5mg) is an excellent BOOSTER. By itself, sure I'll get some sleep with 2mg which is 4 pills. I went from 50 to 27 in 4 days before receiving the c-lam, disappointed.


See, I can admit to be a bit of recklessness, and that is a believable chain of events. Those who want a bonfire of c-lam or even rx benzos are misguided and usually show poor judgement.


I described what an "informed" extreme is. Still, don't do it. But, I can recommend that if you have flunitrazolam and an rx to a benzo, add in just 0.25-0.5 and you can save on your script, big time.

I'm really glad the company where I got my clonazolam blotter uses a kind of plastic that is not like normal ziploc baggies and are water resistant, or I would have wasted 70+ blotter when my guitar's neck caused a cascade of stuff to fall over on my desk and the last one was my can of mountain dew who was just south of the clonazolam bag, which was some kind of hard plastic all over except on the sides, i took them out with the eyelash clip I use to handle blotter, that and his scissors were indispensable when dealin L more than a decade ago. Anyway, the hits were all dry, I prayed the benzogod, and moved the thing in another ziploc and in a drawer. Had juiced up all of that I would have went mad I think lol.

You're fucking stupid. **Behavioral management - e.g. only buying a little bit, so you don't have the option to overuse - is an extremely smart form of harm reduction.** Drug-seeking behavior (or any pleasure-seeking behavior) is a spectrum, and overuse is often times a simple function of convenience. That's why many recovering alcoholics don't keep any booze in their house; yes, it's still available to buy at the corner store, but that's a big difference from it being available 10 meters away in the kitchen cabinet. 


And then you're talking about passing out RC benzos to people at a party like it's fucking candy. You're a dumb, irresponsible see-u-next-tues.

I'm still a slave to this drug and I love/hate it. This entire year I've been taking etiz and c-lam and I watched my life go by and I feel like an empty shell every time I run out. It's a fantastic drug if you can handle your shit and not overdo it. It's like Christmas every time it comes to my house, then it's Armageddon after I run through it like a moron. That's because I'm still stuck in the trap of trying to erase my existence. If your life really sucks, this probably isn't the best drug to take because you'll take ridiculous doses to drown everything out.


It's a trap now because Etiz and c-lam are the only drugs that can get me moving and make me come to life again. If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have started back up. It sucks to feel like you need only one certain drug to get out of bed and be productive. It has become my life at this point. If I were smart, I would never order again and just stick to boring ass Klonopin.

I've heard of heroin addicts who go and get a little heroin because they don't want to take too much, but that never works because once they run out, they go right back and get more. I don't know, it's just addict's logic to think having a little at a time will help. You'll only just go back for more and more if you're truly hooked.

  If really committed you will do a "painful" (I put it in between quotes because it's really not compared no dose at all, but to benzoheads, it seems very difficult to imagine, but these days psychiatrist all know about tapering one from benzos the correct speed, well i'd say 3 out of 4, mine and 2 other friends, one guy had his xanax 2mg cut to 15mg serax once a day for 15 days...yeah, so there's still criminally insane psydocs out there) mg per mg valium taper, or 5mg per 5mg librium taper. I think Librium is an even better choice. When I was taking just 2x0.5mg clonazepam a day (scripted), my friend who had been inpatient a few days for real bad alcohol withdrawals, was released with a shit ton 6 refill bottle of 25mg Librium to stop the shaking and the doctors gave him that much for long because they feared he might have damaged his nerves forever, that didn't happen thankfully. But I know that when I had 75mg of Librium, I slept, and slept and slept, so damn well. For 2 days, after just tweaking (oral meth) one day. It's even longer lasting than valium which is an advantage. Just the difference is that the steps are 5mg instead of 1mg, librium comes as 25, 10 and 5's.

Thanks. I've never heard of Librium. I'll look into it. I know I would be ok if I only used my Klonopin script in a responsible way and stopped ordering this shit. The problem is I'm still in the grips of addiction. I'm not done with it yet and I know that once I get paid again I'm ordering. That's so sad. It's all I've got right now. I can't get my Klonopin script till the 18th anyway so being able to get this drug or Etiz before then is very enticing so I can be productive again.


Another problem is I live with family and their nosy asses are always rushing to the door for the mail first so they see that box too much and they're onto me. I was threatened to have it "taken away" by a family member the next time she sees it. Sorry, but those are fighting words. No one is keeping my shit. I found a different place that sells it in liquid form so the package will look different, but they will still be suspicious.

I don't know, it's just addict's logic to think having a little at a time will help. You'll only just go back for more and more if you're truly hooked.

A lot more difficult with benzos, people don't sell benzos like they sell other drugs out there, you usually need friends who are also scripted some like I did with a couple girls, one with 2mg ativans and the other with 30mg serax, we would help each other in case of no benzos. Thing is, benz wd can kill. Not opiate wd, had I known all the shit methadone and bupe gave me, I would have enduredthe 11 days my cousin did after he went to Montreal hitch hiking with 3000 bucks in his wallet only to find some H and get wasted, he came back, was lucky to have bus money to come back home, he almost lost it, and was sick for 11 days and never shot up again. Only reason I went to ORT was to save my money and get a painkiller without too many questions (methadone works well for pain), although it made me gain 100 pounds..would they script the pills for pain that go 1,5,10,25mg, I could have went much lower than 65mg. Plus I always questioned how (not anymore) but at first when I had to switch pharmacy because not all of them do the methadone in orange juice in the brown bottle hydrocodone and codeine syrup (pure) comes in thing, they get government monies to do so and they were the only ones in my area of town. I'm sure one of the bitch who looked at me like if I was some kind of monster when I look like a jock or whatever, no typical junkie signs, that if she prepared, and its the technicians who did, doses at night when they closed, shorted you with the liquid, the 10mg/ml and the 1mg/ml to give you the dose you need, as I was going 2-3mg per month, I was taking stuff like 57mg etc., not hard to understand. Well I should have continued with methadone, when I reached 39mg, the scheduled 2 days with nothing then outpatient, well, I was in a room only for suboxone induction and if all was well, came in the next day, and left with a dose I felt was ok. But when I was at 39mg of methadone, it was like, I got zero pain, my pain issue is totally in control yet I don't feel high at all (unlike when I reached 40mg the first time, a 10mg jump, I remember feeling it hard then), could have continued tapering that easily, if it was still 2-3mg per month. But no, now I have 26 fillings after 2 years thanks to the lemon-lime suboxone pills, fuck. I know I could have manned up and just endured it, had 2 benzo scripts, clonidine, immodium, benadryl, when I was shooting up 32-64mg dillies a day. I kicked it a couple times myself, easily, but the prospect of having to do it  yet another time was way too hard mentally to accept.


Well I should have. With benzos well, I was put on clonazepam first for seizure control, psychiatrist was told I was on it, just raised the dose for the GAD.


Librium is the first benzo ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Valium came a little after. They mostly give it to people who are detoxing from massive alcohol abuse these days, although, I find it great for sleep compared to even 30mg temazepam, at 75mg though sure, hehe, 3x25mg. Which, depending on what you take, you could be taking a hundred milligram+ for a week at first if switching to Librium.

I'm glad you shared your story. I just feel so fucked right now , I can't think straight. I'm sick of feeling all the guilt of being hooked...so much guilt....my life is reduced to counting down the days and waiting for a fucking package. Constantly looking out the window for the fucking mail. What have I become? Yet, it feels so good and makes me forget myself, I keep doing it. Adding alcohol is what I will no longer do again. It's crazy like once I get the Etiz or c-lam into my system, it makes me head straight to the liquor store. That's when things get really fucked up at home, falling, blacking out, etc. I have to stop drinking with it. Period.

Just an update: I confessed to the psychiatrist today that I ran out of Klonopin early. 17 days early, wow! Anyway, she showed mercy and gave me another prescription thank God AND paid for it because I owe the pharmacy money. God is good. And I learned a lesson not to keep taking them like candy. I was close to having to go to the psych ward because she could tell by my behavior, I wanted to kill myself. So I had to promise I won't do any harm. What a day!

Sucks ass when my normal btc source can't sell me more than 50 CAD, wtf. This is not pricing of drugs btw. But that's strange and unsettling, all the damn things you gotta do to get the trust of a btc seller. And it's only to get a little c-lam on the side, so I don't fuck my rx, which has been successful pretty much all the time. I'll see tomorrow morning.

Well, it is. It's much much stronger than diclazepam. A little less strong than "flubo", which I guess you mean flubromazolam. There's also others out there worth it, flunitrazolam, fonazepam, nimetazepam. Anyway, 0.5 is like a 2mg clonazepam pill, clonazepam doesn't tend to knock one out, but you get so benz'd and not much notice because it's a lot more functional than flubro which is mostly for sleep and diclazepam, made for chillin' and not really going out. That's possible with clonazolam if you take normal does of 0.5-1mg max at once. I tell ya when you go back to your rx, which I hope you don't rely on daily, you will find them weak as shit for a couple weeks. And your intake to level out will deplete your rx's faster than a lot, except maybe if you have 2mg+ flubro a day..which happened to me for a while, last year...although, demands a lot more cautiousness than diclazepam too.

Flubro is an incredibly strong muscle relaxer, Diclaz is fairly close to valium in effects, and c-lam is heavily hypnotic and euphoric....They're not the same at all, really.

Just don't go too far. Stay at your low dosage. Trust me, you don't want to be blacking out, have bruises all over your body, get arrested or end up dead. On higher doses, it's like another person (or spirit) took over. I'm not trying to demonize c-lam. I love it. Just want to tame that beast.

Yes, I have heard they are strong and at 1 mg it seems like a good dose for all day therapeutic relief. Any more and I would be pretty dazed. I do like it also, what is your view on etizolam? I know all about for the addictive traits of each drug so I try to keep it to 1 maybe 2 times a week.

Etizolam is awesome! It gives you a nice, floaty euphoric feeling, completely takes away anxiety. I prefer it to c-lam at times. C-lam lasts longer in your system than Etiz, but C-lam has the potential to put you in "blackout mode" quicker. I recommend Etizolam for sure. You might prefer a higher dose of Etiz though, maybe start at 2 mg.


P.S. I'll leave it at that as far as talking about Etiz since this is a c-lam thread. I know mods prefer to stay on topic.

Ok yes sorry to go off topic. But also I took 2mg clonazolam today at the beach and it is looking good so far. and also kept etiz dosage below 4 mgs. Clonazolam seems to work better for me as An all day relief

Etizolam is just a tease, like Xanax. When I had pure powder or blotter, when I could sub it real good, suckling like crazy, I would get one hell of relaxing euphoric wave, that lasted about 30 seconds, then it had residual effects for an hour. Exactly like Xanax, at least with Xanax I can eat grapefruit and it will last almost all day, I don't think it works with etizolam. I'm not part of those who are mad for etiz, c-lam is much better even if less euphoric, most functional of them all due to length and how it destroys social phobia just like clonazepam.

I love Etiz even if it doesn't last as long as c-lam. It makes me feel more bubbly and fun while destroying anxiety at the same time. It also depends on your source. If you have a crappy source or brand, the Etiz won't work as well. Don't ask me for sources.


Back to c-lam, I'm trying a different source who I got liquid c-lam from. I'm not used to taking liquid c-lam, only tablets. The liquid isn't as good it seems. Maybe I'm still trying to get used to it, but next time I'm sticking to the tablets.

^ That makes sense, as with the tablets you know exactly what you're getting, as opposed to the liquid, which can be easily diluted, or tampered with.

Good point! I took about 2 mg of the liquid last night and slept like a baby, so there's a plus. Felt so good after having insomnia for weeks. I'm expecting liquid Etiz tomorrow so I'll see how that compares to the tablets too.

I wake up in the morning and take a low dose of liquid c-lam AND liquid Etiz at the same time just to get my day started. I hate waking up, it usually involves some kind of panic like "Oh fuck! It's another day." At least this medicine helps me calm down first.


Liquid Etiz and c-lam still doesn't compare to the tablets so I learned my lesson.

You're most likely addicted to downers mate, or will be soon. I would reccomend either cutting use down or stopping.

Yes, I am addicted. I've been addicted for quite a while. I have agoraphobia and generalized anxiety, but I need to cut back. I got my psychiatrist to recently prescribe Vyvanse. It has to be preauthorized first. Once I get It, I won't be messing around so much with other drugs recreationally. It will keep me focused on tasks I need to take on and keep me busy, improving my life. When I'm only focused on drugs, that means I need to get busy with other things and stop trying to fill the emptiness in nonproductive ways.

I'm green (not literally, but on this site) so can anyone let me know if being prescribed Klonopin and taking clonzalam drops will mess up my chances for this job where I have to do a d test? I'm not sure if they can isolate down to the type of benzo. 


Anyone?

There is no way for us to tell you what you have. You could send it off for testing. Now from  the research that I have completed and the individuals I have spoken with from what I gather the majority of powdered clonazolam is yellowish or slightly yellowish with a strong bitter taste. The taste I can not speak to but this one benzo does have a rather distinctive color. Send it to the spanish company for purity and identification standards.

I was prescribed Xanax for anxiety and used it for maintenance approx 2 years.

By my request I was switchd to klonopin.

They seem to last longer with the desired effect.

I have ascertained however that taking them sublingualy works better than just swallowing them..

The Xanax after a while was causing more harm than good. 

Lol... but coca cola sure tasted better whilst taking them. Perhaps that was just me, as I never heard anyone else say as much

The risk to these really potent research chems is that when their first coming out dosage is still a guess! It seemed the general consensus a year ago that C-lam was 4 times stronger than alprazolam. So my first time I figured slamming a half mg would do me good. It was great! Had a nice warm feeling (rush?). That nice feeling was the last thing I fully remember that night. I redosed within what must of been 5 min to turn this into a full fledged blackout. So yeah this stuff has to be stronger than what I thought it was at first....


Next time I tried it was much more enjoyable. Didnt have any more needles due to the first black out a few weeks prior, so I didnt have a good way of measuring out my solution. Read somewhere that a teaspoon was 5mL so I filled what was probably less than a 5th of the teaspoon (.5mg/mL). I took it sublingually and the .25-.5mg dose was enough to get me pleasantly intoxicated all day. Went to work and was able to function without any issues and just had a very good feeling all day and was rather sociable. Went home, took more, blacked out. It is an awesome drug if you can dose correctly, and not redose like I always end up doing.

I suddenly think that  grapefruit juice definitely works with this one, although it should not? Clonazepam doesn't for sure as it is a nitrobenzodiazepine, so that and nitrazepam which I don't have a script for but can easily get a bunch of 10mg Mogadon brand ones for free off a friend who doesn't take em when he refills, although I keep telling him to drop his fucking Seroquel for sleep and to use that. Anyway, anybody noticed this?

Are these substances made by pharmaceutical companies or are these strictly made for abuse? Everyone knows alprazolam, but even Etizolam is new to me and I wouldn't even know how to get it. This though seeing its pharmaceutical structure plus with the half life of klonopin, if this hits the streets well see an epidemic.

Many of them (including clonitrazolam) were developed by the major pharm companies during the 'lets invent benzos' craze of the 60's & 70's - but with the dearth of products brought to market they were seen as unnecessary additions to a class of drugs that covered most of their therapeutic spectrum and were subsequently shelved for decades until RC chemists rediscovered and re - synthesised them, with the ability to sell them on the open market as, due to their non use in medicine, they are not historically covered by drug or medicinal / food control legislation.


The big exception of course is Etizolam, which is marketed and used as medicine in many countries (it's not a strictly a benzo derivative although it sure appears to behave like one).

I am not really into benzos, but find the clonazolam turn to be pretty nice and relaxing. But the next day always is horrible for me, bad mood and I feel shallow and empty. Rebound anxiety I guess. Will probably never take it again.

I used to be a member here. This is where I was turned on to Kratom back in 2008 but I have not signed in so long that I had to create a new account. I just wanted to


add my 2 cents in. I have a very high tolerance to alcohol and benzos. But I have not drank any alcohol in 6.5 years mainly due to Kratom and the will to want to 


stop drinking. But I still have anxiety. I have been on Clonazapam for 5 years about. I average 12 to 16 mg's a day. I know, way to much, but I function 


just fine and hold down a very good job. Anyway I was running low on Clonazapam so I got some Clonazolam. I took 2mg at one time and was very 


surprised at the strength. I do not want to use this as a replacement for Clonazapam as I fear it would create even more tolerance. I am sure that this warning


has already been expressed but if you have little to no tolerance to benzos be careful because you might end up in a place and have no idea how you got there. I


took 2mg last night and is fine but be careful!


Sorry about the crazy double spacing, it does not look that way before posting!

Define abuse. I use them responsibly, like with my RX. Some of them were invented by the guy who invented Valium, Librium, Lexotan (bromazepam) etc., Flubromazepam, but it never was commercialized, although it's not stronger than Temazepam. They are there for people who need benzos but can't get a script, or people who have scripts but are not adequate so one find themselves in tolerance withdrawal and days on end without benzos which can kill you.


The "epidemic" never happened, and now they're harder to find than when there was 30 UK stores selling them, after the UK decided to ban fucking everything, copied on Ireland's law...well things went pretty on the DL. If you can't agree there is a difference between drug use, when it's not abuse, you're wrong.

This.


I love the feeling I get from 0.5mg Clonazolam.. it really gives some of the big pharma heavy hitters a run for their money (Flunitrazepam, I'm looking at you) 


But god damn the next day is just an automatic write off.. Gritty. As. Fuck.


Great addition for the connoisseur or collector (gotta catch 'em all)

But it's crystal clear to me why this one never made it to the pharmacy shelves.

Yeah, the rebound anxiety is really not desirable at all. Never had issues with other benzos. I´ll stay with diazepam. It is not nearly as good, but never had issues with hangovers.

I got more rebound with flubromazolam, big time. With clonazolam I can just take 0.5-1mg a day and be fine, unlike clonazepam, where when I was scripted 4mg a day, waking up was always the most "ugh" of experiences, also I was zombified at that dose.

Klonopin is great for anxiety, but it really is a borefest and does make you feel zombified like you said. I have not ordered clonazolam in a very, very long time. That shit makes me act way crazier than I do on Etizolam and it only takes a second. Etizolam is also a slippery slope for me because I tend to overdo it at times, but it's better than nothing and more fun than klonopin. 


I notice many southern states are banned from ordering on the site I use. I notice those same southern states usually get banned when it comes to research chems or other things. That fascinates me. Maybe they are ordering out of control in those areas and raising too many flags? It's an epidemic.

33rd latitude...


I'm Canadian, I only have to deal with ridiculous collateral damage such as nbome ban (which is good to me) dragging along 2c-x phenethylamines, not because they were targeted, but because the nbombes and nboh's are based on these, like the DOx...DOB and DOM was already illegal, but that didn't prevent bikers from ruining "blotter" popularity in the early '00s with their horrible DOB blotter they sold for 3-4 years, which the police warned against (saying not to do "blotter" as another chemical much more dangerous than LSD was circulating and it was true). The makers of 2c-B which was banned here in 1994, the only 2c-x expressly banned (and our analogue law is much weaker here, they added one benzo from all the RC's and it's Flubromazepam, which explains it was the only stuff I ever had seized, even the second time with a decoy...the sender was flagged for sure) could make DOB easily if they could produce 2c-B which has never left the streets here, people call it Nexus.


But yeah that 33rd degree latitude...seems only bad things happen/are law there with very few exceptions. And no way it's an epidemic, even in Montreal you'd be hard pressed to find someone addicted to benzos, it's just not something people sell or know what they are. People here have a kind of attitude where they never know what meds they take, only that they take them because the doctor scripted them. People sold me 70 Dilaudid brand name 4mg for the price of the biggest bucket of KFC you can get because nobody knows the street prices for those things, well almost nobody does. There's more of an epidemic of people selling particularly Dilaudid to people, who end up frustrated by the price and end up shooting it, which happens even more with our HydromorphContins which are abusable, hard to do safely, sterifilt or micron, but many don't care and use the somewhat safe good filter in the SecuriCups in the injection kits but everytime I did it I felt dirty, and it seems to keep some of it's XR properties for some reason, would make me sleep like a baby, while slamming 8mg Dilaudid would give me the insane rush that gets you opi-crack addicted, while even with the crushed beads to the finest powder..it will hit hard, the rush is lesser, but it will hit hard 10 minutes later when you could surprise yourself projectile-vomiting. That's offtopic but I was making a comparison.


Doctors do not have a DEA preventing them from prescribing what they want, and it's people with legit issues that normally sell the pharms as they make contacts in the waiting room of the pain clinic and a merry-go-round of pills start, that's how I put my hands on 60 or so generic APO-Oxycodone CR 60mg (generic oxycontin like you don't have) which lays in my stash because my suboxone poisoned body (yes poisoned, I'm going back to methadone, after what that shit did to my teeth, suboxone that is, anyone familiar with the Canadian Suboxone Lemon pills will know what I'm talking about, I used to have perfect teeth, had 2 tiny cavities until 2 years into Suboxone where suddenly I had 23 cavities, then now, a year later, I got 12 new ones and my insurance does not cover canal treatments in case they can't do filling of one particular teeth that I will keep, there is no way a dentist is removing a teeth out of my mouth, my fist will punch theirs out if they even propose to do so. I'm not sure I will need a canal treatment but if I do, it's not covered by my insurance and it's something about 800 dollars. I could put it on my credit margin, but no fucking way, I managed to get in the + and I'm not going back into the minus in that account. /rant

So you're in Canada? I was just reading about how people are dying big time in Vancouver from Fentanyl overdose. So that is definitely an epidemic there. It's bad news. This is off topic though...

Recommended amount for sleep? 


I don't have any benzo tolerance ; previously I would take 1-2mg Etizolam after tripping or other insomnia-inducing chems (eg. DCK). But my fav Etiz vendor does not seem to carry the stuff anymore, and has Clonazolam instead. So I ordered 100mg to give it a try.

There should be no reason to take more than 1mg. Although, clonazolam takes a bit longer to kick in than other triazolo-benzos, so don't take 1mg and get frustrated because you're not sleeping 10 mins later. Give it 30 min, 0.5-1mg is just fine, although I find it more suitable day-long anxiety/GAD remedy compared to flunitrazolam, flubromazolam and triazolam, which act very fast and are stronger hypnotics. I don't find Etizolam that great, but if it's good quality, I find that subbing 3-4mg gives a really intense anxiety relief/rush similar to a small shot of an opiate even, but it's gone so fast that I don't care for it, it's pretty much like Xanax that way, not very therapeutic, clonazolam is better suited for sleep I'd say, because it lasts a good amount of time, so if you tend to wake up 3 hours after getting to sleep, you'll find it useful. Just don't use it every day, for god's sake, you don't want a benzo addiction/tolerance.

Does anybody starts secreting a lot of throat mucus when using Clonazolam? My best source, I actually had GC/MS'd 4 different stores, from powder, the original gelcaps and now the blotter I obtain, and the blotter is as pure as the powder, 98% for both. So it's pure, but maybe it's the secretion modifications that occur when I also take care my Suboxone which demands suckling on a lemon-lime flavoured very low ph pill for 20 minutes, so would it be both in combo that does this? I always get more throat secretions when taking Clonazolam from the blotter and powder source. The original yellow gelcaps didn't do that, but that could be because I was on methadone then which didn't mess up my teeth and made my mouth so damn dry so my throat goes in overdrive when drinking a Code Red Mountain Dew can or even healthy grenada and berry juice, then I gotta clear my throat and spit it out the transparent/white slightly sticky stuff that originates from my throat, so it's not a cold or anything, taking benadryl with my suboxone usually helps, but I'm prescribed Trimipramine, a TCA antidepressant for sleep and I get a slightly better mood once I wake up which lasts about the whole day until 6-7pm.

I know what you mean regarding acid reflux, the ORT clinic put me on Pantoprazole (mostly to help methadone absorption because here it is still pre-made the night before you come in and mixed with orange juice, so reducing to 10mg and lower is possible unlike the silly stories of the literal drop of medicine in the regular 4oz brown bottle usually reserved for hydrocodone or codeine Rx syrup from the US...just give them the pain pill Methadone 5mg pills at that level, shit. There's no difference in size between the 5,10 and 20's here, only the 1mg ones are tiny. Anyway, I think I found out the main culprit, propylene glycol from my e-cig liquid, the stuff from the local chain of e-cig and e-cig accessories e-liquid is 70% propylene glycol and 30% Vegetable Glycerin, I asked if I could have changed when actually at one of their stores (they have one local chain of convenience stores selling some limited range of flavours of e-cig liquid from 6mg to 24mg. I asked if I could change for something containing less PG and more VG, so they made my Gummy Bear flavoured liquid (the best flavour there is) with 50-50 of each, like some higher end 100 dollars e-cigs that look more like strange gadgets than my 20 dollar e-cigs (I can mention the price of this right? It's like mentioning how a pack of X brand cig costs here). And right away I noticed that I started to produce a lot less phlegm...it used to be worse, I suffer from chronic sinusitis, but I'm in a good place right now, the worse was this fall when I had such sticky crap at the back of my palate so it would be almost impossible to spit it out without making some of the most unholy noises that at the time, my girlfriend and my friend who pays a rent to live in our basement hated it, drove 'em fucking crazy. Now the flare up in my sinuses is at its minimal and yeah, I think the Suboxone and the 70-30 e-liquid were the culprit there, clonazolam and other benzos might have contributed a little more. 


Trimipramine when I first started taking 12.5mg before bed made me wake up with my tongue feel like asphalt to the touch, anticholinergic effects galore, but it's the safest of TCA's out there and those side effects went away fast and now can take 25mg before bed and it's perfect, it's one of the only medication mainly scripted for sleep proven not to mess with REM sleep along with Quazepam...but unfortunately we don't get it here, if I was in the US, I would ask my doctor for some fucking Doral using that argument. But I never heard of anyone here who ever had it or even less had a script. Kinda like ProSom (estazolam), it frustrates me regarding this one cos I can get Euro benzos but no way I can even try ProSom which seems like an ideal sleep benzo, it's only in the US so it's pretty much out of bounds for me. I did experience quazepam through norflurazepam which was a very good, not too strong rc benzo that was only around the last 2-3 months of the UK vendors existing. Nobody picked it up, too bad, it was great for all-day GAD treatment, better than my Valium script, because it lasted all day and had about 6 active metabolites. I love Flurazepam, but one would be wrong to think a flurazepam metabolite in its own dosage is the same as Flurazepam.


Anyway, mystery solved. I'm getting bored, I have none of my rx right now, renewal day is in a week for bromazepam 6mg bid, Valium is on the 21st and Temazepam on the 27th (I only get 30x30 caps, I'd rather get 45x15mg caps but I'm not asking for too many changes re: my benzo scripts, but I rather take safe doses, like I said I never take more than 1.5mg of clonazolam a day, sometimes 2mg, but that's all. But I like taking say 1mg clonazolam with 30mg temazepam, or .5 Triazolam with 5mg Fonazepam, the different actions at subreceptors a1,a2,a3,a4,a5 and y1, y2 (I think that's the complete list of gaba subcomplex gaba receptors), taking a reasonable dose of 2 different benzos affect more subreceptors and it's that way I get the most out of 'em, for GAD, sleep, or the few reckless times I abuse the hell of them (them being rc benzos), which happens mostly when I mix a couple benzos, but double doses, with 50mg atarax and then take my mr.clean tasting shackles, I mean Suboxone pill (now at 8mg after a long struggle of 10mg one day, 8 mg the other...but now I went through a month where I didn't feel a bit restless due to lack of bupe so I'm good, that's how I determined when I could do this 10-8-10-8 etc., going from 12 to 10 right away was rough for 2 months, only after 3 months did my body adjust. That's why, among other reasons, I think suboxone has to be reserved for those who go for a 3 month detox, max.

Does a lower dose have shorter effects/lead to less sleep? 


I've taken this twice now, at the same dosage - 500ug - after LSD (it gives me the worst insomnia). I love that it knocks me out quickly, but both times I was deeply asleep for about 12 hours. I think I would much prefer sleeping for a max of 10 hours. I woke up at 4PM today and was a little frustrated because I wanted to get things done, hah. 


Should I go for 250ug? Would I fall asleep just as easily still?

Triazalo benzos have hit my town hard! Somehow someone has figured out how to li+uify them using "onion" juice & whatever so the new kick is to mix it wih H in a shot. We've had 8 confirmed deaths from this at my clinic in 2 months...its worse than the fentanyl ods a couple years ago

I had experienced with this one in the past. Won't be touching it again after my fiancée's response to it and our seemingly hedonistic tendencies. last experience with it.Too potent, horrible rebound anxiety, shouldn't even be on the market imho. But if you can use and not abuse more power to you


I want to take her to the hospital but she won't go. She thinks she's suffered brain damage after just one use. Is that even possible? Like if you were to blackout and say accidentally take 35 mgs in one night after one use

Clonazolam is known to be not only very potent mg for mg as compared to many other benzodiazepines, but also to have a different range of effects, including a brand of "stimulating" euphoria that is followed by sleep.  It also causes the user to black out much more quickly and intensely than others.  


To accompany this, the rebound effects are much more intense as well, and can occur to a great extent even after one or two doses.  The feeling of nerve damage has been common in my experience after discontinuation, as well as a rapid onset of a seizure state and aura of depersonalization.

That sounds about right. Here's the thing. She took somewhere between 35-50 mgs in one night. Prior to this we had been following the Ashton manual using flubromazepam with plans to eventually switch to diclazepam while very slowly lowering our etizolam dose. 


Got the clonozolam to deal with comedowns on stims/psychs/dissos. Yes I know how stupid this all sounds. I'm just trying to get some help. Don't be afraid to be real with me. I know how moronic this sounds, but it's the reality of the situation.

How long do you have to use benzos before withdrawal occurs and when you  are on a lethal zone? Two nights ago I did 3mg Rivotril and few beers  with very low tolerance, tough I've used Rivotril the past. Yesterday  night I took 4mg with some energy drinks and when I just woke up I took  another 1mg. So I've taken 8mg with one day between 3mg an 5mg doses.


Will  this give me nothing that worse a hangover without any withdrawal or is  it already dangerous to complete stop from this. I still have 2mg left,  so there's some possibility of phasing it out. I'm asking this because I  really can't go to benzo withdrawaln since I'm on a program which  aims at stop using drugs and alcohol completely, and some benzo  withdrawal would fuck that up. Benzo's sowing on the test isn't a  problem, that won't end he program. I really want stop using drugs even  though it may not look like when I've been drinking a few times a week,  trying MDMA and now benzos.

^Impossible to say as everyone reacts different. Some can take them for a few weeks straight without getting serious withdrawal symptoms while others experience withdrawal after just a week.

You may experience some rebound symptoms.


And for lethal zone you usually have to abuse them for quite some time, but some people will seize after just two weeks of normal use but I think those are prone to seizures.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21815323](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21815323)

> Since the first report of benzodiazepine withdrawal seizure in 1961, many case reports have followed. Withdrawal seizures have occurred with short, medium, and long halflife benzodiazepine, if discontinued abruptly. Withdrawal seizures usually occur in patients who have been taking these medications for long periods of time and at high doses. Seizures have also been reported with less than 15 days of use and at therapeutic dosage. Almost all the withdrawal seizures reported were grand mal seizures. The severity of seizures range from a single episode to coma and death. Benzodiazepine dose tapering can be done faster in a hospital setting in high-dose abusers, but must be done more slowly in the outpatient setting in therapeutic dosage users.

I've only used them for about three days, totaling 9mg, but use hasn't t  been spread out equally. It's been like 3mg at one, then about 40 hours  later 4mg at once and then about 4-8 hours 1mg twice. I only have 1mg  left and not getting more, so abuse will end soon anyway.


Still at least 18 days to test, but I don't really think it matters if I  got caught. Main thing is not to have any manor WD. Some minor hangover  and rebound is ok, I'm used to that.

I have some coming in. 60mg in 30ml of liquid with a 2mg measuring little oral syringe so I know the dose is exact, I'll see how it is. I also am waiting for blotters which are taking longer than usual to come in, the usual blotters I've been buying at 2 different places, unfortunately one has had to stop selling anything and is in a lull, having to relocate, but it's okay the other place, although the mail gets here slower, is exactly the same blotter, white blotter with clonazolam written in orange here and there on it. A year ago the had the molecule all over the backside but not anymore.


The liquid comes from much less far away, so I'll maybe test it before even going back to my 1 blotter a day routine, but that'd be ridiculous, it's been a while since i'm waiting for it, the other store, they had an average of 8 days to get to me, from central europe to Canada with a priority sticker. I don't know why the other place is slower but it's a drag, I had also only had one delivery from them when I had to switch, I hope they're trustable...which they must be, they're around since a decade almost. I'm tired of this crappy powder Etizolam I have, I prefer my Valium rx right now to it, I only had one good source for powder etizolam which I was able to weight (450 dollar scale) and still am, and this one I need 10mg to feel what 2mg of the other source who's in Canada but whos site is restructuring right now. It's a complicated mess since a while, things always get here very late, or the shipper ships like 5 days after I paid (for other stuff). 


Anyway, I hope everyone's doing fine here and not taking 50mg at once and waking up 3 days later in an industrial garbage bin and coming here to yell at how horrible c-lam is...

Shooting up Dilaudid if you do it multiple times a day in 3 days can get ya....although, that one time I was able to detox myself. The time I couldn't was because of heartbreak, as sappy as it sounds, it was the only thing that killed the pain from losing a girlfriend whom at one point had big plans together. Anyway, the one I have now is better, different, a bit more superficial, always exercising and wearing make-up to go to college and all, she wants to look "professional" at all times. So sure babe, as long as you prevent me from buying a jar of 100 8mg Dilaudid and you keep being pretty and play that bass while I play my guitar with just suboxone and valium and c-lam every other day and everything will be fine.

For someone with 11k posts  here....of course you're gonna say your fiancee feels like she had brain  damage, good god 50mg. Why am I able to take between 1-2mg a day since 4  years and not go fucking nuts? In my opinion flubromazolam was much  more dangerous to the average person, I can use it, but I wouldn't trust  anybody with more than 1 dose of max 1mg with them. I was able to  handle the original 2mg pink capsules but even then, it's the only thing  that had me fall down my office chair to the ground asleep and not  notice it until I woke up. Nothing, ever, had me fall down from my  chair, I've fallen asleep on my comfy office chair from benzos but not  this. I also never had more than 4mg of clonazolam a day.


It does  stimulate because it removes all anxiety without getting you sleepy  right away, it's a lot like clonazepam in this way, anxiety killer that  lasts all day without falling asleep with the max pilled dose of 2mg.  It's not great for sleep even, except if you are overworked/lack of iron  and/or sleep. Although clonazolam's second phase induces tiredness, I  really like it's GAD-killing effect so I can get shit done and not have  those racing thoughts or loops of anxious thoughts I had before taking  any benzos. Stopping to smoke weed everyday helped in getting rid of  that a little, but not that much. 


Be cautious people, those  things aren't toys and drinking a 12 pack without alcohol tolerance  would be safer than eating 50mg of clonazolam...ffs guys.

Shit, you need some GABA-B substances then...fuck. The only benzo that increased anxiety to me was when I was scripted clonazepam to cure HPPD, which it did, but it's a long process, and sometimes I was bored and took the most reckless dose of any benzo I ever did, 8mg clonazepam, and I was anxious as shit and also really depressed. They still work since that second 8 month script (I had a script for 0.25mg xanax 4 times a day before that for a month) in 2006 and sudden withdrawal is the worst thing that can happen to me still.

  Depends man, some are good for panic attacks, while others are good for GAD, which unfortunately means everday, like my current valium and lectopam (bromazepam) scripts for GAD, granted, they're not hyper strong benzos, but they keep withdrawals at bay and I can get shit done without...well without being like I was before I got some treatment (psychology, psychiatry....there's one lady psychotherapist in this town...I never went, but I think it would be more useful than psychologists who seem to be in it for the money and you pay for a friend who gives you "advice" and always ends the session with an attempt at getting some kind of life lesson to you, also it was 45 minute sessions...not enough time, psychiatrists are paid for here, not psychologists, except government psychologists but I'm not doing that, not going to tell anything to a government employee that's basically there to get info on you heh.

I'm very interested in the idea of combining benzos for best affect with my severe anxiety disorder. Any suggestions on what to ask for at the Dr's? Already on roughly 3mgs a day of klonopin and very curious what on top could help with both sleep and the anxiety, but my Dr won't just think I'm drug seeking... Any suggestions?

see the Ashton Manual (google it) about withdrawal/slow titration.  I came off of 1/2 mg and it almost killed me.  Now mainly they prescribe it for 5 days I understand.  I don't hear of it besides doctors prescribing it for anxiety. Am I right?

Just in case you are not taking the piss, ug and mg are multiples of the same unit division.


1 gram = 1000 milligrams (mg) = 1000000 milligrams (ug) regardless of location.

Cracked open some mylar and retrieved 100 x 500 ug blotters and cut a few of the blotters into four equal triangles so I could take a .125 ug dose and I was surprised by how hard it hit. I honestly didn't think I would have had much effect from such a small dose as I remember taking the .5 mg yellow capsules from the original vendor and not completely blacking out, but perhaps my tolerance to benzos was much higher back then. Now that my tolerance is back to baseline I would estimate .125 ug of this one to be equipotent to 0.75 mg of Xanax, it felt a bit stronger than a .5mg pill would assuming the blotters aren't dosed too high. I don't like having this one about if it's active at such a low dose, it freaks me out that such a tiny amount of powder can hit the GABA receptor so hard, any other receptor would be fine. Will be storing this one in the bio-hazard container.

I like the name it has everywhere else better, Rivotril. Slang is Rivos instead of Klonos. Although your brand name Clonazepam with the carved K looks a lot cooler than the brand name Roche Clonazepam or Diazepam for that matter in Canada, they aren't like that and we don't get 1mg brand name clonazepam or 10mg Valium, only brand for the 5's when it comes to Valium and the brand name .5 or 2mg Rivotril is either a beige pill or a white fat pill for the 2mg, with Rivotril written in a circle at the top with a big "2" in the middle. I'd pay a lot for american brand name clonaz or diaz, especially diaz, what with the heart-shaped V carved out of the pill for the 10mg ones. They look so cool. Just as a collectors item, I wouldn't use them heh.

*⬆To reply on page 38 of thread... Anyways, as to speaking on this chemical, even though i soooo love that i hate Clonazolam as much as i do.. I also have a hatred that i am soooo in love with it as well. Hmmmm.. Would love to be able to trust myself enough to place an order for 500mg of at least 99% pure powder, and concoct a 100ml solution of 0.25mg x 2,000 drops, for use on blotter, or simply sublingually. May make a few mls of .200ug(mcg) Definitely wanting to do this with Flunitrazolam, and maybe making all the doses .200ug/per drop as being a triazo-analogue of Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) speaks for itself..I know im getting off the threads topic, and my apologies for it...but has anyone thats tried both have a comparison-ratio, of the two?? 

 Thanks for any, and all inputs guy's, n gals. Please stay safe, and may God bless!!

Ah yes! The babyblue 10mg cut-Vs. They're here, yet hard to find for me. Even Diazepam in general are getting rare unless you are an older vet, or know of one that can get 120 or more a month from the V.A. Alprazolam, n Clonazepams are fairly an easy find. Have uet to try Rivotril. Would love an unopened bottle of 90ct.. Mmmmmmm!

Have read a good many of your post, The Real Oblivion. Interesting reads. Good to meet you sir.. ?

mygreenbic..Man please play it safely with maintenance dosing Methadone, n ANY benzo.Weather Clonazepam, any other rx benzo, or analogues of rx benzo's..BE SAFE!!!!!!! Im dosing 75mg a day myself n tend to drop a mg or 2 of Alprazolam, to make my movie viewings abit more pleasurable ?. Soooo many loved ones deaths has made me more HR aware. Always be aware of that very thin n fragile line. So easy to flirt with it, as i tend to do. Re-dosing is a MF with me.. I used to lay back in my bed, pour out 20 or so, 1mg Actavis, R|031 onto my belly, n pop 1 like every 10 mins or so, after my initial 3 mgs sublingually....yes, thats right sublingually! Yes, yuck.. Sorry for getting off topic..Again

How slowly would you guys suggest tapering from a 1mg/night habit that's been going on for a month (I have a history with benzo abuse too, so kindling effect and all that...). I just had a bad grand mal seizure and went to the ER, one doctor who didn't even know how to pronounce it right suggested a 2 day inpatient detox, another doctor who seemed to know much more about it supported my decision to taper myself but very slowly. I have a bunch of diclaz and clonidine, seroquel, gabapentin, and hydroxizine on the way. Just wondering how I should go about this.

jesus m-d, i'm so sorry to hear that. you need a medically supervised taper, i'm surprised that second doctor didn't begin to plan one out with you? because if not they were more useless than the first doctor! okay while your stuff is on the way you can taper with the clonaz, start splitting pills in half perhaps? i'm pretty sure you already have heard of it but the [Ashton Manual](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/) should be your bible while planning this all out, specifically chapter 2. give that a read asap to get an idea of the kind of timescale you should expect.

I have found diclazepam to be good for daytime work functionality. No euphoria or loopiness. Just negates all anxiety. Bad for sleep. Long wakeup hangover.

If you take diclazepam once a week, reaching a steady state plasma level still takes weeks.... it is the methadone of benzos. Best for when you are taking 240mg of diazepam per day and need a way to get DOWN.

I'm looking for a temporary replacement for alprazolam that would kick in just as quick and would not be too hypnotic and amnesic. Out of all benzodiazepines available as RC's clonazolam seems to be the best option and would be the easiest for me to get as soon as possible. But I need to know if one can stay functional after taking it in similar manner to alprazolam (I'm talking about clonazolam dosing equivalent to therapeutic doses of alprazolam of course).


I got alprazolam scripted by a family doctor to be taken in case of panic attacks (0.5mg a dose) that started happening during obligatory classes/labs at the university. The problem is after I had got my first panic attack moments after the start of a lab that was to last 4 hours more, the pattern started repeating every time before *similarly structured* classes/labs and I have to dose on every weekday and tolerance raises pretty fast. Basically, it happens before so-called "labs" which have nothing practical about them and I'm supposed to sit through a 3 to 4-hour long obligatory lecture, often in very small rooms with plenty of devices sitting on a stool without a support for back. I don't get such panic attacks before actual labs when the time spent there is consumed by practical activity, though I'm still anxious. I don't have such problems at work though where I basically spend all day in the lab. It seems to me I have developed agoraphobia.


Anyway, I've run through 15 0.5mg pills in like 10 days because I had to take it every day, obviously tolerance kicked in fast for this reason and now 1mg is not even working as good as the first few 0.5mg's did. I'm not a newbie to benzos, I'm well aware of the kind of devil I'm dealing with here. I had been dependent on them for 9 years, I managed to quit 4 years ago after hellish withdrawal and I thought I would never take any benzo again, no matter what, I thought I'd grown up and would be able to deal with any stress in some other way without drugs. But the problem I have now got very serious, I started skipping classes and then decided to go to a GP to get an anxiolytic before I would run into serious trouble at the uni for not being present at obligatory classes. I will visit my family doctor again soon to discuss all this and hopefully I will get another script for alprazolam, otherwise I might be in trouble 2 weeks before the Christmas holidays, hence I consider clonazolam. I know this can't go on for too long no matter whether I stick to alprazolam or switch to clonazolam, but for now I see no other options. I lost so much time due to problems with opioids and benzos, which stemmed from depression and anxiety too, that if I hadn't, I would have this studying thing left far behind me. I also got trazodone scripted for insomnia, I thought I'd manage to get rid of daytime anxiety with it as well, but it just makes me drowsy, it doesn't necessarily help me that much in falling asleep and sustaining sleep afterwards, but it carries the grogginess into the following day which makes focusing on stuff quite hard and it's not really anxiolytic.

Clonazolam is not really the best choice for a functional benzo. It is known to be much more amnesiac then alprazolam. You would be far better off using diclazepam, etizolam or F-Pam. The memory problems after  being on this specific chem can cause irritability and confusion.

The time I couldn't was because of heartbreak, as sappy as it sounds, it was the only thing that killed the pain from losing a girlfriend whom at one point had big plans together. Anyway, the one I have now is better, different, a bit more superficial, always exercising and wearing make-up to go to college and all, she wants to look "professional" at all times. So sure babe, as long as you prevent me from buying a jar of 100 8mg Dilaudid and you keep being pretty and play that bass while I play my guitar with just suboxone and valium and c-lam every other day and everything will be fine.

Why am I able to take between 1-2mg a day since 4  years and not go fucking nuts? In my opinion flubromazolam was much  more dangerous to the average person, I can use it, but I wouldn't trust  anybody with more than 1 dose of max 1mg with them. I was able to  handle the original 2mg pink capsules but even then, it's the only thing  that had me fall down my office chair to the ground asleep and not  notice it until I woke up. Nothing, ever, had me fall down from my  chair, I've fallen asleep on my comfy office chair from benzos but not  this. I also never had more than 4mg of clonazolam a day.

It's not great for sleep even, except if you are overworked/lack of iron  and/or sleep. Although clonazolam's second phase induces tiredness, I  really like it's GAD-killing effect so I can get shit done and not have  those racing thoughts or loops of anxious thoughts I had before taking  any benzos. Stopping to smoke weed everyday helped in getting rid of  that a little, but not that much.

i also notice since i stopped smoking weed every day heavily,my anxiety prolems are much better now,almost completely gone.In my opinion weed is underestimated in regards of its potential psychological side effects in many people.

They always play it down with saying "its only a plant" well so is opium,datura and coca leaf.Cocaine is what thc shatter is to normal weed,and in my opinion has alot worse side effects than low grade weed.Also weed is much more potent nowadays and is therefore much more dangerous than weed was 30 years ago

Can anyone help me with volumetric dosing?  I was wanting to order the Clonazolam powder because it is the same price almost for 100mg in powder form as 25mg in pellet form.  I have a pellet press and was wanting to make my own tablets, and although mg scales are on Amazon for around $20 the reviews seem to indicate a tolerance of +/- 5mg depending on which way the wind blows.


So if I ordered 100mg of powder in a well ventilated area with a mask, and mixed THOROUGHLY with 900mg of binders and made small pellets of ten mg that would give me 1mg of Clonazolam per pill correct?  Is this too dangerous to attempt?  Would an ethanol/pg solution be that much safer?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I just can't justify going through all the effort of getting a bank account just to acquire Bitcoin, then spending the same price for a fourth of the product.  I have ordered a Clonazolam solution before that was mixed with both ethanol and PG but I was thinking about doing a straight ethanol solution so I could mix a ml in a drink and hopefully have most of the ethanol evaporate after sitting for a few minutes.


All you guys that are really here for harm reduction, I need your help.  I know ordering the pellets is the safest option, but barring that, what would be my best bet for keeping cost down while maintaining as much safety as possible?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I just can't justify going through all the effort of getting a bank account just to acquire Bitcoin, then spending the same price for a fourth of the product.  I have ordered a Clonazolam solution before that was mixed with both ethanol and PG but I was thinking about doing a straight ethanol solution so I could mix a ml in a drink and hopefully have most of the ethanol evaporate after sitting for a few minutes.

It truly is dangerous to mix down anything dry outside of a lab. The making of tablets is also highly discouraged as pill pressing without the right excipients and binders just makes a crumbly mess, if not straight off then after some humidity hits them. That is unless you want to go through the hassle of obtaining some kind of coating like Hypromellose and then evenly coating them without losing integrity from the coating mixture. I think you can see it's a fools errand and fraught with labor intensive steps, not to mention it turns your powder into a distribution charge if you're caught.


A major problem with trying to dilute powder with powder is uneven grain size and it's behavior in a stack, resulting in a mixture that is far from homogeneous. While powder might be cheaper or have wider availability vs pellets, the labor and materials involved in diluting it properly and accurately dry outweigh the savings manifold. The safest method for dilution is using a solvent such as PG or EtOH and mixing down from a heavier concentration to a one that is dilute enough to be dispensed with say a small oral syringe at maybe 1mg per ml so fractions of a mg can be easily dosed.


A note about using Ethanol by itself it that evaporation can increase the concentration to an unknown amount leaving you somewhat blind to the actual dose. Always keep EtOH (& PG) solutions sealed and cool so storage time isn't as big an issue.But EtOH in solution with something else will not evaporate like high concentrations or pure EtOH.


Trying to weigh out small quantities really requires a professional environment and expensive scales with isolation measures to compensate for air currents, temperature, vibrations, humidity, etc. While inexpensive scales are great for a number of other substances, potent powders isn't one of them. For some more in depth discussion about dilution I would suggest referring to -Flualprazolam/page2 . Some good points are brought up regarding things like dilution in the original packaging vs trying to transfer it to something else and contaminating your work area or leaving packaging out that could inadvertently dose another person or pet. I hope this dissuades you from the powder route and surely from trying to make pellets at home. Feel free to PM myself or any moderator if you have further questions. Stay Safe.

Too piggy back off this:


If you are going to mix with PG, I would suggest adding about 5% EtOh to the mix, as it will help keep the integrity of the suspension.

Seriously we are not here to help to make pills, which I can only seeing you try to make to sell... Especially with not just a pretty, but very easily dangerous. If you were off by 100 ug that could send someone into blackout terratory. If you really want to buy powder to make a solution to dose for yourself then do that, but don't risk making the pills even if it's for yourself. If you need to bring a few doses with you prepare some by dropping the liquid solution on a cracker or something. If you make it so each ml contains 1 mg than each 0.1 ml or 10 units on a 1 ml insulin syringe would be 100 ug, which could easily soak into a cracker or something.


There's no reason you need to make a gram worth of c-lam doses all at once. Not if it's for personal use

Being unable to order diclazepam I decided to grab a small vial of Clonazolam. After reading many experiences of severe rebound anxiety and seizures I’m beginning to have second thoughts. Is it really that bad or is using it once or twice a week a safe bet?

So for me first trying this and flualprazolam, I had gotten the clon for the strict usage as an ace in the hole knock me out during a bad comedown drug. The flual is really recreational but I had to take a fair amount. But man once I tried the clon one night I loved it so much. It’s euphoric and at the right dosage she doesn’t put me to sleep at all. 

Clon is fast becoming my favorite Benzo.

Does the nasal dosae and duration differ from oral? I usually dose my benzodiazepine nasal through a spray containing a mix of 50/50 water and PG. Works wonders with Etizolam and Flualprazolam but i've yet to try Clonazolam nasal. Not sure what dosage to go fro.

That's probably the only angle one can look at benzos that make them less addictive than opiates, a couple days "binging" on benzos won't bring you withdrawals, lol. I'm surprised no one called you on that, this is a HR forum afterall (which means erroneous hypothesis should be called on, it's nothing personal).

I know this is an old thread, but I had bought a few grams of clonzolam back in 2015ish and had got to the point I was taking 20-30mg per day (volumetric liquid dose) that had escalated over about a 4 month period. 


 I don't remember much, obviously. I wrecked my car multiple times, once with my kid inside, wrecked my dad's car at least twice, and broke everything fragile around the house, I was actually on a "fail" video on a dashcam walking down the street (not too fucked up looking really), and missed a curb and just fucking bit it face first. Hilarious if it wasn't me. 


I had been taking (real) Xanax at doses up to 20mg at the time, but clonazolam was an entirely different animal. I could always somewhat function on Xanax, Klonopin, or Valium, but C-lam was simply uncontrollable, even at known doses. That stuff would stay at my system so long that I would wait 24 hours before ritosen, not realized how fucked up I still was, and end up lacking out for another two days on a "regular to me" dose. 


My wife would find me at 7-Eleven looking at drinks or whatever for what had to have been close to an hour. Luckily the staff knew me, and knew I was harmless, so didn't call the police. 


It finally culminated with me running around the neighborhood at night with a BB gun shooting at whatever I wanted and getting in some pretty serious trouble for it.


The withdrawals were something else as well. I was in a jail cell and didn't know where I was, I kept waking up on the floor and not knowing what was going on. It went on for well over a week. It was so bad that I was detoxing off of dope too and didn't even remember. 


If you stumble upon this thread and want to try some clonazolam, DONT.
