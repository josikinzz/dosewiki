**1-Phenyl-2-pyrrolidinylpentane** (also known as **Prolintane** , and by the trade names **Catovit** , **Promotil** , and **Villescon** ) is a synthetic central nervous system (CNS) [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) that is structurally similar to the [substituted pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_pyrrolidine) class of compounds such as [MDPV](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDPV) and [A-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) albeit with notably attenuated effects. Prolintane was first synthesized in the 1950s, where it was found primarily to act as as a [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (NDRI) which is thought to confer its [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and potential [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) qualities.

Historical reports show records of the preparation of prolintane for use as a mild CNS stimulant, wakefulness agent, and cessation aid for [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) addiction. It has been marketed in Europe since the 1960s as an antidepressant (i.e. due to its anti-fatigue properties) and analeptic. It has a history of being used in neuropsychiatric research related to CNS stimulants with reduced side effects. Therapeutic uses of prolintane in Africa, Europe, and Australia include the treatment of narcolepsy, ADHD, fatigue, and orthostatic hypotension. It is not approved for pharmaceutical use in the United States.

The first reports of prolintane abuse appeared in Europe during the early 2000s when prolintane was identified in tablets distributed at a rave party. Later reports documented the recreational use of prolintane in the United States, where it appears to substitute for recreational amphetamine and other stimulant use.

## Chemistry

Prolintane, or 1-Phenyl-2-pyrrolidinylpentane, is a synthetic stimulant of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. An [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) molecules has the structure of a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) molecules with an additional methyl group located on the alpha carbon. Prolintane's structure consists of a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core with a propyl group substituted at the alpha carbon, and a [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pyrrolidine) ring at the amino group. Prolintan is structurally similar to [A-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) , but differs in the absence of a ketone group attached to the beta carbon.

## Pharmacology

Prolintane is thought to act primarily as a mild [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) . Reduced re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine results in higher concentrations of the two [catecholamine](/w/index.php?title=Catecholamine&action=edit&redlink=1) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) in the [synaptic cleft](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synapse) , or gap between [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) . The result of this reduced reuptake activity is an enhanced and prolonged concentration and resulting post-synaptic effect of dopaminergic and noradrenaline signaling at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors on the receiving neurons. This sudden increase in neurotransmitter concentration in the brain is thought to be responsible for the high that prolintane can induce at higher doses.

Because it acts principally as a catecholaminergic re-uptake inhibitor, prolintane could be considered more like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) than [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) in its pharmacological mechanism of action In contrast, amphetamine acts primarily as an agonist to release dopamine and noradrenaline indirectly via activation of the TAAR1 receptor.

## Subjective effects

The effects listed below are based upon the subjective effects index and personal experiences of PsychonautWiki contributors. The listed effects will rarely (if ever) occur all at once, but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)** or **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Some experience reports describe individuals who have experienced one or more types of gastrointestinal disturbance while under the influence of prolintane, but typically only at very high doses.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - Higher doses of prolintane can create a significant and often dangerous increase in heart rate and blood pressure.
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the offset of a stimulant experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its peak. This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of neurotransmitter depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The general cognitive effects of prolintane can be described as being similar to those of classical CNS stimulants with attenuated activity. At common dosages, the prolintane high is described as being subtle and functional, comparable to a proportionally smaller dose of [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) with a smoother, less jittery come up and a milder comedown. Higher doses of prolintane, however, can likely intensify numerous negative effects such as anxiety and disorganized thoughts; at extremely high doses or continued use, delusions and psychosis become likely.

### Experience reports

Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) include:

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational prolintane use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context, and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried prolintane within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

### Lethal dosage

The exact lethal dosage of prolintane is unknown, and no formal studies have been carried out in humans. The typical adult therapeutic dose of prolintane has been 10-40mg daily. In therapeutic trials, 20mg prolintant is a mild stimulant equivalent to 100mg caffeine. In a study of fatigued volunteers the administration of 20mg or 40mg prolintane produced similar, but less intense effects than 20mg [d-amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . In experimental studies of healthy volunteers, prolintane has little cardiovascular activity following the single dose of 20mg.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Unlike some of the other more potent [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) in its class, the chronic use of prolintane can be considered mildly to moderately addictive with only a moderate potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users.

When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage. Addiction is a potential risk among users of prolintane as it can cause compulsive redosing, although typically to a far lesser degree than the notoriously compulsive [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) analogs A-PVP and MDPV.

### Psychosis

User reports indicate that chronic abuse or single overdose exposure of prolintane can potentially lead to [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Psychotic symptoms from prolintane can include [hearing voices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations) , [visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , urges to harm oneself, severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , grandiosity, [paranoid delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , increased aggression, and [irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability) .

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Prolintane can be potentially dangerous in combination with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) as it can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Prolintane should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Prolintane may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and other stimulants.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

## Legal status

- **Germany** : Prolintane is a prescription only medicine, according to Anlage 1 AMVV ( *Medicine Prescribing Regulation, Schedule 1* ).
- **Switzerland** : Prolintane is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
