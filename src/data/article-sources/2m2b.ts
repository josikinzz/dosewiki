**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 0.5 mL
- Light: 1 - 5 mL
- Common: 5 - 10 mL
- Strong: 10 - 15 mL
- Heavy: 15 mL +There have been unconsciousness and deaths reported at as low as 18 mL respective 29 mL.[2]

**Duration:**
- Total: 8 - 14 hours
- Onset: 10 - 50 minutes
- Peak: 6 - 8 hours
- Offset: 4 - 6 hours
- After effects: 4 hours
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) or [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**2-Methyl-2-butanol** (also known as ***tert* -amyl alcohol** or **2M2B** ) is a tertiary [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) substance that produces [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) , [hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) , and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects. Historically, it has been used in anesthesia as a component of avertin fluid mixed with tribromoethanol and water. It has a strong solvent smell reminiscent of gasoline and camphor, but with little flavor aside from a burning sensation. 2M2B's simple structure and intoxicating effects have led to its use as a recreational drug.

Fusel alcohols including 2M2B are a grain fermentation by-product and therefore present in many alcoholic beverages. Trace levels of 2M2B have also been detected in various food substances, including fried bacon and cassava, rooibos tea, and fruits (such as apple and pineapple).

## Chemistry

2-methyl-2-butanol is also known as tert-amyl-alcohol, 2M2B, or amylene hydrate. 2-methyl-2-butanol is an [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) with the formula C 5 H 11 OH. 2-methyl-2-butanol is comprised of butane, an alkyl chain of four carbons. This chain is substituted at R 2 with a methyl group CH 3 - and an alcohol group OH-. It is synthesized by the reaction of 2-methyl-2-butene with water in the presence of an acid catalyst.

## Pharmacology

2-Methyl-2-butanol inhibits binding to a proconvulsant site on the [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) which causes negatively charged chloride ions to enter neurons and increase the amount of excitation necessary to cause the neurons to fire. As it is a tertiary alcohol, it cannot be metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase into aldehydes (which cause the hangover associated with consuming large amounts of [ethanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethanol) ). This makes 2M2B significantly safer than primary alcohols. However, a consequence of this is that 2-methyl-2-butanol has an extended duration of action with effects that last up to 12 hours after its consumption.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to other depressants of a similar nature, 2M2B is comparatively closer to [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) in terms of its subjective effects and is also considerably more sedating than alcohol but less sedating than GHB.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In comparison to [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , 2-methyl-2-butanol is significantly more sedating. On low to moderate doses, one may feel a lack of energy, resulting in extreme difficulty in performing basic tasks. This effect can last up to 24 hours afterwards.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - In comparison to [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , 2-methyl-2-butanol has less pronounced physical euphoria in proportion to other effects.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - In comparison to [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , 2-methyl-2-butanol is significantly more impairing to motor control in proportion to other effects.
- **[Appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- [Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others.
 - Compared to alcohol, 2-methyl-2-butanol impairs motor control proportionately more than cognition, which can act to amplify delusions of sobriety if using alcohol intoxication as a reference. 
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Focus suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_suppression)**
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2M2B use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown although the lowest recorded fatal dose in a human is 30mL. However, 2M2B is expected to be less toxic than ethanol as it cannot be metabolized into aldehydes in the same way. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 2M2B within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with any other GABA receptor agonist, repeated use and increasing tolerance will eventually result in a withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation resembling alcohol, barbiturate, or [benzodiazepine withdrawal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) , up to and including delirium tremens ("the shakes"). The chronic use of this compound can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 2M2B develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2M2B presents cross-tolerance with all [GABAgenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) , meaning that after the consumption of 2M2B all [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , 2M2B , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.

  "wikipedia": `# Tert-Amyl alcohol
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tert-Amyl_alcohol*

tert-Amyl alcohol (TAA) or 2-methylbutan-2-ol (2M2B), is a branched pentanol.
Historically, TAA has been used as an anesthetic and more recently as a recreational drug. TAA is mostly a positive allosteric modulator for GABAA receptors in the same way as ethanol. The psychotropic effects of TAA and ethanol are similar, though distinct. Impact on coordination and balance are proportionately more prominent with TAA, which is significantly more potent by weight than ethanol. Its appeal as an alternative to ethanol may stem from its lack of a hangover (due to different metabolic pathways) and the fact that it is often not detected on standard drug test.
TAA is a colorless liquid with a burning flavor and an unpleasant odor similar to paraldehyde with a hint of camphor. TAA remains liquid at room temperature, making it a useful alternative solvent to tert-butyl alcohol.

## Production

TAA is primarily made by the hydration of 2-methyl-2-butene in the presence of an acidic catalyst.

## Natural occurrence

Fusel alcohols like TAA are grain fermentation byproducts, and therefore trace amounts of TAA are present in many alcoholic beverages. Traces of TAA have been detected in other foods, like fried bacon, cassava and rooibos tea.
TAA is also present in rabbit milk and seems to play a role in pheromone-inducing suckling in the newborn rabbit.

## History

From about the 1880s to the 1950s, TAA was used as an anesthetic with the contemporary name of amylene hydrate, but it was rarely used because more efficient drugs existed. In the 1930s, TAA was mainly used as a solvent for the primary anesthetic tribromoethanol (TBE). Like chloroform, TBE is toxic for the liver, so the use of such solutions declined in the 1940s in humans. TBE-TAA-solutions remained in use as short-acting anesthetics for laboratory mice and rats. Such solutions are sometimes called Avertin, which was a brand name for the now discontinued TAA and TBE solution with a volume ratio of 0.5:1 made by Winthrop Laboratories. TAA has emerged recently as a recreational drug.

## Use and effects

Ingestion or inhalation of TAA causes euphoria, sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects similar to ethanol. When ingested, the effects of TAA may begin in about 30 minutes and can last up to 1–2 days. 2–4 grams of TAA is sufficient to produce a hypnotic effect. About 100 g of ethanol induces a similar level of sedation.

## Overdose and toxicity

The smallest known dose of TAA that has killed a person is 30 mL.
An overdose produces symptoms similar to alcohol poisoning and is a medical emergency due to the sedative/depressant properties which manifest in overdose as potentially lethal respiratory depression. Sudden loss of consciousness, simultaneous respiratory and metabolic acidosis, fast heartbeat, increased blood pressure, pupil constriction, coma, respiratory depression and death may follow from an overdose. The oral LD50 in rats is 1 g/kg. The subcutaneous LD50 in mice is 2.1 g/kg.

## Metabolism

In rats, TAA is primarily metabolized via glucuronidation, as well as by oxidation to 2-methyl-2,3-butanediol. It is likely that the same path is followed in humans, though older sources suggest TAA is excreted unchanged.

The use of TAA cannot be detected with general ethanol tests or other ordinary drug tests. Its use can be detected from a blood or a urine sample by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry for up to 48 hours after consumption.
