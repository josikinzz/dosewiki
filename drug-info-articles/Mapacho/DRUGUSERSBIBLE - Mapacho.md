## Subjective Experience

Mapacho (nicotiana rustica) has a rich history of entheogenic use, primarily amongst
South American shamans, and sometimes during ayahuasca ceremonies. It is not to
be confused with common tobacco (nicotiana tabacum), not least because its nicotine
content is commonly stated to be about 20 times higher.

My experience with this was, shall we say, not successful. Perhaps being a non-
smoker didn't help, but it was a sorry story.

```
REPORT #1
I undertook the experiment at about 6pm. I loaded the leaves, still pungent
and fresh, into a large bong, and took two enormous hits. I'm not sure why I
was so greedy: perhaps it was the foolish notion that it was only tobacco.
```

```
It was a pretty rough smoke, and then boom: I was suddenly dizzy and was
almost falling over as I slumped towards a soft chair. I thought I might pass
out, but I didn't.
```
```
I felt rough, very rough, with head spinning and a sense of nausea.
```
```
This gradually wore off and I returned to some sort of normality in about 15-
20 minutes. I didn't fully recover until the next day, and I had a very poor
night’s sleep.
```
```
I was completely overwhelmed by it, and vowed never to smoke it again. It
didn't feel healthy at all.
```
Did I actually use the words “vowed never to smoke it again”? I suspect that the
following report, circa 2016, could fall under the heading "he never learns".

```
REPORT #2
Last week I was in Vietnam, and as I tend to whenever I am in a far flung
country, I checked out the local (legal) psychoactive scene.
```
```
In this case, I found very little. Occasionally, however, I did notice small
groups of men in the streets smoking something from huge bamboo pipes. I
presumed this to be tobacco, although I hoped it was something else.
```
```
Naturally I couldn't resist, so I approached a couple of chaps, who looked
friendly enough, and offered a few local shekels for a toke.
```

```
They refused the money but proffered the pipe freely. In fact, they urged me to
sit down, an offer which I accepted.
```
```
Taking a large hit I immediately realized why.
```
```
I was hit for six. I was dizzy, I thought I was fainting, and I felt nausea
coming-on. It wasn’t nice. It felt very much like a re-run of my earlier
nicotiana rustica ordeal.
```
```
I didn't slump into a heap this time, but I was close.
```
```
After a few minutes, and many deep breaths, I started to slowly get my head
together, and I took a photograph of the packet.
```
```
On returning to the hotel, later in the evening, I asked the concierge if they
could translate the front of this and explain what it was. Yes, it was indeed
nicotiana rustica, which also bore the words Aztec tobacco and wild tobacco. I
also discovered that its more formal name there was thuoc lao.
```
What did I deduce from this second slap in the face?

1. Perhaps this feeling is normal, and people get off on it. God knows how. By
    seating me the locals obviously knew what was coming.
2. I had consumed about 3 bottles of beer: the experience sobered me up
    instantly, and I remained so for the rest of the evening. Indeed, I didn't feel
    like engaging any further intoxicant of any type, and didn't drink for the
    rest of the night.

```
After about half an hour, I felt half-decent and strangely clear-headed. In
fact, I felt quite good. Perhaps this phase is the attraction.
```
3. Like the first time, it felt rather toxic and unhealthy. It's hard to see how
    anyone could get used to this, but they do appear to. I have no idea what it
    does to the health of habitual users, but it certainly can't be good news.

Despite the flip side, I'm glad that I re-sampled, largely to have experienced it in a
more authentic setting than my room. However, I don't see any scenario at all in
which I will repeat it again.

This time I mean it.

ADDITIONAL SAFETY NOTE
It is reported that due to its high nicotine content large doses of mapacho can present
the risk of acute poisoning and potentially death. Take it easy!
