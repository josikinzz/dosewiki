MXiPr (Methoxisopropamine, Isopropyloxetamine, Isopropyxetamine') is a recreational designer drug with dissociative effects. It is an arylcyclohexylamine derivative, related to drugs such as ketamine and methoxetamine. It is an N-ethyl homologue to methoxetamine. Since it hasn't been extensively studied, the pharmacological effects are unclear, but its effects are reportedly similar to methoxetamine. It was first identified in Slovenia in December 2020, and was made illegal in Hungary in April 2021.
