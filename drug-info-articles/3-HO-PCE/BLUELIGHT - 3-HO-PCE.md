A well known vendor will be releasing this soon, I was lucky enough to get a small sample 


I've only tried a few mg, so far my impressions are:


more potent than 3-meo-pce/3-meo-pcp and more on the sedating side unlike the 3-meos 


fast onset duration is not as long as the 3-meos but that might just be the low doses

If I recall correctly, it was available for some time from a canadian vendor, and it was found that 50 mg was needed for just any effects what so ever. People were quite dissapointed, and at first it was believed to be a scam, but it turned out that it was the real deal. You can read about it if you google around, but there's not that much on bluelight. 


Edit: Erh..... actually can't find any proof of what I am talking about, but I'm pretty sure. All the info probably dissappeared with some sites that allow vendor discussion.

Your right Incunabula. That is indeed what happened. I know TAC was one of the people who tried it, maybe he'll chime in.

Yes, good, thank you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I remember people saying it was quite all right actually, just not very potent at all.

That's odd, I'm definitely feeling something from a few mg of it (only got a 50 mg sample so cant really experiment with a lot of doses).

Time will tell I guess, they are supposed to release it in the next few days and then other will be able to try it and report back so my reports wont make or break the thing. Saying anything more would be to close to source talk so...

I can't remember the maximum dosage I tried, but I'm sure it was in the tens of milligrams, and I couldn't get anything out of it whatsoever. I assumed it was totally inactive.

Yes, it's strange. The question is what kind of testing the vendor has done on his batch, and was it done by third party? Can customers request to see it?


When it get's released, some one should really ship some off to energy control. Otherwise people will never know what they were taking, and it will just remain a mystery compound sold as 3-OH-PCE.

True enough, sadly any more specific vendor talk is not allowed here. I can say that the vendor in question is one of the most respected ones, has not had any fuckups in the past and has introduced some very good and hard to make compounds in the past and have provided nmr analysis results for their other products. But even the best vendors fuck up on occasion so.....

I haven't tried any of the newer dissociatives since methoxetamine, are any of them anywhere near as good as the MXE that was around in 2012-2013? Most MXE after 2013 seemed to be of lesser quality, possibly due to the MXE not being enantiomerically pure or maybe because of cuts being used. Early MXE is still my favorite substance and it was for everybody else i know that tried earlier batches. However deschloroketamine, 3-MeO-PCE, x-phenidines all sound so subpar. Only 3-MeO-PCP sounded interesting enough to buy but now it seems to be going through some batch variations like MXE did.

There are some gems.  In particular I love 3-MeO-PCP, although it is really nothing like MXE, totally different drug.

It's all a matter of opinion but as far as I'm concerned O-PCE is better than good MXE (although not by a large amount), 3-meo-pce and 3-meo-pcp are also very good but not as similar to MXE as O-PCE.


Imo the top 3 dissos are O-PCE, 3-meo-pce and 3-meo-pcp with MXE being a very close contender.


O-PCE is the closest of the 3 to MXE and is relatively hole friendly.


3-meo-pce is not hole friendly, is quite manic, fun, slightly less potent than 3-meo-pcp and produces a better high than 3-meo-pcp.


3-meo-pcp is similar to 3-meo-pce, but a bit less manic and fun, is more potent and cheaper. And is more versatile than 3-meo-pce since low doses can be used as a functional anxiolytic/anti depressant/booster for other dissos while 3-meo-pce is not that good at those roles. 


DCK/o-pcm is liked by a lot of people, 2f-dck is very close to ketamine.


MXM is also quite nice.


As is ephenidine and 4-meo-pcp.


Diphenidine, mxp and 3-meo-pcmo are qute shitty

alright guys, this will be coming soon. Are there any legit experiences or ideas on what to expect, duration and dose-wise? It sounds like the batches years ago had some skeptics and who knows what the quality was IF it was 3rd party tested and confirmed.

Here is what the lab who made it had to say about prior batchs of 3-ho-pce. 

(Please remove this if im breaking any rules all in the name of harm reduction)

3-Ho-PCE

IUPAC-Name:


3-(1-(ethylamino)cyclohexyl)phenol

CAS #: N/A


Form: Hydrochloride


5mg subtle opioid effects starting

10mg first dissociative effects are starting

15mg was confirmed to be a good (strong dose)


"To our knowledge this is the first real batch of 3-Ho-PCE to appear on the market.

There are reports to be found on the net from people claiming to have tested 3-Ho-PCE and they indicate that doses are in the 60mg area and even higher.

These people did obviously not research with real 3-Ho-PCE but with some fake product."

It amazing all these the fake pce/pcp analouges that are not labeled right or are not the same chemical has not caused a hell of alot more "lab disasters" than i have seen. So PLEASE Tread LIGHTLY with this one peeps. 

Stay safe,

Nugz

Potency for 3-HO-PCE is in the same range as PCE and O-PCE. 2mg-15mg (for non-tolerant users) I kept redosing so I am not able to give you any information about duration. By the way identity of said compound was confirmed via independent NMR spectroscopy, so anyone who needed 60mg for effects did not take 3-HO-PCE!  Another concern for me is the suspected opioid activity. I know this was speculated about MXE, 3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCE which I never understood..  Neither of these let me to believe that that there is opioidergic activity.  But 3-HO-PCE was different. (Please keep in mind that speculation about actual physiological targets using subjective experiences as evidence is highly unreliable..) Experiments took place about 1.5 months after quitting a year long fentanyl binge, so  my memories of opioid effects were still fresh..  Based on my experiences with other arylcyclohexylamines I did not expect it to have opioidergic effects but was pleasantly surprised a few minutes after taking the first 5mg.. Dissociative effects were also present.. So this was the first indication of opiodergic activity.. But I noticed something else which strengthened this idea.. Well I've actually got mild cravings when effects decreased and next morning right after waking up I felt and followed a strong urge to dose it again.. I have never experienced anything like this with any other dissociative I've tried and 3-MeO-PCP is my alltime favourite drug (along with LSD ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

if you know this is comming then you know it should be legit. I didn't really like 3 meo pce. DCK is boring and more expensive than ketamine. 3 meo pcp has it's uses, but I'd use it way less if I had some mxe or even O pce. I like O pce the best out of the newer dissos I think. Will be trying this 3 ho pce.

Ha, yeah. I see it now. Strange indeed. The last vendor who had it (the weak batch) was as reputable as the one who has it now, and I think some one had it independently tested too. lol, I guess we'll never get an explanation. Anyway, if it wasn't 3-Ho-PCE the last time, then it is this time for sure.

So where are the reports apart from the one in this thread? Am I just being too impatient? Usually it`s me taking the dive and rushing in,but I`m deciding to wait and see,so come on people get those trip reports in ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Did not feel much opioid activity at 5-10mg insufflated. Next time I'll try a 10mg measured oral dose.

Like in the 2-oxo-PCE thread : It felt like I took the same dosage of 3-meo-PCE. Maybe somewhat between 3-meo-PCP and 3-meo-PCE. Less motor inabilities with this one (than with MXP, Deschloroketamine, 2-oxo-PCE, 3-meo-PCE). At that dose at least. I guess in high doses it can get manic very fast (if it is more similar to 3-meo-PCP than to 3-meo-PCE, which I don't know.) What I know is, that - at least insufflated it is not ULTRA potent. Does not mean, that you can eyeball it if you are inexperienced @all the 14-17 years old bored kiddies reading this right now. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Thanks for your report Ziiirp. Maybe the opioid activity depends on the ROA, I often read that MXE sniffed has almost no opioid like feeling. Never sniffed MXE myself, but with oral ROA it feels a bit opioid for me.

If snorted at low doses (3-10mg) 3-ho-PCE feels like a cross between snorted 3-meo-PCE and 3-meo-PCP than it could be a really remarkable substance. As I wrote I could ride the bike to the grocery store (2 miles/3.3km away) and get the stuff I wanted without any motor difficulties or expressional difficulties. So fingers crossed, that it can be a 3-meo-PCP replacement in the low dose range.

We need different ROAs and atitration of doses,i believe that plugging is the most effective with most drugs and also sublingual. Good for doing the report.

I haven't tried it much yet but at 5 mg sublingual it had rather pleasant stimulant effects. It's a really chill stimulation, awake but not antsy. 


Something to note is this is the strongest flavored one of the new generation. It's like the scent of acetone coming up from under my tongue.

3-meo-pcp 5mg sub repeated, 3-meo-pce 25mg sub, o-pce 30mg oral, DCK 40mg oral, MXE 60mg oral. 


I would rate this one pretty high. After about 4 hours I felt like it had worn off. Something I noticed was an urge to redose similar to mxe, something I haven't noticed with the newer ones.

yeah, a shortish lasting one was missing in the current disso generation. 


I'm kind of concerned about the potential opiate activity. A dissociative drug with potential for µ-receptor associated withdrawal symptoms sounds like the most seductively destructive shit ever created.

I know this isn't science but it didn't have a opiate effect on my digestive track. I am usually pretty sensitive to that.


On duration: it seems like there is no afterglow, which is kinda disappointing but with no come down and only a minor urge to redose at 4h, I feel like it's a fine trade off. Will be doing IM mighty soon.

I thought all these analogs were that "kinda a clinical wonkiness but I don't know if I would call it a hole" mindset rather than a real hole?


That's my experience so far. I'll be doing an IM in the next couple days and that will probably determine it for me.

I actually experienced ego dissolution with 2-oxo-pce, if that's not a hole I don't know what it is. If by hole you are sctrictly refering to the k-hole experience, where for me is nearly imposible to recall anything from the experience afterwards because of the amnesia high ketamine doses bring to me, I would say they deliver something way better than that ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Oh, for sure high doses of 3meos can deliver confussion and wonkiness, but hard to call it a hole, I tried with 3-meo-pcp to reach that state without success. You are too stimulated and with your feet on the ground to be able to reach ego dissolution.

what are you experiences so far?


the short lasting aspect really wakes my interest, I am a K lover due to it's short duration (most people

seem to dislike K, for these reasons). Does this RC come anywhere close to the joy of K? Or even MXE?

It blows my mind that the synth got released, though we dont have any experience reports...


In case this compound has an opioid action: does it cause w/d's? I mean it should, when you're withdrawing from another opioid

Took a few bumps. Feels a lot like 3-meo-PCP IMHO. No opiate effects are felt even after 15-20 mg (taken spread out intranasally in the time window of 4 hours) but a little bit more couch lock (albeit the same amount of stimulation) and a much harsher comedown (could be attributed to bad nutrition that day, so take that one with a bit of salt or pepper, whatever you prefer) than with 3-meo-PCP are experienced.


I'm really interested in other opinions. To me it is a good competitor to 3-meo-PCP (at least a more capable one than 3-meo-PCE, which is too recreational vs. functional). I appreciate reports, that just involve solo use of this compound instead of combinations like in my cases (few beers but very spread out over the course of 6 hours).


Edit : Motor complications even less than with 3-meo-PCP. Actually this is the least motor function inhibiting disso I've taken.

This is very true for me. I have found the harsher come down to be useful in preventing frequent use.


 I have taken up to 17mg at once now. It was clinical like 3-meo-pcp but there was a little extra positivity. Kind of reminded me of Eth-LAD mindset in terms of positivity. 


I have a leg injury so the couch lock has proved useful. It is a fantastic painkiller as well.

Would you agree, that it is (one of) the least motor function distorting disso(s) ? I could ride the bike through the city and taking subways and trains without feeling intoxicated but as soon I sat down I was kind of helpless against the gravitation. Did not help, that I had a few beers and a puff from a spliff (the spliff was at t+30min, the beers at between t+2h and t+4h and later at t+8h)


But even after the spliff when I was in motion I could not perceive much alteration. I got a common route with the bike from one city train station to another one in record time without physical exotortion and later when I was home I could feel the comedown and I would say it was harsh (for a disso). Nevertheless even then no motor disabilities were felt.

For sure it has to be one of the least with impairing, on par with 3-meo-pcp. 


With a weakened leg, I am walking around pretty alright. Compared to K or O-PCE which I have had falls on both when my leg was bad.

how impairing is ketamine to you guys? o-pce made me unable to move, even when trying hard enough. I don't have a problem with ketamine

in regards to moving on it. My doses are as high as 250+mg, I got syringes ready but am kind of afraid of IMing to be honest.

No impairment of motor functions at 10-15 mg snorted. And until I sit down it is quite stimulating. When I sit down, the couch lock sets in.


All in all rather subtle effects, but in a positive way, more subtle than 3-meo-PCE. As said : Somewhere between 3-Meo-PCE and 3-Meo-PCP effects wise (in low non hole dose ... I'm not aiming for opioid effects so I keep it low and hopefully functionally).

2-Oxo-PCM : 3/10

2-Oxo-PCE : 8/10

3-Meo-PCP : 7/10

3-Meo-PCE : 6/10

3-Ho-PCE   : 6/10


(functional/euphoric) Stimulation :


MXP : 5/10

2-Oxo-PCM : 5/10

2-Oxo-PCE : 5/10

3-Meo-PCP : 9/10

3-Meo-PCE : 7/10

3-Ho-PCE   : 8/10


Dunno, I obviously forgot important characteristics, so this list is relatively useless. Maybe we can come up with better classifiers for the dissociative experience.

I'm surprised to see MXP as less sedating than 3-meo-PCE.

The question is where low doses end and medium (non-social) doses begin.


With medium/high doses of MXP I remember chilling around with many melancholic thoughts but never slept over it or anything. With 3-Meo-PCE it is possible to sleep during the experience, with MXP rather not. Hence the values.

So I gather this is another stimulating one? Someone else said it was about on par with DCK in terms of stimulation but that it was stimulating in a mental/euphoric way. People talk about stimulation and sedation with dissociatives in a really vague way. Is it stimulating like 3-meo-pcp in that it will significantly raise HR/BP and you won't be able to sleep or is it stimulating in a makes you feel good and want to do stuff way? And I still don't understand how so many dissociatives get tagged as being simultaneously stimulating and sedating. How does that work?

It has a lot to do with dosage, but some dissociatives are able to knock you flat on your ass and will not have you move an inch for the duration. These are generally considered "hole-friendly" and sedating. Others tend to induce hypomania for hours or days after the intoxication. If there is no full sensory shut-down as seen with k-holes, these after effects are probably considered the stimulating side of a dissociative.


In my experience, most dissociatives will eventually knock you onto your ass, but with those that require a high dosage it's tricky to find your sweet-spot where the experience can be considered a breakthrough without causing amnesia. Some dissocciatives can not be used this way because they will cause total amnesia at breakthrough doses.


MXP is generally considered very stimulating, but sensory shutoff doses can be extremely rewarding. I had one of the most spiritually profound dissociative experiences on MXP.

I guess what confuses me is that many dissociatives are stimulating in the traditional way. There is a strong correlation between physical stimulation and mania but not always. Ephenidine I found not very manic and also incredibly immersive for holes but it was quite stimulating in the traditional sense, like I had drank a good amount of coffee. If I was going to rate the different aspects of the dissociative experience I think I would break it up into the following categories:


Sensory distortion (mental landscapes, visuals, changes in propioception and sound, maybe anesthesia goes here?)

Cognitive disruption (the 'mind fuck' aspect, ego loss, disorganized thinking, confusion, etc.)

Mania ( feeling like you're on the verge of something big, or feeling motivated to do all sorts of different things)

Emotional detachment (that zen like feeling where you can objectively analyze yours and other people's lives)


Additionally I would rate things based on physical side effects, this is where I would talk about things such as CNS stimulation, nausea, ataxia, etc.


I guess there's always some vagueness when discussing subjective experience though.

Either way, if you want to hole, there is nothing like 2-Oxo-PCE on the market. I'd turn down racemic ketamine any day for that one. In fact, fuck ketamine.

Yepp. In fact I would call 2-Oxo-PCE the only true (pure) dissociative I've tried. The others would count as (semi-)functional ego detaching agents.


Back to 3-ho-PCE. Has some pretty harsh physical after effects (less so mentally in contrast to 3-meo-PCE). Body aches a bit and I'm feeling like in the pre-stage of a flu (which of course can actually be the case, mind the changing wheather and that I did a lot of sports outside the last days). But it feels more subtle. I also did not sleep well 7h after the last dose (in fact it was one dose, i.e. 10-12mg insufflated) but that can also be attributed to the fact, that I slept 90 min during the experience :D


The last few lines must have been the least helpful trip report ever. You are welcome %)


Otherwise I would still say, that this compound is the closest to 3-meo-PCP you can get. When 3-meo-PCE is more serotonergic and 3-meo-PCP is more dopaminergic, this one lies somewhere in between, but I could not feel much of the opioid properties. But it was nicely stimulating.

That's a shame, judging by the description that the vendor made of it and the doses he listed, I was expecting for a potent hole-friendly disso that could be better than 2-OxO-PCE ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

But it is just my subjective experience with low to medium dosages (and mind you insufflated, oral is usually stronger). I personally cannot imagine a compound, that puts you faster into the holey land than 2-Oxo-PCE.


The fact, that I did not perceive any (imho it is the least impairing) motor impairment at ~10-12mg insufflated is indeed a hint, that it is not as a strong NMDA antagonist as 2-oxo is.


And I have to add, that I remember, that 3-meo-PCP is more potent also. 1 or 2 mg snorted too much and you are welcome to Schizo-Mania-Land. (fortunately just for 30 min then it levels off if insufflated). Those incidents are less likely to happen with 3-ho-PCE imho based on my personal experience (though it is still ultra potent @ all the teenagers, that unknowingly try to accidentally kill themselves by eyeballing potent unknown drugs like this one --> SO READ THE WHOLE THREADS, maggots).

It is very similar to 3-meo-pcp. I have done IM, not rectal but I can say it was very similar to 3-meo-pcp IM so I would suspect the same for rectal. 


I would say this one is a must try for dissociative fans but regular users would be better off choosing from O-PCE and 3-meo-PCP/PCE.

I agree it was very similar to 3-meo-PCP but with less potential for a "whiteout". I could not feel opioid effects at 15mg insufflated until after I drank 2 cans of beer at t+2h. Then suprisingly I had very slurred speech and a harsh couch lock. Once I got up from the armchair it was okay again but I felt pretty tipsy by the 2 beers. So I decided to snort a tiny amount of RTI-111 (no safer use at all) and to my suprise it did not ruin the effects. It just got me awake without the typical side effects accompanied by that rather shitty stim (IMHO).


I'd say it feels exactly like 3-meo-PCP minus the dopaminergic push (perhaps there was an opioid push, that I did not realize? at least before drinking the beers).

I think some of the hallmark effects of dissociatives are often mistaken for being opioid. Just think MXE. didn't it turn out, that it was mostly a combination of serotonin reuptake inhibition and NMDA-antagonism that people mistook for "opiod effects"?

Good point. I never took MXE but could imagine just from the anecdotes, that 3-ho-PCE feels close to it (but more clinical and probably less sedating).


It is very functional, a bit manic, but not as dopaminergic as 3-meo-PCP and also not as serotonergic as 3-meo-PCE.


Oh and it totally misses (at least in low-medium doses) the floating feet effect I remember I got from 3-meo-PCP. Basically there is very little tactile change with 3-Ho-PCE.

This is a real same,i thought that maybe this one would be better than 2-oxo-pce,but by the sound of peoples experiences with this one it`s very similar to 3-meo-pcp...Just reading the trip reports it`s sounds mediocre at best,why take something that is just like 3-meo-pcp when you can take 3-meo-pcp?


I was waiting for a more lucid 2-oxo-pce with control,maybe this one would be good in combination with 2-oxo-pce,both taken in low doses. Oh well maybe a better arylcyclohexylamine will appear on the market that will shine like MXE (one day)

Advantages over 3-meo-PCP : It is slightly more manic and has almost no physical effects. Tested it at the late working hours in the office, and talked a lot of bullshit (thankfully nothing too morbid like usually on 3-meo-PCP) and in a good mood (did not get shit done,though). So I'd say it is slightly more social but should not be mixed with alcohol (beer).


Perhaos it is just a mislabeled 3-meo-PCP batch ? Usually the source is very accurate, ya diiiiig ?


But maybe youre right and it is just another 2-Oxo-mix-ingredient for the schizophrenic touch.

I can verify mine is not a mislabeled 3-meo-pcp batch because now I have done IM. It provided much different effects from IM 3-ho-pce vs 3-meo-pcp. The actually subjective effects seem to miss the... creativity I guess I would call it.  


The ho-pce actually did decrease resting bpm and blood ox levels. Make what you want of that. But I have done two trials and both show significant changes. Haven't started blood pressure monitoring yet. 


3-meo-pcp increases bpm and decreases blood ox. 3-ho-pce decreases bpm and decreases blood ox. In me.

Well I tried a couple small doses, less than 10mg rectal, it´s less stimulating or diss than 3-meo-pcp, cant pinpoint fx really, stoney, plastic tongue, no double vision,but what can be felt is some pain in the left side of the abdomen, happens with 3-meo-pcp too. still trying to figure what this could be useful for.

The more I read the worse it sounds,why on earth bring a crap chem on the market like this? Surely do your homework and bring something to the niche market (like we have with these chems)that has a positive effect and will bring the psychonaut back for more.


If I were to be a purveyor of arylcyclohexylamines then I would personally test all my products and only release those that blew me away.

I would assume a good reason to release ones that don't blow people away is there is less of a chance of abuse and less of a chance of problems. 


Think cannibinoids. They started out rather good and got really bad over a short period of time. Obviously that is just my random guess.

Well well well, finally my sample arrived ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


15mg taken orally on empty stomach, after 30-40min the first alerts begin.


After an hour not a lot was felt, some subtle stimulation and dissociation. Pretty similar to a 30mg dose of 3-MeO-PCE for me (Hardhead here, your dosages may and probably will vary!)


Will up my dosage to 25mg orally next time and see where that brings me.


So, it's like 3-meo-pce but stronger. Still doesn't worths the current price IMHO beeing available 3-MeO-PCP/PCE and 2-OxO-PCE, if not for just crossing another disso from your list.


I think the vendor exaggerated a bit about the insane potency and opioid effects.


Edit: A weed joint at +1h:30min feels like smoking psychedelic crack. Anxiety ups a bit, but I'm all sure all of this is because I'm not smoking more than 1-2 joints a month since December, and this kicks me hard even when not combining it with anything else. I'm adding 1ml of GBL to smooth the edges a bit.

OOh ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) let us know


Psychedelic crack with the joint.. sounds familiar x)


The reported #-(alkyl/alkyloxy/hydroxyl)-pcx opioid effects is with 4-HO-PCE, 4-HO-PCP i think compared to others (can find on this forum)


Then again I dont know, it seems like , and this might sound too far out, the molecule specifically locks into the opiate receptors in a special way that re configures it into a more functional form, compared to morphine, and whatever other 'traditional' opioids, of which i have used copious amounts over the years, and after a so-called 'extended break', and then going back to #-(alkyl/hydroxyl/keto)-pcx compunds, it feels like the tolerance and all the 'neurotoxic' (psychosomatically unreliable) effects have been reset


 definitely digging it though


just licked the plate clean of my 2-oxo-pcm :D :D :D waiting on this 3-meo-pce

Because if you look at a molecule, say (again i like this one so i keep referencing it ) 2-oxo-pcm, or even just putting plain non-ketone pcm, and then compare it to methamphetamine, or compare it to n-methyl-a-ethylbenzylamine (not sure if this is the best IUPAC name or even a standardized name but the only other one is the most standard IUPAC name i could find which is kind of unreliable in terms of others being able to search and reference it, if so inclined)--(btw, a common meth cut...) it quickly becomes something to inquire about, because the only difference is that pcm has the alpha-benzyl attachment but that completely reorganizes it's 3d structure and lowest eenergy conformation (IDK if this is the right term but with a simple google will be able to find what i mean)


Very trippy


I am kind of spread out thin now but will check back later to see your reflections about it x)

Dunno. Don't find it stronger than 3-Meo-PCE serotonine wise (euphoria, recreational aspects). It is still very clinical but not as much clean as 3-Meo-PCP and not as much fun as 3-Meo-PCE. So it is a weird one. And the weirdest aspect is, that it causes next to no motor function changes. IMHO this one is dangerously subtle and could lead to uncontrolled redosing in uncontrolled settings.

Yeah, but then the opioid effects (which I did not consciously perceived) could fuck you up big time ... after numerous redoses.

Well, I finally fell asleep at +2h:30 into the experience because of GBL xD That weed joint fucked me up pretty bad, but cannabis is doing this to me lately the few times per month I smoke, so that was expected.


Next time I'll go for 25mg orally and try to not mix with anything else, hope I can give a more detailed revision in the near future ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

After the first sample which sparked off this thread I acquired some more.


It's a very interesting substance, especially in how peoples responses vary.


For me the best experience I had with it was when I just ate ~25 mg in one go after a low dose (~15 mg) 4-aco-dmt trip. The cevs returned and I slowly drifted of to sleep while watching an infinite line of boxes getting loaded from one conveyor belt to the other.


Really a hard one to pin down imo. I wish they make 3-ho-2'oxo-pce (hxe? would be some kind of mxe analog), 3-meo-pcpy (a sedating 3-meo ach? Well I'm interested) or 3-meo-2'oxo-pcpr (mxpr? another mxe analog) next.

There is so much still to be researched when talking about dissos... I wish they synthed 2-oxo-pcp, beeing 2-oxo-pce so different from 2-oxo-pcm, and usually beeing PCE analogs less potent than their PCP counterpant, I only can imagine 2-oxo-pcp as a very potent chemical with holing potential.

I heard from someone/somewhere (can't remember the source anymore), in response to the question "why aren't they making MXP (3-meo-2-oxo-pcp, the PCP analogue of MXE)", that it's because it's extremely difficult or perhaps impossible, whereas it's not too difficult to make MXE.  So maybe it's also really difficult or impossible to make 2-oxo-pcp?  Just speculating.  But it does seem like if those two could be made feasibly, they would.  After all, they did make MXM, and 2-OXO-PCM (but not 3-MeO-PCM whereas they did make 3-MeO-PCP, which is by far the most available 3-MeO).  So whodafuck knows...

10mg IM with oral cannabis taken an hour before hand and four hours in produced very very euphoric effects for me. Did this after a two day smoking break and it involved a good hour of laughing very hard with the girlfriend. 


To me this one has a better trip than 3-meo-PCE. I don't much care for the sour mood that both of them seem to give me the next day. It's not bad but I prefer 3-meo-pcp for a similar high. I don't find this one productive.

I would guess too much steric hindrance from the two bulky groups attached to the cyclohexane to efficiently substitute in the second carbon. Well, I don't know anything about ACHAs synthesis, but I would guess that maybe they would actually start from cyclohexanone. Still,  getting the two significantly sized piperidine and phenyl groups in the ortho position of the carbonyl would have a miserable yield.


I concur though, that if would be possible to get it it would probably be pretty potent and purely dissociating in effects.

They do synth 2-oxo-pcp, 4-ho-pcp hell 3-oxo-2-meo-pcp any and everything you just need to find a number/email businessman connect of a country with laxer laws but booming petrochemical industry, and they would synth any and everything for you for the right price, and minimum orders are on the scale of 100-1000x times the minimum what you could buy from a end-user broker. There's also people on this forum that have synthed things like 4-ho-pcp for personal use amongst a bunch of other analogs (i forget but it was a guy that was from north/northeast europe - search function is our friend ^.^)


The chemicals we see listed on stuff like darkweb, overseas clearnet sites selling half grams and whatnot are literally just the ones that have brought the most hype and seemed like a good business investment for the broker to list/have in stock

I asked about the PCP version of mxe a long time ago and that's the more or less the answer I got. The synthesis would be hard / impossible. 


But the PCPr version of mxe shouldn't have the same issues imo and if the scarce reports on 3-meo-pcpr are anything to go by it is quite similar to 3-meo-pce and only slightly less potent so by that logic MXPr (3-meo-2'oxo-pcpr) should work. Of course that's the same logic that brought us 2-meo-2'oxo-pcm (2-meo-dck or whatever you want to call it) and 2-Cl-2'oxo-pce (or nenk) which were both disappointing so that logic might be wrong.

^Lmao. I know right!! Haha ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) dissociatives are super enjoyable if one is in the right mindset, but very quickly become too compulsive and mentally toxic. Causes a overflow of dopamine in some(most?) people, some individuals' mind/brain can handle it others can't and it breaks permanently. Its really wild to see some of the effects even relatively easy-going stuff like s-ket and s-deschloroket has on peoples minds when abused

It really is a novelty drug that isn't that novel. That's the best way for me to describe it.


I feel that it is more for the "gotta try them all" types.

Oh the theoretical value, is it?

Please keep thinking for yourselves...


Novel ones can be interesting, but not just by default.

I mean there is a super big positive. I'm not dissociated when I wake up in the morning unlike the 3-meo's or O-pce/DCK. All of those have much longer lingering effects but it's nice to wake up and feel sober once in awhile.

Hmm yes, but the residual stimulation is strongest with that one. I think the overall stimulation lasts ~12h even with small insufflated doses.

It was about 9 hours with IM, which I found odd because 3-meo-pcp only usually keeps me up about 8 with IM. I thought it would be shorter.

Maybe something about tissue distribution, lipophilicity, neurogenic effects / afterglow etc etc etc causing the lack of symmetry and differences in durations

The vendor shared this recently about the product:

> 
> Independent laboratory research has shown the following:

> While the feedback is overally very positive, we recently had a complaint about it from one customer.
> 
> As it turned out, the research was done by oral administration and effects were very weak.

I worry about this drug. Dissociatives are compulsively more-ish for many people, greatly impair judgement and thois one may have strong opioid effects, thus respoiratory arrest risk. Crossing a dissociative with an opioid effect is very hardcore, and not necessarily in a good way. Moreover, bioavailability and/or susceptability may be in a wide range. With arylcyclohexylamines i'm really dr. tryitall but this is the first one I feel reluctant to trailblaze with.

IDK no one except the intial release company has said it has opioid effects. The same thing was speculated about 3-HO-PCP but wasn't really reported much in the TR's(limited as they were...). If it's not something that's in your face I don't think it would be to much of a problem. Possibly more reinforcing I'm sure. We have stimulating disscociatives which I'm sure is reinforcement for some. You also have to think of many possibilities. We might think respiratory depression is a risk obviously but there are some of the odd opioids that relevant to potency don't have much respiratory depression. If it causes WD effects that would be bad. Its potency as an opioid might not even be that high relevant to the dissociative dose. It's pretty unknown territory. So many variables for this it's hard to determine to much without any real data points to plot....

It's the 4-HO-PCP that had reported low dose opioid effects. Then again, there is mu opioid agonism and then there is kappa, mxe is said to be a kappa receptor modulator, same with buprenorphine, and I know that personally in the past I have enjoyed their effects for that same(but in a strange way inversely modulating of that receptor), effect. Very interesting (take that with a grain of salt, I don't mean interesting to ingest necessarily just interesting to study). Hopefully more officially sanctioned medical and scientific research is done into these compounds in the near future.

I don´t buy the opiod effects nor for one moment. The oral bioavailability or not could be interesting, I guess we will know for sure in no time. My guess is that oral works perfectly

^I almost feel like people could have been saying that unconfirmed rumor because it reminded them of the calming effects of opiates... oxycodone morphine (a heroin and 6-mam metabolite) etc have kappa effects too i believe... and then the vendors could be perpetuating that rumor because it hypes people looking for a relief from their opiate abuse with something cheaper to buy and use it. Not everyone enjoys dissociatives, especially people in active opiate addiction I've found and seen, something about it makes them completely stray away from it or not feel it at all (I once gave some 99% confirmed mxe to my old heroin dealer... like a small key bump perhaps not more than 25-30mg but still enough to feel SOMETHING for even me as a permatoleranced ketaset/mxe-head...but hung out with him and his girlfriend for the rest of the night to see how he would do, becaues I was trying to give him an alternative to the black tar heroin he was stuck with selling to fund his massive habit (2-3 grams of near pure) - it didn't work for him at all, like, not one effect felt whatsoever (at least by what he reported, however, if you ask me, he seemed a little spaced out and not reaching for his foil as often as usual)

Two fridays back, at night, after the whole day snorting a lot of ketamine (permatolerance made this day just a soft disso-journey, but I easily dosed half a gram total), I proceeded to eat 20mg of 3-ho-pce and go to a folk & punk concert...  I enjoyed myself a lot dancing like a madman, even managed to drink two beers and smoke some weed.   I really, really, couldn't distinguish it from a medium dose of 3-meo-pce at this dosage (Keep in mind my permatolerance, and previous ketamine snorting session), maybe a bit less stimulant... I'll titrate to 25mg and combine with a tryptamine or lysergamide soon, and see where this goes ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I would say it is more dopaminergic and less serotonergic than 3-meo-PCE. Between 3-meo-PCE and 3-meo-PCP stimulant wise. But the length of the stimulation is longer with this one IME (maybe more lipophilic)

Procured a sample of this, will attempt it later tonight. From what I'm gathering from this thread oral bioavailability is ... variable ? I'm gonna try 10 mg sublingual I think, nose is a bit stuffy for insufflation. I'll have a report if it's a strong enough experience.

Hello everyone! Just to check, is anyone aware of any independently-confirmed analytic reports on this compound? If so, I would greatly appreciate a link (or three). 


For context, I am a PsychonautWiki administrator who is currently looking to cover this compound on our site; we were actually on the verge of releasing it when it first came out but decided to sit on it until we had more reports to go on, due to potentially novel risks. And yes, I am well aware of the reputation of the vendor, I think I may have been the first to get their RTI-111/Dichloropane independently NMR-verified when they released it, courtesy of a famous Bluelighter ;-) 


So far this one seems to be difficult to distinguish from 3-MeO-PCE and such. Not quite sure what to make of it. 


Cheers, 


Clarity

  Hi Clarity, Fancy seeing you here!  small world it would seem!  I have submitted a request for the vendor's nmr results.   I am trying to decide if I should send a sample to ED or EC.  I don't have a lot of material, and the requirements of each will diminish my sample quite a lot at this point.  I am based in the US, and ED is fairly expensive when testing research chemicals, too.   I may have a lead on another testing facility...  anyhow, I've got some data to ref.

I forgot to get back too this

Did 10 mg subling + 4-6 mg subling later on

This is certainly one of the oddest dissociatives I have ever taken. I can say for myself, with the sample I obtained, the effects are markedly different from anything else. 

I would say the headspace is almost exactly the same as O-PCE, just a total flattening of affect and emotion, turning me into a glassy cold robot. Yet there are almost no bodily effects, the bodily effects I would compare to a light dose of 3-MeO-PCP, just a slight numbness. Could not find myself able to sink into any sort of hole, it was just a sort of uncomfortable and dull experience that I didn't feel like I gained anything from. This compound is interesting in its novelty, its truly unlike anything else I've tasted, it barely feels like a dissociative, it's its own sort of high, but not even a high, just a purely neutral alteration. I don't think this experience was good for a report as I was just testing the waters and in the midst of a nasty cold. Future trials pending in more controlled settings, will likely do 15 mg insufflated. There are not really any visual effects, no psychedelia or color, just overwhelming pure grey glacial and monolithic mental dissociation, unlike anything else I've tasted thus far. I've never felt so just... inhuman, but it wasn't in an interesting way that could dissected philosophically, it just just a great neutral impassable wall between my emotions and my thoughts. 


Controlled trials pending + a full timestamped report after that, though I am not necessarily eager to explore with this one. Maybe on a rainy day.

Very interesting description -- the way you described it almost gives me the impression it would be a mOR antagonist if it does have anything to do with mOR receptors. I would _love_ to see a full timestamped controlled trial report on this when you get around to it. Will make me feel a lot more comfortable with proceeding with coverage on this. Please feel free to message me or submit it to PsychonautWiki if you get a chance :D


@Lunch-clunge, what's up dude! And yeah, I can sympathize with the difficulties of getting new chemicals properly tested. I am emailing EC today to *hopefully* work something out (another one of our users recently got a sample of darknet "bromo-dragonFLY" which I am suspicious of, though I suppose it could just be old stock if not just DOB or something lol. It will be problematic if it goes into/already is in production again though; I would like our readers to know if this is the case, but I digress...). Please keep me up to date on which testing service you do decide to go with though. I'll let you know how EC responds. Also open to an ED analytic report, ofc, but I was under the impression EC might be a better bet in terms of their technical capacities. I might be wrong on that though. If anyone has any ideas for alternative testing venues (ideally best suited for someone based in the US) that would be great!

I unfortunately lost all the notes from that experience/ I do not feel like it was a proper trip from baseline anyways because I was very sick

Was just testing the waters I suppose.

I may possibly be running another experiment tonight, 15 mg insufflated, if all goes well, a full timestamped report should be up in a little over week or so

Here are the notes from the experience if anyone wants to see the raw data, 10 mg insufflated + 10 mg insufflated at T1:00

Kinda boring

I'm still cruising a bit, but it seems to be pretty short acting. Overall underwhelming. 

Once I've reflected on it properly I'll turn these notes into a full flowery coherent report


<details>
<summary>notes</summary>


Dose: 10 mg insufflated + 10 mg insufflatedDose time: 8:30 PM


T0:00-Insufflated, similar acrid petroleum flavor to 3-MeO-PCE, but does not sting very much

T0:13-Onset, feeling a tad lightheaded

T0:24-Feeling light and heavy simultaneously

T1:00-Not feeling much, another 10 mg insufflated, things appear to be buzzing, horizontal lines appear across my vision, I feel like I may haev made a grave error

T1:30-Smoke cannabis, go outside, feeling a bit distant

T1:40-Feeling substantially more dissociated, I am in my own little bubble no visual effects to speak of except a sort of flashing

faint diamond patterns

Eyes closed is clear visuals of memories from the day

Closed eyed visuals are liike short video clips

It feels like two bulges are pulsing on either side of my field of vision

I feel like I am a head with tentacles hanging down, my extremities are numb but that's the only bodily effect. Very gentle, getting tracers in my vision

T2:00-I cannot feel my fingertips which is odd. I fel grainy, like I am dissolving and fading away

I feel couchlocked, Like I don't want to move, but I dont reallly feel anesthetized or physically dissociated

very clear headed, things seem weird in an indescribable way.

Feeling a weird and very slight buzziness in my head everything feels fuzzy and grainy to the toucuh, 

T2:15 I feel like  I am made of sand

I feel like my head is sliding arouund

My head feels heavy, it feels like it is sinking into itself in 3 dimensions

I close my eyes and my head is pulsing

im sandy and grainy

its like my head is being squeezed

everything seems like its made of vapor, everything seems ethereal and to be drifting around me

Overall, it is very mild

it feels like something is wrapped around my head

I most of all though, feel like a different person

this drug is dangerous, it slowly and subtly assassinates me, seperates me from myself in the most subtle way and creates a new self that is entirely yet not noticeably different

it changes behavior above all else

I must be careful when I interact with people on ths substance, it has substituted me with someone else and I am not sure exactly how.

even my tongue feels numb

I am a weird and different person trapped inside of a sphere

T4:00-Definitely feel like I am coming down, only really feel a faintness in the extremities and the feeling of tightness around my head

T4:30-Mostly back to baseline except my head feels heavy and there's still a bit of numbness

This should not be abused (in fact no drug should be). In comparison to 3-meo-PCP/PCE, it has much more undesirable effects than the former, when taken 2 days in a row, like for instance :


- mood swings (aggressiveness, that only tends to reveal itself after the the 2nd day in a row)

- strong stimulation

- muscle tensions

- subtleness (in regard to the dissociation) that leads one to forget, that she/he has taken something


I like it for once in a while, but better don't fuck with this substance (as you can with 3-Meo-PCE/PCP).

  my bad, i misread your post.  it's interesting that your experience was so different than mine, or the others i know have tested it.  most particularly the section where you say it is dangerous and creates a second self.  I found it to be quite therapeutic for my pain, while not really giving me that lost self or confusion many of the other dissociatives do, which I am assuming is similar to what you described.

I also don't see the usage for this compound. when opening my disso stash I would usually take 2-oxo-pce/pcm or 3-meo-pcp/pce before this. I tried it three times from 10mg to 30mg and was very disapointed. maybe upping up the dose or combining with a psych would do the trick

I agree partially. It is not particularly remarkable in any sense, but it can at least used functionally at a low enough dose in contrast to 2-oxo-pce/pcm or 3-meo-pce.

I think that it is quite remarkable in that it does not seem to linger, and it's lower incidence of noted side effects make me want to push it to a pharmaceutical level.  I really think it could be very effective in a number of emergency settings, and in pain control, instead of opioids.  5 hours and back to baseline? Not even ketamine can claim that!

Yes, I didnt try it but the more I read, the more it looks to me that this on could be the most useful dissociative for therapeutic use.

Like to be taken after a trauma, or just as an exemple, your GF left you, what do you take to numb the pain? benzo, opioids, alcool, all thoses lead to long term trouble and make you more or less non-fonctional.

3-HO-PCE look like it could do the job, and it is not seductive so you can stop it when things go better.

  K left me a little linger.  this is truly baseline, no weird wobblies, nothing.   maybe a gentle mood lift for a few days, but really understated as compared to K.

I abused the shit out of that compound the last days (rather low doses, functionally) and I must admit, if I had used 3-Meo-PCE/PCP or 2-Oxo-PCE or 3-HO-PCP in that manner I would be in the psych ward right now.


So I am pretty positive, that this compound is the most functionally useful disso around. I cannot comment on longterm side effects, unfortunately.

Yeah, this, ketamine and 2-OxO-PCM, I can take them without worrying about working the next day because I can abuse them without any bad shorterm side effects.

High MXP doses made me hole more than once. Talking half a gram IV or something if I recall correctly. Got at least one report up here. A force to be reckoned with. By far one of the most psychedelic and alas psychotomimetic dissociatives I've used.

**Any new reports of 3-ho-pce?**


Are there any other experience reports?     This chem I feel holds true promise and I really would like to hear from more people.     my findings are this so far:       


- 4.5-5hr from start to finish
- Mild, if any, hr and bp elevation
- no resp. depression
- i have not observed any psychological incidents (psychosis, mania, compulsive harmful behaviors) with any of the people who have tried the batch I have.
- I have not observed any greater or lesser insomnia
- there is a lower incidence of heavy sweating than on 3-meo-pce
- there is a lower incidence of dry mouth than with DCK, or 2F-Ketamine.
- There is a lower incidence of abdominal issues (nausea, consitpation, etc)
- There is a higher incidence of meal skipping
- the potency seems to be close to that of 3-meo-pcp, mg/kg, at least in my experiments
- a therapeutic dose for me, 85kg with disso tolerance has been around 25-30mg.
   In summation, if you're looking to "get wet", this isn't the chem.  If you suffer from chronic pain, and are reticent to take opioids (as most should be) this could be helpful as an adjunct to non-opioid acute pain management

I agree to lunch-clunge's test results. It is pretty functional. No other disso is suited for a professional environment (that is not related to mainly entertaining creative output). I kind of overdosed today at work and I hope only few people could get my alteration. I think the subtleness regarding the effects to one's senses leads onesself into thinking, that others don't get, that, that your perception is heavily altered.


The main problem at work is, if you speak in a foreign language by default and forget all the vocabulary on that disso, although you are usually much more expressive. That is one downside. Otherwise it is funny (condolences to anyone who has to go through drug tests at work ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)).

No, I dont know what you mean (seriously). As long, as you dont fuck up the dose (which can of course happen), you'll be safe.


Have to repeat myself : I never would try psychs/dissos at work, when people's life lay on the line.

Okay, though I stopped trying to use dissos functionally in a formal non-creative professional environment because it is a waste of substance and time. Even though 3-HO-PCE is the only disso I know, with which the probabilty to fuck up your reputation/professional relationships not >70%.

Put on 2mg allergy test oral, and circa 5mg rectal 10 mins ago. Very very nice energy. PCE magic for sure, but has 

some aloofness, minty friendly breeze in it. We'll see where it goes (edit, on tops of some beer and moderate (for me) O-PCM/E doses 

throughout the day)


Added the next day. : finished the init experiment some O=PCE and joint. The distinctive effect of 3-HO lingered throughout

however. I haven't tried 3-MeO-PCE, but this is what I might imagine or expect it to be: A very static, overarching and balancing 

feeling reminiscent of 3-MeO-PCP, which in a rather similar way evokes states of, well "stonedness". I also intuit it as a masculine 

presence, a trait that it shares with the 3-meo-pcp. Other give me a feminine vibe. Put that in your science books and smoke it.


But it, ahem, he doesn't does not have the down-to-earthiness of 3-meo-pcp. Instead, he has a jovial air, displaying PCE-

"warmth from the distance". This is strong and a subtle one. Tread with care,


Added some days later: I've now had tested this a couple of times, both by itself and in combo with O-PCE <10mg rectal doses. 

This is really a strange chemical, I don't know what to think of it. Even physically it is odd. It does not dissolve well in water and 

it smells (impurity?). It has this "stoning" quality that is very distinctive, but so far it has not led me anywhere, whereas with 

other ACH's there is a kind of progressive encounter.. The combination with O-PCE produced a state of total indifference reminiscent 

of poppy tea, so maybe there is something in the story about opioid quality? Going to research this more, in particular the oral route 

at some point.

All or at least most phenols (compounds with HO-groups on benzene rings) are smelly and have a similar kind of smell. 3-HO-PCE smells similar to 3-HO-PCP and ODT, that's normal.

Can anybody comment on their favourite ROA for 3-HO-PCE?

I'm especially interested in the rectal ROA and also wondering if anybody tried to IM this substance.

I've sampled that "original" 3-HO-PCE too, that was pretty underwhelming yet did it have a very nice stoneing effect, just that I went through half of that 50mg vial to get an effect and it was much too expensive for that. That vendor was usually relieable but what does this mean anyways... 


Would try this one for sure if I happen to get a source for it. (I have to try just any of these delicious arylcyclohexylamines I can get my hands on, as long as it's pure and well synthed..) My tolerance makes it somewhat safe for one, but me also not the best lab animal to estimate effects from.. I can do literally 500mg of MXE in a day without holing. Don't know a way around that yet. But Disso's are also cool without holing and for that, I don't need that much.. thankfully this is different from opioids..

I didn't have my hopes set high for this after reading through this thread. After a 1mg allergy test I insufflated 20mgs and proceeded to walk across town to drop off some paperwork and was pleasantly surprised by some warm, clearheaded dissociation. This stuff is quite nice with no tolerance.

Yeah, although I haven' t tried the old batch, I can confirm that the current batch (at least here in Europe) is pretty nice, especially in social settings. In low dose range the effects are subtle, but perfect for socializing.

I want to see the MXPr so badly...


This one seemed to get really lackluster reviews at first but lately people seem to like it.  Hopefully I'll give it a try sometime but I'm sort of on a break from dissos.  Not really on purpose but there were a few years where I was dosing MXE 3 times a week and then like 1.5 years of 3-MeO-PCP almost daily in low doses.  Can't be good so I haven't had any in quite some time.

What's everyone's favored RoA with 3-HO-PCE? I have a batch of 3-HO-PCP and my trials with oral dosing haven't really produced the effects I wanted. I also really need to get this batch tested, but I don't currently have the money to spare to send it to EnergyControl.

I consider myself an experienced user of various dissociatives including DXM and about 3 RC's (K-holes with ketamine being my favourite).  In the past I've managed to injure myself after too much 3-MeO-PCP (must have gone manic but can't remember) and am now stepping cautiously with 3-HO-PCE.


There's some strong warnings about redosing (more so with 3-HO-PCE than other disso I think) and I always keep a notepad with a record of time/dose. Doesn't mean I can't over do it but it helps to keep things in perspective (almost all the time anyway).


On first try of 3-HO-PCE yesterday, I did 7.5 mg x 2, 50 minutes apart (all oral ROA). Result was underwelming but pleasant, mild dissociation.

Today, I started about 2 hours after smoking weed and as I've found weed + dissociative can send make whole brain crazily overloaded I mix cautiously.


[Psychonautwiki says](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-HO-PCE):


> Strong 15 - 25 mg
> 
> Heavy 25 mg +
> 
> Redosing may result in dangerous cumulative effects.

> Click to expand...


I've done 7.5 mg, then 7.5 mg at T+40 and T+90 (22.5 mg total).  What's the issue or risk with continuing such cautious redosing (given that the effects remain mild)?


Should I just have a day or two off it then up the game to doing 15 mgs increments?


I know everyone reacts to things differently but any advice or feedback would be appreciated!   ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

3-HO-PCE had a heart load for me. Everything seemed to go relatively smooth for a dopey substance, creativity-enhancing even, until on the comedown it became clear that I must have been red-lining all the time. Peculiar pain-killing properties I suppose. They've scared me away from it.


So keep in mind that the gradual adjustment you can do with other dissociatives might not work as well with this one. Bill gets presented at comedown.

The initial reports of this werfe pretty unanimously "meh", where people said they weren't even sure what it was doing, it seemed weak, etc.  But then the reports seemed to change to view it much more favorably, it makes me wonder if the first batch just wasn't very well-made?  I haven't tried it, though I have experience with 3-MeO-PCP, 3-HO-PCP, and 3-MeO-PCE.

Had the traffic thing with MDMA. Never with dissos though.. though there's the rare dissociative fugue state in which anything is possible.


Also, been confusing 3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCE again here. Please disregard past comments.

^ And here I've been confusing MeO and HO.. jeez.. that's too much confusion. Might have to clean out all relevant posts one day, this is becoming a pattern of unintentional misinformation.


Anyway, duly sampling 3-HO-PCE at the moment (double-checked). It's slow in effect, even rectally. It's somewhat dull, but pleasantly centered. During the come-up it has some of that weird warmth MXPr has that MXE hadn't, but that seems to be declining as it nears plateau.

Testing 40mg rectally with tolerance at the moment. It does otherwordly things to familiar sounds.


I'm surprised I missed this one before. Might undercut MXPr in potency/efficiency ratio... once I can do math again..

It creeps up, so if  one were to redose , a very questionable (dangerous) roller coaster could follow.


Luckily everyone on this end is safe. :D


Also as a note, the feeling with ~2-5mg is very manageable, and was enjoyable enough to cause a desire for more. (And it takes a long time to feel the full effects, 


Due to this make sure to start with the amount you want (weighed out)


-and until you are very familiar with its effects (multiple controlled uses over multiple days), make sure not to consume more than your initial dose in any single day).


Also, if you’re a first timer and plan on trying a dosage in the “strong” range (20mg or more) I would greatly recommend a trip sitter.


If you are unfamiliar with dissos like this, I would recommend a trip sitter at any dose, (due to the fairly likely hypermania, and lesser possibility of full blown mania)

Individually, the 3-HO-PCx weren't remarkable for me. 3-HO-PCP was a bit too cold & distant. 3-HO-PCE was somewhat superficial.


Decided to combo them. Sniffed 4mg 3-HO-PCP+6mg 3-HO-PCE and at 2 hours in I boosted with doses similar to the initial one. It was stronger & more immersive than I expected. They play really well together. Everything became very intriguing, & it was relaxing & euphoric. A gilded dissociation.


Generally I think dissociative combos are unnecessary, but I would actually prefer these in tandem going forward, rather than in isolation.

I haven't tried it, though I have experience with 3-MeO-PCP, 3-HO-PCP, and 3-MeO-PCE.

Iirc, the first batch of 3-HO-PCE was either fake or highly impure. From what I've read, no one got any worthwhile effects and it took until another batch was being sold before anyone reported worthwhile or even dissociative effects. My guess is the synthesis failed and they decided to sell it anyway, but I don't know for sure.

I thought I'd share my 2 cents when it comes to 3-HO-PCE...


I'm not a huge disso guy...


I love ketamine, and loved methoxetamine.... had several DXM experiences when I was much younger, but never dived into the RC disso scene until I bought 500mg of 3-HO-PCE.


I went through the whole 500mg over the course of a month.


When I started I was just messing around, 10mg here and there in combination with other drugs. I kinda liked it. Numbness, wobblyness, kinda added to other drugs and made it more interesting.


I started combining it with ketamine which was quite interesting, but nothing spectacular.


I did it by itself in the 20-30mg range with a few beers and weed a couple of times and was NOT impressed. I can only describe it as "boring" and "weird".


Anwyays, I didn't pay it much attention for awhile. Then I ran out of my main drugs, which I was quite heavy into.


After going through several grams of ketamine I was also going through heroin withdrawal at the same time, and had no other drugs, so foolishly I eyeballed about 50 mg of 3-HO-PCE and snorted away. (Honestly it was probably closer to 75mg now that I think about it, I didn't weigh it so I will never know)


I thought, because of the several grams of K I went thru, I must have a huge disso tolerance... Big mistake....


I got uncomfortably high, could hardly stand or move without falling and acting like a drunken asshole. Hallucinations were quite strong, but not the same as LSD or any traditional psychedelic. More like extremely strong visual distortions. Nothing fractal.


Body completely numb, tactile hallucinations, extreme psychological distress...


I was manic and having a borderline psychotic episode. I kept having suicidal thoughts, or more accurately, the idea of "kill yourself" over and over in my head. It was absolutely horrible. This was during the last stages of a heroin withdrawal. Stupid, I know.


All I could do was lay, and sometimes flail, around in bed for 6-8 hours until it passed, and finally it did.


I threw the remaining ~100mg out... not my cup of tea.


Overall, I think 3-HO-PCE is "interesting" at best, and not something I will ever buy again. It was unique in adding to experiences of other drugs, but by itself it is not euphoric at all, and quite boring tbh...

I'm sure I've been sold some of these compounds you all mention but the dealers told me it's Ketamine, its happened 3 fucking times, 5 if you include another batch that was like K only small crystaline powder and not as strong, slightly different feel


Well the other batches was slightly dissociative but caused fast heart and on edge feeling, like caffeine and an RC mixed together 


One batch I had 4 small bumps, slight dissociative and the I passed out but not in a K hole, legit unconscious 


When I came too I could still feel it, I couldn't even type a text for another few hours and couldn't sleep that night and I took it at 3pm,


Next day as was depressed as fuck, weird! 


It wasn't nice, I want to know what it was but I flushed 2 grams down the sink after I woke up from passing out I barely remember flushing it, wish I knew about wedinos then lol


Fucking K dealers selling me this at K


Why do people do this stuff knstrad if just buying ketamine, is it any better than proper K? 


Even MXE wasn't as good as K for me

For me I've always had a better time with MXE than with K personally, but probably can attribute that to street quality and things like that. Any pharma K I've had has been good I just dislike the short duration I guess and have had more hole type experiences on MXE. 


But I'm test driving 3hopce today. W/ disso tolerance.


12:30pm started with 9mg nasally

2pm took another 11mg nasally


It's now nearly 3pm and my first thoughts are kinda similar to what others have said. This stuff feels pleasant, and it's not as potent by weight as I thought it would be, but it's not quite as euphoric as other dissos are for me. Feels very neutral. But still good. Don't feel any mania, and I'm naturally a manic person.


The bodily effects are a lot less than I would expect. I feel good but not super scatter brained or dissociated in particular. 


Not planning on redosing with this today, but might be seeing how 2fdck plays with it a few hours from now.

I keep reading about these other dissociatives on here, I love my K but I also am tempted to try one of these other dissociatives I keep hearing about but I don't know where to even start?


I want to feel trippy, and hole like K, no stimulation, no fast heart or anything, basically like ketamine or MXE lol

What's the most similar to K or MXE out of


3-HO-PCE

3-HO-PCP

3-MEO-PCE

3-MEO-PCP

2-FDCK

DCK

O-PCE

MXPr


The first 2 have an ambulance at the top of Psyconaut Wiki that can't be good lol, causes mania, delusions and psychosis


So those are a no from me lol, I did look at the others but I can't seem to take in the info, then I forget whats what, so maybe if I ask you lot on here then by the time I get paid I'll have all the info I need so I can chose the best one


I think doing such tiny doses will be weird though as I normally rack up huge lines and snort away a gram lol

Of this list I've tried:


3hopce

3meopcp

2fdck

Mxpr

Mxe, pcp, and k as well


Imo, the one that is most similar to K would be 2fdck from my experience, as it's just ketamine with fluorine instead of chlorine. I've had good experiences with it recently. 


Dosage range is still similar to K. Not sure if I've "holed" yet but I've gotten close and it is sedating for me. It is remarkably pleasant, euphoric, pretty visuals, bright, emotional, etc. Keep in mind my experiences of late are also colored with m-amp use so ymmv. 


I'm trying 3hopce today for the first time and it is cool but not properly sedating or dissociative as I thought it would be. 


I'm about to drop 2fdck on top of this party probably sometime today so maybe I'll let you know how that goes.

Not that much like it, no.  There are some similarities but a lot of differences.  MXPr is good but it's no MXE.  I have heard some reports of very high dosages being really insane and a few people who did so said they liked it better, but I haven't personally experienced anything like MXE on it.

Is 2fdck little tiny crystals, like a course powder, but still crystally, a bit like salt? I had some of that sold to me as K, but I knew it wasn't K even though it felt similar, something about it was off?

My stuff is crystally. I personally have become fond of 2f-dck, its very clear and straightforward, there isn't a lot of mindfuckery but it just feels nice. I have at this point hoovered quite a bit over the previous day, I like it for its simplistic beauty but it isn't overly sedating or powerful. My partner tends to agree. Idk, I feel like a lot of it has to do with tolerance as well. I just don't think I'll ever really be able to relive those MXE days.

DCK IMO is like super-ketamine, I would agree that 2F-DCK is basically a poor man's K, there's something unique about it for sure and for disso connoisseurs it's worth a look, but on the whole I was not impressed.


DCK on the other hand... much more potent than ketamine, longer duration, essentially the same hole space, even somewhat more reliably euphoric in some ways... I think this is actually my new favourite dissociative. It can have long, trailing aftereffects including some physical unsteadiness lasting into the next day which I was not a fan of initially, so it is more of a commitment than K, for sure - which is very easy to do for a quick journey down the rabbit hole knowing you'll be back and relatively functional in a few hours max, a little too easy for me, whereas knowing that DCK is more of a commitment, I think and hope I can respect it a little more and not abuse it. I would urge caution however as the high potency means if you are prone to overuse you will rapidly jack up your tolerance to all other dissociatives, and potentially harm yourself psychologically in the process.

Cool I might try that then, I had one of these RCs sold to me as K but it wasn't it was nasty, I don't want to buy that again lol, is DCK a powder or crystal what's the mg to sniff? Bumps or lines?

I've had both powder and squarish crystals like table salt (obviously needed crushing into powder).


It can be snorted which I usually have done but unlike ketamine it's also quite active orally at about the same dose, although with a slower onset. The Psychonautwiki dosage table is pretty accurate IMO so I'd suggest referring to that: 

[https://m.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deschloroketamine](https://m.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deschloroketamine)


Definitely small bumps to start off - progressing to smallish lines as you get more comfortable and/or you want to go for a heavier experience.

Can pretty much agree with this assessment on 2fdck, it is nice but almost like something is missing. I think my next time messing with it will be just a larger sized dose all at once, I've heard it is good orally as well. To me K just feels like a poor mans mxe, but then again street quality k is iffy, but I feel like I've given it a fair go even with quality stuff ive had and always been left dissapointed. Have not tried DCK yet, though, so has yet to be seen. I feel I'm at the point now that short acting ket style disso's are mainly a good combo for psych use or as a comedown tool. Imo, I've had more fun/full experiences with the longer acting stimulating dissos. I think MXE was kinda the perfect balance between sedating/stimulating while still being quite psychedelic in its own right. 


PS: and for me oddly enough I get more euphoria if you will from 2fdck than i do from ket.

It took me a long time to get MXE - I posted this same thing in another thread recently so not to be repeating myself, lol, although I guess the same things come up in different discussions fairly often - but I must say I never really appreciated it in the way that I know so many people do, I've heard it described as "the perfect dissociative" but I didn't get that. In fact I used to find it quite dysphoric and uncomfortable. I persisted however out of an appreciation for the fact that it is no doubt a deep, complex and intriguing drug - I think similar things about the newer PCP analogues, actually, although I think honestly they are shallower than MXE, or perhaps the depths are just too psychotic and incomprehensible - anyway I think I do get it now. However my preference has always been for the more in your face, reality altering dissociatives which for me MXE is not, like the PCP analogues there is not as much going on perceptually, the effects are more headspace. For that reason I think it comes into it's own a lot more in combo with psychs, or with ketamine (or probably DCK or another more hole-inducing dissociative). Actually I think I'm at a similar place with all dissociatives really, that they work better as enhancers for true psychedelics rather than alone - not that they don't all have something to offer alone, but personally I think I've plumbed the depths of the holes and the heights of the manic insanity of the more stimulating ones as far as it's sensible for me to go by now and I've felt for a while there's probably not much more there that's of any real value for me to find.


Street quality K is iffy indeed, back when I actually picked up on the street from time to time I occasionally got very weird batches that I suspected were cut with SOMETHING although I had no way to tell what. Equally though I've had K from sources I trust enough that it's hard for me to believe it's anything other than K, and still had unusual effects. I think often we underestimate the influence that our own headspace can have on the experience of any drug, even one we consider ourselves to be quite familiar with, and this effect becomes more and more relevant the more we use any given drug. In my early days I'm sure the dirtiest cut to shit bag of grubby street K would send me into another dimension just as reliably as the most pure, lab grade, pharmaceutical quality stuff. Nowadays with either one I can sometimes have disappointing experiences that are hard to pin down a reason for... although for sure I'd still choose the pharma grade K, given the choice, and all things considered this is definitely still less likely to have weird cuts, active or not.

This doesn't surprise me actually, I think 2F-DCK like DCK is possibly more reliably euphoric than ketamine itself, which can be variable, even dysphoric at times as I refer to above with certain experiences being unexpectedly weird and disappointing. This is essentially what I was referring to when I said there was "something" unique about 2F-DCK. Unfortunately the relative shallowness of the other effects outweighed this for me. Also given how little we know about the toxicities of ketamine - except that they seem to be, to some extent or other, probably shared by most if not all other arylcyclohexylamines, the larger doses of 2F-DCK required is also offputting to me as it's possibly more physically harmful for less of a psychoactive effect.


On that note - [@deficiT](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/185147/) - have you ever experienced negative bladder symptoms from your dissociative use? Either way, do you mind sharing a few more details about your estimated lifetime usage, and general frequency of use? I ask all disso fans this question essentially as I'm really curious about it and obviously there's such a wide range of variation of experiences as far as bladder damage or other negative physical symptoms.

^ I think that if you're looking for something close to ketamine, with deep holes that can feel like you've somehow transplanted into another reality - then you won't find what you're looking for with any of the stimulating ones which tend to be less perceptual, ie, the PCP analogues, or the diarylethylamines (ephendine, diphenidine, methoxphenidine), and tentatively I would say *probably *MXE or the newer MXPr either - although as I say, many people do like MXE *a lot*, it's a very popular drug, so you may feel it is worth a look - and I think I have experienced "M-holes", although a long time ago now, and they are IIRC still less immersive than a K-hole, maybe requiring some kind of "potentiating stimulus", such as a film or TV show, to truly get lost within, whereas with K I can get lost staring at a wall, or at least I could at one point.


2F-DCK and DCK are very close to ketamine though, IMO the closest. Unfortunately I found 2F-DCK essentially unholeable, although it may be possible with a large enough dose. DCK is very much holeable however so given your stated preferences it's surely your best bet here.


I have not tried O-PCE - I believe it is one of the more stimulating dissos, but I have also heard reports that it is quite close to ketamine in some ways, so while I can't personally comment it may also be worth a look (it's also chemically very close to DCK, which can also be referred to as O-PCM, or 2'-OxO-PCM, compared to 2'-OxO-PCE, ie, O-PCE).

Thankyou very much for the advice [@Vastness](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/79131/) I'll stick to K while I can buy it and maybe try DCK when there's another K shortage on lol

To my taste O-PCE is the next grial after MXE, so:


MXE>O-PCE>3-meo-pce>3-meo-pcp>the rest (havent tried the 3-ho´s yet)


Sure MXE was more magic and serotonergic, but OPCE is the closest next big thing. I dont get if it´s a very personal preference or it´s just than people have not give it´s oportunity. Probably the latter.


It´s super euphoric, generative of disso-internal-spaces and easy to hole into too. And quite potent by weight. 


The 3-meo´s are more energetic/speedier, less body holing and way less disso spacey, so, basically dissospeeds...

I've just read on Psychonaut Wiki that DCK causes serious threat to health and immune system and on Wikipedia it said it is being used as for immunomodulation


That's some scary ass fucking shit right there


I had been thinking of ordering some as I've not tried any dissociatives other than K, well I have but it was sold to me as K, fuck knows we what it was, horrible I know that much lol


Oh and mxe a few times like a billion years ago, and it looks like there's a K drought around fucksake so hmmm what's similar to K other than DCK, I want to hole, nothing piss weak lol, no poor mans K


Is 3-HO-PCP stimulating then? Or is it like similar to PCP?

You should check out 2F-DCK as that one is pretty damn close to regular Ketamine also MXPr is pretty nice as well and comparable to MXE in many ways. I've had all the 3-MeO's and 3-HO's and all of them are very Euphoric and Mania inducing Dissos that are really easy to get addicted to I use them daily until the batch is gone and it pretty much always turns out bad eventually tho I'm a glutton for punishment and continue going back for more and make the situation more messy. My binges on 3-MeO-PCP/E and 3-HO-PCP/E are what led to losing the woman I was meant to marry this year.


A few weeks ago I was visiting her at our old house and I'd just gotten a 5 gram bag of 4-AcO-DMT a day prior to me findings vial with 1.5 grams of 3-HO-PCE she had confiscated a month earlier from me. Well I ended up going on this heavy Tryptamine/Dissos binge for days and the last thing I remember was taking a 50mg redose orally in the morning after being up all night tripping on 4-AcO-DMT/3-HO-PCE and when the big redose hit i entered an intense hole I which I was shown that are reality is a simulation being generated by an all powerful entity and that everything is in actuality an illusion and this thing loops on forever.


Apparently she is the same woman I end up with in all of my lives and she is guiding light of sorts and of very pure spirit. Slowly the room started to reform around me and I notice I am surrounded by people they are paramedics and have been called because of me going catatonic for an hour or two and bugging out my ex who didn't know what drugs I had taken. A couple weeks prior I'd overdosed on Brorphine and had to be brought back with Narcan so her immediate concern was I was gonna die so I can't get to mad about the situation. Sadly I had all those drugs in my pocket and the hospital took them from me and flushed them down the toilet, at least I didn't get arrested.


They kept me in a psychward over night and gave me a bunch of Ativan due to me acting like a wacko and speaking to them of timeloops and interdimensional beings. As you can imagine the psych's there thought I was skitzophenic or something I told them that I was on PCP. The next day when they came to evaluate me and saw I was "normal" they gave me the boot and I showed back up at my girls to get my backpack and she was obviously super pissed at me.


She would barely talk to me for a week after that and we are best friends to this day so that was really hard on me. But now she is letting me stay over a few days here and there again which is great but I would never use Dissos around her like that again I should have held off till I was alone in my hotel room as I'd still have that stash right now they took a quarter of Shrooms also it fucking sucked was hundreds of dollars in drugs.

Yes I would do that, if I buy a few grams of K I use it daily, I'd sniff the whole lot in one day if I could afford too, but I stretch it out over a few days, even though by day 2 it barely does anything, I legit couldn't save a drug so I need to buy little at a time 


But of course this site I found has a minimum spend, I've tried hard to order a small amount but it's legit forcing me to stock pile, I'm going to end up addicted to RC benzos as of course those are on my list too lol, I only wanted a few to test out but nooooo I needed to order 4 different types of RC benzos lol, of course I'm going eat them daily fucksake


That's some story, that's so fucked up, I'd of freaked out, it sounds like a hole and a half


Then coming round and being watched over by paramedics, shit man, I barely like sniffing K around anyone not on anything let alone all that shit you took in front of her


Doesn't she do drugs then? Yeah it could of been worse, you could of been arrested or forced into a nut house for an extended stay lol, all the maddest people swear they're not mad, so try telling them you're not insane luckily they knew you wasn't, some people ain't so lucky 


Maybe it wasn't worth the polices time as it was mostly RCs you had in your pocket, apart from the srooms? 


Sounds like your Mrs is slowly forgiving you though


I read that 2-fdck is weak and not very dissociative? 


I really want these benzos, they're on blotters I could hardly believe my eyes, benzo blotter what the actual fuck haha and I want some dissociative powder to sniff, I've set my order out ready for paypay, need to amend it and buy something other that the DCK though, I'm just worried about customs and shit, I'll end up not buying it as its a tence wait for the postman lol


Payday will come I'll think fuck it and order real K that I don't need to wait 6-14 days for lol

I'm getting a bit of this in a week or two. Gonna trial it out. Of the dissos, I've only used MXE and N2O, and while I have 100mg of 3-meo-pcp and a gram of 2f-dck I've never gotten around to trying either.


Anyways, from what I'm reading, 10mg is roughly the 'standard' dose right?


Looking forward to finding out what it's like in comparison to MXE and to seeing how it might combo with psilacetin and a few other psychs.

It is so good man I daydream about this stuff all the time. Mixed it with 4-AcO-DMT most of the time also and it's so epic. I had one of the hardest trips of my life on binge but it's really chill in low doses and better off staying there as I'm sure you will Gravy your a pretty cautious drug user in general. It's not the kinda drug to go off the deep end on but I would be a liar if I didn't say I love it in the midst. For me 3-HO-PCE was super euphoric and dreamy and I spent this day walking mg thru the city and the park and stuff it was so beautiful and I was so happy it was probably on 30mgs with a couple days residual days use built up so I was pretty far out there. It was visual and the environment took on this like deeply saturated and wet look. It was like the whole world in 4k or something it's a really powerful drug, love it.

So, I messed about with this stuff for the past five days straight, and I have to say, I'm rather unimpressed. Common effects are that of MXE and other dissos I've tried; i.e. tinnitus, distancing of the mind from the body, a mild mania, confusion and disorientation at higher doses, spaces appearing larger or emptier than they are (or far away). Least desirably, it induced a mild nausea pretty consistently that wouldn't abate via eating or other general remedies like ginger.


I tried 20mg in one go yesterday, way too dissociating without any positives. Felt alien. In the days prior I tried between 10-25mg daily, split into 2-3  doses. That worked better and provided a mild body buzz I enjoyed (more so than 20mg all at once.)


Generally, I'd say it's an okay disso, with the only utility being added in small doses to psychedelics, benzos, or weed to really kick things into wacky town.

I haven´t tested this one yet nor the 3-oh-pcp, but I would say that any diso that you take after 2 or 3 disso binge continuous is going to be lackluster in any case.


Just give yourself one week at least or better two free of use to really test the nature of the compound

I've been researching this for a few days-

My pack arrived this morning and I took 15mg orally

but now i'm reading conflicting reports about it not being active orally.


I plan on waiting it out as its only been 30 minutes but has anyone else discovered that 3-ho-pce is not active orally?

I hate putting anything in my nose but perhaps I can take it sublingually this weekend when I try it again.

It's no more stimulating than most NMDA-receptor antagonists, and yes, I consider it to be substantially similar to PCP in terms of qualitative effects. It also reputedly has mild affinity for the µ-opioid receptor, and I find myself relaxed on it. Super small doses are very lucid and pleasant. Larger doses start getting nutty, and the full-on hole experience is totally batshit crazy very, very similar to smoking sherm.


EDIT: note, the thread is discussing the eticyclidine (3-HO-PCE), of course, and not the phencyclidine version. They are similar, but PCE's, to me, are more manic, energizing, and psychedelic. And yet a strong 3-HO-PCE trip is not quite as profound as a strong 3-HO-PCP trip… go figure.

Yes, it's worth the purchase and is a worthwhile compound for any disso fan and/or psychonaut out there healthy enough to safely explore it. 3-HO-PCE, 3-HO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE, and 3-MeO-PCP are all interesting compounds with very similar effect profiles, yet each *is *distinct. Distinguishing their effects enough to verbalize them and elucidate the differences to others definitely takes a good deal of experience with them though, at least that's my take on it. YMMV.

Someone said it's like being kicked in the face by a psychedelic horse, which made me laugh and immediately want to try that RoA for some reason, so I did and guess what? it was more like the horse poured boiling lava into my sinuses and within a couple minutes I was tripping harder than I wanted to be while dealing with the horse and the lava faucet he turned on, etc. … I digress). 


However, I find insufflating 3-HO-PCE and 3-HO-PCP to be very easy and simply the superior route of administration for this drug. Really if air is a 1 and that aforementioned 2C-B a 10, then these potent arylcyclohexylamines are a 2 on that scale. Also, most people snort too aggressively during administration via this route and the drugs actually wind up passing the nasal mucosa and entering the blood through capillaries in the sinus and/or dripping down the throat for any potential first-pass metabolism. Aim instead to deliver the drugs to the nasal mucosa which lines the inside of the nose. I suggest not plugging the opposing nostril and just breathing in slowly and firmly and obviously enough to consume the drug powder, and while still snorting tilt your head back so as not to lose any product to gravity and any potential slow absorption rates…finally, be sure to chop up any powders to a fine dust first to assist dissolution into the mucous membranes.

MXE was euphoric for me, warmish

OPCE to me is extremely neutral, felt like a robot. cold. very different from mxe

MXPr, not comparable to mxe either. actually disliked it the most. the low duration was cool though


DMXE is the closest MXE replacement ive ever tried. hell even the dosage seem to match perfectly.


3-meo-pce too manic to even compare with mxe

Yeah, I wrote that on a honeymoon phase and with near 0 tolerance. I keep liking the OPCE, its nice for holing but agree that is a bit cold and robotic and pretty much prefer 3-meo-pce


I havent tried DMXE and MXPRi yet so I can not comment

DMXE is a special one. I have a stash here of many disso and always reach for the DMXE.

that's interesting, i was excited by the idea of dmxe, and in practice found it lackluster. the experience felt amorphous, cumbersome, confusing and i did not enjoy it, from moderate dissociation all the way to hole doses. the aesthetic was interesting, i got a blue ocean vibe... but not enough to make up for the "when will this end" factor. glad the descent- legs are not nearly as long as opce or dck...


i was hoping mxipr to be more of what people describe as the mxe amazingness (i never shall know what mxe is like, sadly), but if it's not even as good as dmxe...


now this 3-ho-pce looks quite tempting, i enjoy 3-meo-pce a lot at below hole doses and it's great as a jump off point for a more holey disso (like dck).


but should i just stick with 3-meo-" if that's what i like? or is this ho-" one substantially different enough to warrant exploration over the meo cousin?

I tried 12-15mg intranasal last week but had tolerance + was very congested so it didn’t work well.

What’s the typical oral dosage with this for a fun, social dose?

I like 30mg, no tolerance and I weigh 240. I "nod" a bit at that dose, but am still functional. Try 25mg?

It's the less stimulating of all the ArylCHA, even less than the oxo ones and kétamine.

so ok, its less fun and manic, not hole freindly, but it's the best to just stop my disso craving.


I dont like that it don't solve in water, a 3aco should be golden IMO.

PS : the batch bag said "hydrochloride" but I have to use ascorbic acid or lemon like a poor junky to put it in water :/

so if it's a base, I guess I could smoke it, well, it's a phenol, but THC is a phenol to


it spiced nicely any other disso, dont have to put much, sort of the "2-CD tofu" of the dissos ( loved 2cd)
