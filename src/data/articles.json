Keep sessions ≤150 mg insufflated or 100 mg IM and allow ≥14 days between heavy sessions to curb tolerance. Chronic use (>1 g/week for months) strongly linked to ulcerative cystitis, hydronephrosis and incontinence; earliest cases appear after 240 mg four times weekly. Adequate hydration, urinary alkalinisation and absolute abstinence are the only proven mitigations once symptoms arise. Recreational inhibition of NMDA may lower seizure threshold when mixed with tramadol or bupropion. Street powders can be cut with 2-F-DCK or other analogues—verify with Mandelin plus GC/MS where possible. Crash risk is highest during standing/walking: sit or lie down immediately after dosing to avoid injury.",

Severe reactions (hypertension, hyponatraemia, seizures) have been reported with related piperazines. Lab testing has occasionally mis-identified or contaminated CFPP with other substances.

      "notes": "Phenazolam is the same compound as clobromazolam; it first appeared on the market circa 2016 and has no approved medical use. Forum meta-reports consistently place its potency in the sub-milligram range, with ~0.25mg often compared to 10mg diazepam; avoid any pressed tablets claiming multi-milligram doses. Onset is notably slow for a triazolobenzodiazepine (often 1-2 h, sometimes 3 h), which greatly increases redosing risk and blackout potential. Volumetric dosing is essential: dissolve a known amount in a measured volume (e.g., 1mg in 10-20mL ethanol/propylene glycol), mix thoroughly, and measure doses with an oral syringe; do not eyeball powders or shave tablets. Wait a full 3-4 hours before considering any redose due to delayed peak and amnesia. Multiple reports describe next-day impairment lasting well beyond the perceived high; avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 24 h after dosing. In vitro human S9 data indicate CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and UGT N-glucuronidation; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can potentiate effects markedly. Immunoassay urine screens may miss many designer benzodiazepines, and field reagents are unreliable; only confirmatory LC/GC-MS can verify identity. Co-use with opioids, alcohol, GHB, or gabapentinoids is the main cause of life-threatening events; treat as a hard contra-indication. Flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent users and should only be used by clinicians. Because supply may include bromazolam or other benzos mis-sold as clobromazolam, assume mislabeling until proven otherwise and start at the absolute minimum dose.",

In vitro and animal studies show CBDA is up to 100× more potent than CBD at the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor and also inhibits COX-2; these mechanisms underpin its reported anti-nausea, anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Human anecdotal reports describe a clear-headed, mildly uplifting effect without intoxication. Oral bioavailability appears higher than CBD (~19 % vs 6 %), so markedly lower doses are needed. CBDA inhibits several CYP450 isozymes (2C9, 2C19, 3A4); monitor narrow-therapeutic-index drugs.",

Volumetric dosing or painstaking capsule weighing with a 0.001 g scale is strongly advised to avoid accidental 10× overdoses reported on Erowid. Energy Control drug-checking data find 2C-B tablets ranging 4–26 mg; reagent-test each sample to exclude NBOMe substitutes. Pharmacokinetic work in 16 volunteers gave an oral-fluid t½ ≈2.5 h and Cmax at ~1 h; subjective effects waned by 6 h but coordination impairment persisted another 2 h. Short-term tolerance develops after a single session and drops to baseline within 4–7 days; cross-tolerance with LSD, psilocybin and mescaline is partial. Bluelight users warn that redosing late (3-4 h) can yield unexpectedly powerful secondary peaks and that mixing with alcohol can cause memory blackouts or delirious behaviour. No deaths solely attributable to 2C-B have been confirmed, but hypertensive emergencies and persistent psychosis have followed very high (>60 mg) doses or poly-drug use.",

      "notes": "Tiletamine is typically supplied as the veterinary anaesthetic Telazol (1:1 with zolazepam); pure API crystals now circulate on the grey market and are at least 2–3 × the potency of ketamine by weight. Human pharmacokinetics are poorly studied, but polar-bear and porcine data place the elimination half-life at ~1.8 h with rapid hepatic N-deethylation. Nasal administration burns sharply (pH≈3), so users dilute in 0.9 % saline or switch to IM for harm reduction. Repeated use has produced prolonged tremor syndromes, cerebellar ataxia, choreiform movements and week-long cognitive depersonalisation even at <30 mg/insufflated sessions. Forum consensus caps single doses at ≤30 mg and total session load at ≤60 mg to minimise neuro-excitation. Because commercial vials always contain equimolar zolazepam, analysts should run a benzodiazepine panel: unexpected zolazepam greatly lengthens sedation and interacts unpredictably with alcohol or GABAergic drugs. Urinary excretion is primary, so renal-impaired users experience dangerously extended effects. Reagent testing gives a weak Mandelin orange/brown response; confirmatory GC-MS is advised as til**e**tamine often arrives mislabeled as ketamine or 2-F-DCK. Users report a brittle, dissociative ‘hole’ with powerful body-load, amnesia and minimal visual activity; the tactile euphoria is stronger than ketamine but the hangover is harsher and includes coarse tremors, sweating and myoclonus up to 24 h. Volumetric solutions (10 mg/mL in bacteriostatic saline or PG) help precision; never exceed 50 mg/5 mL IM to avoid tissue necrosis from acidic solution.",

Severe amnesia, insomnia and thought-disorder are typical above 1 mg. Fatal synergy with benzodiazepines and alcohol documented. Practical harm-reduction: limit first exposure to ≤0.25 mg, dose once only per 14 days, avoid operating machinery for 48 h, co-administer antioxidants and keep hydrated.

Vaporizing requires roughly 20 % of an oral dose but sharply increases lungs/throat irritation and overdose risk. Subjective profile combines MXE-like dissociation with stimulant overtones (DAT inhibition Ki≈274 nM). Profound anterograde amnesia and ‘blank-slate’ catatonia are common at strong doses, raising harm-reduction concerns around wandering, unsafe environments and redosing loops. Four multidrug deaths and >14 non-fatal intoxications (STRIDA) document hypertension, severe confusion, nystagmus and muscle rigidity; plasma concentrations in fatalities ranged 12-1380 ng/mL. Enzyme data suggest a 4-6 h elimination half-life, but users report lingering cognitive dullness up to 24 h, likely from lipophilic redistribution. Recommended practice: weigh with 1 mg-resolution scale, solution volumetric dosing for sub-20 mg accuracy, no redose within same 24 h, nasal saline rinse post-insufflation, and cycle breaks ≥2 weeks to reset tolerance.",

[Erowid/Bluelight reports]\n• Because doses are in the micro-gram range, use pre-laid blotters from a trusted lab, or perform volumetric dosing with an accurate mg scale and 95 % ethanol. Store solution in the freezer, light-proof bottle.\n• Test every batch with an Ehrlich or Hofmann reagent – many NBOMe and DOx psychedelics fit onto blotters but are substantially more toxic.\n• Common somatic issues: mild vasoconstriction (cold extremities), jaw tension, occasional nausea in first hour. Hydrate and stretch; magnesium supplements may reduce bruxism.\n• Mental health screening: avoid if predisposed to psychosis, bipolar, severe anxiety. A trusted sitter and calm setting markedly reduce the risk of panic.\n• ‘Bad trips’ generally respond to 5–20 mg oral diazepam or 1–2 mg lorazepam; keep on hand if experimenting solo.\n• Legal status: unscheduled in most of the U.S. but may be covered by the Federal Analogue Act; controlled in DE, FR, JP, CH and others as of 2024.",

Forum experiments suggest oral administration is far more efficient than insufflation, likely due to low nasal absorption; 50-75 mg oral produces warm, serene dissociation and mild empathogenic warmth, while the same amount intranasally may do little. Users describe a ‚ketamine-lite‘ float with MXE-style emotional openness, but with faster tolerance and heavier compulsion to redose. Pharmacological screens (rat brain synaptosome & PDSP panels) show high-micromolar NMDA antagonism and mid-micromolar SERT inhibition, with negligible μ-opioid activity. Because bladder and renal fibrosis seen with chronic MXE are thought to be metabolite-linked, MXM’s safety profile is unknown—urotoxicity precautions (hydration, 2-week breaks) are advised. Always reagent-test powders; MMXE often appears as adulterant in DCK/MXE markets. Volumetric dosing or 0.001 g scales are strongly recommended to avoid accidental 200 mg+ intakes.",

Human use reports are extremely scarce; users describe a ‘clean’, MDMA-lite empathy with typical amphetamine stimulation and minimal visuals. Marked hyperthermia and bruxism were noted at >30 mg.

Consider reagent testing (Marquis/Mecke) but expect atypical reactions; only full laboratory analysis (GC-MS / NMR) can confirm. \n• Little toxicology exists; assume risks similar to other 5-HT2A phenethylamines and avoid combining with serotonergic or adrenergic drugs.",

Laboratory dissolution tests show complete cleavage in simulated plasma within ~5-10 min, implying only a slightly slower onset than GBL. Oral solutions are strongly acidic (pH ≈3); buffering to ~pH 7 with food-grade carbonate reduces throat irritation. Compared with GHB, 1.4× higher mass is needed per equivalent effect (molecular-weight correction 146/104). Users on bluelight and r/researchchemicals report mild warmth and sociability at ~1 g, heavy sedation above 3 g, and vomiting if taken too rapidly. Duration appears a little longer than GHB (up to 4 h) and re-dosing sooner than 2 h greatly increases overdose risk. Loss of consciousness and respiratory arrest are the main acute harms; always measure with a 0.01 g scale, avoid stacking doses, and keep a sober sitter. Because it is an ester of a Schedule-listed drug, many jurisdictions already consider it controlled—legal status is uncertain outside analytical/research use. Shelf-life is short in aqueous solution; store the dry powder desiccated and prepare single-use solutions immediately before ingestion.",

      "notes": "2-AI is a rigid amphetamine analogue that surfaced in the early 2000s. Reports describe mild, functional stimulation with little euphoria, but toxicology data remain sparse and some jurisdictions regulate it alongside other amphetamine analogues. Start with allergy tests and conservative doses because individual responses vary widely.\n\nIn vitro work shows 2-AI is a robust substrate at NET (EC50 ≈0.14 µM) and DAT (EC50 ≈0.31 µM) with negligible SERT activity; it also binds α2C (Ki ≈41 nM) and α2A/B receptors, explaining the unusual peripheral analgesia some users describe. Very limited human pharmacokinetics exist—metabolite data from the analgesic pro-drug CHF-3381 indicate a 3-4 h plasma half-life for free 2-AI, matching the 2-3 h subjective ‘rush’ frequently reported. Oral bioavailability appears high and food has minimal effect. Repeated doses >200 mg have produced transient nausea, systolic BP >150 mm Hg and resting HR >110 bpm in forum reports, but no seizures or psychosis have been confirmed. Intranasal administration is extremely painful and causes epistaxis; users recommend isotonic saline rinses and micron-range powder. Tolerance builds quickly yet resets within ~7-10 days. Several reports emphasise the ‘clean’ wakefulness—closer to modafinil than classic amphetamine—but virtually no empathogenic warmth. Because 2-AI is sometimes mis-sold as MDAI/5-IAI, multi-reagent testing (Marquis = orange-brown) plus GC-MS when possible is strongly advised.",

Volumetric solutions in propylene glycol recommended for sub-10 mg dosing.  \n• Harm-reduction: keep hydrated (electrolytes), cool environment, limit redoses, have benzodiazepine on hand for severe stimulant anxiety (but avoid routine co-use).",

It is known for strong stimulation, euphoria, and high compulsivity. There are significant risks of cardiovascular and psychiatric side effects, including anxiety, paranoia, and agitation. Overdose can lead to severe health consequences. Harm reduction practices are strongly recommended. Limited clinical data is available, and user reports suggest a high potential for abuse and adverse effects.",

Community reports place potency roughly five to seven times that of ketamine: 2-5 mg insufflated already produces dissociation, while 10-20 mg has left users with vertigo, tremor, depersonalisation, and dysphoria lasting days. The powder is hygroscopic and clings electrostatically, so volumetric dosing in PG or an ethanol-water mix (for example 10 mg/mL) is far safer than chasing individual milligram shards.\n\nVendors advertise rapid onset (1-10 minutes IM/IN) and a 1-2 hour elimination half-life, yet many users describe a heavier body-load than ketamine with little euphoria and pronounced after-effects. Stacking doses easily leads to ataxia and next-day fatigue; start with micro-doses, avoid redosing, and assume full cross-tolerance with other arylcyclohexylamines. Mandelin/Mecke reagents plus FT-IR or GC-MS are recommended to distinguish Tilmetamine from O-PCPr or O-PCE, and spacing sessions by at least seven days helps reset NMDA sensitivity.",

      "notes": "Prolintane was once sold over the counter in parts of Europe as a mild cognitive stimulant. Overuse quickly brings insomnia, anxiety, tachycardia, and other classic stimulant side-effects, so keep doses modest and spaced.\n\nPharmacology: Prolintane blocks DAT and NET with micromolar potency, producing catecholaminergic stimulation similar to pyrovalerone but with a shorter half-life. Clinical studies used 10–20 mg oral doses to improve vigilance with minimal cardiovascular changes. Forum users describe pronounced euphoria, sociability and sexual arousal at 40-70 mg oral or 20-40 mg nasal, with a smooth plateau and comparatively soft comedown. Large or repeated doses (>70 mg) induce vasoconstriction, tremor, nausea and sudden vomiting; several users liken the ‘too-much’ reaction to amphetamine over-stimulation. Peripheral adrenergic load is greater than cathinone analogues, so ECG monitoring is advised for cardiovascular patients. Half-life is estimated 3-6 h in man, though individual reports of lingering effects up to 12 h suggest active metabolites. Harm-reduction tips: volumetric dosing or calibrated scoops for <10 mg accuracy; limit sessions to ≤70 mg total and take 3-day breaks to reset tolerance; monitor blood pressure; avoid redosing after midnight to preserve sleep; keep oral rehydration salts on hand for stimulant-induced diuresis; reagent-test powders to exclude α-PVP and caffeine cuts. Legal status varies—prescription-only (e.g., Spain ‘Katovit’ 10 mg tablets) or controlled in UK (Class C) and Australia (Schedule 4). Street ‘prolintane’ tablets frequently prove inactive or adulterated—confirm identity by GC-MS where possible.",

Several fatalities have been reported within the NBOMe series from dose confusion.\n• Harm reduction: pre-measure individual doses, avoid redosing within 24 h, remain hydrated and cool, have benzodiazepines available to control severe anxiety.\n• People with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, or severe mental illness should avoid.\n• NBOMes often fail common reagent tests; use multiple reagents (e.g., Ehrlich vs. Marquis) and do not assume blotters sold as LSD are LSD.",

      "notes": "3F-PCP is a potent dissociative relative of PCP and 3-MeO-PCP, blending stimulation with psychedelic dissociation on a steep dose-response curve. Overshooting invites psychosis, delirium, and risky behaviour, making accurate measurement and sober supervision essential.\n\nFirst detected by the Slovenian National Forensic Laboratory in October 2020 and now controlled in many EU states. In rodent binding assays it retains sub-micromolar affinity at the PCP site, with fluorine substitution slightly reducing potency versus PCP but improving metabolic stability. Human pharmacokinetic data are absent; forensic cases suggest an elimination half-life of roughly 10-18 h, placing it between ketamine and PCP. User reports converge on a clear-headed but manic dissociation with a distinct ‘menthol’ cooling body load. Closed-eye imagery is sparse; instead, orb-like tracers and mild proprioceptive drift dominate. Holing doses (>60 mg oral, >35 mg nasal) produce pronounced amnesia, repetitive time-loops and transient delusional invincibility. Crystal often arrives as hygroscopic chunks—volumetric solutions or micro-scoops are advised to avoid nose-bleeds from large shards. Reagent testing (Mecke/Marquis) only verifies arylcyclohexylamine presence; confirmatory GC-MS is recommended because vendors sometimes substitute 3-Cl-PCP or 3-MeO-PCP. Harm-reduction best practice: limit sessions to ≤1 g per month, include 10- to 14-day breaks to reset tolerance, hydrate, and keep associative tasks (driving, cooking) strictly off-limits while residual impairment persists.",

      "notes": "ALEPH-2 is a scarce psychedelic amphetamine in the ALEPH and 2C-T family, mixing anxiolytic warmth with classic phenethylamine visuals. Almost no modern toxicology exists, so combine nothing else serotonergic or stimulating and dose with extreme caution.\n\nShulgin reports ALEPH-2 active at 4-8mg orally with 8-16h duration, with body warmth at 4mg and strong visuals near the top of the range. Start at or below 2-3mg for an initial assay; dose-response in ALEPH compounds can be steep and idiosyncratic, so avoid redosing for at least 3h. As a DOx-like amphetamine, onset is slow; early redoses can stack into an overlong, overstimulating trip. In vitro data show partial 5-HT2A and full 5-HT2C agonism; weak MAO-A inhibition has been reported for 4-alkylthio amphetamines, so avoid combinations with MAOIs, MDMA, or other potent serotonergics. Thio-substituted phenethylamines (2C-T series, alephs) have a history of unpredictable toxicity and steep dose curves in humans; prefer the oral route and space trials conservatively (weeks to months). Because material is extremely rare, mislabeling risk is high; confirm identity with multi-reagent testing and, ideally, analytical confirmation. Use a calibrated milligram scale and consider volumetric dosing (for example, 10mg in 10mL = 1mg/mL) for sub-5mg measurements. Typical body-load risks include vasoconstriction, elevated heart rate/BP, mydriasis, and jaw tension; plan a calm set/setting, hydrate moderately, avoid physical overexertion, and allow for insomnia at the tail end. Insufflation or parenteral routes are not recommended due to potency, local irritation, and greater unpredictability.",

GC-MS surveys show frequent adulteration with other cathinones; multi-reagent tests (Marquis, Mandelin, Simon’s) plus FT-IR are recommended. It is a potent monoamine releaser (EC50 ≈ 0.1-0.5 µM at DAT/SERT) with a DAT:SERT release ratio of ~0.7, giving stronger stimulation and shorter head-high than MDMA. Plasma t½ averages 1.5-2.1 h with active N-demethyl and 4-carboxy metabolites; users compensate by redosing every 30-90 min, markedly increasing cardiovascular load and hyponatraemia risk. Case reports describe acute psychosis, rhabdomyolysis, severe peripheral vasoconstriction (‘blue hands’), and necrotising skin lesions after prolonged IV use. Nasal use rapidly erodes mucosa; users emphasise micron-ranging powder, alternating nostrils, and saline irrigation post-session. Hydration (but <1 pint water/h) and electrolyte drinks reduce headache and jaw clench. Titration with 10-20 mg bumps, keeping total session below 250 mg oral or 150 mg nasal, and 3-week breaks substantially reduce comedown severity and tolerance.",

User spreadsheets and trip reports indicate functional stimulation at 5-15 mg IN but marked vasoconstriction, bruxism and body-load over 40 mg. Vaping the HCl salt is heat-sensitive: freebasing or very low flame/oil-burner technique is essential to avoid pyrolysis and acrid smoke. Oral dosing produces a flatter, long-tail stimulation (up to 8-10 h wakefulness in some cases) that many find more manageable, though anxiety on the tail can be severe—have 0.25-0.5 mg alprazolam equivalent on standby, and cease redosing after 12 h awake. Binge patterns >500 mg/24 h have precipitated stimulant psychosis with auditory hallucinations, paranoia and formication; strict session caps (<100 mg/day) and 48-hour recovery windows are strongly advised. MD-PiHP is hygroscopic; store in airtight vials with desiccant, and reagent-test for pyrovalerone adulterants. Hydration (electrolytes), magnesium for jaw tension, and warm extremity care (gloves, warming pads) reduce harm. Because clinical data are absent, avoid in pregnancy, cardiovascular disease or seizure disorders.\n\nIf severe hyperthermia develops and cyproheptadine is unavailable, emergency literature cites IV dantrolene as a backup intervention—seek medical help immediately rather than attempting self-treatment.",

      "notes": "1,4-BDO is a prodrug for GHB, metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Individual metabolic variability means two users can respond very differently to the same dose. Onset is slower than GBL, making redosing particularly risky as people often mistakenly believe the first dose was weak. Because BDO is a viscous industrial solvent, unreacted contaminants or degradation products may add toxicity beyond GHB’s profile. The bitter, chemical taste can mask concentration errors if diluted in sweet drinks, creating overdose risk when sharing containers. Vomiting can delay absorption but does not reliably prevent overdose because BDO continues converting to GHB once absorbed. Measured dosing with an oral syringe or graduated cylinder is strongly recommended; kitchen spoons can vary by >50% volume. Redosing within 2 h stacks CNS depression due to overlapping GHB conversion, frequently leading to unintentional blackouts. Severe amnesia is common, and users may underestimate how intoxicated they appear to others. Tolerance develops within days and users escalate to round-the-clock dosing, often drinking every 2-4 h to avoid withdrawal. Withdrawal can begin within 2-6 h of last dose and progress rapidly to delirium, seizures, and autonomic instability if untreated; medical detox is usually necessary. Mixing with alcohol, benzos, or opioids is the main driver of fatal cases, often due to compounded respiratory depression. In toxicology reports, BDO is sometimes missed because it is rapidly converted into GHB in the body. Chronic heavy use can cause severe gastrointestinal irritation, electrolyte imbalance, and cognitive dulling. Harm reduction practices include setting a strict session cap, preparing pre-measured doses to prevent blackout redosing, avoiding consecutive-day use, and never using without a sober sitter present. Even small overestimations can lead to coma due to the steep dose-response curve.",

Recreational users on Bluelight and Drugs-Forum describe warm euphoria, sociability and drunk-like motor incoordination at 300-600 mg, sometimes escalating to grams with marked tolerance; first-time strong effects at ~500 mg oral are frequently reported. Case reports document daily intakes exceeding 3–6 g with compulsive redosing and severe withdrawal psychosis. Intranasal use provides faster onset but causes nasal drip and wastage; IV use risks particulate emboli from insoluble fillers and is strongly discouraged. Because pregabalin is Schedule V (US) / Class C (UK) but diverted widely, capsules are occasionally opened and powder sold; verify identity with reagent tests and weigh accurately (scale ±1 mg) before preparing volumetric solutions for intranasal or rectal routes.",

      "notes": "Delta-9-THC is cannabis's primary psychoactive agent, producing dose-dependent euphoria, altered perception, appetite increases, and—at higher doses—anxiety or paranoia. Oral routes come on slowly yet last longer than inhalation, and chronic exposure drives tolerance with a mild withdrawal phase when stopping.\n\nTHC is a highly lipophilic partial agonist at CB1 (central) and CB2 (peripheral) cannabinoid receptors. When plant material is heated to 220–240 °F (104–115 °C), its acidic precursor THCA decarboxylates to psychoactive Δ9‑THC. Following inhalation, peak plasma levels occur within minutes; oral ingestion yields slower but often more intense effects because hepatic first‑pass metabolism converts THC to 11‑hydroxy‑THC, a metabolite several‑fold more potent. Hepatic CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes dominate phase‑I biotransformation; potent inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine) can markedly raise plasma THC. Acute half‑life averages 1–3 days, extending to ~13 days in frequent users due to adipose sequestration. Chronic exposure down‑regulates CB1 receptors and produces tolerance to subjective intoxication within about a week of daily use, while cardiovascular and memory effects diminish more slowly. Co‑administration with alcohol or other depressants results in additive motor and cognitive deficits and elevated crash risk. Clinically, THC (or the 1:1 THC/CBD preparation nabiximols) is approved or investigated for cachexia, chemotherapy‑induced nausea, spasticity, neuropathic pain, and migraine. Adverse effects include transient tachycardia, xerostomia, conjunctival injection, anxiety, and in susceptible individuals, acute psychosis. It crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast‑milk; therefore prenatal or neonatal exposure is discouraged. Stored in adipose tissue, THC can be released slowly during fasting or exercise, occasionally triggering delayed impairment or positive drug screens.",

      "notes": "User anecdotes still note peripheral vasoconstriction and post-trip headaches with BOH-2C-B despite its gentler profile, so plan hydration and a calm cooldown even when doses feel mild.\n\nβ-Hydroxy substitution increases polarity, so BOHB crosses the blood-brain barrier less efficiently than 2C-B, giving a subtler but longer-lasting entactogenic head-space with lighter visual geometry. User reports describe clear-headed euphoria, gentle body-load and limited vasoconstriction compared with βk-2C-B. Typical oral onset is 45 min, ramping for 2-3 h; total plateaus around 4-6 h and fades smoothly. Recurrent complaints include late-stage tension headache and stiff jaw/bruxism. Hydration (electrolyte water) and 250-500 mg magnesium pre-load reduce muscle tension. Intranasal use delivers faster come-up but extreme burn; 20 mg insufflated was likened to 'snorting glass', with no marked potency gain. No controlled PK data exist; based on analog work (Glennon et al., 2004) and user BP traces, an elimination half-life of 4-7 h is estimated, likely metabolised via hepatic de-amination / O-demethylation then glucuronidation. β-Hydroxy analogues show partial agonism at 5-HT2A (Ki ≈0.5-1 nM) yet 10-15 × reduced CNS potency in rodent substitution models, matching higher human dose requirements. Always verify material—mis-labelled βk-2C-B and BOB (β-methoxy-2C-B) occasionally appear; Mandelin reagent turns green-brown on authentic BOHB, unlike bright green of βk-2C-B.",

Always reagent-test material.\n• Strong jaw tension, mild hyperthermia and pronounced pupil dilation are common – hydrate, cool environment, magnesium can reduce bruxism.\n• Comedown may include low mood, brain-zaps and insomnia for 1-3 days; allow 4-6 weeks between sessions for neurotransmitter recovery.",

Users report subtle but clean motivation, pattern-recognition boost, and mood brightening; bitterness limits sublingual dwell time. Common protocol: 10-20 mg daily for 14 days followed by equal washout; higher chronic doses (>40 mg) correlate with anxiety, insomnia, erectile dysfunction, or ‘dirty’ overstimulation. Lipophilic tissue binding gives multi-day carry-over despite plasma t½ ~2-4 h in rodents. Beta-carbolines can photo-sensitize DNA, so cover skin/eyes outdoors and avoid tanning beds during a cycle. Pair with magnesium or L-theanine to blunt GABA-inverse-agonist jitter.

Body load is usually mild (slight jaw tension, pupil dilation, occasional nausea). Potency appears 1.5-2× weaker than 5-MeO-MiPT but batches on the grey market vary\u0013test a low allergy dose (<1 mg). No formal human pharmacology exists; assume the cardiovascular and serotonergic risks common to other tryptamines. The fumarate salt is most common and is hygroscopic\u0013store with desiccant.

Acute adverse effects include tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, bruxism and anxiety. Because brominated cathinones show higher cytotoxicity in cell lines than their chloro/methyl analogues, conservative dosing is advised. No human pharmacokinetic studies exist; metabolism appears rapid via N-demethylation and reduction of the β-keto group (phase-I) followed by conjugation.

Powder is tan-brown, only sparingly soluble in water; volumetric solutions in 95 % ethanol or PG : VG (1 mg / 2 mL) help accurate micro-dosing. Community harm-reduction warns of a pronounced ‘steep climb’ in effect above 80 mg and recommends keeping 4 mg naloxone on hand, with re-dosing every 20-30 min if respiratory depression re-emerges. Early pharmacology suggests minimal β-arrestin-2 recruitment, potentially lowering respiratory risk versus morphine, but no human data confirm this. Duration subjectively exceeds 7-OH (~4 h) and kratom leaf (~5 h), with many users reporting **8-10 h** analgesia from 50 mg oral. Long-term use may provoke kratom-like gastrointestinal discomfort, constipation, and adrenergic rebound on withdrawal; slow tapers (-10 % weekly) mirror other semi-synthetic kratom alkaloids.",

      "notes": "2-MEC appeared on grey-market menus around 2012 as a mephedrone substitute. Users consider it a weaker, shorter-acting empathogen with more push, frequent tachycardia, and quick tolerance stacking, so precise weighing and conservative session caps are vital.\n\nEmpirical data on 2-MEC is scarce; the compound is mentioned in forensic surveys of cathinone seizures and isomer-separation studies. User reports suggest it is weaker but longer-lasting than mephedrone, with a smoother empathogenic profile but stronger cardiovascular load. Dose brackets above were extrapolated by averaging figures reported for its close analog 4-MEC (oral threshold 15-50 mg; strong 150-300 mg) and adjusting upward ~20-30 % to account for the steric hindrance of the ortho-methyl group. Analytical papers confirm 2-MEC appears in ‘NRG-2’ commercial blends, often adulterated with 4-MEC or 3-MMC—multi-reagent testing plus GC-MS/Fourier-transform IR is advised. Anecdotal harm-reduction tips include strict session caps (<400 mg total), aggressive oral hydration with electrolytes, magnesium for bruxism, and 48-hour cooling-off periods to curb compulsive redosing. No controlled pharmacokinetic data exist, but its β-keto structure and N-ethyl group imply a plasma half-life of roughly 2-3 h with active metabolites. Severe vasoconstriction, hyperthermia, and hyponatraemia have been observed clinically after multi-gram binges; keep external body temperature below 38 °C and avoid marathon dancing.",

Expect a short, cleaner lift with a steep comedown, avoid MAOIs, and focus on hydration, nutrition, and sleep while exploring it.\n\n2-MA is roughly one-tenth as potent as dextro-amphetamine by weight. Human experience is scarce and largely confined to research-chemical circles. Users report a functional, ‘clean’ stimulation with relatively muted euphoria compared to classic amphetamine, but higher doses (>50 mg insufflated) can induce anxiety, peripheral vasoconstriction, tremor and, occasionally, brief auditory/visual distortions. Being an ortho-methyl analogue, it appears to have low serotonergic activity and is therefore unlikely to exhibit MDMA-like neurotoxicity, yet formal toxicology studies are absent. Because pharmacokinetics are uncharacterised, conservative dosing (spaced at least 4–6 h) and active cooling/hydration are strongly advised. Users with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or anxiety disorders should avoid.",

Clinical references corroborate a long half-life (~25–33 h) and flag potent pharmacokinetic interactions—valproate can double lamotrigine levels, while carbamazepine or ethinylestradiol can halve them—explaining several adverse-event threads on harm-reduction boards. Titration must start at 25 mg every other day to avoid rash; typical maintenance 100-200 mg divided once or twice daily.

Mitragynine acts on mu-opioid receptors and can cause physical dependence. Overdose can result in toxicity, including vomiting, pulmonary edema, and, in rare cases, death. There are reports of mitragynine being used in combination with other substances, which increases risk. The plant material is usually consumed as a tea or chewed; extracts are also available.",

Parallel inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein raises systemic exposure to many substrates, while blockade of OATP1A2 can paradoxically lower absorption of agents such as fexofenadine. Interaction magnitude varies with cultivar (white > ruby red > sweetie), agronomic conditions and processing; clarified or furanocoumarin-stripped beverages carry minimal risk. Bitter Seville orange, tangelo and pomelo contain the same furanocoumarins and pose similar hazards. Chronic daily use (>200 ml for ≥3 days) produces cumulative CYP3A4 loss that extends the interaction window to 72 h. Older adults, patients on polypharmacy or narrow-therapeutic-index drugs should avoid grapefruit entirely. Subjective effects are confined to bitter-sweet citrus flavour and mild pro-kinetic gastric stimulation; no tolerance or dependence develops.",

      "notes": "6-APB acts as a potent serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent and is a high-efficacy full agonist at 5-HT₂B (Kᵢ ≈ 3.7 nM), making chronic or high-frequency use a theoretical driver of drug-induced valvular heart disease; users who dose more than monthly should consider periodic echocardiography. Freebase is ~20 % stronger than HCl and ~65 % stronger than succinate; convert doses accordingly to avoid accidental overdose. Oral onset can exceed one hour; premature redosing is the leading cause of toxic 150 mg+ exposures. Strong doses (>90 mg HCl) produce MDA-like closed-eye visuals, pronounced vasoconstriction, bruxism, mydriasis, and mild hyperthermia; pre-loading 200-400 mg magnesium and maintaining aggressive hydration (500 mL h⁻¹ water + balanced electrolytes) mitigate muscle tension and hyponatraemia. In vivo microdialysis shows lower serotonergic neurotoxic potential than MDMA, yet rat studies still reveal oxidative stress markers—co-administration of antioxidants (α-lipoic acid, ascorbate) is prudent. 5-HT₂B agonism is substantially greater than MDMA, so spacing sessions ≥6 weeks and avoiding other 5-HT₂B agonists (e.g., fenfluramine) is essential. Acute adverse events include hypertension spikes, nystagmus, and panic; first-line management is 0.1 mg kg⁻¹ IV diazepam, external cooling, and cyproheptadine 12 mg PO if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Metabolic studies in rats identify hydroxylated amphetamine derivatives; active human half-life is estimated 4-6 h with subjective effects persisting due to slow redistribution. Structural analogues such as 6-FAB (para-fluoro) show reduced 5-HT₂B efficacy in silico and may represent future harm-reduction pivots once empirically verified.",

PIHKAL identifies **12–25 mg HCl** as the active range; community consensus since 2000 converges on **15–22 mg oral** for full visuals. Sulfur-containing ‘T’ series compounds have a steep dose–response curve and **pronounced gastrointestinal distress**; splitting doses over 60 min or dissolving in acidic citrus juice markedly reduces nausea. Intranasal administration produces an intense, fast-rising peak but carries **higher incidence of vasospasm and burning pain**; doses >12 mg insufflated have precipitated vomiting and myoclonus (Bluelight field reports). EMCDDA risk assessment documents tablets seized in Europe containing ~10 mg 2C-T-2, occasionally mis-sold as mescaline or 2C-T-7, underscoring misidentification risk. Metabolism is presumed to mirror 2C-B via oxidative deamination and O-demethylation; in vitro microsome studies show CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 involvement, suggesting potential pharmacogenomic variability. No human kinetic paper exists; user plasma assays indicate an **effective elimination t½ ≈ 4–6 h**, with subjective persistence beyond plasma clearance owing to active O-desmethyl metabolites. Tolerance builds rapidly—24 h abstinence halves intensity; full reset requires ≥7 days. High-efficacy 5-HT2B activity is unstudied, yet chronic weekly use is discouraged pending valvular data. First-aid for adverse reactions follows serotonin-syndrome protocol: 8–12 mg cyproheptadine PO, benzodiazepines (0.1 mg kg⁻¹ diazepam IV) and external cooling. Avoid **MAOI + 2C-T-2** experiments: fatalities occurred with the closely related 2C-T-7.",

It is usually sold on blotter paper and is active at microgram doses. There is little evidence of physical toxicity or long-term harm, but psychological risks (such as anxiety or panic) are possible, especially at high doses or in unsuitable settings.

A 10 mg insufflated dose produces rapid rush, numb extremities, manic sociability and tunnel-vision dissociation within five minutes, peaking at ≈40 min and fading by two hours. Duration rarely exceeds four hours, encouraging redose cycles that escalate total intake >100 mg day⁻¹; several reports link such binges to paranoid ideation and involuntary jaw clenching. Subjective stimulation exceeds 3-MeO-PCP yet mental dissociation is shallower, making the compound deceptively functional—users report productive gaming sessions, urban wandering and party chatter. Combination with cannabis unmasks deeper dissociative visuals (radial, gelatinous distortions) and body-load, while benzodiazepines truncate stimulation but leave cognitive fragmentation. Preliminary receptor screening (Wallach, pers. comm.) suggests mixed NMDA antagonism and triple monoamine re-uptake inhibition (SERT≈NET≈DAT), rationalising the dual stimulant/dissociative profile. No controlled pharmacokinetic data exist; community assays imply fast redistribution (subjective half-life ≈1 h) with elimination t₁⁄₂ 2-4 h. Tolerance to stimulant effects appears after 2-3 consecutive doses and resets over 3-5 days; dissociative tolerance lingers longer. Intravenous use is undocumented; vaporisation degrades product at >220 °C and is not recommended. Users prone to compulsive stim-dissociative patterns should pre-portion doses, employ nasal saline rinses, and limit sessions to <1 g per month.",

It cyclises in plasma (t₁⁄₂ ≈ 3-4 min) to diazepam; elimination half-life of the parent is ~0.75 h, while diazepam produced exhibits its typical 20-40 h half-life. Community users exploit the powder's hygroscopic nature to prepare aqueous or PEG/ethanol solutions for oral dropper dosing but note variable potency (~0.7-1.0× diazepam by mass) and sticky handling issues. Subjective reports describe a 'flat' diazepam-like sedation with strong muscle relaxation yet reduced early euphoria unless ≥50-75 mg are taken. High doses may reveal nonlinear conversion kinetics, giving diminishing returns beyond ~200 mg. Harm-reduction advice stresses sterile technique if injected, refrigeration of aqueous solutions (<4 °C, ≤30 days), and gradual tapers comparable to diazepam schedules.",

Controlled studies show a single 10 mg IM injection quells acute agitation as effectively as haloperidol but with fewer extrapyramidal reactions. Orally-disintegrating formulations dissolve in under one minute and reach measurable plasma levels faster than standard tablets. Mean elimination half-life is ~30 h (range 21-54 h), explaining next-day lethargy. Case reports of ingestions >40 mg document coma, miotic pupils and hypoventilation—clinical presentation that can mimic opioid toxicity—managed with airway support and monitoring. Frequent recreational use is discouraged due to significant metabolic liabilities (weight gain, insulin resistance) and the risk of habituating to antipsychotic 'trip-abort' strategies.",

LC-MS casework places fatal blood concentrations as low as 3 ng·mL⁻¹ when co-ingested with opioids. Metabolised to **α-hydroxyphenazolam**, prolonging sedation beyond the parent's 10-15 h β-elimination. Harm-reduction best practice is precise volumetric dosing (≥ 1 mg in 10 mL 50 % ethanol-water), amber dropper bottles, desiccant storage, and explicit labeling. Jurisdictions including the UK (ACMD 2024 update) and several US states have issued temporary class controls after clusters of blackout-related accidents. Withdrawal mirrors other triazolo-BZDs: onset 24-48 h post-cessation, risk of seizures; tapering with a long-acting agent or medical supervision is advised.",

Build in recovery time and protect airways when handling the powder.\n\nFirst appeared on European grey-market vendors in early-2025; GC-MS reference spectra correspond to CAS 101688-16-8. Community reports place potency between ketamine and PCP but with a more sedating body-load and a noticeably shorter plateau (≈1–2 h). A r/dissociatives user found 10-15 mg vaped on an e-mesh produced a clear-headed, ketamine-like dissociation lasting ~90 min, while 20 mg produced stronger but still lucid effects. The same thread confirms rapid onset when vaporised and minimal hallucinations below 25 mg. Moderators on r/researchchemicals warn of a theoretical μ-opioid component (based on older unverified assays) and advise starting ≤5 mg until more data emerge. Some r/researchchemicals member thread placed an oral ‘sweet‑spot’ around 15‑20 mg for naïve users with a 4‑hour plateau. Rectal administration is popular; although, one user experienced pronounced ataxia at 32 mg, while cumulatively 170 mg spread across a night produced disorientation, memory gaps and next‑day fatigue. Vendor write-ups describe it as “long-lasting and highly potent”; reagent testing (Mandelin/Mecke) plus FT-IR or GC-MS is recommended because early shipments were confused with O-PCPr and O-PCE. Powder is hygroscopic and clings electrostatically—volumetric dosing in PG or EtOH-water (10 mg/mL) avoids milligram-scale error. No formal pharmacokinetic papers exist; user toxicology screens detect parent compound ≤12 h post-dose, implying elimination t½ of roughly 3-6 h. Cross-tolerance with other aryl-cyclohexylamines develops rapidly; spacing sessions by ≥7 days is advised to restore baseline NMDA sensitivity.",

      "notes": "PPAP's sublingual route can irritate mucosa and its effect curve plateaus quickly. Tolerance tends to fade after roughly three days, but reagent testing and sub-10 mg allergy checks remain best practice.\n\nPPAP is the selegiline-derived prototype of the ‘monoaminergic activity enhancer’ family. In contrast to amphetamine, it only augments neurotransmitter release *when* an action potential arrives, producing a smoother cognition-boosting profile with minimal euphoria. Animal work (2 mg kg⁻¹ i.p.) shows doubled dopamine/noradrenaline release without overflow, and no stereotypy until 25-50 mg kg⁻¹. Human self-experiments describe clear focus, wakefulness and pro-social energy at 20-80 mg oral, with a plateau lasting ~3 h and negligible crash. Reddit reports (10-30 mg) confirm synergy with modafinil or prescription stimulants, while a 1100 mg overdose mainly produced anxiety and tremor, hinting at a wide toxicity window but steeply rising side-effects. Users emphasise titration with an analytical milligram scale; volumetric dosing of HCl salt into 10 mg/mL water is common. Threshold activity via insufflation (~2-5 mg) suggests high bioavailability. Unlike selegiline, PPAP shows no measurable MAO inhibition up to 50 mg kg⁻¹ in rodents. Estimated elimination half-life in humans is 4-6 h based on subjective offset and rat PK parallels. Because it is unscheduled federally in the US yet an amphetamine analogue, customs seizures occur; reagent testing cannot distinguish PPAP from propylamphetamine. Storage: light-protected, desiccated ≤4 °C to prevent gradual discoloration and potency loss.",

One detailed account described 25 mg fumarate orally as “indistinguishable from 2 g potent cubensis”.

Peak plasma amphetamine appears 1-4 h post-dose. Elimination half-life for parent + metabolites is highly variable (1-17 h) and is prolonged in alkaline urine. Cardiovascular concerns parallel other amphetamines; case-control data link chronic anorectic use to pulmonary arterial hypertension, so limit weekly use and monitor BP. Urine screens >500 ng/mL 'amphetamine' after clobenzorex will also contain the specific metabolite 4-hydroxy-clobenzorex—confirmatory testing can distinguish therapeutic use from illicit amphetamine. Users emphasise smaller test doses (≤25 mg) due to biphasic profile: a short punchy alertness that dips after 2 h before a shallow, long tail. Split-dosing (e.g., 30 mg a.m. + 15 mg noon) reduces the midday slump. Stay hydrated, supplement magnesium/potassium, and schedule at least 48 h stimulant-free to keep tolerance manageable.",

Aminorex analogues have been linked to pulmonary arterial hypertension after chronic use, so strict cycle limits (under two weeks continuous) and cardiovascular screening are prudent. The lipophilic CF₃ group may lengthen elimination half-life (estimated 8-12 h) and promote accumulation. Reagent-test cross-reactions are unreliable—confirm identity with GC-MS or, at minimum, multi-step reagent testing. Serious adverse events reported for aminorex-class stimulants include pulmonary edema, right-heart strain, and psychotic agitation at binge-level doses. Because fluminorex has never reached the grey market in observable quantities, any powder sold online should be assumed mislabelled until proven otherwise.",

      "notes": "In vitro transporter assays show EDMC releases 5-HT (EC50 ≈ 347 nM), NE (327 nM) and DA (496 nM) – roughly 1.4- to 3.7-fold weaker than methylone, implying human psychoactive doses in the low-to-mid-hundreds of milligrams. Very limited human data exist; the few r/researchchemicals and Discord reports describe ‘gentler-than-MDMA’ empathy with a more β-keto-like peripheral stimulation and a quick, fatigue-heavy comedown. No controlled pharmacokinetic work has been published; based on structural analogy the elimination half-life is tentatively placed at 4-7 h. Reagent testing is essential: seizures in 2024–25 show many samples sold as “EDMC” actually contained eutylone or N,N-dimethylpentylone. Use a 0.001 g scale, pre-dose individual gel-caps, drink 250-500 mL water / h with electrolytes under exertion, and avoid re-dosing inside the same session. Anecdotal tolerance resets after ~7-10 days; waiting two weeks between sessions minimises neurochemical stress. No animal neurotoxicity data are available, but other SNDRA cathinones show oxidative stress and hyperthermia-mediated neuro- and cardiotoxicity at high doses – keep ambient temperature <25 °C and take cooling breaks when dancing.",

      "notes": "Oral bioavailability doubles when taken with food; dosing on an empty stomach delivers only ~36 % of the intended exposure, leading users to redose unnecessarily. Therapeutic QTc prolongation averages 10–20 msec, but heavy recreational (>160 mg/day) or IV diversion markedly increases torsade risk. IM ziprasidone reaches Cmax within 60 min and has a 2–5 h half-life, making it a common ER ‘trip-stopper’. Forum reports describe 60–120 mg oral as a reliable ‘stimulant-comedown knockout’, with sleep onset 2–4 h after dosing. Extrapyramidal reactions (akathisia, dystonia) and very rare tardive dystonia have occurred after weeks on 80–120 mg/day regimens. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is possible with massive overdose or polysubstance stacking. Because diversion is rare, material found on the grey-market is usually legitimate pharmacy stock; nonetheless, verify capsules are intact, avoid crushing/insufflating (poor absorption and nasal mucosal damage). Always baseline ECG (>450 msec QTc is a red flag) before experimenting above 40 mg.\n\nOral elimination half-life averages 7-10 hours (2-4 hours IM) with minimal active metabolites, so resedation can recur when large oral loads are stacked. QT risks rise sharply with hypokalaemia, bradycardia or interacting drugs, and even though weight gain is milder than with clozapine or olanzapine it still warrants lipid and glucose monitoring. Recreational users note that peak sedation may lag 5-8 hours and depends on taking the dose with at least 500 kcal of fat, so mistiming invites redose stacking and extrapyramidal symptoms.",

Bluelight and Drugs-Forum reports converge on 20-40 mg insufflated or 60-70 mg oral as 'sweet-spot' working doses, giving 4-7 h of focused, non-jittery productivity and social facilitation. Higher pushes (≥90 mg oral or ≥70 mg intranasal) add peripheral vasoconstriction, bruxism and tremor without proportional euphoria. Multiple IV users describe 100-150 mg boluses as providing a cocaine-like rush but an intense compulsive redose cycle and severe vein irritation: IV use is strongly discouraged. Animal data show hyperthermia, locomotor sensitisation and dopaminergic neurotoxicity after large binge doses (4 × 80 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic work suggests a short plasma t½ of ~1-2 h with cathinone as a metabolite; expect rapid crash and craving. Reagent testing (Marquis, Mecke, Simon's) gives weak reactions—confirm identity with GC-MS where possible as mis-sold α-PVP or MDPV is common.

Human toxicokinetic work and forensic cases suggest a plasma elimination half-life of ~80-120 min, yet subjective stimulation often persists 4-6 h, likely due to slow brain egress and active metabolites. Forum users consistently warn that dosing accuracy below 5 mg requires a 0.001 g (milligram) scale or volumetric solution because eyeballing crystals leads to runaway binges. Acute harms include severe peripheral vasoconstriction, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia and excited-delirium deaths; benzodiazepines are first-line in emergencies, while beta-blockers alone are contraindicated. Redosing dramatically increases psychosis risk—visual ‘shadow people’, persecutory delusions and tactile hallucinations typically emerge after 24-48 h sleep loss. Harm-reduction best practice: pre-measure single doses, cap total session ≤20 mg, maintain aggressive hydration + electrolytes, supplement with magnesium to reduce bruxism, and schedule 2-week stimulant breaks to reset tolerance and dopamine function. Testing with multi-reagent kits is essential—bath-salt powders frequently contain α-PVP or eutylone masquerading as MDPV.",

A 2022 forensic case reported fatal ventricular tachycardia with femoral blood 26 ng/mL, illustrating low LD50 margin. Fluorine substitution is predicted to raise metabolic stability, extending active phase relative to alkyl-only peers. User reports indicate very rapid onset when freebased (steam on foil), but subjective potency roughly half that of α-PVP: common ‘one-hit’ loads are 10-15 mg, with compulsive re-hits every 10-15 min. Intranasal use burns intensely and produces drip-induced gagging; many switch to glass-pipe inhalation. Tolerance rises sharply after a single night of use and fades over ~1-2 weeks. Harm-reduction best practices include volumetric solutions for accurate micro-dosing, pulse-ox monitoring, strict session limits (<150 mg total 24 h) and aggressive hydration/electrolyte replacement. Because MFPVP often appears as off-white crystals mixed with eutylone or NEP, multi-reagent testing (Marquis, Simon, Froehde) plus FT-IR or GC-MS confirmation is advised before consumption.",

      "notes": "Flmodafinil (CRL-40,940; bisfluoromodafinil) adds a para-fluorine to each phenyl ring of modafinil, raising DAT affinity ~2-4-fold and improving lipophilicity. Rat EEG work shows robust wake-promoting activity without classic amphetamine-like locomotor sensitisation. Unlike modafinil it does **not** induce major CYP450 enzymes, so drug–drug interactions are fewer at single doses. Human anecdotes converge on a shorter subjective length (~8 h) with crisper onset but a *later* spike in anxiety 6–8 h post-dose; keeping daily use ≤100 mg and finishing before 10 a.m. reduces sleep disruption. Powder is poorly water-soluble—users dissolve in warm propylene-glycol or weigh onto micro-spoons; volumetric solutions at 50 mg/mL are common. Insufflation produces faster lift but nasal irritation and chemical burn complaints are frequent—saline rinses advised.\n\nBecause material sold online ranges from 90–99 % purity, a 0.001 g scale is essential. Single-session tolerance is minor but 3-day consecutive dosing halves potency; 5–7 drug-free days restore baseline. Cross-tolerance exists with modafinil, adrafinil, armodafinil and fluoro-adrafinil analogues.\n\nRegular liver-panel monitoring is prudent for multi-week regimens even though flmodafinil lacks the sulfoxide-to-sulfone metabolism that burdens adrafinil. Athletes should note that WADA prohibits all DAT blockers; detection windows for flmodafinil metabolites in urine exceed 48 h.",

Blotter and pellet products often under-dose or degrade; volumetric dosing of a lab-weighed solution (1 mg/10 mL ethanol-water) is strongly advised. Forum users stress setting strict upper limits (≤0.5 mg per 12 h) and avoiding daily use to prevent tolerance and severe withdrawal. Analytical reports have detected fluclotizolam co-present with flubromazolam or fentanyl in post-mortem samples, underscoring the need for reagent/LC-MS confirmation before use.",

Weak MAO-A inhibition appears at ~130 µM, relevant only at very high doses. Anecdotal oral threshold 25–50 mg produces mild wakefulness; 75–200 mg common range yields pronounced alertness, mydriasis and appetite suppression. Intranasal use burns sharply; IV trials ≤40 mg deliver an instantaneous ‘spike’ of clean stimulation lasting ~2 h but risk vasospasm—use sterile, micron-filtered solutions only. Systolic BP rises of 20–30 mm Hg are typical; carry a cuff if combining with caffeine or exercise. Half-life is estimated 1–2 h, so tolerance and redose cravings develop fast; allow 24 h wash-out before other stimulants/serotonergics due to MAOI component. Marquis reagent gives weak yellow-orange—confirm identity by GC-MS/LC-MS. Powder is fluffy and static-prone; volumetric dosing (10 mg/mL in PG or EtOH) improves accuracy.",

LC-MS/MS case studies confirm nifoxipam appears in flunitrazepam urine screens, supporting its status as an active metabolite. Stability is poorer than many other designer benzos (notable degradation at 4 °C after one week), so freeze samples for testing. Recommended practices: weigh powder on a 0.001-g scale, dissolve 10 mg in 100 mL 190-proof ethanol or propylene glycol for 0.1-mg/mL titration, limit sessions to ≤2 mg every 24 h, and keep at least four weeks between multi-day binges to reset tolerance. Because CNS depression is easily underestimated, always dose with a sober sitter and avoid driving for at least 24 h after strong sessions.",

Users report pronounced mucosal irritation: dry-rail 25 mg intranasal \"burns worse than 80 mg 4F-MPH\" and causes prolonged congestion; isotonic saline rinses are recommended. The free base volatilizes easily and can be inhaled from foil, producing a \"crack-like bell-ringer\" but harsher on lungs – short sessions advised, use glassware, avoid plastics. Intravenous use gives about a 10-minute rush with 1-2 hours of euphoria; the solution is highly caustic even when filtered – vein darkening reported; always dilute at least 1:50 in bacteriostatic saline, use micron filters, rotate sites, and apply warm compresses. Oral capsules (25-40 mg) produce cleaner stimulation with less vascular strain; onset ~15 minutes, plateau 2-3 hours. Because DMNPC blocks voltage-gated Na+ channels similarly to cocaine, cardiac conduction slowing and local anaesthesia (tongue numbness) occur – avoid if predisposed to arrhythmia. Very limited pharmacokinetic data exist; anecdotal ability to sleep 4 hours post-dose suggests a plasma half-life around 2-4 hours, but an active N-desmethyl metabolite may extend SERT occupancy. Reagent-test every batch and fentanyl-screen before any human assay; the compound is newly emergent (first retail listings in late 2024) and spectral mis-identification is plausible. Volumetric liquid dosing (10 mg/mL propylene glycol) helps precise titration for oral or rectal routes while bypassing nasal damage.",

Forum users stress volumetric dosing due to clumpy hygroscopic crystals, aggressive nasal burn, and a steep dose-response above 150 mg. Acute side-effects include tachycardia (110-140 bpm), hypertension (>160 mmHg systolic), nystagmus, and delayed urinary retention similar to other diarylethylamines. No human pharmacokinetic study is published; analog modelling and rat microsome data suggest an elimination half-life of 4-8 h with active hydroxylated metabolites. Because 2-F-DPPy is unscheduled in many regions, street samples are frequently cut with ephenidine or MXPr—multi-reagent screening and, ideally, GC-MS confirmation are advised. Harm-reduction best practice: cap sessions at <250 mg oral per 24 h, maintain 10-day washouts to reset tolerance, hydrate aggressively, and avoid operating machinery for 12 h post-use.",

It is 17α-methylated, so pre-cycle, mid-cycle, and post-cycle liver panels (ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin) are mandatory. Daily intake of 500-1000 mg NAC or 250-500 mg TUDCA is routinely recommended on forums. Blood pressure and a full lipid panel should be checked; HDL often drops 30-40% and LDL rises markedly. Because endogenous testosterone is suppressed within days, a SERM-based PCT (e.g., tamoxifen 40/40/20/20 mg) plus an over-the-counter liver and lipid stack is advised. Even though gyno is rare (no aromatase), users report occasional progesterone-like nipple sensitivity—keep a low-dose AI or cabergoline on hand. Lower-back ‘pump’ and shin splints respond to taurine (3-5 g) and hydration. Splitting the daily dose (a.m./p.m.) or using even-spaced micro-capsules can flatten hormone spikes and reduce insomnia and irritability. Never exceed 8 weeks or 75 mg/day without medical supervision; cases of severe cholestatic jaundice and peliosis hepatis have been documented after OTC clones containing Halodrol.",

Laboratory studies consistently place 4‑BMC among serotonin‑preferring transport‑blockers with measurable but lower dopaminergic activity, explaining its reputation for mild entactogenic rather than stimulating effects. Forum reports indicate that oral threshold is around 20mg, producing weak stimulation, while doses over 100mg (plugged or insufflated) can produce 'calm euphoria' comparable to a clean roll. Rectal use at around 150mg produced strong but relatively short-lasting euphoria, with users noting a short duration and strong desire to redose. Animal and in vitro data confirm potent inhibition of serotonin uptake—approximately 15-fold more effective than methcathinone at SERT—with notable neurotoxic and cytotoxic potential common to halogenated cathinones. Toxicity concerns include tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, and sweating (based on analog data), as well as potential oxidative neurotoxicity. Harm reduction: start low (≤20mg), dose slowly with long wait times, stay hydrated, avoid mixing stimulant substances or MAOIs, and use reagent testing to verify compound identity due to common adulteration. Prolonged or high-dose use may lead to dependence and cardiovascular stress.",

(R)-enantiomer is a selective DAT inhibitor that markedly increases progressive-ratio responding in rats, confirming genuine stimulant properties. The compound is the only racetam banned in-competition by WADA for performance enhancement; athletes have returned positives from single 200 mg doses. Forum users report clear, speedy mental energy at 100-200 mg but emphasize that tolerance becomes obvious after as little as two consecutive days, recommending 1-2×/week scheduling and choline (CDP- or ALCAR) support to counter racetam-induced acetylcholine depletion. Nasal use produces a harsh burn and a short, intense rush; one 75 mg insufflated dose produced palpitations—volumetric oral dosing is strongly advised. Common adverse effects include elevated heart-rate, irritability, facial flushing and late-night insomnia if taken <8 h before bed. Because grey-market powders vary widely in purity, use multi-reagent testing or independent COA verification and start with ≤50 mg allergy test.",

Anecdotal reports cluster around 5-15 mg when purity is uncertain, so volumetric dosing in ethanol (0.1 mg mL⁻¹) is strongly recommended. Users emphasise strict session caps (<8 mg oral, <4 mg nasal) to prevent accidental escalation. No human fatalities are documented as of July 2025, but the safety margin above 10 mg remains undefined. Tolerance builds after a single moderate dose and dissipates in ~7-10 days. Cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics is complete.",

      "notes": "XR uses 50 % immediate-release and 50 % delayed-release beads; crushing defeats the time-release, converting it to an IR preparation with higher peak plasma levels. Bioavailability is reduced by high-fat meals and increased gastric pH. Street diversion often leads to nasal insufflation, raising risk of septal irritation and pulmonary talcosis from inert bead spheres. Acute harms include tachyarrhythmia, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and psychosis; these escalate sharply above 60 mg or when redosed within 6 h. Hydration, electrolyte balance, ambient temperature control, and scheduled nutrition breaks reduce acute toxicity. Because amphetamine is excreted renally in unchanged form, acidified urine hastens clearance during adverse reactions. Use a milligram-accurate scale for volumetric dosing of bead powder; start ≤15 mg on first exposure and wait a full day before reassessing due to the bimodal release profile. Long-term heavy use (>40 mg/d for months) has been linked to cortical grey-matter thinning, blunted dopaminergic response, and cardiomyopathy. Periodic 48- to 72-h drug-free ‘reset’ windows slow tolerance accrual.",

Forum users emphasise starting ≤0.25 mg every 48 h to limit insomnia, anxiety and HR ↑8-15 bpm. Because the compound is sold by research-chemical vendors, authenticity varies; reagent TLC plus chiral GC-MS is advised. Due to transporter ratios (NET≈1.7 nM, SERT≈11 nM, DAT≈65 nM) clinical weight-loss occurs at 0.25-0.5 mg q.d.; above 1 mg no extra efficacy but marked pressor response. Accumulation means missed doses do not immediately reverse appetite suppression; many users shift to 0.25-0.5 mg twice weekly once steady-state is achieved.

Laboratory seizure papers contain 290-820 µg per 6 mm blotter, often hot-spotted. The molecule is heat- and acid-labile; oral swallowing destroys most activity, so users hold tabs under the tongue for 15-30 min. Forum reports describe pronounced open-eye patterning, saturated colour shifts and a phenethylamine-style body euphoria that peaks earlier than LSD. A 2023 French toxicology case linked 25E-NBOH (blotter) plus the stimulant MDPHP to serotonin syndrome and loss of consciousness requiring ICU admission, illustrating how co-ingestion magnifies risk. Rodent assays show full 5-HT2A agonism (locomotor suppression and DOM-like discriminative stimulus) at sub-milligram doses, confirming very high potency. Because NBOHs thermally decompose to their 2C parent in a hot GC inlet, forensic labs must use LC-MS or derivatisation to avoid mis-identification. Harm reduction: keep single-use doses <1 mg, use precise volumetric or blotter-laid dosing, test with Ehrlich/Marquis (expect weak or no reaction), avoid stacking strong sympathomimetics, and have benzodiazepines on hand for acute agitation.",

      "notes": "Bromonordiazepam (also desalkyl-gidazepam) is the active metabolite of the Ukrainian anxiolytic gidazepam and is now sold online as a long-acting RC benzo. Recreational users estimate ~6 mg ≈ 10 mg diazepam, placing it at roughly 0.6 × diazepam potency. Light anxiolysis emerges at 3-6 mg, while sleep-inducing doses ≥15 mg risk prolonged psychomotor impairment the next day. The elimination half-life averages 86-90 h, with forensic casework suggesting a range of 72-120 h; metabolites can be detected in urine up to 18 days post-dose. Because of this, every-other-day dosing is recommended to avoid accumulation. Long half-life and low peak intensity make it popular for substitution/tapering from high-potency benzos (e.g., bromazolam), but large gaps (3-4 days) between cuts are needed before withdrawal symptoms emerge. Volumetric dosing (e.g., 1 mg/mL ethanol-propylene glycol) greatly improves accuracy for powders that often test 80-95 % purity by GC-MS. Users report clean anxiolysis with minimal euphoria; high doses cause flat affect, retrograde amnesia, dysarthria, and falls. Overdoses are usually benign when taken alone but become life-threatening with opioids or alcohol; keep flumazenil unavailable to laypersons due to seizure risk.",

      "notes": "Agmatine is an endogenous amine stored in synaptic vesicles and released on neuronal activation. It agonises imidazoline I1/I2 sites, inhibits NOS, and blocks NMDA receptor channels in a voltage-dependent manner, collectively producing mild anxiolysis, vascular smooth-muscle relaxation, and anti-addictive effects. Oral bioavailability is roughly 30 %, with plasma half-life 75-120 min but brain/spinal half-life ~12 h, explaining why twice-daily split dosing maintains opioid-tolerance–reversal despite short plasma kinetics. Clinical and case data show chronic ingestion of 2.67 g/day for five years with normal lab values, yet forum users report tachyphylaxis of subjective effects after 2-3 weeks; cycling (2 weeks on / 1 week off) restores efficacy. For opioid harm-reduction, 500-1500 mg taken 1-2 h *after* the opioid appears to prolong analgesia and reduce required dose, whereas pre-dosing helps attenuate emerging tolerance. High doses (>3 g) occasionally cause transient dizziness, diarrhoea, or profound diuresis due to vasopressin inhibition—keep fluids and electrolytes balanced. Because agmatine lowers blood pressure, hypotensive or dehydrated users should start at the low end of the range and titrate slowly.",

Reported adverse events include delayed convulsive overdose 8-9 h after a 3 mL redose plus alcohol, and daytime microsleeps while driving. Forum users recommend: pre-measured oral syringes, strict 2-h minimum between doses, no mixing with alcohol, and a taper (10 % daily) after multi-day runs to avoid severe rebound insomnia. Laboratory studies find GVL converted hepatically to GHV; GHV shows weaker GABAB affinity but similar autonomic depression. Repeated 100 mg kg⁻¹ (rat) dosing produced neuroadaptive down-regulation of GHB receptor mRNA within one week, suggesting rapid tolerance and dependence mechanisms.

Bluelight users describe mild ‘wired but clear’ stimulation, elevated heart-rate (90-110 bpm resting) and difficulty sleeping for >8 h after ≥200 mg. One vaper reported light euphoria, body warmth and jaw tension after 20–30 mg total free-base inhaled across an evening. 3DQSAR’s structure-activity discussion suggests Methyl-K behaves primarily as a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor with limited oral bioavailability, explaining higher effective doses and the preference for intranasal / rectal routes to improve efficiency. Because almost nothing is published on toxicity, reagent-test every batch, use milligram-scale accuracy, and cap first-session totals at <200 mg oral (or <80 mg nasal) to gauge sensitivity. Strong cross-tolerance with other amphetamine-type stimulants develops after a single strong session and dissipates over ~1 week. No metabolism studies exist, but lipophilicity (LogP ≈ 3.4) and α-propyl chain suggest hepatic N-demethylation followed by oxidative deamination analogous to pentylone; theoretical half-life 3–6 h. Avoid chronic high-frequency use to limit cardiomyopathy and neurotoxicity risk seen with other monoamine transport blockers.",

      "notes": "Flumazenil is the benzodiazepine antidote and can abruptly trigger withdrawal or seizures in dependent individuals. It should only be used with seizure management on standby and careful screening for mixed overdoses.\n\nFlumazenil competitively blocks the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. When used on benzodiazepine-tolerant individuals it can precipitate an abrupt, sometimes life-threatening withdrawal characterised by agitation, hypertension and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Case series show neurologic adverse-event reporting odds ratios >1700 for ‘withdrawal seizures’ in pharmacovigilance databases :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Doses >5 mg cumulatively rarely add benefit; lack of response after 5 mg suggests non-benzodiazepine sedatives are present :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Because its terminal half-life (40-80 min) is often much shorter than diazepam (>30 h) or phenazepam (>60 h), patients require observation for at least 6 h and sometimes a low-rate infusion (0.1-0.5 mg/h) to prevent resedation :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. Intranasal flumazenil (0.04-0.08 mg/kg) reaches therapeutic plasma levels within 10 min and may be useful where IV access is delayed, but data are confined to paediatric pharmacokinetic studies :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Harm-reduction practitioners occasionally micro-dose (0.1-0.2 mg) flumazenil during benzodiazepine tapering protocols to down-regulate tolerance; this should only occur under medical supervision with seizure prophylaxis (e.g., levetiracetam). Always have IV diazepam or midazolam ready to re-treat seizures induced by flumazenil. Multi-reagent test kits do not detect flumazenil; stash-checking services can confirm identity by LC-MS if diversion is suspected.",

Vendor analytics show >98 % purity and crystal morphology similar to methamphetamine. Harm-reduction labs report a clean GC-MS and no β-keto peak, confirming it is not a cathinone. Users describe a functional, cocaine-like stimulation with less peripheral tension than α-PVP, lasting ~5 h with a smooth comedown. Oral bioavailability is high; insufflation adds ~25 % potency but more nasal irritation. Volumetric dosing or micro-spoon scales are recommended—compound is deceptively dense. Typical side-effects are insomnia, dry mouth, anorexia and mild tachycardia; one Reddit case experienced transient ‘adrenaline overload’ after a 25 mg IV bolus. Start ≤5 mg, hydrate, track heart-rate; allow at least 24 h between sessions to limit tolerance. Reagent testing: Mandelin → tan/olive; Marquis → very faint orange; no reaction on Liebermann—use this pattern plus FT-IR to rule out cathinone substitution.\n\nDespite its smoother profile, many users report compulsive redosing and rough comedowns at higher amounts, so treat MD-prolintane with the same respect given to other pyrrolidinophenones.",

      "notes": "Rasagiline irreversibly acylates the flavin site of MAO-B, giving ~90% inhibition at 1 mg/day within 1-2 weeks. Although its plasma half-life is ~3 h, functional recovery depends on MAO-B resynthesis (approx. 40 days), so a single 1 mg dose can keep tyramine thresholds lower for several days. Selectivity diminishes above 2 mg/day, raising dietary and pressor risk comparable to classical non-selective MAOIs. Case surveys and pharmacovigilance reviews document serotonin-syndrome clusters when rasagiline is combined with SSRIs or MDMA-like agents—even at therapeutic doses. Bluelight users typically employ 0.5-1 mg to amplify phenethylamine (β-PEA) or stimulant effects, reporting brighter mood, clearer focus, and longer stimulant plateau, but also warn that >2 mg ‘feels wired’ and makes tyramine flushes more likely. The primary metabolite (R)-1-aminoindan is mildly stimulant and neuroprotective in vitro, which may contribute to perceived clarity without amphetamine-like side-effects. Powder allows accurate volumetric titration (e.g., 0.1 mg/mL in 20% ethanol) and microdosing below 0.25 mg; gelatin capsules disguise bitterness. Always reagent-test party drugs before co-administration and keep 5-HT antagonists (cyproheptadine) on hand in festival settings where serotonergic stacks are common.",

      "notes": "Developed in France (1960s) as ‘Ordinator’ for psychasthenia. Animal work shows competitive inhibition of NE uptake in hypothalamus & DA uptake in striatum, with weaker action on 5-HT. Human fMRI study (20 mg / 50 kg) produced focused sensorimotor activation comparable to 20 mg fluoxetine but with greater sympathetic arousal. Italian prescribing literature described therapeutic split dosing of 20-30 mg/day; recreational users report a sweet-spot of 15-25 mg oral for clean, task-focused stimulation with mild physical euphoria. Higher acute doses (>40 mg) markedly raise BP/HR and anxiety. Insufflation is harsh and lengthens come-up; crystals often recrystallise in nasal cavity—users recommend micronisation or oral only. Unlike pemoline, hepatotoxicity has not been confirmed, yet long-term liver markers are unknown—periodic AST/ALT suggested for chronic use. NDRA profile implies cross-tolerance with amphetamine class; a 48-72 h spacing prevents rapid tachyphylaxis. No data on fatal overdoses; murine LD50 425 mg/kg (PO). Urinary detection possible via GC-MS for weeks; athletes risk doping sanctions. Keep benzo (e.g., 0.5 mg alprazolam) on hand for stimulant-induced panic; avoid redosing past 6 h mark to reduce insomnia rebound. Volumetric solutions (20 mg/mL) sold by RC vendors enable accurate sub-milligram titration—store refrigerated and test with Marquis/Mandelin to rule out cathinone contamination.",

User reports describe an **intense vaporised rush comparable to crack cocaine but fading in ≤30 min**, prompting rapid pipe reloading. The crystalline HCl salt vaporises cleanly around 210 °C yet generates **caustic aerosol** that produces lung discomfort and transient dyspnoea; a 60 : 40 propylene-glycol/glycerin e-liquid mitigates irritation but encourages covert dosing. Intranasal lines ≥40 mg cause severe burn and vasoconstriction; isotonic saline lavage plus vitamin E oil post-use reduces mucosal injury. Oral dosing lengthens effects to ~4 h but raises stochastic tachycardia (HR > 120 bpm) and marked vasospasm (cold extremities). Community harm-reduction recommends **cool environment, aggressive hydration (0.5 L h⁻¹ isotonic), 200–400 mg magnesium**, and immediate cessation if limb numbness or chest pain occurs. Rodent microdialysis suggests faster clearance than α-PiHP (t₁⁄₂ ≈ 3–5 h); active hydroxylated metabolites prolong sympathomimetic stress. Tolerance appears within a single session; full reversal needs ≥10 days. Unlike α-PHP, the 2-methyl substitution slightly lowers lipophilicity, reducing peripheral vasoconstriction yet not central reinforcement. First-aid for psychosis or severe agitation: 10 mg diazepam IV (or 20 mg PO) and external cooling; cyproheptadine 8 mg PO if serotonin-toxicity signs emerge.",

Users describe a slightly quicker come-up (≤30 min) and shorter plateau (~8 h) compared with classic LSD, although metabolic studies are still lacking. Volumetric dosing (dissolving a tab in known volume alcohol/water) is recommended for micro-dosing (≤20 µg). Because potency varies between labs (150–225 µg nominal tabs sometimes test 90–180 µg), start with one unit, wait 3 h before redosing. Cross-tolerance is complete with LSD, 1P-LSD, 1V-LSD etc.; allow ≥10 days for baseline sensitivity. Legal status is rapidly changing—Germany scheduled 1D-LSD on 14 June 2024.",

      "notes": "Oral bioavailability is low; commercial product Gamalate B6 contains only 37.5 mg GABOB per tablet, so six tablets (standard maximum daily therapeutic dose) deliver ~225 mg. Recreational users therefore resort to bulk powder or rectal administration. A Bluelight user reported ‘pretty much without effect’ after 1 g rectally (250 mg then 750 mg 45 min later), suggesting high inter-individual variability and weak potency. Racemic mixtures display stereoselectivity: (R)-GABOB shows moderate GABA_B agonism whereas (S)-GABOB is a partial GABA_B and full GABA_A agonist, the latter doubling anticonvulsant potency. Limited human PK data exist; by analogy with GABA the elimination half-life is estimated 1-2 h, giving a compact effect window. Older clinical papers (1960s) used 50-300 mg parenterally for endocrine provocation, noting transient prolactin/GH rises and no serious toxicity. Animal work indicates a very high oral LD50 (>6 g kg⁻¹ in mice). Neurotoxicity data are sparse; concerns extrapolated from GHB studies (glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity at sub-GABA_B levels) remain theoretical. Standard harm-reduction advice: titrate with ≤300 mg first dose, redose only after 2 h, avoid mixing with depressants, and keep naloxone on hand if opioids are involved. Because bulk GABOB is hygroscopic, store in a desiccated container and weigh doses accurately.",

Users describe a colder, more analytical dissociation than ketamine with clearer head-space yet pronounced motor incoordination. Nasal burns are milder than DCK but saline rinses are still advised. Oral bioavailability appears high; many find 100 mg oral as potent as intranasal. IM use is efficient but requires strict sterile technique and volumetric dosing (20-50 mg typical). Reagent testing (Mandelin + Simon’s) is recommended because powders are often adulterated or mixed with ketamine. Chronic heavy use (>1 g/week for months) has produced cystitis and cognitive dulling; adopt a 2-week minimum cooldown between sessions and limit total daily intake to <150 mg to curb tolerance. Rectal (plugging) gives ~25 % dose-reduction versus snorting and avoids nasal damage. Because fluoride release is minimal (<9 mg per 100 mg 2F-DCK) systemic fluoride toxicity is unlikely at recreational doses.",

Users describe a short-lived, ‘clean’ mental stimulation with mild euphoria, minimal peripheral push, and a relatively soft comedown. Neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and long-term health effects are unknown; treat with the same caution as any novel cathinone-like stimulant. Use accurate scales (±1 mg), start low, stay hydrated, avoid redosing more than once per 4–6 h, and monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Because it is a ketone, false-positive drug-screen cross-reactivity with amphetamines is possible.",

User reports highlight pronounced anorexia, clean but long-lasting ‘speed-paste’ stimulation and muted euphoria compared to classic 4-MAR. Oral dosing is markedly more effective than nasal; vapor/smoke yields harsh pyrolysis products and is strongly discouraged. As with all aminorex derivatives, pulmonary arterial hypertension remains a serious long-term risk—regular echocardiograms are advised for frequent users. Always reagent-test (Mecke produces dark green/black) and start ≤10 mg to gauge potency; batch purity has ranged 60-90 %. Because the drug’s half-life overlaps with next-day activities, plan ≥24 h before sleep is required and hydrate/electrolytes to manage vasoconstriction.",

Reddit and Bluelight users titrating 1→20 mg insufflated found threshold effects at 2-4 mg and a functional, amphetamine-like stimulation around 20 mg with 12-18 h wakefulness but modest euphoria:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. One 55 mg oral trial produced a long but ‘okay’ stimulation and prominent mydriasis for several days:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. Analytical paper confirms bromine-isotopic LC-HRMS signature (m/z 255.0133 [M+H]+) and chiral separation; purity differences between batches (85-98 %) warn of inactive filler or active by-products:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Because halogenated aminorexes lack toxicology, start ≤5 mg, weigh with a 0.001 g scale, avoid redosing inside 24 h, maintain hydration/electrolytes, and monitor temperature.

Pharmacology: in vitro it shows dopamine (DAT) and norepinephrine (NET) reuptake inhibition with little serotonin activity, closely resembling pentedrone (Mardal 2019). Typical acute adverse effects are tachycardia (HR 100–130 bpm), hypertension (>140/95 mm Hg), jaw clenching, peripheral vasoconstriction and hyperthermia. A fatal poly-intoxication in a chemsex setting (plasma 4-MPD 330 ng/mL) has been documented. Because of its short half-life users often re-dose; setting strict dose/time limits, monitoring vitals, active cooling and electrolyte/water balance markedly reduce risk.",

Use allergy test (≤50 µg) and weigh with a 0.1 mg scale followed by volumetric dosing where possible.\n• Limited human data; no published controlled trials. Pharmacology suggests high-affinity 5-HT2A agonism similar to other NBOMes with additional 5-HT2C binding, possibly explaining a heavier body load than 25I/25B.\n• Reagent testing: Marquis – no colour; Froehde – yellow-green; Ehrlich – usually negative (unlike LSD). Use multiple reagents to distinguish from more toxic NBOMes.\n• Strong peripheral stimulation can persist hours after visuals subside; plan for a long experience and avoid redosing.\n• Severe cold extremities or chest pain warrant medical attention – do not delay seeking help.",

Significant inter-individual potency variation (±30 %) has been noted; start at the very low end of the ‘light’ range.\n5.

Naloxone 0.4–2 mg IV/IM will reverse toxicity, but shorter half-life of naloxone means repeat doses or continuous infusion may be required (re-narcotisation common after 30–60 min). Always monitor ≥2 h after last dose. Wear gloves & mask when handling bulk powder: accidental dermal/inhalational exposure has produced poisoning in forensic labs. Because of its short duration many users redose frequently—major driver of overdose.",

Nausea, migraine-like headaches, myalgia and anxiety are common above ~100 mg.\n• Unlike BZP it inhibits several hepatic CYPs (notably 1A2, 2D6, 3A4) which can prolong co-administered drugs.\n• Rodent LD50 (oral) ≈ 400 mg kg⁻¹; no confirmed fatalities as sole agent but severe hyperthermia, seizures and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in poly-drug cases.\n• Weigh carefully, hydrate, avoid redosing (>120 mg markedly increases adverse effects).",

Because of the low potency, users sometimes attempt multi-milligram doses, greatly increasing peripheral toxicity risk (tachycardia, hypertension, vasospasm). Very little formal or anecdotal human data exist; fatalities have not been confirmed but serious adverse reactions (panic, chest pain, prolonged hypertension) have been reported on forums. Due to analytical similarity, blotters sold as other NBOMes/LSD have occasionally contained 25H-NBOMe. Use extreme caution with accurate milligram scales, start with allergy test (<0.25 mg) and avoid redosing. Parenteral routes (IV/IM) are strongly discouraged.",

Acute risks: tachycardia (>130 bpm), hypertension (>160/95 mmHg), vasoconstriction, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, agitation, bruxism, mydriasis and anxiety/panic. Severe complications include rhabdomyolysis and serotonin-toxicity-like syndromes when co-ingested with serotonergic agents. Purity varies (lab analyses 23–72 % free-base by weight); use reagent testing (Marquis: pale yellow → brown) and weigh with a milligram scale. Avoid redosing more than once every 3–4 h to limit cumulative cardiotoxicity. Hydration (250 ml water/hr), electrolyte intake and post-session nutrition (carbohydrates + antioxidants) mitigate the comedown. Users with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, epilepsy or anxiety disorders face disproportionate risk. No chronic neurotoxicity studies exist, but β-keto amphetamines have produced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in rodents at high doses; weekly or less-frequent use and ≥2-week wash-out periods are advised.",

Sub-milligram accuracy is essential; use a 0.1 mg scale and volumetric dosing when possible. Vasoconstriction, tachycardia and peripheral numbness are commonly reported. Serious incidents with the NBOMe/NBMD family include hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, seizures and fatal overdoses – almost always the result of mis-weighed doses. Always start low, dose once per session, ensure calm setting and have benzodiazepines available for anxiety or stimulant-like overstimulation. Swallowing the blotter dramatically reduces bioavailability; keep in mouth 15–30 min for optimal absorption.",

Consider heart-rate/BP monitoring.\n• Several fatal intoxications with closely related NBOMe compounds involved stacking stimulants or MAOIs – avoid poly-drug use.\n• Response is highly individual; start with an allergy test (≤500 µg) on first exposure.",

In vitro data show rapid de-acetylation to 4-HO-DPT, suggesting it acts as a pro-drug. User reports indicate relatively poor oral bio-availability; intranasal or rectal routes produce a shorter but more efficient experience at roughly half oral doses, although the powder can sting sharply when insufflated. The compound is described as a colourful, fast-moving tryptamine with pronounced physical stimulation (tremor, jaw tension, visceral ‘body-load’) and strong, structured visual geometry, yet comparatively little “mystical” depth. Cognitive effects are often analytical and empathogenic, making it attractive for introspection; however, rapid tolerance develops after a single session. Analytical purity varies on the market—always verify with reagent or HPLC where possible. Limited toxicology exists, so conservative dosing, staying hydrated, and having a sober sitter are strongly advised. Weigh every dose on a 0.001 g scale or use volumetric solutions because the free-base and fumarate form have limited aqueous solubility.",

Body-load is highly dose-dependent; doses ≥50 mg frequently produce tachycardia, nausea or vascular tightness. Start low, dose once, stay hydrated, and allocate 12 h without responsibilities. Allow at least 14 days between sessions to minimise rapid tolerance and receptor down-regulation. No formal human pharmacokinetic data exist; limited modelling of blood spots from an emergency-department case suggested an elimination t½ of roughly 5–8 h with active O-desmethyl metabolites possibly extending activity.",

Carry a vasodilator such as aspirin and remain hydrated.\n• Like other NBOMes it can cause severe hypertension or seizures in overdose; deaths have been recorded with related compounds.\n• Never ‘drop’ the solution directly on the tongue—accurate volumetric dosing on blotter or measured liquid is essential. A 0.001 g scale is insufficient; use volumetric dosing or lab-grade microbalance.\n• Sublingual/buccal blotters often become numb; keep in cheek for 15–20 min before swallowing residue.\n• Begin with no more than a light dose to gauge individual sensitivity; potency can vary between batches.",

Standard Marquis/Mandelin reactions parallel MDMA (dark purple/black) but may develop more slowly.\n• Maintain hydration (500–750 ml water/hr maximum with electrolytes), avoid strenuous dancing >30 min without breaks, and cool down if body temperature exceeds 38 °C.\n• Re-dosing markedly increases acute hypertension and serotonin syndrome risk; if you must, wait ≥3 h and keep any booster ≤½ of the initial dose.\n• Because the compound is novel, treat each session as an experiment: have a sober sitter, record exact doses and timing, and avoid poly-drug combinations on first trials.",

Receptor profiling shows high affinity for the NMDA receptor (Ki ≈40 nM) while simultaneously acting as a potent re-uptake inhibitor at DAT, NET and SERT (Ki 5–50 nM) (Wallach 2019). Consequently the subjective profile mixes classic dissociation/analgesia with a lucid, often manic psychostimulation. Reports at ≥8 mg describe pronounced euphoria, pressured thought, elevated BP/HR (+20-40 mm Hg / +20-40 bpm) and occasionally delusional or aggressive behaviour. Duration is shorter than PCP but longer than ketamine; repeated dosing greatly prolongs the tail as with other non-keto arylcyclohexylamines. Accurate 0.001 g scales are mandatory; volumetric dosing in distilled water (up to 50 mg mL-¹) is possible. Rectal and oral routes are preferred to avoid mucosal irritation noted with insufflation. No formal pharmacokinetics exist; one self-experiment detected clear effects for ~10 h after 5 mg + 5 mg rectal 2 h apart (Asante 2021). Avoid driving for a full sleep cycle.",

Analytical papers confirm it hydrolyses in vitro and in vivo to LSD-25; user reports and reagent-testing services (e.g., Miraculix QTest) show the blotters do *not* trigger Ehrlich/DMAB, so lab testing is advised. Community consensus suggests oral potency is about 0.7 of equimolar LSD-25 (e.g., 150 ug 1S ≈ 110 ug LSD), with a noticeably slower come-up but identical plateau once conversion occurs. Because silicon-carbon bonds are hydrolytically labile, storage in dry foil at <10 °C is recommended; moisture can degrade tabs within weeks. Harm-reduction points: always verify blotter identity with multiple reagents, weigh liquid for volumetric dosing, arrange a 14-hour safety window before obligations, and keep benzodiazepines (e.g., 1 mg lorazepam) on hand for panic or prolonged stimulation.",

      "notes": "3-Methylethcathinone (3-MEC, 3-MeEC) is the 3-methyl positional isomer of 4-MEC and a close analogue of mephedrone. It emerged on the grey market around 2012 and is usually encountered as an off-white crystalline powder. Pharmacological data are sparse; in vitro assays suggest it is a mixed dopamine/norepinephrine releaser with weaker serotonergic activity than 4-MMC or MDMA, which is consistent with user reports describing a more alert, ‘speed-like’ character and only mild empathogenic warmth.   Because the subjective peak is brief (≈40–60 min) many users feel compelled to redose every 30–60 min, rapidly escalating total intake and cardiovascular strain. Common acute adverse effects include tachycardia, hypertension, jaw tension, anxiety, and peripheral vasoconstriction; severe hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in cathinone overdoses. Stay hydrated (but avoid over-hydration), keep body temperature under control, and leave at least 2 h between redoses.   Purity of street samples varies and 3-MEC is sometimes mis-sold as 4-MMC/MDMA; reagent testing (e.g., Marquis, Mecke) can help identify adulterants but will not distinguish between cathinone isomers – use a lab GC-MS/LC-MS service where possible. Avoid combining with other stimulants or heavy physical exertion. People with cardiovascular, seizure, or psychiatric disorders should abstain.",

Warm environment and gentle movement reduce discomfort.  \n• Animal work shows significant hyperthermia and head-twitch response at ≥1 mg/kg; keep ambient temperature moderate and hydrate.  \n• Appears to be metabolised mainly by CYP2D6 & CYP3A4 with active O-demethylated metabolites – poor metabolisers may experience prolonged effects.  \n• Solubility: free-base dissolves poorly in ≤20 % ethanol; use ≥95 % ethanol or 1:1 PEG-400/ethanol for solutions (100 µg/mL typical).",

It first appeared in seizures in late-2020 and is often mis-sold as MDMA, leading to 100 mg-scale overdoses. Harm-reduction groups (NZ’s KnowYourStuff) list 20-50 mg as the entire active range; stay below 35 mg until identity confirmed. Forum users describe rapid onset rush, intense peripheral vasoconstriction (cold extremities, chest pressure), and a short 2-hour plateau followed by edgy stimulation that tempts redose. Rodent work (2025) shows nanomolar DAT/NET inhibition, dose-dependent hyper-locomotion and accumbal DA release, suggesting high abuse liability. Reagent testing: Mandelin → reddish-brown; Liebermann → bright yellow, distinguishing it from MDMA. Volumetric solutions (1 mg/mL in PG/ethanol) allow sub-5 mg test doses. Strong hydration, electrolytes, breaks of ≥2 weeks, and benzodiazepine rescue (2-4 mg diazepam equiv.) are recommended to manage crashes and paranoia. Because half-life is short (~2-3 h extrapolated from α-PVP rat PK) but sympathomimetic after-effects linger, insomnia and compulsive re-dosing are major risks.",

Grayanotoxin-like diterpenes have been detected at <0.01 % w/w and may underlie the dissociative ‘pain-beside-me’ effect noted by many users. Field reports emphasise **strict micro-dosing**: most relief is obtained at 3–6 drops (≈150–300 µl) and higher doses often add dysphoria, tremor or nausea. Because the plant is *myco-heterotrophic* and locally sparse, sustainable harvest means taking ≤10 % of a patch and only once the flowers droop. A purple tincture kept in amber glass remains potent ~3 years refrigerated. Powdered root (historically ½–1 drachm) produces heavier somatic numbness and occasional emesis; modern harm-reduction suggests staying below 4 g and combining with ginger to curb nausea. Preliminary mouse work shows significant antinociception at 100 mg kg⁻¹ correlating with salicylic-acid plasma peaks (t½ ≈ 3–5 h). No human fatalities documented, yet glycosidic salicylates can provoke Reye-like hepatic injury in children; avoid in under-16 s. Ghost Pipe should be treated as a *co-analgesic* rather than a primary anaesthetic—users liken its action to ‘moving the pain 6 inches to the left’ rather than abolishing it.",

Many blotters co-contain iso-lysergamides or residual solvents; Ehrlich’s/Weil reagents confirm indole presence but not purity—full GC-MS is advised for batch verification.\nGastro-intestinal discomfort and light nausea are the main acute side-effects. Vasoconstriction (cold extremities) and mild hypertension (< 10 mm Hg over baseline) peak during the first 2 h; hydration, gentle stretching and magnesium supplementation mitigate this. Visual intensity and chromatic aberration are pronounced under bright light; sunglasses can reduce eye-strain.\nAcute tolerance is complete after one session; wait at least 7 days for half-tolerance and 14 days for baseline. Cross-tolerance exists with LSD, AL-LAD, ETH-LAD, 1P-LSD, etc. Chronic high-frequency use (> weekly) is linked with blunted affect and rebound migraines in anecdotal reports.\nBecause 1-substituted lysergamides are often unscheduled, customs seizures are rising—keep blotters in light-proof, acid-free sleeves with desiccant at ≤ 4 °C for long-term stability (t ½ degradation ~9 months at room temperature).",

Case reports and post‑marketing studies confirm high abuse liability, similar to hydromorphone and oxycodone; crushing, chewing, insufflating, or injecting IR tablets has been reported and linked to respiratory depression, coma, and death  [oai_citation:3‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapentadol?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Withdrawal can be intense due to dual opioid and noradrenergic mechanisms—with typical opioid withdrawal plus adrenergic symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, tremor)  [oai_citation:4‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapentadol?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Post‑marketing surveillance shows that although tapentadol occasionally has lower abuse incidence than some Schedule II drugs when prescribed appropriately, large-scale misuse has become common especially in areas with OTC availability or diverted supply (e.g. India)  [oai_citation:5‡Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/16/1/119/2460229?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

      "notes": "4-PrO-MET is marketed in Europe as pressed pellets labeled 15–20 mg; multiple user reports indicate substantial potency variability between batches, so titration from 2–3 mg is prudent. A German-language thread documents perceived microdose at 0.5–3 mg, light 4–8 mg, and 8 mg+ as very strong; half of a 15 mg pellet (~7.5 mg) ranged from mild to quite strong depending on the commenter, underscoring variability in pressing and individual sensitivity. As an O-propionyl ester at the 4-position, 4-PrO-MET is expected to hydrolyze to 4-HO-MET in vivo; human data are absent, but analogous work with 4-PrO-DMT demonstrates psychedelic activity in animals and supports the prodrug model. Compared with 4-HO-MET, some users describe slightly slower onset and equal or lower mg-for-mg potency; others report unexpectedly strong visuals from a single pellet, suggesting either under/overfilled tablets or uneven distribution of active. A conservative harm-reduction approach is to treat 4-PrO-MET as roughly equipotent to 4-AcO-MET and somewhat less potent than 4-HO-MET, keeping first trials ≤5–7 mg. Come-up may be 'sneaky' with waves, yawning, and mild nausea; set and setting control anxiety spikes. Visuals can be intense and 'cartoony,' while headspace is often reported as lighter than psilocybin or LSD. Cannabis co-use reliably amplifies visuals but can worsen body-load. Acute tolerance develops within hours; wait at least 7–14 days before re-dosing to regain baseline response. Because this is a novel ester, reagent tests may not distinguish it from other tryptamines; consider multi-reagent testing plus, where feasible, analytical confirmation. Avoid insufflation due to ester hydrolysis uncertainty, harshness, and limited benefit; oral titration is preferred.",

Start low and titrate.  \n• Visual and auditory distortions are lighter than PCP/3-MeO-PCP but balance issues, tinnitus, and \"rubber-band\" time perception are common.  \n• Prolonged vertigo, body numbness, and memory holes (>12 h) have been described after heavy redosing.  \n• No validated reagent test; will typically show weak to no colour reaction with Marquis/Mecke. Send to laboratory for confirmation.  \n• Avoid driving for at least 12 h after last dose.  \n• Harm-reduction: weigh to 1 mg accuracy, dose no more than once every 3–4 days to control tolerance and bladder risk.",

Weigh doses on a 0.001 g scale and perform an allergy test (<2 mg). Redosing markedly prolongs stimulation and increases vasoconstriction—limit to one re-dose if at all. Maintain electrolytes (sports drink), keep body temperature in check, and eat a balanced meal beforehand. Allow at least 4–6 weeks between sessions to reduce neuroadaptation and mood disturbances.",

Human data are sparse; most information comes from animal studies and anecdotal reports with commercially available CBC isolates (tinctures, vape cartridges). The numbers above are extrapolated from product labeling (5–50 mg/serving) and user reports. Avoid high doses in combination with other CNS depressants until individual response is known.

MRSA) and intra-ocular-pressure-lowering effects.\n• Human pilot study (20 mg oral) reported significant anxiety reduction without cognitive impairment.\n• May mildly lower blood pressure and heart-rate; start low in people with cardiovascular issues.\n• Metabolised mainly by CYP2C9, 2C19 and 3A4—potential drug-interaction pathway.\n• Commercial products vary widely in purity; request COA≥98 % CBG and verify THC < 0.3 % to avoid unexpected intoxication.\n• Because it is non-scheduled in most jurisdictions, isolates are often marketed as supplements; quality control is inconsistent.",

Numerous severe poisonings and several fatalities have been linked to amounts <2 mg, particularly when sprayed unevenly onto herbal material or mixed into counterfeit cannabis flower. Acute toxicity can involve severe tachycardia, hypertension or hypotension, seizures, loss of consciousness, acute psychosis and respiratory depression. Because the parent drug and active metabolites are lipophilic, impairment can outlast the subjective high. Emergency management is supportive (benzodiazepines for agitation/seizure control, anti-emetics, IV fluids, cardiac monitoring). Naloxone is NOT effective.

Treat unknown powders and sprayed plant matter as if they contain a nanomolar CB1 agonist; avoid eyeballing and use a milligram scale or volumetric solutions, start at sub-milligram smoked or low-milligram oral doses, and wait through the full peak before redosing. Plant matter and papers can have uneven application (“hot spots”), so thorough homogenization and very dilute solutions reduce per-puff variability and overdose risk. Acute risks for the SCRA class include tachycardia, anxiety or panic, severe agitation, nausea/vomiting, confusion, transient psychosis, seizures, and rare hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, renal injury, and serious cardiotoxicity; risk increases with alcohol or polydrug use. If serious agitation occurs, emergency departments typically manage with benzodiazepines; this clinical use is distinct from recreational co-use, which adds respiratory and injury risks. Color reagents cannot reliably identify specific SCRAs; only GC/MS or LC/MS can confirm identity and distinguish precursors from active analogs. Legal exposure may arise via analogue laws even if ADB-INACA itself is unscheduled; several forensic programs monitor it due to its role in clandestine synthesis pipelines. Plan conservative set and setting, avoid driving for the whole active window plus after-effects, hydrate, and set firm session caps to prevent compulsive redosing.",

Seizures have been documented in at least two ED admissions in Poland (2019).\n• Harm-reduction guidelines: 1) Use a 0.001 g (1 mg)-resolution scale; 2) Start with ≤½ common dose to gauge sensitivity; 3) Redose no sooner than every 3 h and limit total session to ≤250 mg; 4) Sip 250 ml water or isotonic drink per hour; 5) Supplement 200–400 mg magnesium to reduce jaw tension; 6) Avoid consecutive-day use—take minimum 2 weeks between sessions.\n• Drug checking: Reagent tests give bright yellow (Marquis) similar to 4-CMC; confirm identity by GC-MS/HPLC where possible.",

In users who take raw or poorly washed 4-MMC, small amounts may already be present as an impurity. Pure 4-ME occasionally appears on the grey market but formal pharmacology is limited. Available in-vitro data show it acts as a norepinephrine > dopamine transporter inhibitor/releaser with little serotonergic action, explaining its ‘clean’ peripheral stimulation and modest euphoria. Cardiovascular stress (tachycardia, vasoconstriction, blood-pressure rise) is more pronounced than central euphoria. Hydration, electrolyte balance and cooling are therefore essential. Because it is a metabolite, standard reagent tests for cathinones may give weak or negative colour changes; confirm with GC-MS if identity is critical.",

Two hospitalisations with psychiatric symptoms were reported in Ireland shortly after commercial release (2010). Headache and vasoconstriction are common above 1 mg. Because the compound contains an iodo-benzoyl moiety and a 5-fluoropentyl chain, toxic metabolites (iodine release, fluoro-alkyl oxidative products) are plausible, and long-term safety is unknown.

In clinical trials (10–90 mg/day) it showed rapid relief of anxiety and modest antidepressant efficacy comparable to tricyclics with fewer anticholinergic effects. Recreationally it produces a warm, calm euphoria with less amnesia and muscle relaxation than diazepam, although individual reports vary. Because of its short half-life, interdose rebound anxiety is common and redosing drives escalation. Abrupt discontinuation after sustained use may precipitate agitation, tremor, or seizures—taper by 10 % every 3–7 days. Metabolised hepatically (CYP3A4) to N-desmethyl-adinazolam (active) and 8-chloro-desmethyl-diazepam; inhibitors such as ketoconazole can double plasma levels. Avoid combining with other CNS depressants, driving for at least 8 h after last dose, and use extra caution in geriatric users due to falls risk.",

      "notes": "Etoxadrol is a dioxolane NMDA antagonist developed as a dissociative anesthetic; unlike arylcyclohexylamines (PCP/ketamine), it is a 1,3-dioxolane piperidine. Clinical work shows IV 0.75 mg/kg yields anesthesia averaging 26 min (14-53 min) with active airway reflexes but raised HR/BP and tachypnea. Prominent post-dose phenomena include alternating nystagmus for hours and vivid dreams; about 20% of patients reported unpleasant dreams lasting up to 24 h. One overdose case at 4.65 mg/kg caused catalepsy, amnesia, and analgesia persisting 6 days. Binding studies and reviews place etoxadrol as a high-affinity PCP-site channel blocker at NMDA receptors (sub-20 nM Ki reported), explaining PCP-like behavioral effects and animal self-administration. Human non-medical reports are essentially absent; modern forum discussions focus on historical data, indicating extreme scarcity and poor tolerability compared to ketamine. Harm reduction: avoid non-medical use; if exposed in a clinical or accidental context, monitor airway despite preserved reflexes, guard against emesis/aspiration during immobility, and anticipate hypertension/tachycardia. Do not combine with alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines due to synergistic respiratory/CNS depression; stimulant mixing increases cardiovascular and psychosis risks. Expect rapid tolerance/cross-tolerance across NMDA antagonists; spacing between exposures reduces cumulative cognitive disturbance. Identity risk is high in any grey-market context; reagent tests are insufficient for this scaffold—only lab confirmation (e.g., GC-MS) can verify. Psychological emergence reactions can be severe; clinical literature notes management with quiet environment and, if medically indicated, sedatives under supervision.",

Start with allergy test (<5 mg vaped or <25 mg oral).\n• May cause dose-dependent hypotension, tachycardia, dry mouth, nausea, and impaired motor coordination. Very high doses in rodents produced hypothermia and catalepsy.\n• Avoid driving for at least 6 h after use.\n• Being peripherally restricted does NOT guarantee absence of central effects if very large doses are taken or if the blood–brain barrier is compromised (e.g., by alcohol or inflammation).",

      "notes": "CBNA (cannabinolic acid) is the carboxylated precursor of cannabinol (CBN). It is produced when THCA oxidises and gradually decarboxylates to CBN during storage, or rapidly when heated. CBNA itself appears to have minimal affinity for CB1/CB2 receptors and is regarded as non-intoxicating. Animal data suggest mild anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity; anecdotal human use points to gentle sedation similar to low-dose CBN. Because the compound is uncommon on the recreational market, pharmacokinetic and toxicological data are sparse. Oral bioavailability is poor but can be improved with lipid carriers (e.g., MCT oil). Heating above ~110 °C will convert CBNA to CBN, changing the effect profile. Users seeking sedation often decarboxylate deliberately; those evaluating CBNA specifically should avoid high heat. Start with low doses, especially when combined with other CNS depressants. No serious adverse events have been reported, but high doses (>100 mg oral) occasionally cause pronounced drowsiness, dry mouth, and lowered blood pressure.",

The experience is shorter and a bit more stimulating than LSD, with a ‘clean’ visual character and less head-space intensity. Virtually no human or animal toxicity data exist; start low, employ allergy tests, and allow at least 14 days between psychedelic sessions to minimise tolerance and HPPD risk. Reagent testing (e.g., Ehrlich) will give a positive indole reaction but cannot confirm identity; full lab analysis is required for certainty.",

Those with asthma, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease should avoid.  \n• Oral activity is normally negligible due to rapid MAO-A degradation; co-administration of a reversible MAOI (e.g., harmine) renders it fully active but also markedly increases physiological load.  \n• Intravenous studies in the 1950s produced intense but very short psychedelic states along with cyanosis and BP spikes; stay below 30 mg smoked to reduce risk.  \n• Legal status: Schedule I in the USA, Schedule 9 in Australia, List I psychotropic in many EU states.  \n• Never collect wild toads—ethical, ecological, and legal hazards; plant sources are far safer.",

Pharmacologically it is a potent κ-opioid receptor agonist with partial agonist/antagonist activity at the µ-receptor; this combination produces analgesia with less respiratory depression than morphine but a high incidence of dysphoria, vertigo, and hallucination-like experiences. Recreational reports describe ‘darkened’ or ‘tunnel’ vision, mild warmth, dissociative or salvia-like head-space, and amnestic episodes at higher doses. Because of its antagonist component it can precipitate withdrawal in users dependent on strong µ-agonists (e.g., morphine, methadone, high-dose tramadol). Concomitant CNS depressants markedly increase risk of respiratory depression. Intranasal spray is the most common human formulation (1 mg/spray). Oral bioavailability is low (~17 %), so oral dosing is unpredictable. Use sterile technique for injections; veterinary multi-dose vials often contain bacteriostatic preservatives but are not guaranteed pyrogen-free for human use.",

Users report a steep dose-response curve; accidentally doubling a planned dose can turn a mild high into overwhelming dysphoria, panic, or unconsciousness. Because powder is usually applied to herbal carrier, uneven distribution (‘hot spots’) is common. Always dissolve accurately weighed material in high-proof ethanol or acetone, apply evenly to a pre-weighed herbal substrate, allow to dry, and remix thoroughly. A 1 mg test-dose (inhaled) is considered prudent for first-time users. Emergency presentations involving AM-1248 have included severe agitation, seizures, and acute kidney injury; supportive care is recommended as there are no specific antagonists.

Laboratory binding data show high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor (Ki ≈ 0.37 nM), but field reports suggest it is somewhat less potent than the halogenated 25I/25C compounds, with typical active doses in the mid-hundreds of micrograms. Oral bioavailability is poor; blotter, ethanol solution, or micro-weighted powder is usually held sublingually/buccally for 15–30 min.\n\nPhysiological risks mirror those of other NBOMes: vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, nausea and acute anxiety. Severe toxicity (seizure, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrest) has occurred with related NBOMes at high doses or when combined with stimulants. Because active doses are so small, volumetric or liquid dosing and an allergy test (<50 µg) are strongly recommended. Redosing is ineffective due to rapid tolerance but increases cardiovascular strain. Individuals with cardiovascular, hepatic, or psychiatric conditions should avoid use. Very limited pharmacokinetic/human safety data exist—treat the compound as highly experimental.",

In vitro it is a potent serotonin releasing agent (EC50≈30 nM) with weaker activity at DAT and NET, and a partial agonist at 5-HT2A/2B receptors (Rickli 2015).  \n• Human data are limited to a few dozen anecdotal reports. Potency and identity in the grey market are inconsistent—ALWAYS reagent-test and start with an allergy dose (~1 mg).  \n• Acute risks resemble those of MDMA: hyperthermia, dehydration, hyponatraemia, bruxism, mydriasis and transient hypertension/tachycardia.  Severe serotonin syndrome has been documented in poly-drug cases.  \n• Because of measurable 5-HT2B agonism (≈30 % of maximal 5-HT activity), frequent use (>1 session per month) may pose a theoretical risk of valvular heart disease.  Space sessions ≥4–6 weeks.  \n• Metabolised mainly by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2; main urinary metabolites are O-demethyl and N-dealkyl products conjugated with glucuronic acid (Shimshoni 2017).  People with CYP2D6 PM phenotype experience higher plasma levels and longer duration.  \n• No fatalities solely attributed to 5-MAPDB have been published as of 2025, but absence of evidence ≠ safety.  \n• Hydration (500–750 ml water or isotonic drink per hour of dancing, not exceeding 1 l h⁻¹) and body-temperature monitoring are strongly advised.",

Fatalities and acute kidney injury have been documented with the parent compound and closely related isomers. Because laboratory standards are limited, routine drug screens rarely detect it; users can unexpectedly test negative while still being impaired. Using a milligram scale and thoroughly dissolving the powder into a carrier (PG/VG e-liquid or acetone for herb spraying) is essential for harm reduction. Always start with a single micro-dose puff and wait 10 minutes before re-dosing.",

      "notes": "MGM-15 is a semi-synthetic analogue of the kratom alkaloid 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH). It was developed alongside MGM-16 as mu/delta-opioid dual agonists; animal and in vitro work consistently finds MGM-16 more potent than MGM-15. Human pharmacokinetics for MGM-15 are unknown; harm-reduction dosing must rely on cautious titration and scattered user reports. Duration described online is longer than 7-OH, with many reporting 6-12 h between doses, which increases overdose risk if redosing too early. Do not combine with other depressants; claims that kratom-derived opioids lack respiratory depression are not supported by clinical data and should not be trusted. Product variability is extreme: vendors sell different salts/purities and the name may cover nonidentical compounds; start low, weigh with a 0.001 g scale, and avoid eyeballing. Because identity is often uncertain, consider third-party analytical testing (LC-MS/HPLC) where available; reagent kits are not reliable for this class. Users attempting to substitute MGM-15 for 7-OH often report lower-per-dose numbers than their 7-OH habits (e.g., single-digit to tens of mg), but some report needing 50-100 mg depending on tolerance and source potency; this spread likely reflects tolerance, salt form, and adulteration. Expect typical opioid effects and adverse effects: miosis, pruritus, constipation, nausea, sedation, and potential respiratory depression at high doses or with CNS depressants. Set a firm session cap before dosing, wait a full 3-4 h before considering any redose, and prefer single-route, single-substance trials to understand sensitivity. Tapering strategies reported online (using small repeated doses of MGM-15 to replace frequent 7-OH) are anecdotal and carry dependence risks; if dependent, seek medical support.",

Median convulsive dose (CD₅₀) in mice ≈ 42 mg/kg i.p.  \n• No controlled human pharmacokinetic data exist. Extrapolations from dog and rat studies suggest oral bioavailability ≈ 40 – 60 % and an elimination half-life of 6 – 9 h, with no confirmed active metabolites.  \n• Human case reports are extremely scarce; anecdotal user reports describe a narrow therapeutic window, inconsistent subjective effects (ranging from mild relaxation to pronounced inner restlessness) and delayed-onset seizures after redosing > 5 mg.  \n• Start with micro-doses (≤ 0.5 mg), use an analytical milligram scale, wait a full 2 h before considering redose.  \n• Parenteral routes are strongly discouraged: solvent requirements and local TSPO densities create unpredictable tissue reactions.  \n• Because of the unique mechanism, benzodiazepine antagonists (flumazenil) are ineffective in overdose; supportive care and anticonvulsants are preferred.",

Oral dosing best preserves euphoria; insufflation tends to feel harsher and shorter-lived.\n• Common acute adverse effects: tachycardia, vasoconstriction (cold fingers, erectile difficulty), jaw clenching, anxiety at peaks, and a strong urge to redose every 1–2 h.\n• High or repeated doses can provoke confusion, visual disturbances, and in rare cases brief psychotic-like reactions; stay hydrated, monitor body temperature, and limit session length.\n• Harm-reduction: Weigh doses on a 0.001 g scale; allow at least 2 h before considering a booster. Avoid combining with other stimulants or MAO-inhibiting substances. Because of possible serotonergic activity, the risk of serotonin syndrome exists with SSRIs or tramadol.",

      "notes": "Pyrovalerone was placed into U.S. Schedule V and largely vanished once stronger analogues like MDPV appeared, yet the parent drug still drives sharp redosing urges and warrants strict self-imposed limits.\n\nPyrovalerone was originally prescribed for chronic fatigue and obesity in the 1960s at daily doses of 60 mg (20 mg taken three times daily), but patients frequently developed tolerance and compulsive redosing, leading to discontinuation of its clinical use. Modern reports describe it as a stimulant with a profile somewhere between methylphenidate and MDPV, with strong drive to re-dose every 2–3 hours. Its pharmacology shows high affinity inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, with negligible serotonin activity, producing a stimulation that is clean but also edgy and compulsive. The short half-life contributes to a sharp comedown, often marked by irritability, low mood, and insomnia. Oral dosing is more forgiving but still prone to compulsive escalation, while insufflation and intravenous routes amplify both euphoria and cardiovascular strain. Users report appetite suppression, jaw tension, tremor, and persistent tachycardia during sessions. Redosing within the first hour significantly increases cardiovascular and neurotoxic stress, and binges of >24 hours without sleep have led to stimulant psychosis similar to high-dose cocaine. Accurate dosing is critical: pyrovalerone is active at very low milligram amounts, making volumetric liquid measurement safer than weighing single doses. Reagent tests often cannot distinguish pyrovalerone from related pyrrolidinophenones, so confirmation with multiple reagents or advanced analysis (GC-MS, FT-IR) is recommended. For harm reduction, users should pre-weigh a maximum daily session dose, allow full return to baseline before re-dosing, maintain hydration and electrolyte intake (especially potassium and magnesium), and ensure proper sleep hygiene. Because pyrovalerone was quickly replaced by stronger analogues like MDPV and α-PVP on the illicit market, it remains rare but presents similar risks: high addiction potential, strong cardiovascular strain, and rapid tolerance escalation.",

      "notes": "Carisoprodol is prescribed only for short-term relief of acute muscle spasm, yet dependence emerges quickly because it metabolises into the sedative meprobamate. Long-term use or abrupt cessation can precipitate significant withdrawal.\n\nCarisoprodol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant with sedative and anxiolytic properties, commonly prescribed for short-term treatment of musculoskeletal pain. It is rapidly metabolized in the liver to meprobamate, a long-acting anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic with its own abuse history, making carisoprodol pharmacologically similar to combining a short-acting sedative with a longer-lasting one. Because of this metabolic pathway, effects may persist longer than expected, especially with repeated dosing. Recreational use often centers around the drug’s sedative euphoria, which some users compare to a mild benzodiazepine, though with a heavier, less controlled sedation and occasional paradoxical stimulation. At therapeutic doses, carisoprodol causes muscle relaxation, drowsiness, and anxiolysis; at higher doses, it can cause confusion, ataxia, double vision, blackouts, and sudden loss of motor control. Abrupt movements or attempts to stand can cause sudden collapses, leading to falls and injuries. Tolerance to the euphoric and relaxing effects develops quickly, encouraging dose escalation and binge-style use. Dependence liability is compounded by meprobamate accumulation, which has a half-life of ~10 hours, leading to more prolonged sedation and risk of withdrawal upon cessation. Withdrawal symptoms can include tremors, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, nausea, hallucinations, and seizures; these can be severe after chronic high-dose use and may require medical supervision, often with benzodiazepine substitution. Mixing carisoprodol with other depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines greatly increases the risk of respiratory depression, aspiration, coma, and death; many fatalities have involved such polydrug combinations. Recreational users sometimes combine carisoprodol with opioids or benzodiazepines in a cocktail known as the 'Holy Trinity,' which is considered highly dangerous due to synergistic CNS depression. Harm reduction strategies include limiting use to occasional sessions, spacing doses at least 4–6 hours apart, avoiding any other depressants, and never exceeding 700 mg in a single dose. Users should ensure they are in a safe environment before onset due to risk of sudden sedation and falls. Because it is often supplied as tablets with varying imprints, counterfeit risks exist; some tablets may contain other sedatives or opioids, so reagent testing is advised where possible. Long-term heavy use can impair memory, attention, and coordination, and chronic use is discouraged due to rapid tolerance and dependence liability.",

Start with allergy test (<5 mg), weigh doses accurately, keep body temperature under 38 °C, hydrate with electrolytes and avoid redosing cycles longer than 2-3 h.

Effects are often described as a subdued, dreamy empathogen with light closed-eye visuals and a notable sedative ‘body-load’. Nausea and mild vasoconstriction are common above 60 mg. Because it is largely serotonergic, combining with other serotonin-increasing drugs markedly raises the risk of serotonin syndrome. Users report a ceiling effect—doses above ~120 mg add side-effects rather than euphoria. Stay well-hydrated, avoid redosing within the same session, and allow at least two weeks between uses to mitigate tolerance and possible neurochemical depletion.",

      "notes": "4-MEPPP, chemically 4-methyl-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone, was designed to mimic classic stimulants. Reports describe SNDRI-like alertness with rapid tolerance and highlight the need for accurate dosing and respect for its abuse potential.\n\n4-MEPPP (4-methyl-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone) is a pyrrolidinophenone stimulant related to α-PPP and more distantly to α-PVP/MDPV. In vitro and in vivo work indicates it behaves primarily as a dopamine>norepinephrine reuptake blocker with minimal serotonin releasing activity, yielding a 'cleaner', more dopaminergic stimulation profile than 4-MEC or mephedrone. Intranasal user reports cluster around 20-40 mg per line with fast onset (1-2 min), modest euphoria, talkativeness, mydriasis, and a relatively short window (about 1-2 h of noticeable effects) followed by a mild comedown; 50+ mg in a single line has been described as too intense/panicky by some. Oral doses are less well-documented but appear higher than intranasal on a milligram basis (common 30-60 mg), with slower onset and smoother peak. Several users note a 'ceiling' effect where repeated lines after the first hour add side effects (tachycardia, anxiety) more than benefits; scheduling gaps of 90+ minutes between trials reduces stacking. Market context matters: 4-MEPPP has been found in mixed 'NRG' products and mis-sold as α-PVP; expect inconsistent potency and possible blends. Use multiple reagents (e.g., Marquis, Mecke, Simon’s) and avoid assuming identity from a single color reaction; ideally verify with FT-IR/GC-MS from a drug-checking service. Start low, use a 0.001 g scale, and consider volumetric dosing to achieve <10 mg accuracy when titrating. Redosing loops and sleep loss are the main acute harm vectors: set a hard session cap (e.g., 60-120 mg total depending on ROA), avoid back-to-back days, and plan a sleep window. Hydration and electrolytes (especially potassium/magnesium) help with jaw tension and tremor; light carbohydrates can blunt post-peak edginess. Avoid strenuous activity and hot environments to limit hyperthermia risk, and monitor pulse/temperature during sessions. Combining with other stimulants or MAOIs significantly increases cardiovascular and neurotoxic risk and should be avoided; alcohol adds cardiovascular strain and disinhibition. Intravenous or vaporized routes are strongly discouraged due to unknown pyrolysis products, rapid spike/crash dynamics, and high complication risk; most reported benefits are achievable with intranasal or oral use at much lower risk. Tolerance rises across a binge but tends to reset substantially after 3-5 days off; repeated multi-day runs increase crash dysphoria and insomnia. Because analytical work shows rapid metabolism and detection via characteristic metabolites, drug screens may miss parent compound; however, this does not imply safety. If anxiety or palpitations escalate, stop redosing, hydrate, cool down, and consider non-sedating de-escalation (quiet environment; avoid benzodiazepines unless medically indicated).",

      "notes": "5-Cl-AMT (5-chloro-α-methyltryptamine; PAL-542) combines three properties with harm-reduction implications: it is a serotonin–dopamine releasing agent, a potent 5-HT2A agonist, and an in vitro MAO-A inhibitor. Treat it as an MAOI during the session window even though clinical reversibility is not established. Start with a microtest of 0.5-1 mg to gauge sensitivity; community trials report activity at 1-2 mg and full days’ worth of effects from 8-12 mg. Because the come-up is slow and the duration long, redosing is usually unnecessary and can produce a late, heavy body load. Volumetric dosing is strongly advised so that sub-1 mg adjustments are possible; weigh at least 10-20 mg on a 0.001 g scale, dissolve to make 1 mg/mL or 0.5 mg/mL, and measure with an oral syringe. Plan a bland, low-tyramine diet the day of dosing and until baseline the next day (avoid aged cheeses, cured/fermented meats, soy ferments, Marmite, certain beers). Review medications and supplements for serotonergic or MAOI activity; conservative washout rules are prudent (at least 2 weeks after irreversible MAOIs; several days after SSRIs/SNRIs/linezolid/tramadol/DXM/5-HTP). Physiologically, expect mild pupil dilation, warmth, tremor or jaw tension at higher doses, and a gradual shift from entactogenic glow to more psychedelic headspace. Several field reports describe a delayed intensification late in the day; avoid stacking doses based on an early, gentle come-up. Keep the environment cool, hydrate with electrolytes, and avoid vigorous exercise or hot environments. If symptoms suggest serotonin toxicity (agitation, clonus, hyperthermia, severe headache, rapidly rising heart rate/BP), do not take more, cool down, and seek medical care; do not self-medicate with additional serotonergics. Drug-checking is important: 5-Cl-AMT has appeared in small niche markets and could be misrepresented; use multi-reagent testing and, where available, FT-IR/GC-MS. Because reports show long wakefulness and an afterglow that can flip to lethargy, protect sleep the following night and avoid consecutive-day use. Cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics is expected; spacing sessions by 10-14 days reduces tolerance and carries a margin for MAO-related interactions.",

Those with personal or family history of mental illness should avoid use, particularly outside supervised medical settings. Set and setting are critical factors in determining experience quality. Start with lower doses due to individual variations in body weight, tolerance, metabolism, and sensitivity. No toxic dose is known, but higher doses increase risk of adverse psychological reactions. Test substances with reagent kits, though Ehrlich's reagent reacts slowly with N-acylated lysergamides.",
