## Subjective Experience

I approached this chemical with a significant degree of apprehension. This largely
stemmed from the fact that it is an analogue of PCP (phencyclidine) which reportedly
causes much higher rates of mania and psychosis than other dissociatives. Media
reports around this have, over the years, created a substantial amount of infamy, and
have contributed to the wide scale popularity of street names such as angel dust,
rocket fuel and sherm.

At time of testing, 3-HO-PCP is one of its lesser known analogues, even though it was
first synthesised back in 1978. I chose it rather than the more popular 3-MEO-PCP
largely because existing field reports subjectively seemed to be less erratic in content
and nature.

Having stated this, I may be somewhat in the margins with this perspective as in
addition to direct warnings regarding dose and risk, Psychonautwiki, for example,
states that:

```
"There are also reports that suggest this compound may produce more
physical side effects such as muscle soreness and flu-like symptoms during or
shortly after administration. This suggests it may be uniquely more
dangerous or toxic than related dissociatives, particularly at higher doses."
```
Another safety matter is the problem of bladder damage, as documented for
ketamine and a number of other dissociatives. Does this apply here? I can’t find
anything conclusive but this remains in the back of my mind.

```
Published papers didn’t offer much comfort regarding the safety of this drug
```
In terms of dose, the consensus on the Reddit post I am currently reading is that well
under 5mg is more than sufficient for a first time user. Given the horror stories
dotted around the Internet I intend to heed this advice. I weigh 20mg, halve it with a
card, halve it again and then halve it a third time; in theory leaving around 2mg or
so. I am aware of the obvious lack of precision with this method, which is a further
extenuation for the cautious approach I am taking.

I also note that the doses specified on the usual harm reduction websites are for oral
consumption. However, a significant number of users do insufflate, which these days
is my preferred method, so I elect to take this route. That generically suggested doses
for insufflation are often lower than for oral is yet another justification for going low.

```
T+0.00 I snort the powder using my right nostril [11.50am]. I did read on
several forums that this drug has an opiate-like aspect to it. Perhaps this will
alleviate the slight anxiety I am experiencing in starting this experiment.
```
```
T+0.45 Onset is commonly cited as being the best part of two hours, but I do
detect a slight change of headspace in that I feel a little distant. At the same
time there is something of a tingly numbness about my hands (although these
are arguably contradictory terms).
```
```
T+1.30 I feel warm and I am a little flushed, with now a hint of dissociation in
play: everything seems slightly different in terms of sensory input. This is not
at all as dramatic as encountered on some of my ephenidine trips (for
example), but a similar edge is present. I remain in full control of my faculties.
```

```
T+3.00 This is already an interesting experience. I sense that I am not far
above threshold (which is undoubtedly true), but the dissociation, whilst not
particularly distinct, is solid. I am warm, with the numbness still apparent,
and with a rounded and contented disposition (recalling those opioid
references). There is also some potential for horn, which I don’t usually find
with this class of drug.
```
```
There is a peculiar heady quality to this; not a headache but a presence which
may develop. The trip itself is a little wearing as I discern an air of fatigue, but
it is pleasant by most metrics.
```
```
T+4.20 I have the impression that the ride is now a little less intense, and that
I am in afterglow territory. There is still some headiness there, I am a little
chilly with the numb edge about my fingers remaining, but I am most
certainly homeward bound. I also note at this point that the time has passed
extremely quickly, and I recall that this is a common manifestation with this
class of drug.
```
```
T+5.00 In terms of significant action this is now over. The mild afterglow
continues and I am left feeling generally content, with a slightly dreamy
headspace.
```
From this point the effects ebbed away quite quickly, leaving a somewhat balmy feel
and perhaps the hint of a headache, which persisted until the next morning. The
night’s sleep wasn’t the worst and regarding the aftermath I felt a degree of reset, as
per other dissociatives (and of course psychedelics).

This was in fact quite a decent experience, tempting a potential return. Indeed, I did
intend to schedule another ride at a higher dose, but now I am not so sure that,
having documented the basics and with the issues previously discussed in mind, I
will follow through.

NOTE:
The following day the beginnings of a cold seemed to be emerging. This eventually
turned out to be COVID-19. I have no idea how this influenced this experiment, if at
all.
