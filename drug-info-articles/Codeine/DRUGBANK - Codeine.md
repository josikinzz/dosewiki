## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic.

### Background

The relief of pain (analgesia) is a primary goal for enhancing the quality of life of patients and for increasing the ability of patients to engage in day to day activities. Codeine, an opioid analgesic, was originally approved in the US in 1950 and is a drug used to decrease pain by increasing the threshold for pain without impairing consciousness or altering other sensory functions. Opiates such as codeine are derived from the poppy plant,
Papaver somniferum
(Papaveraceae).

Codeine is utilized as a central analgesic, sedative, hypnotic, antinociceptive, and antiperistaltic agent, and is also recommended in certain diseases with incessant coughing.

### Indication

Codeine sulfate is a form of this drug that is commonly used. It is available in tablet form
Label
and indicated for the relief of mild to moderately severe pain, where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate
Label
.
The solution form is used by itself or combined in a syrup with other drugs and is used as a cough suppressant in adults aged 18 and above
14
,
15
.

### Pharmacodynamics

General effects
Codeine is a weak narcotic pain reliever and cough suppressant that is similar to morphine and hydrocodone. A small amount of ingested codeine is converted to morphine in the body. Codeine increases tolerance to pain, reducing existing discomfort. In addition to decreasing pain, codeine also causes sedation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression
4
.
Antitussive activity
This drug has shown antitussive activity in clinical trials
6
and has been effective in cough secondary to tuberculosis and insomnia due to coughing
4
. Codeine suppresses the cough reflex through a direct effect on the cough center in the medulla
18
.
Effects on intestinal motility
Codeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action
19
. This may possibly lead to constipation
18
. The chronic use of opioids, including codeine sulfate, may lead to obstructive bowel disease, particularly in patients with underlying disorders of intestinal motility
Label
.
Effects on the central nervous system
Codeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine, but is much less potent as an analgesic. Its primary site of action is at the
mu
opioid receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system. The sedative activities of codeine are less potent than those of morphine
18
. Codeine may cause respiratory system depression by the activation of μ-opioid receptors at specific sites in the central nervous system
8
.
Effects on blood pressure
This drug poses an increased risk of compromised ability to maintain blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and other mechanisms
Label
.
Effects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain
Codeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine, however, is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties. Its primary action takes place at the mu opioid receptors, which are distributed throughout the central nervous system. The average duration of action is about 4 hours
18
.
Regular dosing of opioid analgesics such as codeine in patients with severe cancer pain has been well documented to improve symptoms
4

### Absorption

Absorption
Codeine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The maximum plasma concentration occurs 60 minutes after administration
Label
.
Food Effects
When 60 mg codeine sulfate was given 30 minutes post-ingestion of a high high-calorie meal, there was no significant change in the absorption of codeine
Label
.
Steady-state concentration
The administration of 15 mg codeine sulfate every 4 hours for 5 days lead to steady-state concentrations of codeine, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) within 48 hours
Label
.

### Metabolism

Approximately 70 to 80% of the ingested dose of codeine is metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glucuronic acid to
codeine-6­ glucuronide
(C6G) and by O-demethylation to
morphine
(about 5-10%) and N-demethylation to
norcodeine
(about 10%) respectively. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major metabolic enzymes mediating the glucurodination of codeine to the metabolite,
codeine 6 glucuronide
.
Cytochrome P450 2D6 is the major enzyme responsible for the transformation of codeine to morphine and P450 3A4 is the main enzyme mediating the conversion of codeine to
norcodeine
. Morphine and norcodeine are then further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are
morphine-3-glucuronide
(M3G) and_ morphine-6-glucuronide _(M6G). Morphine and M6G have been proven to have analgesic activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is not known at this time. Norcodeine and M3G are generally not considered to have analgesic properties

### Toxicity

Oral LD50
: 427 mg kg-1 (rat)
MSDS
.
Overdose/toxicity
Symptoms of opioid toxicity may include confusion, somnolence, shallow breathing, constricted pupils, nausea, vomiting, constipation and a lack of appetite. In severe cases, symptoms of circulatory and respiratory depression may ensue, which may be life-threatening or fatal
13
,
Label
.
Teratogenic effects
This drug is classified as a pregnancy Category C drug. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies completed in pregnant women. Codeine should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk of the drug to the fetus
Label
.
Codeine has shown embryolethal and fetotoxic effects in the hamster, rat as well as mouse models at about 2-4 times the maximum recommended human dose
Label
. Maternally toxic doses that were about 7 times the maximum recommended human dose of 360 mg/day, were associated with evidence of bone resorption and incomplete bone ossification. Codeine did not demonstrate evidence of embrytoxicity or fetotoxicity in the rabbit model at doses up to 2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 360 mg/day based on a body surface area comparison
Label
.
Nonteratogenic effects
Neonatal codeine withdrawal has been observed in infants born to addicted and non-addicted mothers who ingested codeine-containing medications in the days before delivery. Common symptoms of narcotic withdrawal include irritability, excessive crying, tremors, hyperreflexia, seizures, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and poor feeding. These signs may be observed shortly following birth and may require specific treatment
Label
.
Codeine (30 mg/kg) given subcutaneously to pregnant rats during gestation and for 25 days after delivery increased the rate of neonatal mortality at birth. The dose given was 0.8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 360 mg/day
Label
.
The use in breastfeeding/nursing
Codeine is secreted into human milk. The maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, including death, in nursing infants
Label
.

### Mechanism of action

Although the exact mechanism of action of codeine is still unknown, it is generally thought to be mediated through the agonism of opioid receptors, particularly the mu-opioid receptors.
4
Morphine was previously postulated to contribute to the analgesic effect of codeine due to the O-demethylation of codeine to morphine by CYP2D6. Particularly, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer did not experience the analgesic effect of codeine.
2
,
10
However, this is unlikely to be the main mechanism of action of codeine as only 5% of codeine is metabolized to morphine.
2
Other hypotheses also postulate that codeine-6-glucuronide, the main metabolite of codeine, mediates the analgesic effect of codeine as it not only has an affinity to the mu receptors as codeine but also can be metabolized to morphine-6-glucuronide, which was observed to be more potent than morphine.
3
Binding to the mu receptors by codeine activates the G-proteins Gα
i
, causing a decrease in intracellular cAMP and Ca
2+
level.
11
,
12
This causes hyperpolarization of nociceptive neurons, thus imparing the transmission of pain signals.

### Volume of distribution

Apparent volume of distribution: about 3-6 L/kg, showing an extensive distribution of the drug into tissues
Label
.

### Protein binding

7-25% bound to plasma proteins
Label
.

### Route of elimination

About 90% of the total dose of codeine is excreted by the kidneys. Approximately 10% of the drug excreted by the kidneys is unchanged codeine
Label
.
The majority of the excretion products can be found in the urine within 6 hours of ingestion, and 40-60 % of the codeine is excreted free or conjugated, approximately 5 to 15 percent as free and conjugated morphine, and approximately 10-20% free and conjugated norcodeine
18
.

### Clearance

Renal clearance of codeine was 183 +/- 59 ml min-1 in a clinical study
5

### General Function

Electrogenic voltage-dependent transporter that mediates the transport of a variety of organic cations such as endogenous bioactive amines, cationic drugs and xenobiotics (PubMed:11388889, PubMed:11408531, PubMed:12439218, PubMed:12719534, PubMed:15389554, PubMed:16263091, PubMed:16272756, PubMed:16581093, PubMed:19536068, PubMed:21128598, PubMed:23680637, PubMed:24961373, PubMed:34040533, PubMed:9187257, PubMed:9260930, PubMed:9655880). Functions as a pH- and Na(+)-independent, bidirectional transporter (By similarity). Cation cellular uptake or release is driven by the electrochemical potential (i.e. membrane potential and concentration gradient) and substrate selectivity (By similarity). Hydrophobicity is a major requirement for recognition in polyvalent substrates and inhibitors (By similarity). Primarily expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and proximal tubules and involved in the uptake and disposition of cationic compounds by hepatic and renal clearance from the blood flow (By similarity). Most likely functions as an uptake carrier in enterocytes contributing to the intestinal elimination of organic cations from the systemic circulation (PubMed:16263091). Transports endogenous monoamines such as N-1-methylnicotinamide (NMN), guanidine, histamine, neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline (PubMed:12439218, PubMed:24961373, PubMed:35469921, PubMed:9260930). Also transports natural polyamines such as spermidine, agmatine and putrescine at low affinity, but relatively high turnover (PubMed:21128598). Involved in the hepatic uptake of vitamin B1/thiamine, hence regulating hepatic lipid and energy metabolism (PubMed:24961373). Mediates the bidirectional transport of acetylcholine (ACh) at the apical membrane of ciliated cell in airway epithelium, thereby playing a role in luminal release of ACh from bronchial epithelium (PubMed:15817714). Transports dopaminergic neuromodulators cyclo(his-pro) and salsolinol with lower efficency (PubMed:17460754). Also capable of transporting non-amine endogenous compounds such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2-alpha) (PubMed:11907186). May contribute to the transport of cationic compounds in testes across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable). Also involved in the uptake of xenobiotics tributylmethylammonium (TBuMA), quinidine, N-methyl-quinine (NMQ), N-methyl-quinidine (NMQD) N-(4,4-azo-n-pentyl)-quinuclidine (APQ), azidoprocainamide methoiodide (AMP), N-(4,4-azo-n-pentyl)-21-deoxyajmalinium (APDA) and 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP) (PubMed:11408531, PubMed:15389554, PubMed:35469921, PubMed:9260930)
