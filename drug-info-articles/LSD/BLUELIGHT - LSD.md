[Original post:]


I've never tripped before but I may be getting two acid tabs.


Apparently they are relatively weak though.


For a first time tripper, how strong would the trip be to me? Would it be worth buying the two tabs?

The pic on the tabs is a butterfly. Also, if I smoked some weed while tripping, how would that work out?


Thanks in advance. ^^

^Hey, just merged your query in here dude.


Well, apparently weak could mean a few things. Theres no real way to gauge your dose if you don't know it already- if that makes sense. I would always adives a first-timer to take one hit for their first experience- I don't know whether you should buy two, let your wallet determine that ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

^ I never made the connection until just now, but my first bad acid trip (and the reason I hate Berkeley) I believe was directly caused by smoking a blunt. It was 4/20, we were in people's park and sparked a blunt. I was starting to peak and next thing you know all I wanted was to get out, I had a strange sense of insecurity and paranoia flush over me. 


Not quite sure why it didn't occur to me now but I believe weed was the direct cause of it.

I agree with swilow. Daily smokers are the only people that should really fux with smoking weed on LSD. I smoke daily, and it hardly even alters the trip for me when I smoke -- I just enjoy the taste, and it helps ease some nausea that can be caused by the insanely high dosages I'm inclined to take. 


However, last time I tripped, my friend who doesn't smoke much started panicking  MAJORLY after taking just one baby rip of chronic out of my bubbler. It was not a good experience for him; I gave him a temazepam and put him to bed and all was cool, but it kinda fucked up the good vibes during my peak. I didn't mind though, shit happens when you trip--you gotta learn to go with the flow.


edit--on an interesting note. being a daily smoker, I've found that when I take Lucy, my trip sometimes won't really "kick in" until I take a hit of weed. Its as if the weed runs through my system instructing the LSD to stand at attention and go full speed ahead. Often, i won't feel it at all--until I take just 1 hit. Then the air develops a deep, hovering purple fog and I know I'm in for a good ride.

i think at least part of that can be attributed to the fact that smoking is such a comfort-act for daily smokers. i mean, personally, i associate smoking a bowl with chilling out, kicking off my shoes at the end of the day. thus i find it relaxes me on psychedelics. i think if i've learnt anything from psychedelics it's that the mind plays the biggest part of the experience, not the substance itself.

LSD + weed can be an exhilarating combo.  Usually works best when you are coming down from the acid peak.  The weed mellows you out and makes the lingering acid effects more noticeable.

smoke DMT on L, not weed. 


and 1+mg or nothing at all. when it comes to LSD its all a amtter of how big your dick is. so go big or go home.


oh and being on public streets on such a large dose is highly recommended, just make sure you tighten your belt REALY tight so when you deside you need to get naked its alil harder to do in public.


and whats up with that? all the kids yous ee naked runninga round ALWAYS have taken too much L. what is it about lsd that makes you want to get naked?

> I rarely smoke weed on LSD; I just don't want to, but a lot of people find their trips can take a more paranoid and anxious turn after smoking. Of course, it really depends on your tolerance. If your a regular smoker who doesn't get blasted out of his 'ead from pot, you'd be fine to smoke. However, if your only a occaisional user, I would personally say don't smoke; save it for the comedown.

I would definitely advise against smoking cannabis whilst on your first LSD trip. I've been able to smoke it the whole way through a mushroom trip with not much effect but with acid, only a few tokes can but a paranoid, confusing edge on things. This is true even in the last hours of the trip. All subjective though.

I've been able to smoke it the whole way through a mushroom trip with not much effect but with acid, only a few tokes can but a paranoid, confusing edge on things. This is true even in the last hours of the trip. All subjective though.

Very very very good advice. Weed all too often can spin a good acid trip out into paranoia for me. I am no longer a regular smoker but when I was smoking pot was so ingrained into me that it would take me a second to realize what it actually was that was causing this phenomenon! The weed.

^Well, he knocked on her door and when she opened it a little he busted in and proceeded to sexually assault her. He was pulled off her and beaten up by some football players, all the while he was laughing and saying "You have no idea how much power I have!" I'm seriously not making this shit up haha

I also find it interesting that some LSD is explosively visual while other batches (that still feel clean) have less of a visual aspect and more of a mindfuck. Anybody know why LSD differs in its visual intensity from batch to batch even when it still feels like clean cid?

not sure but i have read about the synapses (nerve endings in the brain) that the further they are apart the more lsd they will need.I remember me and my girlfriend at the time .and 2 other friends who had never had acid before.Me and the gf were tripping really hard but the other 2 who were brother and sister said they could barely feel a thing They said after it was no different to smoking weed.As to why some cid is more visual than others i wish i knew.


I reckon they should do clinical tests on people that do acid.And give us all delysid so we all know what it should be like when its in proper exacting doses

I'll hopefully be acquiring some tabs soon.  Extremely excited.

I tend to need higher doses than most people with all drugs to get to certain levels, so I'm thinking I'll start with 2 tabs. Even if it hits hard I'm confident that I'll be able to handle it. 

Most of my experience has been with 2c-e, which I have not been found to be incredibly visual even at ~18mg dose (oral). Visuals were definitely prominent in rooms I was very familiar with, but when I started moving more the more intense OEVs started going away.

So, to you folks, if you've taken 2c-e, how visual did you find it, and how visual was LSD in comparison? Do you find that if you get less visuals with one drug that you will get less from others as well, or are they independent of each other?

I actually tend to appreciate the mind/thought alteration more, but I'd like to hear from you on this to maybe judge how acid will effect me.

god im so happy i finally found acid, once you find one of them you sort of figure out everyone who can get it... shame one of the best was arrested a couple weeks ago, good guy... let you know when various research chems were in town and wouldn't try to pass DOx off as acid, even warns people about the DOx blotter when its floating around town... 


i shall try to get some for bicycle day if im not working...

To the first poster in this thread- ive had a few experiences with the butterflys.. (assuming they r the same ones).. 1 doesnt do anything to me, but 4 did a hell of a lot lol.. 1 got my friend tripping (shes a girl and quite small so that cud explain it), and 2 got a guy friend of mine tripping hard.. 

i forget if u sed it was ur first time or not, but ide start of taking 1 if it is then re-dose an hour or so in if it isnt enough. if uve taken acid b4, ide say take the 2.

hehe thanks swilow. It is now about 1 pm and I have taken the full blotter now, its really nice, mellow in a way but then intense as well. I don't think this tab was the strongest available, but I can still feel it very nicely.


Edit: I understimated this tab somewhat. Just went on a walk to the shop with a friend and it all hit me in there, it is pretty damn intense. But great, all the same. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^its about 9 hours or so since I took it now, still feeling it, walking outside was proper nice. Can't believe I was so scared of taking it, thinking it would freak me out or something, didn't in the slightest it was just a total state of tranquility, especially while walking outside. The body buzz was as powerful as MDMA, if not better at times. Really enjoyed it, a thumbs up for acid one of the best drugs I've tried.

I just had a load of bong hits and the acid has kicked back in a little. Hopefully be able to do this again in a week or two, will try a higher dose next time. As great as the trip was/is, I felt it could have been more. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

yes LSD may be the best psychedelic I've tried thus far. My other LSD trips were lower intensity (I would say they were all +2s on the shulgin scale if that works for you). They were giggly fun with friends with some eye candy (most all my LSD trips were indoors listening to music during the peak then walking outside talking with my friends).


Now, tripping on high dose alone was something altogether different.


I'm thinking of combining a high dose with some MDMA dancing under the stars and see what manifests. I've only candyflipped once before and it was AMAZING, but albeit on a really low dose of LSD (not even enough to get much visuals). This time I'm thinking about reversing that and doing a high dose of LSD with just a small booster dose of MDMA halfway through (perhaps plugging 75mg-ish).


Anyways, lol I'm excited! I love LSD! It is so purely powerful! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

**LSD excretion in the sweat**


Ok, I've searched and haven't found a thread that actually answers my question with support.


Does anyone have a link or an article with actual support on whether or not we sweat out LSD while on it?  


If we don't sweat out LSD do we sweat out some other chemical?  


Please, no "I touched my dog and he freaked" or "thats bull shit".  Give me evidence or a link to a thread which does.

I don't belive much is excreted that way at all, most LSD is metabolised throught the intestinces. It sounds like another acid myth- though a new one for me. Thanks! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So lately iv been thinking that the magic of LSD has left me because of how much iv used it in the last couple years.


Well im happy to say that isnt so, all you need for the magic to be there is a good dose of some good LSD.


Those of you who feel that LSD isnt what it used to be to you (SKL!!) take a high(er) dose next time ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Can women have increased stomach cramps when ingesting lsd and when they are having their period (if sensitive).


I remember vaguely something about that. It could of course been something about pregnant woman (which trivially shouldn't take drugs) and stomach cramps.


I'm planning to introduce a girlfriend in the near future and I want to do the research for her since she won't do it herself due to a lack of interest.

I took half a tab of LSD last week and had a very positive experience. One awesome effect is an increased mind and body connection. I played soccer (well kicking the ball against a wall) and it was awesome. It felt like I could analyze everything much faster and really plan out how I should kick the ball and what movements were effective. Guitar playing was also quite fun in a similar way. 


I did a lot of good thinking and analyzing of my life/personality. And it seems quite easy to integrate your thoughts when your not tripping heavily. I could think about things for awhile, my mind wasn't being pulled by cosmic forces. Note that I am not advocating against big doses. My first time I took seven hits and had a profound connection with the universal source or the white ball of light.


Also, I am legally prescribed adderall. I don't abuse them and only take 10 or twenty milligrams on day that I use them. Sometimes the medication can be quite helpful but I still feel like it can be draining on the brain. Last week I took adderall more than usual (50 milligrams in 3 days) and smoked more cannabis than normal. So my brain wasn't feeling at its peak. My last min-trip reset my brain positively, even though I also smoked cannabis and took adderall that day. I have lots of respect for lysergic acid.

Have taken shrooms up to 3.5 grams of cubes but, 1.5 is what I usually take. I have tripped shrooms at least 12 times in the past year. I have had a bad trip, but I had to do with set and setting. Not my fault someone invited sober people over, that where not supposed to found out we where tripping.


Anyway, that was my last experience, it was about 4-5 months ago. Closer to 4.5 is my guess. I have decided that I would like to try LSD next. I am going to be getting my own apartment, so I will be able to decide who comes over and what not. I want to take 1 hit just to test the waters. I have two goods friends that are willing to trip with me, one of which has tripped on LSD 4-5 times. 


My question:


About how long do you think it will last. I usually here it last 6 hrs with another 6hr gradual come down. In other words 12 hrs before I will be able to sleep.


Next question, what body load should I expect, will it be like shrooms, or more energetic?


Is one hit a good place to start, or should I go more or less?


Also, any more advice would be 100% appreciated. thanks in advance for responses. (If this isn't the right place please move it)

^^


Honestly, I usually go into it anticipating things to be really going for 8 hours, rather than 6. That minor point aside, you should still be back down to the ground in about 12 hours. Falling asleep may or may not come easily to you at that point, it's hard to say. Assume 'worst' case and dose earlier rather than later IMO.


It's definitely more energetic than mushrooms. That's not say you'll be particularly stimulated and bouncing around all over the place, but you definitely won't get that weighted-down groggy sort of feeling that comes along with a mushroom trip. Aches and such in general aren't uncommon, but they aren't really anything to be concerned about.


One is a good place to start. Less and you, in all likelihood, are going to wish afterward that you had taken more. More and you *might* feel overwhelmed if your hits are particularly strong. It's all up to whatever you feel comfortable with.


Have fun. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hey can anyone compare intensity of trips in hits of acid, to grams of shrooms. Lets assume the hits of acid are around 50ug (if this is a good assumption) if not just give the number you are going off of.

say I give the kind and a roughly calculated potency. Also, I have another question, what is the next day like. I have been contemplating this and reading a lot for about a year now. But, I still have a few random questions. Like, should I eat a lot before tripping. I hear that you do not have much of an appetite while tripping, but at the same time sometimes people throw up when they are coming up. Sorry, if I am asking ridiculous question that can have been answered already, or if soemone can point me to a thread that would be cool. Have read wiki, tihkal, and erowid already anything I should check out?

**Trippin' on Acid on Acid**


When you guys eat acid, does anyone actually trip on like...  The drug.

Likeee...

Get stuck in loops about it being a spiritual chemical and how in god(who apparantly may exist now in some form??)'s name that is possible?? Wonder at the fact that you're totally fried from eating little square pieces of paper it's a lot different than ingesting any other drug.?  Has anyone ever felt like.

Advertised to by LSD?

Like the chemists are advertising their product to you through the experience?

Like feel your monetary worth is being directly converted into pretty visuals?

I always think to myself like "this is the hard stuff"  "this is the good stuff".


I guess all that was unecessary.


Just wondering does anyone else trip on the chemical itself?

Or experienced something similar?


It seems like that might be taking away from the potential of the trip or something.

I think hes asking if anyone else is amazed by how you can eat a little piece of paper and jump into an amazingly altered state of mind within the hour. The thought alone blows his mind (and mine as well). I've always been fascinated with how such a little teeny tiny amount of LSD can alter your perception of reality in a huge way.

Came across a recent article regarding LSD psychotherapy, good read:


[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/19/psychology.drugs](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/19/psychology.drugs)


> After three LSD sessions, a patient emerged from what was labelled chronic psychotic depression (she had attempted suicide three times, had been hospitalised, and given several courses of ECT, major antipsychotics and antidepressants), and was able to hold a job, derive pleasure from her days, and look forward to cultivating a varied garden of delights. She moved from cursing me for not letting her die to blessing me for the surprising freedom that opened up for her as a result of her LSD experiences. Psychotherapy, without LSD, would not have been enough, I'm afraid.

Hello everyone.


I'm off camping in brighton next week and I think it'll be the best time for me to try LSD for the first time.


This may be a stupid question, but what can I expect from 200μg? Thanks for any help.

^ A pretty decent ride. A normal dose (by today's standards) is between 80ug and 100ug, so 200ug should be a good trip (about 2 decent blotters).

You can expect a great trip.  You MAY experience cross-senses, but that's usually from larger doses.


LOL, my first trip was 2 hits of cartoon acid; they were 850μg per hit.

Expect to be awake, stimulated and seeing visual distortions for 12+ hours.


200ug for some people is pretty intense. For others its barely the threshold where they consider it a real "trip".

I assure you, they were at least AROUND 850 micrograms/hit.

My "person" had them tested.

They were originally liquid LSD, but dropped on blotter paper.

So I suppose they weren't all the same potency, but I'm positive they were FAR stronger then the average hit.


Ketamine is good ANYTIME on acid.

It's like an explosion of psychedelic bliss.

^I doubt very much you would have had anything close to 850ug. How can you have them tested for quanitity-afaik its not possible....Most blotter is "liquid LSD" or LSD-in-solution dropped onto blotter- thats not so special.

I know it's hard to believe, but it's possible.

I'm fairly certain that blotter paper can hold up to 1,200 micrograms per hit (at most). I think...


I guess no one will believe me unless they try some of it.

it depends what kind of blotter paper you use and how big the square is.

even 2 or 3mg is possible, as has been shown by the DOx's.


anyway, send me a couple and ill let you know how strong they are ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Count me in as a non-believer. In my experience, people tend to over-estimate the amount of LSD that is on their blotters.


I got a question: has anyone experienced briefly intensified trips from standing up too fast whilst on acid?


This has happened a couple times now, I'll be lying down with some friends and we'll be talking for a while, a couple of hours I think, then I'll stand up too quick and get a headrush like I normally do when I stand up quickly after sitting down too long. Except that it's like the acid becomes much stronger for a couple of seconds, e.g. increased visuals, really strange bodyload, confused mindstate...


Anyone else had this? Is it perhaps similar to the effect inhaling alkyl nitrite whilst on LSD might have?

Blotters can definitely hold a few mg. But nobody soaks LSD that strong. The strongest doses of LSD that I can attest to -- and it's hard to do so anyway 'cause it is a very subjective thing and your mind can play tricks on you -- are no more than 200mcg, perhaps a bit less.


Worth noting: Tim Leary once fed people either 200mcg or 1000mcg of LSD and told them that they'd received the other amount. They tripped according to what they'd been told, not what they'd been dosed.

**negative and positive**


In the past the combination of L and bud also helped to potentiate the experience. Although, this was all during a time when I was a heavy smoker. Recently, I have stopped smoking and am finding L more enjoyable, extremely limited paranoia and anxiety. Although, I find when it comes to any psychedelic the trip really is all about environment and onset.

^^ it is true. I find though sometimes if I smoke bud, it helps put me in the right place. Also, the weird feeling my body has on the come up of trips is not as weird. (I have only tripped shroms though)

> smoke DMT on L, not weed.
> 		
> Click to expand...


This is an old quote from youkai, but seeing as how it's relevant to my experience a few days ago, I'd have to agree that this is DEFinately the route to take.


I smoked it on a small dose of 2ci (just light visuals, nothing spectacular, could have been the valium I take) the night before as well. I find the DMT visuals (closed eye) to be absolutely breathtaking when combined with other psychedelics, full verbalization (not my voice) and the speed and intensity in the visuals/auditory effects are well worth it.


On the last night with the L, I was smoking 50mg every hour, and noticed it caused quite a bit of tolerance by the end of the night. I also had been smoking a lot of it the day before with nothing else, is DMT cross tolerant with LSD? Because I noticed a MARKED difference in potency on the second blotter (first got me to a full plus 4).

I dunno, it felt pretty cool when the head rushes were coming on but the "blah" and headachey feeling thereafter wasn't cool at all. Just felt dirty. Poppers certainly aren't my bag though, somebody just happened to kick me down one while I was tripping and I decided to give it a whirl. I may have overdone it though.

Yeah, the after feeling is the worst, may not be fun on acid. Did the visuals increase or anything? 


I may have to try this after all; here in Australia we get watered down iso-butyl nitrite so overdoing it is unlikely. 8)

You don't want to get asked for the time or something by a random dude and then spout off a bunch of total nonsense or philosophical bullshit either.

Well it seems to me that time is just a manifestation of our society, something that us humans tell ourselves for motivation and orginization of the day.

Yes and now again. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) Relatively benign drug bing is relatively benign yet still a binge. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) 


I haven't been smoking pot at all for a long time and I got a little bit and I've been really enjoying myself. It's so funny. One forgets that it's actually a pretty powerful drug in it's own right. Smoking recently has felt like it was when I smoked for the first time @ like 12 or 13 years old ... the whole world felt magical and funny and I was just a littttttle munted ... LOL.

I fell asleep after taking two tabs last week. I was having the strangest dreams, like i was at the core of the universe, then woke up, panicked, realised my arm was numb from sleeping on it, and that i was tripping. My visual field was a fucking mess for ages, i also felt like i'd forgotten who i was. 


It all came back to me though, took 2 tabs fell asleep, woke up full-on tripping, makes sense ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


i must mention it was really easy for me to get to sleep cause i was sleep deprived and had benzos in my system. i dont think i wouldve normally, the anticipation of tripping wouldve overridden any tiredness.

"and the big and dandy lsd questions thread blah blah blah" is stupid and unorganized and get no one anywhere. its just a way for you to put all the acid stuff in one place and not have to worry about....which is really dumb? im pretty sure you dont put one of the main main subjects of your site on one thread because "its taking up too much space elsewhere" or something. . awesome. keep up the rockin work. maybe if i start dumb worthless post "CrAzIeSt ThInG YoUvE DoNe On AcId woooah" maybe ill get tons of respones. thanks

You know, there is a thread stickied to the top of the forum where you can make improvement suggestions, and they are listened to and considered seriously... or you can shoot a PM to one of the moderators and see about putting your stuff back like you had it if its worthwhile. They might, they might not, but this isn't the place to go into it really, as its not about acid. eh?

You know you can search the B&D threads to find the specific info you're looking for? It's never been a problem for me. And by having the B&D threads, questions that get asked in new threads that have been asked many times before don't just get closed they get put into the threads. If you tried that in OD it would be closed mos def.

this may be a silly question -


quoth wikipedia:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant)


Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant that can easily cross cell membranes and the blood-brain barrier.[45] Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which is the ability of a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.[46]


am i right in assuming that it's probably a bad idea to take melatonin with lsd?


has anyone given it a try?

How strong is each dose of 2C-B?


If they are around 20-25mg each, I'd go for a 2C-B trip then around a week or more later maybe a Lucy and 2C-B combo.

Okay, a few misinformed friends of mine have been arguing with me about some things and I just wanted to ask here and hopefully get the facts.


Firstly, one of them said that if you get spinal tapped, if you have ever dosed it will show up.  (I'm pretty sure this is a common myth)

     They also are arguing that dosing makes the back of your brain bleed.  (Which  I know is false)


Also, they are saying that alot of LSD is made with rat poisons or other toxic chemicals.  I've tried explaining to them that LSD is one of the safest drugs to do but they are so friggin' stubborn! 


What's the best way to go about convincing them that all these myths are false.

They watched MK-Ultra and some other movie about dosing which involved the government using it for mind control and everything and they refuse to believe that those movies are just not giving all the information.


Halp?

a spinal tap will show a cheese burger you ate 12 years ago. minute amount of EVERYTHING you consume is found there (from what I understand)


its not made with rat poison but it is made from toxic chemical just as tooth paste is made with toxic chemical. but teh final product IS NOT toxic.


it only makes you bleed if you cut your self. but this happen on or off LSD.


lastly, you cant change what someone else thinks. thats there problem if they want to mislead.

**LSD between short intervals.**


Ok, i have a bit of a dilemma.. and im curious what you guys would do in my position.


I have a Doof (Psy Party) coming up on sat night.. i'll probably go anyway lol, i really doubt im going to be able to avoid tripping there since the Psytrance will be too much of an instigator lol.


However, i then have a Music Festival on Monday.. which i've been looking forward to tripping at for a long time. It's only 2 days apart.. and i know it usually takes around 3-5 days for tolerance too disappear.. so i't'd probably be a waste to dose on Monday..


But i was just wondering if its possible to pull off? or the time between the two events is too short.

Yes it's possible. I've taken a day apart and they still worked, just the second trip wasn't as strong. It depends how hammered you want to get. Why not just take only a small amount on Saturday and then get wasted on Monday.

Sadly is it, I have done crack more recently then I have dropped L. 


some people just grow out of tripping. I'm one of them. I still get high on other stuff but I don't find a need or want for the effects LSD gives me anymore. But I find some enjoyment out of a rush of dopamine. Dont read this as I use cocaine often because I don't. But given the mood, I would take the rock over the LSD.

^ Im not really surprised i know people who are the same, they would rather do meth over LSD. I think thats just because of the immense euphoria from it.. opposed too LSD, where its more psychological/mental..


I personally love been thrown into the abyss, down the rabbit hole etc.. i get too see a different side of reality for a while, and it's a really rewarding experience.

LSD is incredibly euphoric in a body and mind that has been taken care of and made strong by meditation and working out.

^^ My last trip was SOOO euphoric during the peak... I had a 2 hour orgasm. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Do whatever you feel like doing on LSD, is what I'd recommend. Go with the flow (ya know, try not to run around naked in the street..).. make sure if you are tripping with friends that they are good friends.


Maybe pick out a movie or two for the tail end when things are winding down but you're still very much awake.

I have a question, if you don't come prepared and bring your own stuff to concerts, how do you know who to ask? Because I have been to some huge festivals, wearing trippy clothing, asking around the best I can... Randomly just walking up to people and saying Hey u got some 'cid? seems like a good way to get busted by the cops. 


West coast seems to be much easier to find, but over here NO ONE has any, I've been searching for literally 2 years, and I know plenty of pot/e dealers. Only ran across it once, but I was on e at the time so I saved a hit for later... then my "friend" ate it later in the party. 


My college campus doesn't have many hippies, its mostly a commuter school, and there are a lot of guys studying to get into homeland security type jobs so it's not the best place to ask around either. I feel like by the time I get turned on, it will be too late and I'll have a real life and job to worry about. Or is it never to late to be turned on? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**LSD for a drug virgin?**


I've done LSD once, and I'm doing it again monday. The location is a new friends house who really wants to try acid. He's never even smoked a cigarette.


I plan on giving him a nice talk on LSD and psychedelia beforehand and make sure his hearts in the right place. And make sure he knows all his facts. I personally think this is a great idea, I can't think of a better way to introduce someone smart to mind altering substances!


Opinions? 


Can I not make polls until I make a certain number of posts or something btw?

It's hard to say because i don't know this individual.  I'd say if this person has a relatively stable self-conception as well as being emotionally stable, a little lsd could be excellent for him.  Use your best judgment.  If he really wants to try it, it might as well be with someone who's experienced and can create a good environment for the experience, which i assume describes you.


edit: it seems i didn't read your post very closely.  Given your limited experience with lsd and the fact that you don't know him that well, I wouldn't do it.

That's like saying should I have a rolls Royce for my first car. Also IME it ain't wise to be dosing kids when you have tripped once they don't understand the experiance and neither do you.

I really don't know him that well, but hes recently became a pretty good friend of my girlfriends. She has had some shitty friends, some attempted to take advantage of her (males). Her friends that were good people have passed away. So I am ever grateful for him being an honestly good dude. I get great vibes off of him, but I can't honestly say I KNOW him. He is intelligent though, so he will at least be able to comprehend whats happening lol.


And although I've only used it once, I have a good understanding on the way it works. I see you assume I have no idea what I'm doing, and I appreciate your concern, but if I felt confused about how LSD does its thing I wouldn't even consider this.

TRUTH!  Don't dose others until you fully understand the possibilities and consequences of the substance yourself.

spot on right there.  i think this is the best way to find what you're looking for.  make new friends.  dont just ask for drugs.  chat someone up for a bit, get to know them a little, and mention if they know anyone who has a hookup.  the chances of a random person *having* acid and wanting to sell it to a stranger that randomly walks up to them and asks for it are pretty slim.  but the chances of an acquaintance knowing someone that knows someone that is trusted by a dealer?  much more likely.

**LSD aftertaste**


Anyone else get a weird taste in their mouth on just lsd? I usually notice it once the lsd takes effect. I don't mean the blotter tastes like something.

could be that its not LSD and it could be a DoX compound which is the most common RC passed off as LSD.

yup Ive had that, last time I tripped - was very good acid, but as I was coming up more & more I got a horrible taste in my mouth, kinda like cod liver oil & too much saliva with a feeling of nausea.

Got this feeling & taste last time I did 2C-E, how high dose did you do? 


This was definitely LSD that I had though, time to come up was bang on - about 1.5-2 hours til peak and stopped tripping completely about 8 hours later + I know the person who prepares it from crystal.

Well, like jimmyblaze1 said, it's quite possible it was DOx. How long were you tripping? 8-12Hrs~? Or 20+Hrs~? That might help out.


Or, it could be quite possible you were having taste hallucinations. I did. I am 100% sure I took acid on Friday and I was having some funky taste and smell hallucinations.

OH MY GOD!!! I don't know how many fuckin' times I've talked about my wonderfully amazing acid come-ups!!! But YESS!!! :D So much euphoria!! Both times I felt so happy and energetic I didn't know what to do with myself, first time I was by myself in my room so I just danced to music and did all weird things with my body. The second time I was with my friends and as soon as we stood up to go for a walk I could feel it coming on. For a couple minutes I was just saying, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!! Then I started jumping in the air and stuff. I really wish there was a word to describe the feeling.  And i love how acid totally gets rid of ALL my anxieties!!! I can just be myself even in the middle of the city!

If you think you're a slave or not, doesn't change the fact that you are or you aren't. We aren't free to do what we want; we can of course, DO whatever we want. It doesn't change whether or not we are legally able to...

And by the way Swilow and Big stroonz, you guys don't agree with me??? The lsd part i said at the end was sort of a joke but seriously, how can you agree with modern culture and society?

Out of all the psychs ive done ( alot of them) LSD is the best, its one of the few drugs that every time you dose you will get a different experience unlike coke, meth, H, weed, even MDMA.


LSD is great and noone really gets addictd, also its one of the most physically safe psychedelic drug you can use, physically safer than vitamin C. Though if you dont have a trip sitter around it csn be dangerous to your mental health.


Bad trips also suck but as long as you have the right set and setting you should be fine, just dont go to a party on it. I find I get the best experiences when im by myself, id suggest 1-2 experienced people with you at least one sober or on a very small dose That could prevent you from doing dumb shit coz acid takes you far, far away from reality.

Yeah with LSD and mushrooms symbolic imagery is a common effect, but there is an enormous collection of symbols and I'm finding it hard to say what part is some sort of eidetic (sometimes synaethetic) memory from the most symbolic images we once saw or what part comes naturally almost like basic concepts or Jungian / Platonic forms...

Is the feeling of tapping into collective consciousness illusory or not, are we just copying? Nature? Nurture?

Potatoe. Tomato.


With cannabis I have more than once gotten the effect of seeing a fast slideshow of stuff from my own memory, with 4-FMP+DMT I've had another sort of imagery slideshow that was many times more fantastic but basically still the same thing. But I didn't notice any suspect collective consciousness like stuff.

How likely are you to absorb LSD through your fingers?


i was fondeling my vial and got a bit on my finger tips which i whiped off.


Now im starting to feel something but i also just smoked a bowl so im not sure what im feeling.


I guess ill know soon enough if im tripping or not. But jusst vurious if a drop or two on the skin will absorb without DMSO?

I think a standard hit in a vial would take far longer than even 10 seconds to be fully absorbed into your skin.

**The mental orgasm**


On a high dose of LSD, I was able to meditate on the feeling/concept of an orgasm and intensify this feeling over a period of a few minutes.


Add a balloon of nitrous and an amazing full body orgasm lasting about 5 minutes followed.

Thanks guys, I honestly thought people only took it for the crazy visions!


Also, my friend who's very experienced with most drugs was telling me a story of how a girl he knows almost died after taking dodgy LSD.


Is it common to get sketchy LSD? I can't understand why anyone would screw with the chemicals, it's not like pills where you've gotta bulk them up or anything right?

It's common to often get blotter containing certain RC's (Research Chemicals) substituting LSD. Some of these chemicals in high dose's can be dangerous.. B-dFLY comes to mind, which is why i cautioned DOB on taking 20 blotter hits of supposed LSD.. because that would be in the dosage range that would cause problems if it turned out to be something else.

Hey I'm considering dropping acid for the first time and am too bumfuck lazy to search around so I thought I'd ask here... Whats the deal with flashbacks?what can I expect in terms of them for the first few weeks after the trip? Can doing one hit of acid guarantee flashbacks for the rest of your life? If not then how much acid would one need to take to get to the point of those 60-year old ex hippies who still get flashbacks? Would lots of moderate doses have the same effect as a few big doses ect ect.


Basically I'm completely clueless, halp!

Most people hardly ever get flashbacks. Anyway flashbacks are not something that are caused by the drug itself. Flashbacks are caused by experiences so intense that your mind can't begin to comprehend them. You know, like war veterans getting flashbacks of the war, without ever taking any sort of psychedelic drug.


LSD is one of the safest substances ever developed by man. If you use it responsibly that is.


However: be prepared for your world view to be permanently altered. After your first trip you will never be the same, there's no going back to ignorance. This is usually a positive thing though.

As long as the klonopin is not at a dose that will fuck you up, it shouldn't reduce the intensity of it at all. At most it will dull it a little. As far as the adderal, i would skip it the day or night you trip... 


LSD is energetic enough as it is, and focusing shouldn't be the highest thing on your list of priorities while tripping, generally speed and LSD don't mix....

I dont think im gunna make a new thread ' so ill just post here.

yesterday i dropped 3 tabs a normal dose of my own stuff im used too.

i dropp at least once every 2 or 3 weeks..

i had a hell of a good time. too good.

now i feel kinda emotionally unstable and i guess im kind of despressed or disappointed in myself

for allowing myself to binge on oc/benzos as much as i was. and get addicted and physically and slightly mentally unhealthy,

i swore i wouldent pick it up again, and im not.

ive kept my use to a min with friends, alot of them even the ones who shouldn't be worried, were about me.


i dont really wanna fry either for a really long time and i think im gonna barely smoke weed.

i guess im not satisfied at all with where im at in life and am finally making a change.


anyone experience this?

or i guess the better question is, has lsd changed your perspective and values so much it caused you to have a experience close?

I haven't done lsd yet, but I had a somewhat similar experience with 2ci 


2 years ago I basically would try whatever my friend could get me, at the time that was pretty much just pills (oc, ritalin, adderall, xanax.....and I was considering trying coke). My first psych experience with 2ci made me realize how stupid I was to be fucking with that stuff......and I haven't really messed with pills or any "hard" drugs since then (aside from vicodin once or twice). 2c-i also made it pretty easy for me to cut back on weed. Since I've tripped a few times now, I easily go weeks or months without smoking. 


I've also had trips that made me want to change things in my life (aside from drug use).....but I realized that the psychedelic doesnt make a difference, it's all about what I choose to do.....and well I've decided to not change things.


EDIT: and it might not be a popular opinion on a drug forum, but pills are fucking garbage. Nothing good comes from that shit. Personally I would just drop it all together

^^act on your feelings...


your realizing you need to slow down or stop using oc and benzos... 


consider it a positive thing, LSD can only show you the path, your the one who has to put forward the effort in following it to change your life. 


I had a life changing experience with my first acid trip, i realized that i have so very much to live and be happy for that it pretty much killed the depression i had been living through for the last few years.... Life is beautiful, cherish every day you have. 


All in all it made me a much more optimistic individual, life went from being one monotonous boring day after another until i die to something much more happy. I started to enjoy my life from that day. My first thought after walking out of my friends house the morning after the trip was "life is wonderful". It was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life and i will never forget it, going on about two and a half years since that day and if i look back on it, i still find myself fighting back tears.... 


My advice is to take some time off from the drugs, and take some time to sort out your life. Make positive changes in your life, you will be happier in the end because of it...

Thanks alot for the replys guys


If anything i have learned soooo much from everything ive done

i cant begin to imagine how much ive learned from myself through lsd

but even now i see its not soo much about doing it but yea acting on it.


to do it as often as i was i realize even once a month isn't enough time to get your head

together and actually learn to the full extent of every experience.


I figure i have alot of sorting to do and so im pushing everything aside so i can

stop and smell the roses for once in a few years.


once again thanks for the replys. =]

Something similar happened to me. I was doing a lot of weird pills (mostly oxy and Dexedrine) that either I or my friends could cheek or take from our parents, grandparents, or whoever. Also doing a bit of coke and smoking weed whenever I could afford it. Anyways, I was fairly experienced with psychedelics having tripped a few times before.

Anyways, I got an LSD connection. I bought 10 hits, planning on doing them with 2 of my friends. But given my tendancy to take whatevers in front of me, I eneded up taking 2 of them to 'test the potency'. The tabs weren't that strong, so I decided to pop 2 more. Given how time distorts on LSD... about 20 minutes later I ended up popping 3 more thinking this stuff was awful. This was a mistake. However one I learned from. This was 3 months ago and since then I haven't touched DXM, coke, oxycodone, or any psychedelic since. I've done dexedrine twwice since then, but o big deal. Fortunately I didn't fry myself (especially considering all the high doses of DXM I had done). And only now do I feel ready to trip again.

LSD is definately moving my drug-related opinions back to where I was when I first discovered Bluelight, as a nieve, casual cannabis/MDMA-only user.


I lightly sampled the whole gamut, but after a few years had an on/off Oxy run; after that any/all drugs were always about addiction, never mere recreation or self-improvement.


While it may be slightly aggravating to suddenly lose interest in / view from a different perspective your personal addictions/habits/lifestyle (drug related+unrelated), losing your existing comfort zone with your personal status quo, its really hard to argue that such fresh perspectives / self-criticisms are anything but good so long as they lead you a healthier life or to examine things you normally take for granted.


Like anything else, tho, there's only so many lessons you can learn the same way before turning progess into burnout/addiction ... my initial fond&euphoric MDMA days were comparably life-changing, but I saw it destroy several friends, and when I (twice) stopped treating MDMA as a moderated, revered substance and instead only as 'pills' I soon lost the magic as well.


Even as someone who takes it easy these days, having more Acid than I need at once is invitation enough to overdo it .. Addiction in general is harder to kill the longer it lives, but if you can use one drug against the others its safe to say you've come out on top ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hey, I got hold of some acid recently, it was sold on rowntrees fruit pastels (chewy sweets covered in sugar, the sugar absorbs the liquid) which where then wrapped in clingfilm to transport it. I'd like to know if the LSD could degrade under, or react with the clingfilm (I know jack shit about chemistry and thought that the 'acid' might actually dissolve the plastic). Anyone got any clue? I assume since clingfilm is used to wrap food and must be fairly chemically stable and harmless but would something as complicated as LSD damage it or be contaminated by it?

Acid isn't actually an acid as such - more just a slang term. From my very limited chemistry "knowledge" anyway - could be wrong on that but it won't eat through the cling film either way. Should be fine in film but I wouldn't store it longterm like that. I suspect you aren't planning to store it longterm so shouldn't be a problem at all ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Ideally acid likes dark, cold, dry conditions so best to keep it as close to that as possible but in the short-term it's a tougher lil blighter than it gets credit for and will survive most conditions within reason ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well it's actually an carboxylic amide, but it has a basic nitrogen, so it'll form a salt with an acid, hence LSD tartrate (isn't organic chemistry just a barrel of laughs? ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif))

Organic chem is certainly more fun than other aspects of chemistry (orbitals, quantum mechanics, et al.), I must say. And of course, as Shamblerson points out, the practical applications of it can be quite delicious. :D

it was just so fucking dark, i don't think a lot of people would enjoy it tripping on acid for the first time....


You want to cry from the beauty of it all? Go for a walk on a beautiful spring day, or at night time under a clear sky and a bright moon....

When i start to cry "from the beauty of it all" i know LSD is doing its job,


it doesnt matter where i am or who im with, or if im watching or listening to anything at all.

It just happens.

LSD just shows you how beautiful and rich everything around you is.

Crying is such a great release when you are feeling those emotions.

i once tried watching fantasia 2000 while on mushrooms and it sent me into a downward spiral i couldnt snap out of till the trip ended.


Not sure if it was the movie or just my mind set but i dont think ill be watching movies while tripping anymore.


(i do enjoy a nice music dvd for the comedown though)

i was talking about the remaster of the ORIGINAL fantastia

i never did like the 2000 fantasia part 2 nearly as much


now, when i found that a movie or piece of music caused me or a friend to head off into a downward trip spiral, playing music that is totally different than the music that led to the bad turn can break it


or a couple hits of good weed or a hit of nitrous can jolt ya brain out of bad trip spiral


in bad cases, a nice cold shower works, but u should remove ur clothing first.....there are times when that comes quite natural....the trip spiral might have even left ya nearly naked!!!

other times getting naked can be quite a chore

Hey, I am sure this question has been asked before, but I didn't want to sift through hundreds of comments to find it. Unless there is an easier way...


Anyway, I digress. 

Question is this. Does LSD ever effect the serotonin receptors?

Two easier ways - the search engine or (more usefully) the "search this thread" button on the top right of the page ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


LSD affects just about every neurotransmitter you have to varying degrees. F&B posted the list in order of effect recently - quite possibly in this thread - but the search engine will track it down if you ask it nicely ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This can be found from wikipedia. Note that the lower the graphs, the higher the affinities. Which means that the highest affinity would be to the 5ht1a receptor.

**A queston i have been wondering about lsd**


Hi all, I have been looking at this forum for a little over a month,just glacing at threads and such, and have fineally hopped abord BL.


I have much knowlege about LSD/rx,But today i come to the community of Blue light to answer my question.


My question is how were i to (thereticlly) obtain a vial of lsd(100 doses) and apply it to sugar cubes/blotter paper.


I know theres much more of a process of just using a baby dropper to drop it on the paper, I know theres  a dilution process and i would love it if there was anyone to help walk me through it.


For sugar cubes do all i do is just drop one single dose on it and it's ready to be consumed for an inner journy!?


and for blotter, Again do all i do is just drop 1 drop per 1/4 square? I know theres a much more complicated process then that, I just know it.


Thank alot

[They call me malc-da-kid]

As for dropping liquid from a vial on candy, that's all you do. You just put a few drops on the vial. No way to know the exact dose. As for laying blotter, I'm sure someone else knows more about that, but you don't just drop it square by square; the blotter is left to soak in the solution and, again, I'm not sure you can be sure of the exact dose.

Well ive heard from a source that 1 drop is compared to 50ug to 100ug,(enoug to trip balls) But again it does depend on the dose of each drop.

It is hard to tell how much acid is in a vial per drop considering it is a solution.  Just judge the dosing by titration.  


Sugar cubes, sweet tarts, etc. work fine for a holding device.  I have some sweet tarts chilling in my stash as we speak.


As for trying to put the drops on blotters, don't even bother imo.  You'd have to dilute the solution with a solvent according do the geometry of the blotter paper to evenly distribute the doses among the sheet.  Just a lot of bullshit to try and deal with/figure out.

blotter is generally laid by the people handeling crystal....


and your not one of those people, so just be happy with putting a drop on a piece of candy or a sugar cube....


just put a drop on your tounge and see what its like....


theoretically you can put enough LSD in a drop or two to have you tripping utter fucking balls.... but that is rare and its probably already diluted down to 50-100ug per drop...

How should I store my liquid. Im gonna put it in something small which blocks light, but would storeing it in my drawer/closet have it degrade at all over a year or two or would it be better to put it in the freezer?

It wouldn't be quite as good...especially if you 5 hits...it could be alright considering you want to take shrooms as well, but - 


Hallucinogenic drugs directly affect the serotonin receptors(specifically the serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT2), so anything you take within the tolerance time period will A) not be giving your brain the recharge time it needs; and B) lessen your experience.

Question:

A person had 4 awesome mushroom trips and decided to take LSD for the first time and got (supposed) 200micro hoffmans, how much should one take for the first acid trip?


1/4, 1/2 ?


EDIT:

The whole thing is a bit scary, but a half or less seem very inviting...

Take half and if you feel fine a few hours later take the other half.

I would recoemdn taking the whole thing.

But if you feel anxious about doing so than try going with half and see how you feel an hour later and then decide whether you want to take the other half.

Dont wait too much longer than an hour though because then if you take the second half later it will only prolong the trip with out making it stronger.

I always just cut those in half and chew on them when they're done. You should get about a good 8-10 hits worth from chewing on a vial that once contained 100 hits. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

wow! yes - don't wash it - one time i asked my good friend if he knew where to find acid and he said yes - but, he meant literally "find" acid - lol - he led me to a place by the highway that he had tossed an empty vial earlier that day - so after pawing through the roadside we got it and i drank the tiny dribble - then i ripped it open and licked the inside pretty thoroughly - i had one of the most intense trips in my life - i saw some amazing visuals - my closet turned into an Egyptian sarcophagus covered in gold...  don't wash it!!

**Unreceptive to acid?**


Is it possible that my body is just naturally unreceptive to acid? Or just decent/lower dosages of it? I have attempted 3 acid trips now, all of which have been failures. My first time trying acid, I figured one tab would be enough to effect me, seeing as I have never taken it, and nothing. Another time my friend hooked it up with one tab which were really good and he was trippin' already off one. Again, I felt nothing.


And most recently, I took 2 tabs figuring that should definitely be more than enough since I have zero tolerance. My friend took 2 as well and was totally geekin' hard. I took 2 at 9:30ish, kept the tabs in my mouth for about 5 minutes. I waited until 1:30 in the morning until I finally decided to just go to sleep. 


So is it possible that my body is just unreceptive to acid? I dxm trip frequently, but that wouldn't make sense to effect acid trips. Next time my connect gets more tabs, I plan on doing 5. If that doesn't work, idk what will.

I dxm trip 2-3 times a week. So that works. Shrooms work. MDMA works. Salvia works. It's just acid that seems to have no effect on me. At least in the dosages I have taken so far.

Try not using DXM for a few weeks and then drop the acid. IDK if it will work, but it's worth a shot.

Good call. If you frequently make tri-weekly DXM trips then there in lies your problem, or at least there in could be your problem. DXM causes a certain amount of serotonin reuptake inhibition, an affect that, in some people, greatly reduces the affects of 5-ht2a agonists.

I'm not doubting you but I find that really hard to believe. If you can trip off of psychedelic tryptamines then half a vial of LSD will make you trip, provided that you do in fact have acid in that vial. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) I mean, what exactly could allow for someone to be unaffected by LSD but affected by other 5ht2a agonists?

I don't think DXM tolerance has anything to do with LSD resistance (save for perhaps a minor psychological effect) but you do know that robotripping 2-3 times a week is likely dangerous right?

I have a friend that the only psychedelic he's really receptive to is herb, he's taken windowpane LSD and shrooms and both times he just got a body buzz and no other effects and to him LSD was a stimulant and he did take strong LSD and mushrooms both times.

The first time one of my friends tried LSD he felt nothing besides a body high until he smoked some marijuana. 


I understand why he didn't trip hard though, it because of the setting. A lot of experienced trippers were all on LSD too and we were all drinking in an apartment with loud music, too much going on at once to focus on the trip, even I had a hard time noticing my visuals until I stepped outside and then I was blown away at how vibrant they were. [I was on 4 hits of really strong blotter]

I think the DXM is the problem. Tripping on DXM 2-3x a week is some pretty heavy use, and i'd expect it to effect your enjoyment of other drugs (and life in general, for that matter).

watch.  I bet I know whats gonna happen.  He'll try one more time and get frusterated.  Then in a last ditch effort he will unluckily eatl like 100 tabs and then it will work and he'll go crazy for a day or too.

Also, it could be bunk acid and your friend was just getting a placebo trip off it. (it does happen, especially with inexperienced users).

I've had this problem with all drugs at one point ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Frustrating as shit... The problem was I've been smoking dank for 3 years daily, my brain did not even work without weed... Haha.. some sad shit. I was doing MDMA and was like WHY ISNT IT WORKING, like 4 times lol -- I wanted to have a clean trip without weed. The 5th time I gave up and smoked some herb then BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM HEAD SHOT, and you know the rest. Rolled fuckin balls. Maybe your problem lies in DXM.

Not that it can basically nullify the effects of acid (or any drug for that instance) however my partner seems more receptive to drugs, all different kinds so I can just put it down to one specific class, then myself. I attribute this to me being **alot** more analytical then him. So basically I can't "let myself go" as easily as him. For example, we might take the same pill and he's munted as while I'm only "half there".....I think about things (eg, what's happenig with my body? What's this drug doing to me?) too much!


But like I said, can see how, if this is the case with you, it could completely negate the affects of LSD. Im too putting my money on the DXM.

It's not about tolerance at all, it's about brain function. I tested this theory many, many times and I know that it is true, for me anyway. When you do something like smoke weed daily for 3 years, your brain WILL get use to it. I did this and tried to do MDMA several times with little effects at all. As soon as I hit the blunt though I was in the clouds ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

Hello,


I am totally new to LSD or any psycho active drug. I've only tried XTC 4 times in the past, but I'm searching for something more visual, something deeper, and longer lasting. I've always been wondering how to find LSD around (yeah yeah, it finds you, but I guess it did then ;-) ), but now a study mate of mine is able to get me 4 papertrips. 


I now face a 'luxary' dilemma: I live in the Netherlands, and drug testing is free over here. Problem is that I would like to have this experience (and hopefully 'these experiences') with my girlfriend. If I get 1 trip tested, I will only have 3 left, which leaves me with an uneven amount for me and my gf. For future use we would then have to buy some more from a different batch, and hence have to test it again. So, getting 1 out of 4 tested isn't so 'economically interesting'...


I am kind of thinking about just buying 4, and get nothing tested at all. We would then start with half a paper trip each, and see how it goes. 


I know that in America and a lot of other parts of the world testing isn't free, so I guess a fair amount people have experience with taking the drug without testing it first. 


So my question kind of is: what would you advise me to do?


Thanks in advance!

Okay I have a couple questions. 


1. After your trip...does it change your perception in a way where you feel more disassosiated? Like...you don't feel like you're living in-the-moment totally? Or maybe you feel alienated? Does it make it harder to feel normal emotions through normal means? Like attraction for the opposite sex, or the excitement of a party.


I know...it sounds stupid. But like I really don't know how an acid trip and it's perception changes could affect you. I've heard from a couple who've experienced ego death...how they have no desire for anything or someshit. I feel dead inside as it is...I don't wanna feel even more emotionless. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)


2. How long post-trip do you feel the perception changes...if any? Like how long until you come back to a totally normal, sober state of mind?

After you come down it's definitely not a disassociated state i personally felt more connected and at peace with my life and surroundings after a high dose acid trip. The best i can describe is like feeling reborn and invigorated. That feeling probably lasted around 3-4 months after the trip and then it was kindof back to humdrum sober state of mind with a better perspective on my life. 

Hope that helps a little.

have you ever gotten anything tested? do you have any reason to suspect you need to get these trips tested? do you know your dealer well, and do you trust his experiences eating this batch?


if you have any reason to suspect adulterated trips, then i must suggest you get them tested. giving up one trip is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that you got exactly what you paid for. if you are really worried about the unevenness of 3 trips for two people, is there any way you can buy 5 trips and get one tested?

Ryan i would have to agree with thespiral. In no way is it disassociated state, your thought pattern may be a little different but in a good way. After a strong pleasent and introspective trip leaves me feeling so wonderful !! It is like a total rebirth of your consciouness and if anything u will feel more in the moment ! O wow u got me jonesing for some of those lovely Hoffman anniversery tabs now !!!!

Sounds like the best course of action - unless a trustworthy psychonaut has verified these tabs to be LSD for you. In that case, I'd simply take 1.5 - 2 tabs right from the get-go. Two relatively strong hits of acid, by today's standards, would make for a good first-time trip in my opinion.


After a good acid trip, I'm usually a little burnt out the next day. The long-term therapeutic effects of LSD are invaluable, though.

Thanks all for the replies. I jsut gave the green light to get these hits. I will buy them from a friend, who's friend has a friend with acid, who doesn't use it himself, but his friends do. For me that means I don't know where it comes from, so that's the reason why I want to test it.


Now that I think of it: if I get 1 tested I have 3 left. I could then use those to get up to a total of 1,5 hits per person, which would indeed be a great night as I think of it. Testing it will also make it a safe night. (Yes, I have tested something before: xtc.)


Thanks again, I'll let you know when acid has done it's thing for me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just wanted to share some appreciation. I had been eating a lot of L over the last 3 or so years, and have eaten some excellent shit. I thought I was experienced and would eat 5 or 6 of what everyone in the town would call "amazing dose". 


Well, until the other day. I ran into an old friend and the town is very dry, so I could only grab a few. Knowing her, I decided to test the water with one, the smallest. Me and a buddy literally lost our shit for like 6 hours, everything seemed like cartoons, telepathy, everything melting into other things, i could paint my room with nothing, vivid hallucinations appeared out of the wall in and out of fractals. I was skeptical it was L after having eaten so much, but I was down around 11-12 hours and felt great since. I think it was just sooooo high mic'd and I had never had anything even close to this. Like...it easily felt like I was tripping twice as hard then on 5 of the best, cleanest L I've ever had. 


Anyone had a similar experience? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i had lost faith in dose for a long time, a lot of bunk/weak/RC hits going around, but recently i stumbled upon some hits of so-called needlepoint. personally, i dont put a lot of faith in categorizing different types of acid like fluff, needlepoint, amber, lavender, etc. maybe it has something to do with the presence of different isomers, i dunno. i havent seen any convincing evidence one way or the other.


however, this "needlepoint" was the strongest, most angelic, beautiful dose i've ever eaten. it was exceptionally powerful, but not pushy, and easy to control. the visuals were present but mild, the headspace was like a crazy tumbling labyrinth of ideas, but it was as though i could take it all in and process everything, i felt like a mentat, or like i had two consciousnesses existing simultaneously, a tripping mind and a sober mind, and i could switch between the two at will. the body feelings were lush and erotic without twitchiness or discomfort. 


ONLY ATE ONE HIT


amazing. i feel as though ive fallen in love with acid all over again. its gone now, good thing i picked up a strip ^_^

i just got some of these

except they say 2010 in gray at the bottom.  on the back is alex grey's Ecstasy 


they seemed to come out around bicycle day.  anyone get any like this?  i'm hoping they are nice and potent as they are rumored to be.  my last blotters were decent, but weak i think.

thats a big trip, to put it lightly. 


hoffmans first dose (the first EVER) was 250ug and he freaked his shit. 

like full on trippin his face off. 

yes, 300ug will get you absolutely out of your face. 


you will never believe you could be that high. 


Id advise halfing the hit and testing it. 

if after 2 hours you arent satisfied, eat the rest.

Hmm. How about 225? I'd like to avoid redosing. I can always just try 150 mcg if that's what is best.


I'm not an experienced tripper; I've done 2c-i and salvia, and the latter left me quite shaken.

I would personally not go over 200 and between 100 and 150 seems best to me for a seasoned tripper. Full on trips are great but it's nonsense that your first brush is only as magical as it is intense. My first one was with a bunk blotter so that doesn't count, the real first time was with I estimate to be about 100 micrograms but what made it extra special is that it was at my dad's and he was there to guide me (he has experience with it, but many years ago). I Experienced synaesthesia and my thought patterns became really interesting but strange. As I sometimes spoke my mind my father would look at me with a smirk and sometimes repeat what I said or write it down. Things like: 'even as a word blue is my favorite color', but some things were lots funnier / stranger. I saw all kinds of stuff waving around in his aquarium but other than that the visuals were not that pronounced.

He took me for a car ride when the sun was setting and I never saw more beautiful pastel colors in the sky and elsewhere all around. Just magical.


So in other words: don't focus too hard on the 'micage' of your first trip, focus on set and setting!


But do what you gotta do, if you arrange an awesome setting and decide to go for a strong dose anyway make sure you are prepared for anything. And follow rules like: better not take calls, set an extra day aside, possibly get yourself a sitter who is basically not necessarily there to guide you but who is also a very good friend you can share your feelings with. Perhaps arrange a downer for either when shit really hits the fan and it appears vital to the situation that a little edge is taken off, highly preferred not to do it of course and let your mind run its course it apparently needs to.

Downers like some benzo's can be good for when your body is still electrified but your mindtrip is over. I don't think that counts for the first so-many acid trips. At the start, or basically as long as you keep finding new material in your mind it's good to let it perculate in the afterglow for a healthy reintegration!

With much experience that may not be as important anymore and one may choose to give the body rest at a certain point.

Thanks for the advice, Solipsis. I did end up taking 200 mcg (approximately, of course) last night.


It was quite easily the most intense drug experience of my life, and that includes the salvia that I smoked. Eventually, after a few more trips at varying dosages, I think I will better understand exactly what happened to me, but until then it's only a partially formed puzzle.


Let me recount a bit of my experience for the benefit of anyone that would take the time to read my report.


I dosed at 6:24 P.M. PST with great anticipation. I was a little uneasy about the fact that I could no longer control what would happen to me following this action, but I find that that anxiety is suffocated by wonder once you are thrust into that magical new world.


At one point, even though it had only been an hour and I was most definitely feeling the onset of effects, I began to suspect that I had been given a substance separate from LSD since it felt eerily similar to 2c-i, but I soon realized that that was not the case. I was outside at this moment of understanding, and when I glanced down at the ground I saw a smirking figure; a wraith born from the careful placement of sand and shadow, one that knew my inner thoughts and wore that painted expression because it understood exactly how little I expected what came next, and... somehow, though I openly mocked this notion in my own mind, I knew that this was a representation of the chemical I had ingested, that she (LSD) would show me exactly how mistaken I was, and, sure enough, during the peak, when I went to recall that instant, I felt as though it were LSD herself traveling back through time to teach me what I had neglected to take the time to learn.


The best part of all of this is that I only felt anxious during the come up. As SOON as I started to get slight patterning on the walls, my anxiety dissipated and I was able to immerse myself in the experience completely. I did remain lucid for a large majority of the trip, and was able to converse with a friend about what I was experiencing (though to what degree of legibility I cannot say, he claimed that it made perfect sense to him, and I'm inclined to believe that since he has tried mushrooms himself on two separate occasions and could relate a great deal to what I was experiencing), which I'm sure helped to lessen the blow of having my mind ripped from my skull and trampled on (gently and with great care, of course.)


At the peak my body became very foreign to me; it was as though I was receding from this world into an ethereal state where only the mind exists.


The trip lasted about 9 hours and when I went to sleep at 3:40 A.M. (exhaustion had set in) I was still in the throes of a very mild form of introspection brought on by the LSD. Technically still tripping, though only slightly compared to where I had been.


I do feel that most of what I experienced was simply my consciousness' manner of instruction, that it personified objects in order to teach me something. An illusion borne from the desire of an awakening, if you will.


I think that's enough for now. Maybe I'll write up a detailed trip report when I can recall better the chronology of the trip.

Solipsis, that's a really beautiful experience, I really enjoyed reading about it !  If I ever spawn offspring babies, I would be totally into intiating them into the psychedelic world if they wanted it !  How old were you when you had that experience ?


Arohydro, nice report !  LSD sure is incredible.  I recently just had a trip where I did 3 hits of acid that no one I was with had tested before.  Apparently it was "a little too good, seriously", according to the supplier.  I was looking for an earth shattering type of trip that night, and oooohhh man did I ever get it.  I have never felt a drug so completely take over my nervous system and just totally immerse me in itself.  At some points I felt like, well to make an analogy, my mind was a molecule of water, and that acid trip was the ocean.  LSD will forever have a special spot in my heart among all of the psychedelics I have ever done, because it is so deep and connecting and powerful.  I find it much more immersive and deep and intense and scary and delightful and wondrous and hellish and pleasant than 2C-X.  And there is just something about the visuals and state of mind that feels so genuine and from within.  Ahhhh, LSD, my scary crazy awesome friend.

Sorry if this has been asked a million times - Will someone be able to act normal on the comedown/afterglow of acid, around 12 hours after dosing? And will you still have dilated pupils at this time?

^ I'm usually a bit zombified after the peak of an acid trip subsides, until I get a good night's sleep. The day-to-day routine suddenly becomes sort of awkward and retarded.


That's my experience, FWIW. Seems like this varies from person to person though.


Can't answer the pupil question -- I've never really bothered to take note of the pupil dilation duration. My pupils actually tend to be really dilated naturally for some reason.

if you're worried about acting weird around parents or something, I'm pretty damn sure you'll be alright especially after 12 hours.  Last saturday was my first time with acid and had the most amazing trip of my life and after 10 hours i wouldve been able to act sober around parents


But I was wondering what a good dose for microdosing is?  Me and my friend are thinking 1/2 hit each and just going about a normal day.


this acid is white on white blotter and with 1 and a 1/2 hits I had the most amazing trip of my life but my friend who also did that much didnt trip nearly as hard as i did for some reason.  So I think if we both took a half hit we'd be fine and not ever go into a deep trip during the day, but i'd like to hear some opinions

Agreed. I would say you'd probably be able to pass you're dopiness off as 'a big night and not getting any sleep'.


Re the pupils - I reckon it'll all depend on the person.


Lets put it this way, you probably won't want to be interacting with people anyway and would want to try and stay clear.


Personally I just feel like my brain is all dumb and I can't really think too coherently, and just wanna sleep [I think most of that is **because** I love my sleep too much! Gotta get my 9/10hours straight or else I'm grumpy! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)]

 Im going back to school on monday so I set out to trip today and it was a great trip. that lsd tore me to shreads and put me back together. ahh feels like I earned my sanity lol. and the most amazing afterglow ever. A shower, joint, and mushroom cap just kicked the afterglow into purebliss but still afterglow level. I had also secured some xanax and heroin.


Though I still feel unsatisfied, I want a nice dmt blast to end my night right. but either way it was a great day and this afterglow is unfuckin believable.


sorry if this post wasnt productive but just had to share some of this amazing energy

Hi all. Just curious what the recommended time between trips is? Would it be okay to trip again a week after originally tripping or should I just pick one time or the other? Thanks.

A week has been sufficient time for me to recover physically and experience the drug's effects fully again in my own experience. It helps if you take care of yourself during the time in between too. Catch up on any lost sleep, eat right, stretch etc...

I have a question for people more experienced than I...


I know that being outside on a warm night, surrounded by nature, is the best way to spend an acid trip. Though it has to be said that watching TV is really good fun, on a kind of low dose. 


I wondered if anybody ahd tried playing video games when tripping. Obviously it'd probably be a bit difficult to play them properly, but is it fun? Or is it just too confusing? I assume different people will have different opinions and it would depend on dosage. 


It's been bugging me since I saw this thread this morning though, and it'll be a small while before I get any more LSD so I can't immediately try this out myself.

Hi, first-time tripper here.  I did acid once but with weak windowpane and I only got sort of a weird high (though smoking a lot of pot 14 hours later gave me an insanely intense "pot-trip", consciousness fragmentation/derealization/dissociation and vivid auditory hallucinations etc).  I also have some experience with DXM.


I now have two hits of WoW blotter, supposed to be very good, sitting in tinfoil.  I plan to dose on Saturday with both.  The guy I bought them from is really smart about LSD and said that one hit would be enough for a light trip and two for a proper one, so I might be taking a dose in the 120-160 microgram range.


I'm not tripping with anyone though.  I'll be the only one tripping.  I do have friends who I will be hanging out with.  My roommate, at least, is going to have some pot (as will I) and he said we can go on a long walk for the come-up and peak.  After that I'd be hanging at someone's house most likely, or in my room listening to music.


Will this be okay?  Maybe I'm overthinking things way too much, I've heard that LSD is not as likely to give you a bad trip as, say, mushrooms.  Also I know my dose might seem high but I really want to have a full experience, not just a weird buzz with mild visuals like I had last time.

If your home alone and tripping then just relaxing and playing some video games is the right thing to do, on my first 5+ gram mushrooms trip I played sonic 2 for hours to keep myself from wigging out, which felt immanent.


I could see myself having fun playing some kind of RPG while i'm on LSD, or something visual or weird. LSD trips are long so might as well do a few things, go for a walk, make love, play video games, make music, see what it is all like through a different set of eyes

**LSD Questions**


So last night I took some decent quality acid, 3 hits, and I must say I was slightly disappointed. The ceiling was swimming but besides that there were no hallucinations. Do I need more? If so, how much more, I have 10 more hits. 


Also, has anyone else noticed that when on acid you can't stop fucking smiling? It is actually impossible for me to not smile on acid, which is enjoyable, but odd.

it hurts my jaw when I took lsd. only 1 hit, had similar effects to you, sounds like you had weak acid. i'd imagine 3 hits of the lsd I have would be far too overwhelming.

you probably have really weak acid... 'round here one hit will do far more than what you described three hits did.

Hm sounds like you had some pretty weak acid

I also had 1 hit and had the same effects... I would recommend taking more then 3 hits next time if it's the same acid


And yes I can't stop smiling either when I'm on acid lol but I like it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**Lol lsd**


Same thing happened to me. I had done many drugs, but no classical psychedelics. Then I was offered acid at college. I ate one. Nothing but mild visuals that were enhanced greatly by weed for around 6 hours. I pondered how people thought acid was soo great. Next time I took two tabs from a different source, thinking I'd get **no more** than 10x the effect from doubling the dose. I was wrong, this was far more potent acid, and I was in for a hell of a ride. I was also happy that the acid I took at college wasn't what I was taking then.


When you get a real dose of acid, you'll know it, for sure. Visual distortion is a secondary effect of the drug. Time distortion is a secondary effect of the drug. I've had 1 minute go by on a clock and it felt like an hour. Yet other times I've had 9 hours go by feeling like 2. You are a primary effect of the drug.

take more acid, man! eat 6 (suck on em well, i can feel a proper acid dose already 30 minutes in) and the remaining four after one hour if you're not happy about how much you are feeling. 


this will give you some sense of control. if you aren't obsessive about losing control like me, drop em all at once. you will trip ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


To relate to this dose-effect relationship, i mailed a friend of mine who lives far away two (weak) hits of 50 ug acid. he shared it with a friend, reporting lots of giggles, video game playings and a ravenous appetite. when he visited me, he dropped five. this was his second ever lsd trip, some selected comments were 'this is an entirely different drug', 'these visuals just don't fucking give up'


we walked through parks, tried to buy cheese, got lost, got assaulted by birds, stared at flowers and talked ceaselessly about fractals and ate soup. good times.

I've never found acid that psychedelic, I think compared to a big dose of mushrooms and moclobemide or oral DMT it's fairly straightforward but it's very euphoric and puts you in a beautiful place emotionally. 


I think Mckenna mentioned that acid isn't in the same ballpark as mushrooms and DMT as far as the visuals go. But each is special in it's own way.

I actually wouldn't say it was that weak, I was immersed in the environment so I didn't really pay attention to the effects. I think I was just really surprised by how much fun it was, like my face was in a perpetual smile, and I've never had that happen before.

Drugs effect everyone differently.


I have friends who have taken acid and they didn't get much more than seeing the walls slightly breathe while everyone else got more visuals than just that, or one friend just got audio hallucinations and not visual ones at all.

Just remember, I believe that if you take them all at once there is a multiplying factor that helps the trip power. But if you take them all night like candy every hour on the hour, you wont trip much harder, just for a longer period of time.

Dont do that. 


I made that mistake. I had a stripper on me and we got pulled over, and instead of risking getting searched i munched it down. 


I came down with serious HPPD after that one. 


I have taken LSD in a huge dose 40+ hits in liquid form and didnt leave with me as bad HPPD as the 10 strip.


Also sometimes the person who laid the sheet, didnt lay it even. Ive had L that was heavy in some spots and very light in others.

Read up about tolerance..


If you did 3 last night then 10 more today will only give the same affect as the 3 yesterday.


wait a week between trips then take 6.

I don't think 10 would even be as powerful as taking 3 the previous day. I've tried taking bigger doses of acid the day after and never felt a thing.

I took acid for the first time the other day and it was the cleanest feeling of being on any drug I have ever felt.

It feels so clean and natural it is truly a beautiful drug and imo the best and only drug worth taking.


I have now decided that im not going to take any other drug as they are a waste of money, time and possibly brain cells.


The effects I had on acid was that everything had a psychedelic rainbow tinge to everything, walls were melting and breathing, peoples faces were melting, vision was blurred and I couldnt stop smiling and I was proper mad hallucinating that my mates bathroom carpet was a pool of sick and thought my mate was going to die when he was just throwing up big time... god it was mad!!!!! BUT AMAZING!!! god I LOVE LSD


shame the intensity of it only lasted 4hours though and after that it seemed pretty shitty but still rediculously clean and I didnt get any comedown what so ever!

If it only lasted 4 hours I would do some serious investigation.  Especially if it wasn't blotter.  If it wasn't blotter, it could be anything... but acid should last at least 6 hours.  Vomitting and intense euphoria aren't commonly associated with acid.  I mean it's definitely euphoric, but it's not 4 hours of complete bliss type euphoria like amphetamines or oxycodone, you know?

You get more euphoria from speed than acid? Not me.

i was taking ketamine aswell though


the trippy effects only lasted 4 hours then the rest was very mild

He mentioned the intensity being 4 hours, yes this sounds like acid, a normal acid peak (if doses taken all at the same time) should be around 4 hours.

Yeah that's an aspect that doesn't get mentioned much.  I think it's because you only notice it on weak doses like the one yours sounds like.  With stronger doses that's overwhelmed by the hallucinations & more powerful effects.  But yeah everything you do just becomes completely fun, it's like turning back the clock & becoming a kid again for 8 hours.

Bad idea.  It's really easy to drop different amounts of acid onto different blotter squares.  So you have no idea if those 10 squares have dramatically more LSD on them than the three you already took.


This is just anecdotal but from my experience it seems that in some people LSD needs to be primed a few times before you get the full effects.  Don't go nuts trying to force it, just take it as you feel led & one of these times the doors will open wide on their own.  It'll happen when it happens, there's no rush.

I took acid for the first time on New Years Eve and I had just 1 drop of acid but it was amazing everything had a rainbow like effect around it, the walls were melting and everything had a cartoon sort of look to it. I also felt pretty good and overall it was a very clean feeling experience as opposed to most other drugs ive tried.


Now I was wondering whether or not I should wait at least a week until I next take some or whether it would be ok to take some tonight which is like 4days since I last took some or is this not giving LSD enough respect.


As I know if you respect LSD it will respect you, but if you dnt give it enough respect it will fcuk you up.


Your thoughts/views and comments would be much appreciated

Generally you want to wait at least 5-7 days do avoid any type of physical tolerance.  However fully integrating a trip usually takes longer than that.  Also familiarity with the headspace is an important psychological component as well.  If you dose two or more times close together it isn't as novel.

It will be my 3rd trip this saturday in the space of a week.


I just love LSD so much I cant stop thinking about the crazy headspace you get, I truly feel peace of mind on it and aslong as I dont try communicating with anyone I feel good about myself.


As I have definatly found talking just seems to pickle me and I end up feeling stupid which then gives me bad thoughts and usually I stop thinking about bad thoughts before it escalates but I could definatly see the bad trip potential if I was to actually try fully communicating with someone.

I hear ya... been there... done that.


Some sage advice: SAVE THE LSD for a future point in time (all the friggin way to ONE FULL WEEK FROM LAST DOSE!!!) and I promise you will be glad you did.


LSD has one of the strongest and fastest tolerances there is.  Second time in a week you still get off ALMOST as good as the first time, maybe 75-85%, enough so you might not even notice the reduction in effect.


Third time in one week expect it to feel like you only did 30-40% of the dose.  Yes it's that much reduced that fast.


I remember wanting so bad to trip again that soon, and so taking fully 3X the original dose, but to little avail... at some point it just felt just some weird stimmyness, and like I was abusing my receptors.


Soooo... save your "trip-receptors" the wear-n-tear, and DEFINITELY preserve for MUCH better enjoyed future use that precious resource that is your Acid Stash

UNDER your tongue.... the membranes there have MANY more capillaries near the surface, which itself is thinner and more permeable, hence will absorb more of what is put there than on top of tongue... between lip and gum is better than on top of tongue, but not as good as under tongue... that's why things like B12 or liquid herbal extracts are taken in "sublingual" (literally "under tongue") form.


Actually I suppose 2mins after its in your mouth and gets wet, whatever it is gets distributed pretty evenly all over the inside of the mouth so in the end I doubt it matters.  Unless it's something solid like a tobacco with a plant cellulose matrix that is gonna hold that active ingredient in place as the saliva SLOWLY leeches it out and into the immediately adjacent tissues.


Then again, perhaps it DOES matter with LSD...such a tiny amount, maybe the location where it first gets wet DOES matter, i.e., if its under the tongue where its more permeable, then 100ug of LSD is likely to be released from the paper within seconds and absorbed right there, faster than if its kinda all over because its more permeable there.


Jesus I overanalyze everything.  Just hold it in your mouth and try not to swallow for 10 minutes.  Then swallow with a gulp of liquid to get what's left into your stomach as fast as possible.  I doubt much is absorbed from the esophagus.

I got some acid the other day that had a really strong acidy taste, reminded me of deodorant or hairspray or something. I'd never had acid taste like that before (always been tasteless). Is this normal? Any idea what might have caused this?

OK cheers mate,. I already have 2 drops (on sweets) which im planning on doing tomorrow.


Considering 1 drop got me blasted both times I previously done 'cid surely 2 drops will fcuk me over?

Or does tolerance literally go sky high?

tolerance can also keep climbing if you take it as often as once a week for a long period of time. such as weekly lol, i've known people who take it that often and had to take fairly large doses by the end of their stretch to get tripping on it.


To much of a good thing! plus there's the worry of being an "acid casualty" when one gets far to accustomed to the mindset and eventually goes a bit loony over it and starts chasing LSD like any other indulgence drug.


Tolerance will probably not be so apparent if you double the dose, but you surely will not have twice the trip as you did previously. Part of the weight of an LSD trip is that what your experiencing is so alien from day to day life and if it gets closer to a daily or expected thing then the body/mind is just gonna get used to it more.

**Is it normal for acid to cause leg cramping?**

i've had this happen on the comeup of an extremely high dose that was taken when i was already on an extremely high dose, but that's the only time.  I think some people experience this occasionally though, even with reasonable doses.

**Is 200ug a strong dose of acid?**


Be gettin some acid soon (avatars) I heard they are 200ug i'm no expert on LSD but would u say that was a strong dose? I tried acid for the first time a couple weeks ago (a different type) and was underwhelmed I were told there were slightly weaker so had two got a good buzz but no really good visuals just tracers and distorted look.


When I get these 200ug tabs i'm thinkin of having one and a half would this be too much?

dose/blotter is always a guesstimation of what others think. blotters are also unevenly spread with the substance, so just because someoe says they are 200ug doesnt mean thats what they hold.


on the other hand i find 200ug is a rather strong dose for me, and while others might disagree, i wouldnt go for 1 1/2 (300ug total) in the first try with any first time unknown blotter.


maybe start with one and see how that goes. id rather be underwhelmed than tripped out. you can always explore more next time

Well unfortunately you can't often tell how good acid is by how many micrograms it is. The reason for this is the purity of the crystals that are used in the solution that was put on the sheet.  while 300mcg of mediocre LSD may produce a good trip, 300mcg of needle point crystals will likely floor you for the peak. Not only this, but dealers, no matter how much they're "trusted" will often fudge the truth, if you're getting LSD with 200mcg of good crystal then congrats, because the majority of what I get is 150-200 ish and I've been in the game for a while, it seems to me (no offense) that you have not, therefore if you have a connect like that then you're pretty set. Most likely though, the blotters you're getting are less than 200mcg or possibly are 200mcg of not quite so pure crystal.

Now, with that being said my advise to you is this: when somebody tries to tell you how many micrograms are on a blotter, don't listen to a damn word they say, it's more than likely that they really have no idea, unless they're the maker, and if you're getting shit from a good producer then very much congrats to you. At any rate, talk to people who have done the acid before and ask them, not how good they were, but how many they needed to take to get the effects that they were looking for, of course also ask them how they like their trips, some people like them mild, I like to be floored. 


As far as blotters being done unevenly... I'm sorry you have this issue but anyone who knows what they're doing is likely not going have this happen with their blotters.

i been in drugs game for a while i am experienced with most drugs but LSD is new to me as its so rare where i'm from. the first acid i got i was told they were not that strong so i was not lied to but as it was my first time i was expecting a bit more especialy from 2.


i dont know what being floored on acid is like but i'm certainly not scared to be it as i really like to trip out. on the last acid i had i kept thinking to myself this is cool but not amazing i was wanting to see something unbelivable but just got mild trips.


i'm not niave to belive everything someone tells me but i'm taking the risk anyway if it turns out its shit then i wont buy it again simple as that but i trust this guy enough to know it wont be fake.


thanks for your reply its been very helpfull i'll ask a few friends in the week who might be trying it to see what its like.

Asking people what it's like is a great idea.  200 ug per blotter is quite high compared to the average these days.  It's certainly possible, especially if you know the person dropping it on the blotter, but it isn't likely.  I recent study someone posted here said the average blotter has 60-80 ug on it.

Dealers will BS and say all sorts of stuff but they really don't know.


Talk to other people who have taken it and find out how strong it is/was.  


Keep in mind that drugs effect everyone differently.  I've taken lsd that made me trip lightly/moderately but other people took it and had to take 2 of the same type of blotter to get what I had from one blotter or half of a blotter.

breakthrough dose is 400, IME - but if your salesman is selling them with a pitch that they're 200, they're prob'ly = to about 75-100 LSD 25, so I'd drop 4 if you want to make sure you leave this plane of existence and 2 if you still want to be able to deal(somewhat) with sober people and still have your face melt... IMhO.

The dealers don't have any idea of what the microgram dosage of your blotter is, they don't have any way to measure it either.  Unless you're getting your blotter from the guy that made it, you don't really have any way of knowing.  I go with the assumption that any one tab I'm getting is going to contain somewhere between 75 and 100ug.  So, I'll take two and that brings it up to 150-200ug.  Two tabs of good acid is exactly where I wanna be while tripping.


So take one of those tabs, if its stronger than what you're used to, then maybe your dealer wasn't bullshitting you after all.

the best tabs i've ever had in my LIFE might have been 100 mics each, paper just doesn't hold much more in those itty bitty squares. Of course dealers will try to say that the new stronger batch is some kind of certain and large dose but even if they saturated the LSD onto the paper themselves how would they weight it out to be 200 mics perfectly. Just ask a lot of questions to yourself on base logic and you'll discover that it's probably just a fellow trying to sell a decent batch up. 


they might be stronger than average though...

the avatars are the same potency as dancing bears, which is 90-120ugs. I'd say you'd be safe with starting with 2-3.

I think he means to actually "trip", and I somewhat agree with him. I find that anything below 200ugs is recreational.

Have you tried these? I'm hearing reports these are 240ug - leading me to believe OP could be correct, meant to be trying some soon. 


200ug is a strong dose for a first timer, 180ug has me pretty with insanely wonderful visuals and great introspective thoughts. But if you can keep a grip on yourself or have some psychedelic experience behind you you'll be fine.

Nevermind, I heard from someone else that they're that potency. So I think 2-3 would be a good "strong" first trip. If you're scared take 2, if you have plenty of experience with other pychs take three.

400ug for a first time strong trip? I think that's a little too steep with only one previous trip under your belt personally.

**LSD and Stomach Pains during and after trip**


Seems like every time I trip I get a stomach pain in the lower abdominal area anywhere from 1/4-3/4 of the way through the trip and lasts even after the comedown. I tripped with friends yesterday and all three of us experienced it. It's not nausea, it's more like a cramp. We all tried alleviating it by eating food but it still persisted, even after the comedown.


Does anyone else get stomach pain on acid and know of an OTC way to alleviate it?

**The best way to approach an LSD trip (or other psychedelics)**


I've always been a bit in the middle about this. The first time I tripped I hoped to gain some insight into myself, or maybe learn how to cope with personal issues at the time. So far it's only really been recreational. I've mearly enjoyed the experience, the visuals, the discussions had. Because of this I've started entering a trip simply for entertainment purposes.


I've always wondered how different people like to go into a trip. What their chosen mindset is before you enter the psychedelic realm. Do you go in hoping to gain something that you can take away with you forever? Or do you prefer you use them purely recreationally?


What is the best way, in your opinion? Do you believe there really *is* something to learn by using psychedelics? Whether about yourself, or something external. Or is there no point in taking it too seriously and just use them for their enjoyable visuals etc.

Personally I think it's treading on thin ice, for your first few trips I recommend lower doses - even if you do feel underwhelmed, LSD has many effects that I don't think many become aware of without some experience in various doses, jumping into the deep end could really make it an uncomfortable experience - an even more uncomfortable experience than if they were on a lower dose. I always suggest a person builds it up. 80ug is my recommended dose for someone's first acid trip, enough to see what it carries but not a strong headspace so they still feel in control. Higher doses become very lucid and I think this could become too intense for those who haven't experienced it before.

When I first took acid, I was going to take one tab, the white-on-white stuff that's always around here, anyway, I was going to take one, and then everybody I talked to said "take two, I took one and really wished I had taken two my first time".


So I took two and it was perfect.  If those tabs are 90-120ug, you should take two.  Not three, unless you're experienced with LSD to the point where you're comfortable with what it does and what it does when you take a lot.  I personally feel that 150-200ug is the place to be.

My intention is to get insight that I can then carry into my life.  There is not a right or wrong way to use psychedelics, but you will have a different outcome depending on what you are hoping to achieve.  


I think using them for insight is more productive, but that's me.  If you are using them recreationally then I would say it's more helpful to accept it as that rather than tell yourself that you are or should be using them for other purposes.

I've had a similar "pain" a few times. I wouldn't  call it a pain really, more like i need to eat something because my stomach feels empty. 

I tried eating a few hours before, or maybe something light during the trip but that didn't help. It doesn't really bother me though as its very very mild.


You can try a mentos sweet. It usually solves most of my problems during a trip ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**What is a strong trip like? (LSD)**


Last weekend I had by far the strongest dose of acid I have ever had, and I was fairly surprised by how intense it got, but it wasn't quite mind-blowing to the extent that some people say acid is.


I guess my question is does acid ever take you to a place where you literally cannot recognize where you are, does that require a massive dose? Are my expectations too high.?


My visuals where pretty intense and the body high was ridiculously stimulating but mentally I didn't feel that changed, which I have on lower doses. 


I feel like this is a pretty stupid question but I don't want to be unsatisfied again on something that was pretty overwhelming, all things considered.

to achieve full ego death on LSD i would say you would need at least 3-4 tabs. im not sure though, personally ive never done more than two tabs, which while being extremely intense, didnt give me ego death.

Yes, but you also have to really 'let go' of everything and totally immerse yourself within the experience; that's when things become very interesting.. when you begin to taste music, hear colors and have some pretty amazing synesthesia happening.. you know your entering into a state of mind that is beyond the usual.


I've had some real fun with time manipulation, music in slow motion while tripping is quite the experience, feels like liquid bliss pouring into my soul ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I agree with malakaix, You can let yourself go and experience amazing things, but at the same time click out of it to the normal trip whenever. I have always known where I was during acid and mushroom trips. You just experiment within your own mind, letting it alter the world around you. As you should know If you tried it. Try some DMT, that takes you to another world if you break through.

I have had the 'full' feeling. It seems common enough as I believe the expression 'A belly full of acid' arose from. Sometimes it weighs me down and I feel the need to lie down. Or when I walk I walk real slow. But it has never annoyed me, just a mild feeling as ferax stated.

I sometimes get a gassy, bloated feeling that is easily relieved by some ginger, meclizine, or farting.

How strange i got this exact same feeling last wekend when i done liquid acid, the real cramping pains in your stomach, i know what u mean


i heard drinking anis tea and ginger root before your trip helps and aparnelty alot of factors can make a trip different, i.e food intake, how much sleep you have had ect 


this is what i heard from dmt nexus :D

i'm defo not taking anymore than 2 in one go but i'm hearing these are strong then some others saying not so strong but it seems more people are saying these are some strong tabs. i might take one and a half see how it goes then take the remaining half about 4 or 5 hours into the trip.


a stick of some good sensi is bound to help with the intensity ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

generally blotter these days is 100µg or less.  Much more of a substance can fit on blotter, as it can be used to dose things that require higher doses like DOx, 25x-nBOMe, etc.  Most people would probably find a 200µg dose pretty strong, and generally 250µg+ is where things start to get really weird.

I was under the impression for years that I was taking LARGE doses when i took my tabs previously assuming that they must be 100 or so each, or maybe just optimistically hoping. I've come to terms and realized most of my previous doses were only 150 micrograms combined from my 3-4 tab adventures.


LSD is much more powerful than I had ever known, having taken 12 of these standard hits on day in the summer from the pacifying mindset that I had "festival invincibility".


I gotta tell you that 400+ microgram dose was fields different than my other trips, I felt entirely saturated with LSD, literally swimming in a veil of constantly shifting organic visualization, the only difference from being in one place or the other was the amount of dizzyness that I endured while moving to it... it was like my visuals would stay in one place, meshing and ululating and my body would walk but that walking was like throwing pebbles into a pond, disturbing the notions of the visualizations and since they were so complex anyways great dizzyness would ensue from disturbing it.


I should have stayed grounded that whole trip... but even then I had figured what proper dosing was like... not until that day/night/day... not to mention dosing that much more left me with a trippy afterglow for the whole next day after i tripped, the trip lasting 14+ hours (not DOX, just massive dose of LSD)

**Taking LSD while drunk?**


I have consumed pscilocybin cubensis mushrooms twice but never done acid. I have been wanting to try acid lately but have been hesitant because I am scared that I will freakout. Even though I enjoyed my shroom trips I did freakout for a portion of the trip. I am scared that I will freakout big time on acid but I still want to do it. Last night I was drunk, I had like two beers and maybe two shots of vodka. So I wasnt like plastered drunk but I was too drunk to drive and I felt so eager to do acid. Like if someone would have given me a hit of acid I would have done it in a heart beat. Is it ok to take acid while drunk? has anyone done it? What would be different?

the only time i ever take lsd or mdma is when i a drunk, because I know better when I am sober. LSD while partying and getting drunk is different than taking LSD with just weed and specifically doing the trip thing. Drunk lsd will obviously be much blurrier. You will laugh much and not really know what is going on. if you are not a big drinker, you might forget about beer after a few hours into the trip. 


you can still freak out though. less likely i imagine. and you will feel worse than shit the next day.

I find drinking on acid leads to far more confusion. But it also makes me laugh a lot more too, I enjoy drinking on the comedown though.

Even though I've never tried this combo, I too think it would be a waste of good acid. I like to be fully conscious during my psychedelic trips, and tripping whilst drunk seems unproductive at best.


I wish I could get a hold of some 'cid. I need a lot normally, and since I take mirtazapine, I would need a ton just to get off. Using it conjunction with ackahol would be doubly wasteful for me.


Hey, if some of you could put out some good vibes for me, make a wish that I could obtain a good trip. It's so dry around here ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Alcohol's sole function is to inhibit neural activity.


I would assume that most valuable psychedelic effects are caused by neural excitation...

I've done this many times. I don't think tripping whilst drunk is a "waste" just a different context really. Its more of a hedonistic experience then profound, but I have found that LSD whilst drunk is still intense and thought provoking. The main concern though is: if you have lowered inhibitins due to alchohol and feel kinda blase about dropping acid, you may really regret it in a few hours when the booze is wearing off. Also- a hangover beginning during a peak is pretty damn shit. Nothing wrong with having a few drinks to take the edge of the experince, but you need to aware that acid lasts a whole lot longer then alcohol. 


Personally, as a virtual non drinker, this issue doesn't arise very much. However, if I was to take a psychedelic whilsts drinking, it would be 2C-D or 2C-I, both of which have entertained an intoxiated me many times before. In fact, if I take 2C-D by itself, I often end up having a few beers or some whiskey....

LSD's complex effects are due to it inhibiting and exciting different receptors.

If you can handle shrooms, than it is very unlikely that you wouldn't be able to handle acid. Most people consider LSD to be a lot less confusing and mind-fucky than psilocybin. However, the choice is up to you. 


Speaking of drinking and dropping acid, one of my friends once told me that his aunt used to take acid and get wasted and she'd usually end up screamin crazy shit like "WHO AM I?" because the acid would take away her ego but the alcohol would amplify it which would be all mix-matchy and shit

Taking LSD while drunk sobers me up, seems to completely override the alcohol. I was a maid of honor at a wedding and got blasted before the ceremony. Took a tab so I could do the walk down the aisle. Worked perfectly.


I eventually developed an addiction to alcohol, so I don't drink anymore, but I could drink and drink and drink while on LSD, and it wouldn't touch me.

THe first time I ever did acid I was really drunk and coked out.  To put it simply, it did not end well.  I drank 2 4 lokos, 5-6 keg beers and railed a couple lines and my friend offered me some acid.  I gladly placed it on my tongue without even thinking about it.  I took 1.5 tabs and I was trippin really good, I even drank 3-4 beers on the come up.  I think the alcohol mellowed the trip out a bit, but it was also pretty intense because it was my first time tripping on anything.  I laughed a lot and I don't really remember much of the first half of the trip.  I think crashing from the coke and losing the effects of the alcohol really affected my trip.  I started freaking out and had a major panic attack and it turned into one of the worst nights of my life.  


I didn't really know what I was getting myself into at the time, you might be good if you don't drink much and because you've obviously already planned this out; it won't be a drunken decision.  I was also coming off of 4 days of rolling in a row and also a lot of coke use so that's probably what made my trip go bad too.  


Oh and to pr0digy ^^, I love getting hammered after an acid trip.  My best trip was my last one and I drank half a 5th at the tail end of my trip, it was great.

I'm pretty sure a COUPLE of beers will not dampen a trip at all, if it's a good dose.

heyyyy, glad some one caught on to that reference, I LOVE CBL.  And forests.  And acid.


A couple beers will definitely NOT dampen a trip, especially if it's your first time.  Although it might make taking a perfect dose harder.  You don't want to take too little (+ alcohol) and have a disappointing trip, but don't take too much and possibly be overwhelmed and have a bad trip.  I guess that's what alcohol/xanax is for though.

How do you take your blotter? I mean do you swallow it right away or do you leave it on your tongue for a while or do you put it under your tongue or whatever?

I always put in on my tongue for a minute or so and them I swallow it.

i just keep it under my tongue until it turns to mush and then swallow that. 


and regarding the previous discussion on alcohol and lucy, i find that dosing after a beer or two sobers me up, and drinking on the comedown feels a bit dirty, like misusing the trip. i much prefer eating fruit.

**Candyflip**


So there is a posibility I might get some decent acid (said to be around 250micro) and some ecstasy pills (also said to be quite decent) tomorrow at a psytrance party. I was thinking about candyflipping but don't know the exact combination.

I was planning to take LSD then chill & dance for abot 4 hours after the trip starts and then eat one pill and maybe more on the comedown. Maybe I'll drink a beer or two and smoke some joints if I'll feel like it. 

How does that sound?

**Whited Out On Cid**


I am from Philly and I recently took a quarter of a strip (2.5 tabs) of cid which is actually less than I usually take but it was "Double Dipped" which is a term I always take loosely.  

So like an hour in I started to trip my nuts off seeing some crazy fractal patterns at a pizza place and about 3 hours in I whited out and just sat back in my buddies dorm bed and went into the deepest trip I went in ever.  

Has anyone here ever have the same or similar experience with tabs?

It sounds like you were just tripping very hard.  Or by "whited out" did you mean that you passed out like some people use that term? Or do you mean that you were just overstimulated by visuals and they all just became a very bright neonish white and you just got very very introverted and didn't talk to anyone and just sat there tripping?

^hmmm so everything had like a whiteish aura around it? auras are a pretty common visual effect across the board on psychedelics, especially as dose increases, so it would make since. a few times on 6+ grams of mushroom my entire visual field was replaced with whiteness, which is what I thought you were talking about at first, but this effect really was just a "flash" that probably didnt last longer then 30 seconds and was not really a major part of the trip. But i deffinitely see auras a lot

Can I take a whiteout to mean dissociation + unity experience, where that one thing is felt to be completely "white", present, connected, on instead of off, everything as opposed to the blackness of the void? A very strongly expanded consciousness up to the point of the mystical? If I take LSD and meditate that is pretty much where I'm headed.

Some people call it a ++++ although that term is used very loosely, much more so than it was originally intended but the mystical is by definition not to be defined so it's pretty understandable. I wouldn't call something that can be conjured with a good dose of acid and meditation a life-changing experience every time, it's not one of a kind if you expect it. Though the expectation doesn't make it less intense! :D


By the way my feelings about that state I just described, the unity, is not well explained in 'external' terms. I think the division of internal/external experience is fundamentally flawed as is object/subject division (even if it is very often practical and functional).

The world we experience is the model of it we hold in our mind, which is a manifestation of the interconnections of all kinds of seperate conceptualizations in a certain structure, that structure is essentially your paradigm. I believe that the effect of LSD or other methods that cause altered states of consciousness remove this differentiation, the normal patterns that make up your paradigm... and by removing those patterns and concept differentiation let you transcend it and let you experience the activity in your brain more directly. I would describe that activity as seeing or even being this energy flow, golden electricity that moves in fluid cascades and patterns in every direction, immeasurable by lack of frame of reference. It makes sense to me like that.


I admit though that I might not know nearly enough about neurology and consciousness and a ton of other things that would be needed to suggest that the above is my 'understanding'. Anyway I hardly care in the end because those experiences just are what they are whatever that may be.

This philosopher said in an interview in the paper that the best realization he ever had was that 'what you are' is a mystery and you cannot find the answer. Mystery means that what cannot be known or understood. I really like that. On one hand I like how far scientific explanations can go and how far metaphysics and spirituality can go, but on the other hand beyond a certain event horizon we probably shouldn't stress to much if all of that collapses. Perhaps that means there is a singularity at the core of everything, or one might call it Brahman. It undermines itself because that is still like saying that in that core, we don't know. It just is.

I've thrown up on acid twice before, due to the taste of some of the more inky blotters. It's shit as your body just feels like it's going into rejection mode and throws up all it can, but afterwards it's all good.

this has happened to me in some of my strongest trips and i know why it happens.. it happens when my eyes are opened and my vision is slowed down, like really extreme chasers.  it will take a few seconds for my vision to catch up with reality so images get piled up on top of each other..  after it falls behind for a minute or two all the light from the images i see is still being processed in my brain and has totally overlapped leaving nothing but a whiteout.  


when this happens you definitely gotta close your eyes.. the light will fade out and you will be totally immersed in the closed eye visual experience!

NOTE: By "whiting out" I mean that literally... everything got brighter and brighter and brighter as if my pupils had expanded to infinite dimensions... anyway here is the story.. it left a "Hole In My Mind" (kinda like Commander Sheridan in Babylon 5, haha) that I still remember as if it was yesterday:


Once about 15 years ago, me and 2 other friends did 2 hits of what turned out to be some super duper STRONG blotter LSD. Started listening to tunes (well and fooling around... all of us gay) and "whatnot" and all was bliss. But at some point, I recall "whiting out", and my memory is then a TOTAL black hole for about like 4 hours.


After being catatonic for a spell, I totally ruined their trip and fun by them not knowing what the hell happened to me, and I or my body "came to", was walking around the house naked, grabbing my crotch, acting extremely creepily lewd and rude and gross. etc., apparently totally unable to understand or speak English, Terry finally forced me to eat a bunch of Niacin which really did snap me out of it after it hit my stomach.  I never did remember even one moment of these hours between the white out and the forced niacin in the kitchen.


The blacking out and reverting to some still "awake" but totally unrecorded "reptilian" robotic behavior circuitry sounds very very similar to a few other accounts I have read, some from shrooms, some from 4-aco-dmt.  It was totally like my human mind was removed from my body and my brain stem alone was in some nasty, primitive mode of control.  It seems like this bizarre dysfunctional brain "mode" has been reported in some form or another here and there.


During this entire time I had ONE very deep and very frightening psychedelic experience, which consisted of ONE image that apparently took up the entire 4 hour-blackout, or maybe it took the entire 4 hours to "reach" it... and it was VERY VERY scary... hold onto your hats people... NEVER told this to anyone online... during this "White-Blackout", here is where "I" was:


It was some indeterminable time in the future.... only 3 minds still existed... mine (wondering if I had died in perhaps a nuclear explosion or something), and what I can ONLY describe as some great powerful Native American "Grandmother Earth Goddess" consciousness, perhaps "Gaia"... we were both in orbit in space... there was the Sun off in the distance, looking normal, who was the 3rd consciousness (but like a giant silent eye, observing from from some very lofty deep billion-year old great-great-great-great-grandfather perspective, totally without any thought or emotion), in the distance, stars... and below us was The Earth, but it was not the lovely shimmering blue/white/brown/green living water paradise we know. INSTEAD IT WAS AN EMPTY SMOLDERING BLACK CINDER... "Gaia" or "Grandmother Earth Goddess" was VERY VERY VERY ANGRY with ME, as a representative of the entire Human race who had somehow caused this horrible catastrophe to happen to her beautiful precious pearl she had take so long and such care to grow. The mood was one of baleful, eternal mourning and sadness. She was as angry as it is possible to be. I was as sad as it is possible to be.. and just crying, crying for all of eternity, trying to say to Her "I'm so sorry.... I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry...." trying in vain to apologize on behalf of all humanity, of which my spirit was apparently the last representative.


I would have to call this under any definition a "Vision" like something of which Black Elk might have spoken, more than a hallucination... it was like "She" had deliberately stolen my mind, seeing it was made vulnerable by the LSD, and whisked me to some distant possible future to confront me about the disaster she showed me.


Honestly, I don't have any other way of understanding what happened to me that night.  it was VERY VERY far out of the ordinary, totally unlike the 1000 or so other trips I have had, some also really strong, but NOTHING like that.


I didn't remember this until a couple days later... it was buried under alot of embarrassment about my brainstem's shameful lizard behavior... then suddenly all at once the image/feelings of that terrifying, soul-crushing "Vision" came back to me like a recovered memory all at once, and I was utterly devastated for a LONG time till I could tell anyone else, before I could even speak... upon remembering it, I just curled up in a ball for a while and just bawled my eyes out.


So,what you do you all think of that? Anyone ever have anything like this, either the whiteout/blackout/missing-time effect, or the walking/talking/behaving with ZERO memory of it, or the "Earth-Cinder-Angry-Sad-Earth-Mother-Goddess-Spirit" vision happen to them?


What the hell actually happened to me so many years ago?

Well I will admit, the comeup and the first strong part of the trip with the fooling around were awesome... until "IT" happened of course (though there were plenty of other quite "successful" sex parties on acid not to mention other drugs over the years... YOWZA!  Yes you need to find yourself some hot gay pals who are also into trippig or rolling and whatnot... paradise awaits)


Boyfriend was totally pissed at me for like weeks, convinced I engineered it all deliberately for some twisted ego-control reason, much to my total dismay.  And the 3rd guy, a very longtime pal, was so freaked we never spoke to or saw him again after that.  ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

The first time I dosed was 2 hits of bicycle day lsd.

Boy was I in for it.

If by white out you mean flashes of white light over taking my vision followed by intense fractals and waves then yes Ive experienced such.


Hooray for my first post! long time lurker (years) dont know why, but i just decided to get involved seeing as psychedelics are becoming increasingly interesting to me.

psychedelics are funny in that you can take huge doses for years, and then one day all of a sudden you decide you're going to do a "low" dose of something and it totally kicks your ass harder than you even thought possible.


I had a buddy who went to a festival last year with his girlfriend, and she did two hits of LSD, and he did 6 hits of the same LSD at the same time and they were doing the same things, and she ended up totally flipping out so bad she had to go to the "tripping out to hard" area, where she was put into restraints.


These kind of things don't happen toooo often, but they do happen sometimes, and anyone who's going to be tripping out as much as some of us in PD so, then you should really consider this peice of information EVERY TIME you decide you're going to put psychedlics drugs in your body.


Anybody remember the story from PiHKAL where Anne did a 40 mgs test run of DESOXY and then that seemed to spark a weeklong spiritual crisis ?????

Why dont I hallucinate when I take 4 drops of good stuff (1drop made my mate trip hard)


Ive done lsd 5 times in the last 2 months and 4 drops makes me feel pretty normal if not just more extreme in however im feeling at the time mainly extreme hunger.


I dont see swirly walls, melting walls, rainbow effect colours or things morph anymore whats going on? have I just got used to the LSD mind set as I dont have 1 bit of paranoia on it either.

A few weeks ago i took half an 8th of pretty strong shrooms. I felt almost nothing for 2.5 - 3 hours then after eating some pizza i went from slightly above baseline to peaking instantly. It was strange as hell, i had no come up whatsoever.


The point is that psychedelics can do weird things.

Some people have a naturally high threshold for drugs like LSD. If the exact same dose gets other people wasted I cannot think of other reasons than that and tolerance which can go up rather fast if you did it 5x in two months especially if you didnt wait long enough after your last trip.


Yeah I definitely think you get used to tripping. I havent done acid in a while now and I feel like it would get very intense if I did it now, like I unlearned it.

Getting used to the effects is probably partially or completely identical to (long term) tolerance.


About the candyflip, yes it sounds okay but keep your alcohol intake very limited. And if you are not used to smoking a lot of weed remember that it can confuse the trip, make it foggy and vague.

It's IMO good to start with LSD and first get to a stable plateau and that is what the poll says as well - which you can find  by checking the candyflip subthread on the first page of this thread.

I had a similar experience on 4-aco-dmt + 2ci + maybe a few other things after a 10-day psychedelic bender. A friend I was with had the same thing happen to him on the same combo. Essentially the whole world (we were in a park during the day) got whiter and whiter until I could barely see through the whiteness. Not so much a fog as if someone had completely turned up the brightness knob on my eyes. I entered a dream state where I couldn't recognize people, completely dissociated from gestalt (I could recognize a leg but not the person it was attached to -- it was as if each part of the person was a distinct unit and there was no whole). I perceived myself as engaged in conversation with a leg, although the leg was doing all the talking.


In retrospect, I think I was on the very edge of a digital mushroom blackout, and my physical/mental exhaustion at the time contributed. It wasn't a particularly negative feeling at all, or very frightening (the absence of meaning left my emotions behind). Pretty sure I seemed to others like I was catatonic for a hour or two although I actually remember every minute of it.


Anyway, "whiting out" is the perfect way to describe that trip. Recently I read some Oliver Sacks aphasia/nosia case histories that sound an awful lot like what I experienced. I wonder if I somehow shorted out my visual processing part of the brain. Then again, maybe I just passed out with my eyes open.

why does this web page say lsd has a more active R isomer?

Because LSD has four possible stereoisomers, but only the  (+)-LSD (or: d-LSD, 5R,8R) isomer is active in ~100µg dosage. This is the stereoisomer which is usually consumed.

that still does not explain why they say the (r) isomer is more active.

I believe there was is some speculation that certain compounds can be trapped in your gallbladder, and released when you eat food.  Especially fatty food.  This seems to happen fairly frequently with ayahuasca in particular.

I've had strange things happen with shrooms.....I've had them not take effect till 5 or 6 hours after I've taken them.  And there was no special reason why this should have happened, like taked on an extremely full stomach.  It seems like sometimes the shrooms just want to sneak up on you and peak while you are in the parking lots leaving the Phish concert!!!

Hello,


About a year ago I purchased some tabs of LSD. I started reading about it over here and have been sitting on them ever since. I know that they will have been somewhat degraded. I stored them wrapped tight in tin foil, in a baggy, in a dark place. I got the tabs tested (Netherlands) and the result was somewhere between 50 and 60ug, so the dose is quite low. I have 4 tabs in total for the 2 of us.


Me and my girlfriend now want to take them on Saturday. It will be our first time doing an actual psy-drug. We both have done MDMA quite a few times before, but I know we are now in for something totally different. I've read the whole thread again in the past 2 days but still have a few questions. I hope some of you can help me somewhat with some answers.


Next Saturday it will be extremely nice weather over here. To my girlfriend it seems to be somewhat of a disappointment to stay inside. I too think it would be great to experience this outdoors. The thing is that the only way to experience this not so far from home is doing it in a park nearby. We could then lay down in the grass and enjoy the experience on a sunny day.


My question is: do you think this is a wise thing to do? I think about starting with 1 tab and see how it goes. We would then have a low dose and can see how it goes. If it goes well we can always up the dose a bit more later on. Of course there will be other people in the park. I don't know how that works out, but I think some of you might have a bit of an answer. If it seems to be a bit too much after all we can always go inside our home and continue over there. I do want to have a great experience and I don't want to bluntly underestimate the drug.


I think I'm looking for some insights from other people, any help is very much appreciated ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). Thanks!

^ X-termi ^ 


You have enough tabs for 2 low to medium dose trips, being that they havent degraded too much, if they have or not I really don't know. It's worth a shot!


In my experience I do not like low doses of LSD, the feeling of being 'half there' annoyed me when I did try a low dose, which was my first time taking LSD..2 hits beleived to be 50 ug each.... I took 4 hits of the same blotter a few weeks later and it was amaaazzzingg, so that would be my recommendation for you, and have your gf be a sitter maybe sense this will be your first time with a psychedelic. 


As for the park, you might not want to be in public but if you feel comfortable and in control of yourself then go for it. Nothing like a nice walk while trippin...it's my favorite thing to do honestly... definitly a good idea if you start havin a bad trip, can bring you right out of it.


Hope this helps you in someway..post back on how it goes

Thanks for the advice. 


It being somewhat of a low dose works two ways I think: negative when it comes to maybe having the feeling of being half way there. Positive when it comes to it being the first time and in that setting. From what I've read, 100ug might be a good dose for a first time. The fact that they have been tested gives me a bit more of a reassurance when it comes to the dose.


This is something I really want to experience for the first time actually with my girlfriend. Her being a sitter might sound like a good idea, but it would also be somewhat of a disappointment.


Don't get me wrong: I'm not trying to throw everything you said out of the window, I'm just looking for some opinions from other people, I'll take them all into account when deciding whether to go on with this or not.


If someone else cares to comment: please do. Help a fellow Bluelighter out ;-). I really appreciate your views. Thanks.

Taking a low dose for a first experience is never a bad idea, who knows maybe that will be exactly where you wanna be, everyone is different. Plus its not like you will never be able to try it again at a later time, most likely.

Very agreed. Swim likes to take massive doses, the more the better if there is no authority figures around (family, driving, etc). But, everyone is very different and you sound a little apprehensive. Best to stay low until you are more comfortable. But who knows, maybe you would love the experience. It's always best to avoid unnecessary anxiety or panic attacks. Have fun. BTW don't know if you mentioned it, but sex is great on LSD if possible. Sweaty, but fantastic. Have fun!! Swim is very happy to hear about your trip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Does anyone know why everyone seems to try shrooms first? Are they supposed to be safer? Or easier to handle? Maybe it's a problem of avaliablility. But, swim speaks from experience that for him shrooms are a total mind fuck and require a lot of mental preperation etc. Although the duration is much shorter for shrooms, LSD always gives swim mass amounts of euphoria and it is much easier to handle when something goes wrong. Opinions?

I was always told shrooms were less intense and easier to handle, and beleived it until very recently. Every1 made it seem like LSD was so crazy it made me not want to try it, and I'm glad I made the decision to try it cuz now I really don't even wanna look at those mushrooms. It was also a BIG problem of availabilty until recently as well, which is why I have a good amount of experience with shrooms before my first acid trip. So I guess if it woulda came around a few years back when I first got into it with psyches, I woulda tried it. I feel the same way you do LSD Lover, when it comes to the shrooms vs LSD comparison. Funny because the whole time I was just eatin shrooms I was thinkin the total opposite about acid, so glad I balld up n took some.

Is LSD bad for the heart? I took 5 hits at a rave yesterday and had an exhilerating experience, leaping and dancing around like a lunatic. Luckily I work out every day and could handle the intensity of it with great pleasure because my body felt jacked up to the extreme. I wasn't really expecting it because I had only done at most 2 hits before and it didn't have that insane stimulating effect. I thought it was supposed to be mostly a mental thing... my mind was blown to smitherines as well. 

Are there any known cases of people dying on acid from like a heart attack or something? I'm just wondering, say I chose to take 10 hits one day (not that 5 wasn't enough ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Sorry to report back a bit late. We postponed the trip. My gf didn't want to do it at that time for several reasons. No need to rush things when somebody is not feeling ok with it, so we picked coming Sunday as the new date. But we'll see if we actually do it then. I will post back after we did it ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**LSD Blotter Questions**


So might be obtaining some LSD for the first time ever on blotter paper and have a few questions that I can't seem to find the answer to.


I know how it is stored etc but how do I handle this shit? Is it alright to handle just like a normal piece of paper or should I be very delicate and try not to touch the actual face of the surface? I'm scared of it soaking into my skin and making me trip or something LOL.


Also, put in a sealey bag how long will it take before the LSD starts get weaker, is this a very fast process?


Sorry if this has been answered before but Google brought me nothing. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I wrapped mine in some aluminum-foil, then placed it in what seemed to be an air tight container..Stored it like that for a month or two and it seemed to be just as potent as a few months earlier.

It's a delicate molecule, as I'm sure you're aware. Most people tend to handle the hits gingerly by the edges though usually not from fear of absorption. Generally, in my circle of friends anyways, the care is taken to avoid damage from the oils on your fingertips.


Personally I have no idea if the natural oils on your hands can actually harm your precious LSD but I *do* know that light, heat, moisture, and oxygen degrade the product....why risk it, eh?

Thanks for both your replies. Is it also fine to pop sheets in a sealey bag to carry around for say maybe a day or two in pocket?

also, i'm not positive about plastic, but i remember hearing aluminum is actually bad in the long run...i've had some in foil before (without noticeable degradation), but i hear its overall a no no.


the best medium to touch it to in my opinion is 'acid-free' paper...lol, that's what its called, i swear. i always used to chuckle about that in high school. it's art paper, if you have any sketch books, it'll probably say 'acid free' if you read the fine print.

Hey guys, so I have a few questions about acid!

I've only done it twice... the first time it was (unknowingly) Electric Bob Marley... haha... the second just white blotter. One hit. I'm a scrawny girl so I don't think I need much..

So I have a my stories to tell & a few questions..


The first time, we took it about 4pm,

A friend of mine & I,

And we were with her boyfriend and a bunch of people I had literally just met.

At the time, I didn't really know all the side effects/visuals of acid... 

But it started out great, sun went down, we sat in the dark while getting lightshows, listening to music... amazing. 

Got up, and I felt a little drunk-dizzy,

And we decided to go to Walmart for a bit...

I was starting to trip really hard, and the paranoia was CRAZYYY... but funny!

But I was all good, it was a big blur of everyone telling us to shush while we giggled like craazy...

Then around 8:30pm, the trip went sour... we went to a nature trail with glowsticks from walmart, and suddenly, my heart rate skyrocketed and everything around me was 2-D...the ground beneath me stretched for MILES behind me, and in front of me, the road had stretched and warped above my head.. I panicked more & more & thought I was going to pass out, when my heart rate started to go back down, and everything just snapped back into place... I was staring at a parking lot full of cars and suddenly I was ok.. 

So everyone caught up and we started walking towards the car, aaaaand just as everything is normal & happy again, 

My heart rate starts to skyrocket, and I'm like, "Oh no, its happening again."

And the world around me just stretched and warped until my vision was "full" and I couldn't take it, I felt like I was being pulled out of my body or being squished in really tight.

Then I scream out to them, and as I start to say something, it snaps back again...


It does this over and over all night, making the remainder of my trip just awful..


The second time was recently at EDC ,

We took some in line around 4pm again..

I had the BEST day of my life, so beautiful, loved everything, just so much happiness,

And as it got dark, the rain began to pour. But the music still played, everyone danced, was happy, etc..

Then they shut it all down due to rain, and we huddled in the port a potties, freezing cold... I had just taken what a friend told me was Molly... didn't feel it yet of course.

Around 9pm we ended up running, freezing, through the pouring rain to the entrance to get out. I just wanted to get to my car.. 

I was ok, knew where I was, we were out of the stadium, then suddenly,

All the sounds around me got real quiet, and everything began to stretch...

I was like, "I'm STILL TRIPPING?! Have I still been trippin this whole time??"

but instead of getting scared, I just started running, watching my friends in front of me, using the tiny bits of info about where we parked that I could remember... we finally had an epiphany and remembered where the car was, and when I saw it, I was so happy! 

But as I started to walk toward it, the ups and downs came back, heart rate shooting up, everything stretching and warping... and I thought to myself... I CAN NOT do this for 4 more hours... I will have a heart attack...

So I sat in my car and stared at the dash while my heartbeat just got stronger and stronger, and the stretching more vivid... it helped a bit...


Then suddenly the molly started to kick in... when my heart rate would shoot up, instead of these insane visuals, I would just get this amazing cool sensation everywhere, and I was so insanely happy that I wasn't seeing craziness.. I didn't even want to move... whatever the "molly" they gave me actually was... it was a lifesaver!


Anyway, so you don't really have to read all that I wrote to answer these probably, just some insight into my difficult/bad endings to my trips...


My questions:


1. Is it normal for my heart rate to randomly shoot up and me to suddenly see everything around me stretching and warping and completely suffocating me? Just for no reason? (at this point I can't even get it to stop once it starts)


2. Why would this happen? Both times?


3. Will I always trip like this? (Have bad endings/last few hours?)


4. Sometimes, things become 2 dimensional, is that normal as well?


None of my friends say they've experienced these things, or EVER had negative trips, so that's why I'm asking, why am I different from them all?

Sorry for the long post. Just curious.

I've come upon the rare change to get some good LSD when my friend comes to visit me from Florida. I want to take a tab with her, but I also want to take it when I'm on a cruise the following week. What would the tolerance be like? Would it even be worth it to do it the second time?

Luckily I work out every day and could handle the intensity of it with great pleasure because my body felt jacked up to the extreme. I wasn't really expecting it because I had only done at most 2 hits before and it didn't have that insane stimulating effect. I thought it was supposed to be mostly a mental thing... my mind was blown to smitherines as well.

No one's ever died on LSD, and many people have done thousands of doses in it's history.


I wouldn't worry about it at all dude, basically you just took tonnes of them and they were probably just not the cleanest of acid and produced a heavy body load.


I've just recently started getting some good clean acid, there's definitely a difference between the stuff I've eaten lately and what I was eating last year, and the lack of body load is one of them, but like I said you took tonnes, you're body would have been doing all sorts of whacked out shit with all that stimuli, especially at a rave.

Okay you've got a long post but I'll do my best here.


Okay first of all the Molly you speak of, Molly is a slang term for crystal MDMA, and combining it with LSD is a great combination, one of my favourites definitely ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

However if you're worried about your heart sky rocketing I wouldn't be taking MDMA as it does have the tendency to send you heart rate up. Not to mention you said that you just took some random drug while on LSD, having no idea what it was, you're lucky it was Molly and the two go together nicely.

Just for future reference, that's generally a no-no. Always make sure you know what you're combining before you combine it, and you've at least done a little research, I can tell you from experience, LSD when combo'd with different things can get really whacky.


Now secondly yes it's fairly normal for crazy shit like that to happen while you're tripping, especially if you're on quite a large dose. LSD plateaus with little peaks for about three hours or so before you start coming down. If you're not used to this it could potentially cause anxiety, or just generally overwhelm you. It's totally different for everyone, and not just your body size, I think it's more to do with your receptors, the only difference body size makes is how quickly it metabolises through the body, please correct me if I'm wrong someone more knowledgeable, Mods? :D


1. Almost definitely, I'd say if it's just intense visuals then yes. If your throat actually physically closes up, or your blood pressure is actually sky rocketing through the roof something might be wrong, but as far as I know no human has ever died of LSD as I mentioned in my previous post, and people have been doing heroic doses of it since the sixties. 


I'd like to make room for the possibility you may have been sold blotters without LSD on them, we don't speculate about what you might have taken on Bluelight, and I'm not saying what you had wasn't LSD but just bringing it up as it does happen, people do sell other chemicals as LSD. The main way you would know is that LSD doesn't really have much of a taste.


2. Well hard to say, but most likely because you ate acid and acid is crazy, and totally different for everyone as well. I have recurring hallucinations on LSD as well, I know people who don't. It's far more likely to occur again if you're focusing a lot of your thoughts on it and expecting it to happen though, as opposed to just relaxing and enjoying the trip. Again everyone is totally different.


3. Not necessarily, maybe, maybe not. It's hard to speculate. Negative themes in LSD trips are more likely to do with your mind, than the drug itself at least in my experience, unless you've just clearly taken way too much and have a freak out. 

Keep your dose low if you're finding the experience uncomfortable, or maybe it's just not for you. Not everyone is a fan of psychedelics the same way I'm not really a fan of stimulants, yet I have many friends who go nuts for them.


4. This totally normal, you just trippin'.

I recognize the feeling, the rushes of LSD feels like electric lightning bolts moving through your whole body. It really feels like "I'm on fucking fire"!. There's so incredibly much energy. It can be felt in every part of the body, including lips, ears etc.


I doubt there's a specific term for this effect, it's just something I get on LSD (and only LSD).

Have a read about 'Kundalini', I get this feeling when I take psychedelics (and now pretty much every time I look at a sunset ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)).

When I began to get these tingles and rushes sober, I this was the only explanation Google had to offer.

Sounds like standard LSD bodyload to me. Acid can definitely feel very metallic, wiry, stimmy, you name it. Since language evolved to describe neurotypical states, it's hard to put something like this into words and make comparisons, but I feel like your analogy with electricity is just another way to capture the same thing.


You're welcome to check out Kundalini if you like, but I would argue that mysticism is not the only recourse for understanding this type of experience.

Just general LSD physical effects. You tend to notice them a little less the more often you take LSD.

I thought some of the better doses I ate had that metallic/electrical taste on your tounge,  ive only had a couple sources my whole life so maybe its that I dont have much to compare to.?  The times we had that taste it was always un prefed wow.  Stronge, clean stuff.

I just want to share my one and only experience (so far) with LSD here.


I was 18 and had skipped out on probation and was staying with some friends in another county. They said "Do you want to trip acid tonight?" and I said "I don't have any money" and they said "That's not what we asked". So I said yes and they went a few towns over and came back with marshmallows cut in half and with what looked like a brown liquid soaked into them.


We each ate one and started watching the Wizard of Oz and blazing. 

It was insane. I can't even describe what happened at this point really except to say "My brain turned to soup". Shit was crazy moving like mushrooms but MUCH more intense and it was similar to 2cI in that it made me feel like my neuro receptors were getting a fireworks show, but like 5-10x 2cI. 

At one point I SWEAR to god I saw the Scarecrow had a gun, and when I said "Is the scarecrow holding a gun?" one of the people I was tripping with said "Yeah". So I believed it, but I don't think he really had a gun.


We blazed a little longer and chilled, then the people I was staying with went to bed (they were a couple so probably to go fuck).


I turned on Netflix and started watching random shit. Eventually I turned on a Futurama movie, and watch like ALL of those for the rest of the night. And that was my REAL trip.

While on LSD I realized that the guy that made Futurama (Matt Groeing) is trying to point out some CRAZY shit with that show. 

Fry is the average American (or supposed to be), and gets sent into the Future (where we expect problems to be solved by then). And he takes problems from today that we don't have solutions for, and puts them in a "Future" scenario with that problem. Then they SOLVE the problem with "future stuff". Like the scientist will invent something, or they realize something, or whatever. But it's basically like "This is the problem, and we solve it with blah-blah-blah" but what he's doing is HOPING that someone with figure out the BLAH-BLAH-BLAH and solve the problems we are ACTUALLY having today.


Another thing he does, is try to show people that you either "get shit done" or "have a baby". In his movies there's always some theme, like "We HAVE to get this done." and in the end the "answer" is either child birth or metaphors for it, or sex or metaphors for it. So basically it's saying you can TRY to focus on other stuff, but most people just end up starting a family at a young age and dropping everything.


But that shit was crazy. The next morning I still felt out of it and we played Oblivion for a while, then blazed and eventually felt normal.

Does acid (LSD) show up on a urine drug test? I'm pretty sure it's this kind of test ([http://www.firstaidmonster.com/drug-testing/drugcheck-urine-drug-testing-9-panel-cup-5/pk/](http://www.firstaidmonster.com/drug-testing/drugcheck-urine-drug-testing-9-panel-cup-5/pk/)) Is there any chance of it showing up on this test, or similar tests during one's high, or a day after?

On any standard 5 panel, 9 panel, and even 14 panel test LSD isn't tested for.

It's generally a specially ordered thing, I know tons of people who have taken drug tests and not one of them has been caught for LSD use.

However, since you don't know exactly what test you're taking it would still be wise to stay away from LSD before the test

Anyone have any REAL data or knowledge in regards to LSD being taken into the blood stream through the skin? 


I recently took a dose via my palm, it worked wonders.  Set in an ethanol based alcohol by the taste of it.

If you already confirmed it yourself, what do you need extra info for? Quantitative information perhaps?


I don't really see the point in using other forms of administration considering sublingual and oral already have super high bioavailability, but if you are going to do this I'd use a spot where the skin is thin and uncallous, and where blood vessels are shallow and plentiful. The inner wrist maybe?

Yep, precisely.  Anecdotal experiences are only anecdotal, they mean nothing in a scientific viewpoint.  


I agree with you on the bioavailability aspect, though skin added a very interesting body high.  Sensory tingles, very fun.  


Substance was confirmed LSD.

Why are you able to absorb one hit thru your skin while other people can stick their arm in a vat of it covered in DMSO?

You had a placebo effect. Encouraging people that "puddling" is a real ROA is wasteful and perpetuates the same urban legends.

Know what's a good way to administer LSD? Insufflation. I used to get those little purple tablets, about 1/8" diameter and I didn't like to wait around for an hour to get high from it so I would crush them up between two spoons and snort the powder. Granted, nobody knows what they used for the purple color or what it would do if you snort it but I wasn't thinking it through that much at the time. Anyway, it worked real nice. Got high quicker and had less stomach discomfort. I stopped taking it by mouth altogether and only snorted it for quite some time until the supply dried up. It just seemed like a better high all around. I did swallow what ran down from the back of my sinuses but most of the effects came quickly by nasal absorption.

This is an old post but I'm really curious about this too.  I've experienced it with both LSD and shrooms.  Kundalini is something I thought of as well.  It's almost (at times) more extraordinary than the visuals!  As long as the overall trip is going well, it's an experience I usually like.


Side question, in addition to the energy rushes, I usually get mild to moderate discomfort in the neck, shoulders and back.  Vasoconstriction most likely.  I've always wondered if it's possible to trip without any of this body load whatsoever -- and whether it would be due to the quality, age, strength of the LSD itself or my own physical conditions.  I have tried magnesium supplements though I'm not sure about the dosage.  


I realize this is a topic that gets debated endlessly and would take extensive research (currently illegal) to understand.  Until then, it's a lot of subjective opinion - which just deepens the overall mystery!

On Halloween, I'm going to hand out candy on +/- 100 ugs. Wanting to combine with a 4-sub tryptamine. What sort of combos have you all enjoyed?

I was thinking somewhere between 10-13 mgs 4-aco-met, fum. Not trying to fish for ideas; not sure if I'm asking questions correctly.

I'm new to all of this but I'm in need of some guidence. Yesterday I consumed 2 185ug of acid purchased from the the dark web with two other friends. I have consumed lsd over 10 times before and had no adverse reaction. I don't really take anything else and rarely drink but use acid as an enlightening experience. I have no known medical conditions and I'm in good shape.


One of my friends started having a bad time and ran from the park we were in. I chased after him into the street.

I couldn't find him. I proceeded to stop every car and tell them to call th police. (This was a main road). 


I was sure my friend was dead I ws absolutely convinced of it. The police arrived but in my state I didn't believe they were the police. It took 8 officers to restrain me over the course of 2 hours on the pavement.  The were continually trying to handcuff me but I thought they were trying to kill me by putting something round my neck so kept fighting. I was eventually put in an ambulance. Once in hospital I has handcuffed to the table and given 40mg of diazapam.


The doctors in the morning told me they couldn't lowerer my heart rate and was 2 minutes from being put into an induced coma in order to stop me from having a heart attack. I was also told that they thought it was impossible for me to fight off 8 officers without having taken something else. I weigh 75kg and am 5ft11


ANY Information would be so greatly appreciated.

Hi am a new member to this site so please redirect me if this is the wrong area.

In a few weeks time me and a few friends plan to go on a small boat trip down a river nearby as one of my friends owns a dinghy. There is a camp site a short while down the river where we will spend the night (we'll pitch our tents before dropping). My three friends planned to drop 160ug of LSD for their first time and me 300ug as I have tried acid several times before. What I am concerned about is whether the 300ug dose (I've only had up to 250ug) would have dissociative effects and cause any potential hazards as far as handling being in a raft is concerned. We will have a portable speaker which I don't intend to ruin and I feel partially responsible as am the only one who has tried psychedelics before, apart from one person who has had 2CB. 

If anyone has any knowledge on the matter I would appreciate it

I assume you felt fairly capable on 250ug, or you wouldn't be asking if 300ug would be okay.  There will definitely be a bit of an increase in strength over 250ug.  It's really up to you... personally when I was early in my psychedelic taking days, I wouldn't have wanted to do something dangerous and skill-based on rafting.  Nowadays I regularly go on dangerous river hikes where I climb waterfalls, on psychedelics.  It's about what you know you can handle.  I would recommend sticking to a dose you know especially since you haven't tripped too many times (sounds like from your post), even if it's 250ug, assuming you feel comfortable with how you'll be on that dose based on your previous experience.


Also, is this the same batch as your previous 250ug trip?  I ask because dosages on blotters are notoriously hard to get accurate, they're usually quite a bit lower than advertised, and if it's a new batch, it could be that the batch you had "250ug" from was weaker than this batch, and you'd actually be taking a substantially higher dose if you go for 300ug, or even 250ug.  But if it's the same batch you can be reasonably sure the blotters will be the same strength as what you had before.

Wear your life jackets and be sure it's on correctly.  I would not like a sudden dunking in the water while tripping without one.

If you're "capable" on 250µg you probably aren't.

I've dived into the water on a decent dose of LSD before (perhaps multiple times but one stood out) and it was very weird, at one moment I was able to use swim techniques that use counterintuitive movements that end up being extremely effective... but at another moment - pretty suddenly transitioning - I was flailing around like an absolute retard. It switched immensely once I started thinking about it consciously, being impressed initially.


Definitely raised a few eyebrows but I was able to just pull myself together. And myself out of the water.


I absolutely only tried this because it was a regular competition pool with lifeguards just in case. IIRC it was in the 150-200 µg range, but I always got my stuff lab tested mind you. Not like in most countries.


When you are going rafting you do not have a safety margin, you can't really afford to fuck up or at the very least it will be a bit of a dramatic ordeal for pretty much anyone if not a truly tragic one.


If your supposed 250 µg tells you this is okay you either tripped in settings that are totally misguiding your setting based tolerance, which will make a trip damn intense in unusual situations (like rafting!), or - as is likely - it was misadvertised and is actually weaker, or - quite rare - you have special hardheaded brain chemistry, or have heavy tolerance which shouldn't have made it such a surprise.


In any case, it's a terrible idea. If you want to incorporate adventures into your acid trips or vice versa make sure that you still survive in the worst case scenario. That can't be said about rafting.


Being able to handle 250 µg is not about dicksizing, that is ridiculous and sooner or later that way you will find out that while for some people LSD may take a bit more to completely pwn you than say mushrooms... it is hybris to think that you can master heavy doses. **Serious doses affecting you that much is not weakness, it is normal.**

Maybe some real freaks who trip absolute balls weekly can overcome part of this partially due to tolerance and a bit due to picking up survival skills... but those people would trip so much that they won't be asking about that on bluelight. And to be clear: even getting to that point will involve pushing your limit every time, it wouldn't happen casually.

It generally tends to help not to get involved in potentially life threatening on a hallucinogenic drug.


Like even at 100ug, your motor skills start to jumble and you start entering "retard phase".

Its like alchohol in the sense of dont do dangerous shit drunk. Or another example dont drive tripping..


Even camping while tripping has its own crazy situations, i kinda think trying to go rafting will be way to difficult, you'll be lucky to get you items together and get into the raft better yet use your brain to make effective physical movements. 

Not too mention anything over 120ug roughly starts impairing rational decisions. What is a terrible life threatening ordeal in reality can appear as fun and games on lsd.

People have jumped off buildings and shit on lsd :/


Sorry negative nelly here but uhh, i dont know about you other bluelighters but i feel like you cant really do an extreme amount during a trip other than deal with the mindstate. Even just the simplest shit becomes painfully hard. 

Some of the hardest times ive had tripping are trying to do things with inanamite objects.. Mindfuck.


"Can you pass me the scissors bro?"

*looks at the scissors for 5-10 seconds, then hands you a ciggarette*


Fuck multiply that situation into rafting with friends.. Idk it just seems to be asking for trouble.


What is the gain too? Like what is it you wish to gain from this trip?

Knowledge or just "fun"?.


Everyone ive met who tripped "just for fun" nearly went delusional and will not trip anymore, and going as far as calling trips disgusting and psychotic, when really those are adjectives they are displaying through themselves.


For example, i will not trip if i dont think theres something i can learn from it. Whether that be a new art style or analysing my lifestyle in search for room for improvement.


I dont really think your rafting skills are going to get better ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Sorry just dont want anybody drowning, then sending the rest of you into PTSD because lsd will take you there quickly if something REALLY fucked up happens.  ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Solipsis is pretty much spot on in his longer answer to the question than mine (who's ambiguity was intentional so as to carry two meanings—you either aren't on 250 µg or aren't as functional as you think. The latter is very important. If you are accustomed to feeling functional in an operational/cognitive sense in a given setting, it is in fact possible to acclimate yourself to doing quite a variety of things under the influence (like having sex—for myself, most of my partners who've indulged, and in the cases of most people who I've spoken to, the first time fucking while tripping is initially awkward in terms of position, rhythm, etc. until instinct kicks in, and this is not even to mention male difficulties, but with some tripping-sex experience "under your belt" so to speak it comes more naturally and is pretty much uniformly mind blowing at least absent some possible negative mind-set, etc.)


Problems, or increased risks, however, happen as variables multiply and change. Things might be different with a different sexual partner, you might be too fucked up and disinhibited and do something inappropriate or regrettable (I've definitely decided "fuck it, forget about the condom" more than once while under the influence of one drug or another, condoms not being very easy to apparatus manage while tripping balls; I've also been to shows and suchlike and wound up with women I never would have if not under the influence, for better or for worse.) Or if you're interrupted *in flagrante*, you might not have the proper reaction causing awkwardness or worse (not exactly this but something like it came rather close to getting me killed around the winter of '08.)


Or let's talk about another activity a lot of us participate in, and usually, or at least statistically, more dangerous one. That's right, we're going to talk about ***driving,*** and the rest of this post is participant–observer sociology, not harm reduction:


Lots and lots of people drive while tripping on a few hits of acid, hopefully after the peak; I'm talking about serious acid users though, usually in the setting of driving back from a show. It's often not a "designated driver" situation but a "who's best at driving tripping" situation. I've ever even had my ride ask me to throw him a few tabs to straighten him up and keep him awake for the drive home. I did, everyone lived; I've been both passenger and driver on acid more times than I can count. Highway driving feels quite easy and with good music and scenery can actually be highly enjoyable. Town and city driving is less pleasant often going on terrifying as is driving on country roads especially in the dark, although again, some people seem to be fine. 


I think most of us who have been in that lifestyle and drove have done this to one degree or another. Saying that it's outright dumb shouldn't even be necessary. The very tail end of an acid trip might be about as impairing as a few beers and a joint, and, just like beers and joints, experience, tolerance and other individual factors may apply. Uniformly, though, even in people who are pretty confident in their ability to operate a motor vehicle while tripping, the risk is more or less the same: ***unexpected events or stimuli.*** While LSD does not have a lot of effect on either gross or fine motor skills (strictly speaking), and often can actually enhance visual acuity and other perceptions, it can *drastically* alter our cognitive coördination of these, it's speed, facility, etc. Even on the highway experienced driving trippers might be in serious, deadly trouble if the car ahead suddenly throws on the breaks; they may very well swerve appropriately but may do so into an 18 wheeler. Concentration in the "keep your eye on the road and your hand behind the wheel" sense may be fine but situational awareness overall completely another matter. You can also be rocking out to music and be followed by the police with lights and sirens blazing for quite a while before you notice (learned that one the hard way.)


So yeah, you'll meet a bunch of people who'll even start to go on about man molding with machine (even more so on bikes) and driving as an extension of their own body, etc. It sure feels like that until something and jars you out of it and this thing is just you out of it might get killed.


This goes for swimming, boating, shooting, drug dealing, any activity where potentially dangerous situations can arise quickly. Don't let your confidence or experience level or confidence in your level of experience deceive you into thinking that you can handle whatever the world throws at you in those scenarios. You can't. You can't really even handle *whatever* sober. Tripping your mind is going to react unpredictably, focus unpredictably, possibly have trouble recognizing and reacting to crisis.


I've been robbed at knife point while on a large dose of acid, I was basically stunned and couldn't do much other than stare at the knife, I had trouble following directions so the other kid had to physically restrain me (by which time I was coming to realize the seriousness of my situation and just complied), search me, take my wallet and jewelery and drugs. I then had as bad as a trip as I've ever with a touch of PTSD; since then I've also overreacted to provocation while tripping and started beating someone and had him on the ground and probably would have killed him if I had not been restrained by people from my group. Still yet also I've saved I've saved lives more than once by giving Narcan, once even CPR and even starting an IV. I've mediated a brewing potentially dangerous and very unbalanced territorial fight by competing organizations during a festival, not saving lives but a lot of unpleasantness, drama and retraction, lost revenue, and s on. So too have I driven, made love, etc. And every example of something *not* to do above.


***But I'd never rely on myself to be able to do so again.* ** That's part of the power and unpredictability of the drug.

Sounds like absolute hell. I once had a random stranger come and insist on walking along with me while I was hiking on acid. He then started talking non-stop about how that particular trail was pretty dangerous and how he's been mugged there before. He even said something along the lines "Don't trust anyone here, you never know who you are talking to. Sometime I've met friendly people here and the next second they pull out a gun. This is a dangerous place, don't take your life for granted. You never know when you will die". A few minutes latter he just took another road and walk away, but that event alone gave me a little bit of PTSD, I was constantly afraid of getting mugged and avoided hiking for a couple of months, It felt like I was brainwashed into paranoia ... can't imagine how actually getting robed, or being in any threatening situation while on acid would be like.

Yeah it was bad. Took some time to recover. I was new at the time, both to the drug, relatively, and to the game (where this sort of thing, let's me real, is an occupational hazard, even at hippie festivals if you're naïve and off your patch.) Luckily shortly thereafter I ran into some older friends of mine, who I didn't even know would be there, who watched out for me and eventually took me home, with the unexpected result of finding out that their house in town was just around the corner from my apartment in town (both of us split our time between town and country), and cementing a friendship and lucrative connection at the time. So I guess there's a silver lining, but while being in a fight or even getting beat down is one thing, getting a knife put to your throat when you're 17 or so is scary enough sober ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) anyways yeah … another thing I took away from this episode was that I would never carry a handgun while on psychedelics, lest something like this happen, as I probably would have either killed or seriously damaged someone or had the same done to me for around $1k, not worth it by any calculus. I tried target shooting on acid once at our makeshift range by an old quarry with a bolt action .308 with scope, this was modestly successful, a lot of fun, and another occasion from my wayward youth in which I wonder what the fuck I was thinking and thank God nobody got killed or maimed. (((**DON'T DO THIS!!** —Harm Reduction Dep't.)))

I have a question for some more experienced users. I would consider myself mildly experienced as far as psychedelics goes. I've done acid 5 times, DMT just as many, Cubes twice. And many other silly substances back in the days of being broke in high school *cough cough* diphen. Anyways I find that when I do decide to trip I only actually trip about half the time, on any substance. For example, I took some LSD on a blotter today while on a mature bike ride and my heart started racing, got a burst of energy, pretty nice body high (noted I did smoke some decent bud while waiting to come up) but never really got any visuals or that overall trippy feeling of just being abnormal that I seem to usually get. I actually decided to hell with it and came home 2 and a half hours in perfectly competent and sat down and socialized with family. The weird part about this is it's the same Lucy I'd taken about 3 or 4 nights ago with a friend of mine and sat on her back porch in a world of visuals and euphoria. Why is it that some times I just cant trip. Or do you think because of the symptoms I did feel that maybe that particular blotter was just a 'weak' dose?

Well well, this is then the answer to your problem. You have to wait at least a week to reset your tolerance. Waiting two weeks is more advisable. Waiting even longer is better, as it gives you time to integrate your experience. I have noticed that when I trip too often for an extended period my trip begin to feel less and less meaningful. Then if I take a three months break or so, the magic is back. 


So your problem is tolerance. Wait two weeks and drop a blotter from the same batch. You should get back the visuals and euphoria.

Driving on LSD is intense. For me it always seems like the first 5-10 feet in front of my car is unaffected so it serves as a guide, while everything after that is stretched and distorted.

But, swim speaks from experience that for him shrooms are a total mind fuck and require a lot of mental preperation etc. Although the duration is much shorter for shrooms, LSD always gives swim mass amounts of euphoria and it is much easier to handle when something goes wrong. Opinions?

In my case, availability. Also, given the choice, I would say start with shrooms because of the shorter duration. Regarding euphoria - I've had a lot of euphoria on shrooms.

I was just wondering if the purity of acid would change the experience you have because i have seen multiple things saying that if you were to take acid that is about 89% purity the high would be a more social party high with a strong body effect and if you were to take acid that has purity into the high 90s the experience would be different in the sense the visuals would be much cleaner and you would have little to no body high what so ever etc. Is this true or does all acid feel the same if it is the same strength?

Hi friends! I have a friend who was recently put on insulin to manage their diabetes and they're wondering if LSD has any interaction with insulin? I don't think so, and I've tried using the search engine here (and elsewhere) without much luck. From what I can gather, it seems like there's no interaction, and most folks who are diabetic who have dosed just take a measurement of their sugar levels before and after tripping, and keep a soda or something similar on hand in case their sugar levels dip. Does this seem correct? Does anyone have any advice for them? 


Your input is most appreciated.

purity plays a major part. 95% vs 99.9% is very noticeable on the body load and the comedown. 99.9% has zero or very low body load. 95% gives me alot of nasuesa, stomach is doing constant backflips on high dose of 95% white fluff compared to when i take high dose needle point and my stomach feels fine even i ate a pizza 2 hours before. 95% is white fluff and is usually the most common form anything less pure than this is acutally rare these days.

Yes, [@TripSitterNZ](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/521610/) , I completely agree.

And the fact that we know there are impurities like iso-lsd and other ergolines present in sub 99.9% is what I think contributes to these less-desirable effects.

Even if these impurities are not “active at that level,” no one can say they don’t have any altering effect on the parent compound itself.


I know from personal experience (hundreds of trips thru the late 80s to present day), always tripping on pure WoW by NS (lived a couple miles from him!).

The one time I obtained a sheet from someone else, due to his absence, we all complained about the gritty comedowns, speedy and tweaky effects of that sheet.

The thing is, I didn’t tell folks this was different, because it was still WoW (and lsd is lsd, right?), but uniformly I received the same complaints. Must/could have been tornado juice, or lavender laid or something.


So until someone can irrefutably prove that these otherwise inactive iso’s and other impurities/ergolines simply cannot have a mechanism of cascading or synergistic effects either on the lsd itself, or on our body chemistry - I’m going to posit that the diffs I and many others feel and report (maybe we’re just too sensitive to these things or overly so), must/could have a causal relationship to effects felt other than dosage, set and setting. Now I agree that those are chief players in the outcome of any trip, but I allow room in my thinking for the  potential of these impurities being capable of altering the experience.


Don’t hate on me folks, I’m no scientist and I know this opinion will be met by a chorus of “here we go agains,” but ask yourself this: can YOU actually PROVE and KNOW this is all just placebo?


One day, double-blind trials may prove one side right; until then, it’s up for respectful debate.

This conversion really works at home and is based on 1992 adducts study, have experienced it twice, like an upgraded version of LSD.


##### At-home conversion of LSD to 1-acetaldehyde LSD in 1 step (similar to but beyond even ALD-52) 1 page synopsis

I have made 1-acetaldehyde LSD twice so far from 3 LSD blotters and then 4 LSD blotters the 2nd time, it is extraordinary, easy to do in one step and based on the 1992 adducts study with indole see below note (6).  This is absolutely no "pro-drug" it has effects all on it's own, COMPLETELY...

I'm just wondering, other than subjectively, how to confirm whether there's an acetyl attached to the LSD-25 or whether something else is going on with acetyl during metabolism.

> Click to expand...
Well said The Axe, let's not forget the possibility that acetaldehyde could be adducting onto the NH group nitrogen of the ergoline indole of LSD "in vivo" in the liver to convert this to 1-acetaldehyde LSD. After all, the Aztecs and Mayans added the morning glory extract to wine/liquor, and the 1992 adducts paper is entitled:


**"Tryptophan analogues form adducts by cooperative reaction with aldehydes and alcohols or with aldehydes alone: possible role in ethanol toxicity."**


Note (2) Page 515 "Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants" Christian Ratsch: "The fresh or dried morning glory seeds normally are added to alcoholic drinks (sugarcane liquor; c. alcohol), tepache (maize beer, chicha), and balche' (Schultes 1941, 37)."


Here's an example: If you soak coca leaf tea bags in wine, and the wine drunk, the cocaine is converted into coca-ethylene in the liver...cocaethyelene is orally potent, it has a "higher like" rating than even cocaine when human tests were done in 1994. This was the basis behind the famous commerical "Vin Mariani wine" back in the 1860's popular with both Popes, Thomas Edison, and scores of other famous  people. I don't see any cleavage taking place with this molecule but rather addition/transformation. This "in-vivo" liver transformation of the molecule was not even discovered till 1994 !


Perhaps this same "in vivo" transformation of LSD to 1-acetaldehyde LSD takes place in the liver via an enzymatic reaction that has not yet been discovered. I know the effects of LSD and 1-acetaldehyde LSD very well, as I have taken acid hundreds of times, and the 2 times I tried 1-acetaldehyde first at 300ug and 2nd time at 400ug were completely different, in fact I prefer the 1-acetaldehyde LSD by a long shot, it's the only way I will take acid for the rest of my life, I don't mind the extra expense of using 3 or 4 tabs at once for the conversion, it's cheap and plentiful in dreams. You have nothing to loose, my grocery store carried just one brand of Sherry wine, seen in the 1st pic of linked thread with 13 pics, "Taylor brand sherry" and the peppermint extract was right down a few isles.


Like I mentioned earlier, I've taken acid in all different amounts with 400g of fresh cactus tea (I grow lots of cactus under shade cloth) for over 15 years, and it always feels just like "acid + cactus", but when I took the 400ug of 1-acetaldehyde LSD with 400g of fresh cactus, for the 1st time in my life it felt like 700mg of mescaline, it was THE most profoundly infinitely beautiful and powerful trip of my entire life, I can't stop thinking about even 1 week later, big time life changing. I had complete control of my faculties, no tenseness or anxiety like with acid, no wandering thoughts, it was deep mentally,  real gem, I would wave my hand and see not only tracers, but fractals inside the tracers, the beauty of the 2 women on screen from the new hulu movie "to the stars" was overwhelming, I was in heaven, the colors were out of this world impossible and breath-taking for hours on end...I thanked Heaven for this remarkable experience, the most profound of my life. Just my 2 cents.

That is the placebo effect, marketing/hype, and branding.  LSD is LSD.


Nicholas Sand and the brotherhood of eternal love as well as other groups of chemists or drug distribution groups were all about making, promoting, selling, and marketing as much of their 'brand' of LSD as possible, and making as much money as they could. 


It is still like this today with LSD sold online on the darkweb and via street dealers, they hype up their product so people buy it from them, and not from the competition.


I remember reading in one of the many books about LSD and other psychedelic drugs I read as a teenager and in my early 20s about how people selling/distributing LSD in the 1960s and early 1970s would sell LSD with different blotter art or different coloured gelatin or windowpane type.  People who were told that certain colours of LSD gelatin or windowpane, or blotter being sold were "bad" had "bad trips" 'felt dirty', etc., or that other colours or blotter art were "good" had good trips, the LSD felt 'clean', etc.  However, in reality it was all the same LSD, at the same dosage, but the carrier such as the gelatin square or blotter art just looked different, and it was based on marketing, brand hype, and the placebo effect.


This is a link which shows how the brand of Sandoz LSD is just like any other 'type' of LSD.

Again, we lack empirical study which supports either claim.

This is a case where I’ll respectfully agree to disagree; it has approached a similar status to that of the Sasquatch.


At the risk of sounding dull, I simply believe this to be true, and await an ontology or empirical proof that could refute the possibility of impurities having an effect, not on their own - as Sasha has elucidated - but in concert with the lsd itself, as an adulterant. That, after all is the question.

Its not about making the most money though the ones making the most money are the ones making impure product that affects the trip in different ways. When you refine to 99.9% you lose alot of hits in a batch that is over 30k hits. 


When you have taken LSD many many times you quickly see which crystal is the greatest. I know that its real so i will avoid trash crystal that makes people have terrible body load.

Further, it’s a dubious notion that branding was the key, as I mentioned two cases of WoW tabs; clearly not an issue of promoting a particular product via blotter art, per se.

I do agree with the premise that branding did occur, and still does with various prints etc., but this in no way accounts for the case I raised.


Try eating some ipomea seeds - you’ll have a trip if enough is consumed, albeit with some pretty real and for most, major discomfort.

Then try refining it via an extraction and note the differences.

Similar trips, but one is much smoother on the body, due to other alkaloids present in stronger ratios than wanted for the desired effects.


Also, [@PriestTheyCalledHim](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/72305/) I had read that article before, and one interesting fact they leave out is that it’s highly unlikely anyone, including Sandoz, has been able to synth a 100% pure product. That would be awesome, by the way! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) So it‘s all tainted, really, but some more so than others. These are differences that some claim to be sensitive to, myself included.

Interesting but LSD still surprises me. Especially in regards w tolerance-took a tab and at 6 hours in thought I might as well take the second since I just wanted to increase the duration and didn't expect much that far in-hit as if it was a full second tab. Tripped way harder than expected.

A little off topic, but have link to a groundbreaking new study on LSH compared to LSD:


[New research: Morning glory contains 5 stimulating LSD-like drugs, soluble only in wine/alcohol, only sparingly soluble in water. - Botanicals - Mycotopia](https://mycotopia.net/topic/110273-new-research-morning-glory-contains-5-stimulating-lsd-like-drugs-soluble-only-in-winealcohol-only-sparingly-soluble-in-water/)


Page 2 post #40 of link above includes BRAND NEW 2020 receptorome study which compares LSH from the morning glory seeds with LSD, this is the first study of it's kind. It shows LSH to be quite powerful receptorome wise.


LSD chemist Skinner made wine extracts of claviceps paspali ergot (3 page trip report on post #32) that kept their strong activity for many years, have done the same using fresh off vine morning glory seeds. They both contain exact same alkaloid profile when fresh. This is how the ancient Maya and Aztec would extract the seeds, into acidic alcoholic drinks, see link above with pics of this from "The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive plants". Sherry wine also contains 10mg acetaldehyde per shot glass or 30 ml, and according to the LSA adducts theory from psychonaut.com, there is a high probability that acetaldehyde can adduct onto the amide nitrogen to form LSH from LSA after 3 hours of soaking and stirring once per hour in fridge of sherry wine extraction solution. LSH is a simple adduct of LSA + acetaldehyde, adducts are easy to form. See the several strong wine extraction seed reports at the end of the linked to paper above, page 4 or post #63. LSH only survives when extracted into acidic solutions, like wine for example (ph=4) else it decomposes to LSA almost immediately in neutral (ph=7) water. Study for this given in above paper, from 2016 Polish morning glory study.

Hell yeah thank you I've heard nothing but good things about them.


I've been blessed recently.  I've got a blast off of dmt left with my yocan that I've been holding on to, a gang of good nugs...  I doubt I'll do the dmt with it this time and I'll probably only eat 2 or 3 then save a couple for next time but fuck yeah I hope my source is legit and everything is straight.   


I rarely trip now I used to all the time many years ago.   


I've come across strong acid several times over the past few years and have to grab some for old times sake.

Test it first, either send it into a lab which will be more accurate, or use a home test kit.  The 'brands' of the supposed crystal types, reviews, and blotter art mean nothing as someone could easily put a research chemical that is not LSD on there and sell it.

Yeah that's just your opinion. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


Just because the blotter art is the same it does not mean it is actually LSD or dosed at that many ug/mics. Anyone can order blotter paper in the same pattern or artwork/design with perforation or without, and put any research chemical they want on the blotter.

unlike your crack dealer on the corner street these are professinals. you cant order this blotter paper / mimic it. Plus 1 million + storms have been distributed all at the same 100-105 ug dosage.

If you say so? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


I wouldn't trust some random dealer or group online on the darkweb, clearnet, etc. I did a basic search for the pattern and blotter art and found blank blotter paper for sale, and any graphic desinger worth his/her/their salt could easily completely copy and sell the same blotter art.

I mean I'm not going to bet on it 100% I'd like to test it but I probably won't. 


Is it true however that you can't order blank sheets of this stuff?  Any print that is able to be ordered easily online I would rather have tested but if this print is that unique I would feel a hell of a lot better as I'm probably not going to test it.  If I found a head shop with reagent tests I might but as far as I know they don't usually carry them.

That's what I like to hear.  The dude I got them from said they are supposed to be clean and really good.  I just took it with a grain of salt but damn he was right.  


I hope this one is special. I need to let loose but I'm shy to really trip balls these days.

Don't just take random stangers' claims or reviews online or even supposed lab tests from vendors or dealers which could easily be photoshopped, get it tested.  Read my other replies. If I were going to take LSD I would get it tested as I have no desire to take any of the research chemicals/lysergamides sold as LSD or acid these days, or to hypothetically pay lots of money for low doses of LSD.

So in other words the man or woman who you got it from has no idea if it is really acid, or if it is a research chemical.


Yes there is still LSD still around, is it like it was decades ago before research chemicals or before there was any need for testing? No, but as I wrote before if you are taking what is sold today as LSD or even MDMA/MDA, or other drugs it is best to test and not go by hearsay, reviews, blotter art which means nothing, or the supposed "brands" of LSD crystals used to make the blotter or whatever form the acid is in.

I don't trust any mdma honestly.  I barely even look for it. Although real Molly is a lot easier to tell than real lsd.  I know the taste feel and look of actual Molly not that moon rock crap that has been around for the last 13 or 14 years.  


There is actually a shitload more lsd around now than in the mid 2000s.  But of course someone could fake a print and lay some  nbome on it.

Yes or the Lysergamide research chems/designer drugs, who wants to be a lab rat or guinea pig?


I was writing about decades before the mid 2000s.


I do not use drugs anymore, but if I were going to I would perhaps just smoke or eat pot/THC, or maybe trip on Psilocybin mushrooms as I did not take them as much as I did LSD as they were seasonal. I know people do grow them but it has to be extremely sterile, and I know people who were growing and got busted by narcs.

Ate 3 of those fractal storms.  I ate one Friday and barely felt it but last night I took 3 and it was everything I had hoped and expected. 


Real calm relaxing trip.  Excellent visuals.  Quality lsd I enjoyed it so much.  I'm gonna grab another 10 or 20 to hold in to throughout the year

I’ve been having some lackluster experiences on al-lad lately and so decided to acquire 10 220mic tabs to play around with. It’s been a while but I’ve never endured a bad trip on lsd. I have had too much and had to be watched over, but I recall being content through out the whole experience. For whatever reason even when I take 400mic+ of al-lad all I get is confusion, dysphoria, and disappointing visuals. Let’s see how ole lacy treats me this time.

Man I don't know what it is, but my last couple lsd trips turned on me. 2 hours after ingesting 2 150 mic tabs the experience went south real quick. I actually think these tabs may have some hot spots because it came on stronger than I anticipated. It felt as if an ugly snake reared it's head. I became increasingly confused, disoriented, and  extremely anxious. My body also started to ache unbearably. I had to take 4 mg of etizolam to mitigate these symptoms. 


Once the etiz kicked in the trip became more manageable and I had some decent visuals. I even smoked a little dmt and had a pleasant and peaceful recurrence of beautiful all engulfing visuals.


I've done lsd countless times at high dosages and I've never had a bad trip. Sucks that I'm not responding to Psych's like I once used to.

sounds like stages of ego loss but you got scared and aborted the trip with benzos.

No I was very much present, but it just turned into a bad trip. The physical sensations were painful and I was bombarded with negative thought loops. I've experienced ego loss before, but this was very different. For whatever reasons the last few times I've done al-lad or lsd I don't get those rich diverse visuals like I use to and I have a tendency to become very confused and uncomfortable.

I have recently received some tabs advertised as 350 ug (ghostbuster design) from a source that has been viewed in this part of the world as having impeccable integrity and the highest quality product (certainly 105 ug batches over the last year or so from this source have been brilliant). 


Is anyone seeing/believing such high dosed tabs around the world at present? I did sample them but I was quite tolerant at the time so unable to accurately gauge their strength.

Outside of small custom batches its quite rare.

I remember a few years ago there was some insanely strong lady gaga tabs. (+300ug)


But i have gotten 400ug on 2x2cm tabs from a friend.

They had layed a small amount of them only for personal use.

I ate only half and it was def over 150ug by a good margin.

So the tiny bit of Cl2 in tape water is destroying LSD in the stomac, what about smoking while sublingaling blotter ?

The smoke is full of oxydied stuf no, like nitrogene oxyde, and all the list of agressives oxydants list on the paquet.

I think lysergic acid is maxbe pointless sublingualy also it can depend on the side, ammount and timeframe from production to consumption but lsd when sublingual at least from my humble exp. is fast disollved or mixed with saliva and goes through stomach as the microg are going through (tube) i dont know the word in English. but muscles dont work for microgr and I red that somewhere or heard from someone that my gut told me to trust that as it makes a little sense, so stomach dont react as there went some chunk of food or pill or anything weghted over 5miligrams, that is why benzos are pill form 100-300mg and in small intestine where your brain fist get the point if not from sublingual at the edges goes the active ingridient substance, protein or aminoacid

Well no matter how old tabs are or in how bad condition they were stored there isn’t a way nature of trip could change so it lasts 2 hours. But fact you were told to put them in wine makes me wonder if those might be supposed LSA tabs that appeared around 2010 I think and he/she read what tregar wrote so got that idea. But than again, LSA isn’t speedy at all.

What do you think they most likely were? It was almost certainly some lysergamide. It was relaxing and even upping dose didn’t seem to produce much visuals and trip lasted 6 – 7h top. Most people who tried both LSD and MGS/HBW were convinced it was LSA.

Either should be fine, but hard alcohol (something neutral like white rum or vodka is best) is a good choice because it will prevent bacterial growth if you have it sitting around for a long time.

last post jul 2023 ? sorry if it's not the place to post.

found 2 very old hoffmans with "ohm" sign on verso.

just like it was the first time I bought them, bitter, the "welcome" close eyes visuals at H+10 mnt, then slow beginning, not so energetic, no visuals, just the acid feeling.

well, I agree, those were not lsd but some fine DOX , so very please that they were not lsd and I could jump again in my memories.

top effect at H+5, then slow come down.

so OK it's out of topic, but we got a lots of them before we could get the fresh and real energetic LSD, was nice, a touch of retro.
