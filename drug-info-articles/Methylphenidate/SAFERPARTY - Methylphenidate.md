## Effects
Taking methylphenidate increases the concentration of the nerve messengers dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the brain. When prescribed for ADHD, the drug is supposed to act as a filter for incoming stimuli and alleviate symptoms such as distractibility, attention deficit disorder, disorganisation and impulsivity.
However, due to its stimulating, energising and drive-enhancing properties, methylphenidate is also used as a party drug or to increase performance. Due to the increased release of dopamine, similar effects occur as with the use of cocaine.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
If prescribed by a doctor or used as directed, sleep disturbances and irritability can often occur. Eating disorders, stomach complaints, nausea and vomiting are also known side effects.
Abusive use and higher doses can lead to seizures, cardiac arrhythmias as well as headaches and confusion.
Tolerance develops relatively quickly, which is why higher and higher doses have to be consumed. In overdose, Ritalin can trigger hallucinations.

### Long-term Risks
It is assumed that no dependence develops with therapeutic use of Ritalin. When abusing higher doses over a longer period of time, psychological dependence may develop. With abrupt discontinuation, withdrawal symptoms such as lethargy, apathy, depression and paranoia may occur.

## Safer Use
- If possible, do not consume methylphenidate intravenously. Due to the substances contained in the tablets, embolism (blockage of lung or brain vessels) can occur.
