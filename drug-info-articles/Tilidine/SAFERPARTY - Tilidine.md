## Effects
Tilidine inhibits pain-mediating neuronal systems in the body and thus has a pain-relieving effect. When consumed in higher doses, it has a euphoric and anxiety-relieving effect. Due to its opioid properties, regular use can quickly lead to dependence. Abrupt discontinuation of tilidine leads to withdrawal symptoms.

## Dosage
With slow-release tablets there is a risk of overdose due to delayed release of the active ingredient! The perceived effect is extremely different depending on the person and tolerance.
In combination preparations with naloxone, the desired psychoactive effect of the tilidine is cancelled out from approx. 300 - 400 mg by the naloxone contained.
When consuming for the first time, low doses should be used, as the risk of respiratory arrest is increased.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Known adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drop in blood pressure, drowsiness, tiredness, headache, excessive sweating and nervousness.
In opioid addicts who abuse Valoron® N in high doses as a substitute for morphine or heroin, the drug triggers acute withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, trembling, sweating) due to the naloxone or intensifies already existing withdrawal symptoms.
In higher doses, hallucinations and euphoria may occur, which is why the drug is consumed as a psychoactive intoxicant. The anxiety-relieving, disinhibiting and euphoric properties can lead to aggression, loss of control and increased risk-taking in higher doses. Some German media reported robberies in connection with extremely aggressive, pain-resistant young people under the influence of tilidine.

### Long-term Risks
Regular, abusive use of tilidine can lead to dependence with severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, sleep disorders and depression. Withdrawal, as with all opioids, should not be abrupt and should only take place under medical supervision.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.
