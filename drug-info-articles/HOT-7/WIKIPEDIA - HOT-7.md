HOT-7, also known as 4-propylthio-2,5-dimethoxy-N-hydroxyphenethylamine or as N-hydroxy-2C-T-7, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, 2C, and HOT-x families. It is the N-hydroxy derivative of 2C-T-7. The drug is taken orally.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists HOT-7's dose range as 15 to 20 mg orally and its duration as 6 to 8 hours. The drug's onset and peak of effects were not described. HOT-7's properties are similar to those of 2C-T-7, which has a dose of 10 to 30 mg orally and a duration of 8 to 15 hours, although HOT-7 may have a somewhat shorter duration. HOT-7 may act as a prodrug of 2C-T-7.
The effects of HOT-7 have been reported to include being "quite psychedelic", very rich in closed-eye imagery, not as much in terms of open-eye visuals, very good for interpretive and conceptual thinking, emotional changes, feeling "smoothly stoned", lightheadedness, alcohol-like tipsiness and wooziness, social avoidance, and gastrointestinal disturbances.
