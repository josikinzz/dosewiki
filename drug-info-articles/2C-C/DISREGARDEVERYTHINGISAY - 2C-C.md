**2C-C** (**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-chlorophenethylamine**) is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family.^[1] It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and described in his 1991 book PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story.

In modern times, it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors. Therefore, it is relatively uncommon and has only a short history of human use.

Many users report that 2C-C is gentler and more sedating than other closely related psychedelic phenethylamines.

In terms of its chemistry, 2C-C is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups attached to carbons R2 and R5 as well as a chlorine attached to carbon R4.

In terms of its pharmacology, 2C-C’s psychedelic effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-C can be broken down into 9 components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The “body high” of 2C-C can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft, all-encompassing and mild tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** and **[Sedation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, the 2C-C experience begins with mild stimulation, but usually becomes very sedating as the experience progresses and lacks the distinctive energetic feeling associated with most phenethylamines. This feeling was accurately described in Alexander Shulgin’s PiHKAL as “*an intense form of relaxation.*”
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Although nausea remains present, in comparison to other phenethylamines such as 2C-E, 2C-I or 2C-B, this remains extremely mild and dissipates quickly even with higher dosages. It is perhaps one of the most physically underwhelming psychedelics out there for this reason alone.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** and **[Motor control loss](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - Whilst at lower doses one may find that their bodily control is enhanced, at higher dosages it seems to become suppressed.
- **[Tactile enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation loss](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_loss)**
- **[Salivation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salivation)**
- **[Increased heart rate](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 2C-C is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **[Analysis enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Empathy, love and sociability enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B. They primarily manifest during the stimulating onset of the experience and dissipate once the full extent of the trip takes place.
- **[Thought acceleration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Sexual arousal](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought connectivity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Current mind state enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Current_mind_state_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Memory suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

2C-C presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Acuity enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**

*Distortions*

2C-C presents a full and complete array of possible visual distortions which generally includes:

- **[Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *([melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting), [flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing), [breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#_morphing))* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and realistic in style.
- **[Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT or Ayahuasca than that of LSD, 2C-B or 2C-I. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, slow and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equally blurred and sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them that at higher dosages. While the geometry for 2C-C has yet to be formally confirmed, it seems more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry).

*Hallucinatory states*

2C-C produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **[Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, 2C-C is extremely high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations)** - 2C-C is capable of external hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[Machinescapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-C are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**

**Physical health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 2C-C use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the median lethal dose (LD50) is unknown. This is because 2C-C is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from those who have used 2C-C would suggest that there are little to no immediate or short-term negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly. The validity of these statements, however, cannot be confirmed.

The addictive potential of 2C-C has not yet been formally studied, but anecdotal evidence would suggest that 2C-C is not physically addictive. Many users describe a self-regulating quality and commonly report a tolerance build up when using the drug consecutively many days in a row. A build up in tolerance may lead to weakened effects and a diminished experience, however, this effect is nearly non-existent when consumption periods are spaced 5-7 days apart.

**Legal issues:**

- **United States:** 2C-C is listed in schedule I of section 202© of the Controlled Substances Act in the United States. This was signed into law as of July 2012 under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.
- **United Kingdom:** 2C-C is a class A controlled substance as it is covered by the phenethylamine derivatives clause of the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971.
- **Sweden:** 2C-C is classified as a “health hazard” as of March 1, 2005 in their regulation **SFS 2005:26**, making it illegal to sell or possess.
- **Japan:** 2C-C is controlled by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law in Japan, making it illegal to possess or sell.
- **Australia:** Australia has a blanket ban over all substituted phenethylamines including the entire 2C-X family.

**Conclusion:**

Despite its lack of relative potency, 2C-C definitely holds up as an excellent psychedelic and is particularly useful for those who are inexperienced. Although I have yet to determine the proper dosage for this method, I would highly recommend smoking or vaporizing this compound using a standard water bong (like one used to smoke cannabis) as it delivers an intense experience which is somewhat on par with a phenethylamine-esque DMT breakthrough experience.
