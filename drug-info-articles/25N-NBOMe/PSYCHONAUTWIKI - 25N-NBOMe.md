**Members of the [NBOMe series](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NBOMe) have been linked to numerous overdoses and fatalities.**
 
It is strongly discouraged to [insufflate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Insufflation) (snort) or take higher doses of these compounds. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**25N-NBOMe** (also known as **2C-N-NBOMe** , **NBOMe-2C-N** and **N-Bomb** , although this term is used broadly to refer to the entire [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) family) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces stimulating [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

The name 25N-NBOMe, which short-hand for 2C-N-NBOMe, is a derivative of the phenethylamine psychedelic 2C-N. It was discovered in 2004 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin and subsequently investigated by a team at Purdue University led by [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) .

25N-NBOMe has a notably shorter duration than the rest of the [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) series with a total duration of 6 hours and a peak duration of 2 hours. It is moderately active at a dose of one milligram, and two milligrams provide a strong/heavy trip. This substance is considerably less potent when compared to the more popular NBOMe compunds such as [25B-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25B-NBOMe) , [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) and [25C-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25C-NBOMe) , all which produce strong experiences at doses above 1mg. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Compounds of the [NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) family are not [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) active and should be administered [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) by placing and holding it into one's mouth and allowing it to absorb over a period of 15-25 minutes.

This substance had no history of human use before being sold online as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) in 2010. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Extremely little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 25N-NBOMe in humans, and many members of the [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) series have been associated with deaths and hospitalizations. Along with its highly sensitive dose-response and unpredictable effects, many reports also suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely. Therefore it is highly advised to approach this poorly understood [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Hallucinogens) if using it.

## Chemistry

25N-NBOMe or 2C-N-NBOMe is a [serotonergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as [2C-N](/w/index.php?title=2C-N&action=edit&redlink=1) . 25N-NBOMe is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a nitro group NO 2 - attached to carbon R 4 . It differs from 2C-N structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH 2 ) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group as shown in the image to the right. 25N-NBOMe shares this 2-methoxybenzyl substitution with other chemicals of the NBOMe family. This NBOMe addition contains a methoxy ether CH 3 O- bound to a benzene ring at R 2 .

## Pharmacology

25N-NBOMe likely has efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) where it is assumed to act as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

There is insufficient scientific research to determine this compound's true nature as the pharmacological properties of 25N-NBOMe have not been described in the scientific literature, but only in anecdotal reports.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 25N-NBOMe is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating. For most people, this substance induces a unique type of physical stimulation which can be described as feeling extremely energetic but in a way which does not force the user to move unless they genuinely choose to do so. For others, however, the stimulation can be quite uncontrollable, occasionally resulting in bodily shakes and a grinding of the teeth comparable to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and traditional stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - In terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" itself can be described as a mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - When combined with stimulation, this component manifests as a strong drive to partake in physical activities.
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - Assuming the substance has been taken [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) , the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after sublingual absorption is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very distinct feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**
- **[Muscle tension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_tension)**
- **[Gustatory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gustatory_hallucination)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Users (especially those prone to it) may experience nausea during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Come_up) . The nausea will subside over the peak.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Runny nose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Runny_nose)** - 25N-NBOMe may cause a runny nose and increased mucus production in some users.
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** or **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry encountered on 25N-NBOMe is often described as similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . It can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp around its edges and mostly rounded across its corners.
 
In terms of its behaviour, 25N-NBOMe’s geometry leads onto [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry with [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) remaining so far unconfirmed within this substance. It also seems to consistently build up in visual intensity when the user stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the user has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of physical size attributed to it.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - 25N-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. Level 4 hallucinatory breakthroughs are reported, but very uncommon and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . This effect is more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in its manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and of no particular theme in content or style. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 25N-NBOMe can be described as quite reminiscent to that of [25C-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25C-NBOMe) . They can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is generally only present at low doses and is [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** and **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - Although one of 25N-NBOME's effects is thought acceleration, the opposite may occur at higher doses.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)** - This effect is considered to be very mild compared to traditional psychedlics.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect seems to occur more readily than other psychedelics, perhaps due to its very prominent stimulating properties
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - The [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) (such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [AMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AMT) )
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Dosage independent intensity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage_independent_intensity)** - While the reasons for this are not understood, many reports suggest that this substance can produce unexpectedly strong or weak effects even when taken at the seemingly same dose in an unpredictable manner. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This may contribute to the relative risk it is poses compared to most other psychedelics.
- **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Transpersonal effects on 25N-NBOMe appear to occur with significantly less consistency and reliability than other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , which perhaps corresponds with the relatively mild changes to one's perceptual and cognitive processes. 
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 25N-NBOMe](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_25NNBOMe.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 25N-NBOMe use have not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 25N-NBOMe is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried 25N-NBOMe suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

Users should be very careful and consider that ingesting 2mg+ of [NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NBOMe) series chemicals have proven fatal in some cases. Although there are no reported deaths caused by 25N-NBOMe at this time, it is a rare [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage and is therefore potentially fatal at heavy dosages.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

25N-NBOMe is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 25N-NBOMe is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 25N-NBOMe presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 25N-NBOMe all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Due to the very high potency and seemingly unpredictable effects the margin between a normal and an overdose of NBOMe compounds is extremely small when compared to many other substances. The exact toxic dose is unclear since it seems to depend a lot on personal physiology, rather than predominantly dose. However, various anecdotal reports suggest that dangerous side effects begin to appear when exceeding 1000 μg and it possibly becoming lethal for the more sensitive people at roughly 2000 μg. Reports of other people surviving much higher doses, sometimes even without any major side effects have been documented as well.

There is also the uncertainty of dosage on blotter paper since it is rather difficult to lay such an exact dosage. Insufflating, vaporizing or drinking tinctures of this substance is highly discouraged because of this and has been tied to many documented deaths . One study found that 25I‐NBOMe and 25C‐NBOMe blotter papers contained 'hotspots' with higher quantities of the drug, implying an inherent risk of overdosing.

The overdose effects of NBOMes are typically a dangerously high [heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) and significant [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) also accompanied by [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) , aggressive behavior, [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) or pain, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) and often [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) . The risks in an overdose include anything from organ failure to cardiac arrest and death [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . There are also multiple reports of people lethally injuring themselves or falling to death . [Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help with the psychological effects during an overdose although medical attention should always be called in even a possible overdose of 25I-NBOMe.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .* Due to the highly unpredictable nature of the NBOMe series, it is generally advised to avoid mixing them with other psychoactive substances.

- **2C-T-X** - The 2C-T-X phenethylamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **5-MeO-xxt** - The 5-MeO tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **aMT**
- **Caffeine** - Caffeine can bring out the natural stimulation from psychedelic drugs to make it uncomfortable. High doses can cause anxiety which is hard to handle while tripping.
- **Cannabis** - Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of psychedelics. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **Cocaine** - Cocaine and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **DOx**
- **DXM**
- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** [- Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably.
- **MDMA**
- **MXE** - As an NMDA antagonist, MXE potentiates NBOMes which can be unpleasantly intense.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and NBOMes have also shown a tendency to cause severe seizures
