## Subjective Experience

2-AI first emerged in 2003. Although it never became hugely popular in its own
right, it remained available throughout the legal high years.

I sampled this chemical on a couple of occasions, circa 2012. Unfortunately, my
recollection of these experiments is a little vague, and I didn’t record the precise
doses. Through the mists of time, a mild, functional, and unremarkable stimulation
comes to mind, with a slightly jittery edge.

For the purpose of this book I therefore undertook a final test, in the context of being
a little tired and having a less than exciting social event to attend.

The following notes were taken during the experience:

```
I dose 20mg orally at 6:15pm. The taste of chemical is always gross, and this is
no exception.
```
```
After half an hour or so, I begin to feel a mildly stimulated headspace and less
fatigue, but I am in no way ramped up. I do feel slightly chilly, suggesting a
degree of vasoconstriction, but this soon passes and I become quite warm, a
condition which persists for some hours.
```
```
The evening is passing rather unspectacularly. I am slightly stimulated, but
not in a manner that makes me talkative or active. Certainly, the sleepiness
has been chased away, but it has not been replaced by an uplift or mood
enhancement.
```
```
The stimulation is quite bland; meaning that although I am not drowsy, I am
in no way sparking or mentally sharp. I have little interest in proceedings, but
this chemical is carrying me through them in a semi-detached and almost
disengaged way.
```
```
On returning home a few hours later the effects have faded, although some
background lag and presence remains.
```
The following morning I reported that:

```
I was able to retire to bed normally, and enjoy a reasonable night’s sleep. I feel
no ill effects or any type of hangover.
```
My original assessment appears to have been reasonably accurate, although I didn’t
feel particularly jittery during the re-run. Perhaps that issue manifested with a higher
dose.

In summary, therefore, I found this to be active and functional, but not engaging or
exciting. A higher dose might create more stimulation, but I suspect with it a more
artificial chemical feel, rather than recreational pleasure.

On the markets, 2-AI tended to be mixed with chemicals such as MDAI and 3FPM,
and sold under brand names. Whilst this would certainly have added a more
interesting aspect to the experience, it would also have introduced additional
variables and issues with respect to safety and risk.

Overall, this chemical did more or less what was expected, but it is not one to which I
am ever likely to return.
