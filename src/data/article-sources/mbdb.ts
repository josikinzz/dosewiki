## SYNTHESIS

## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 210 mg) âOnset rapid. alert 20 minutes, and to a +2.5 at 30 to 35 minutes. No physical symptoms, i.e., teeth clench, no stomach problems. Good visual enhancement; eyes openâbright colorsâno visuals with eyes closed. No âcone of silenceâ that I get with MDMA (and enjoy), otherwise Iâm not sure I could tell which was which if I took them blind.â

(with 210 mg and a 50 mg supplement) âTasted perfectly rotten. Suspect I was getting some type of alert in 5 minutes (I often get one quickly with MDMA) and at 30 minutes, a full blown high developed rather abruptly. It would be difficult to describe the high. I suspect it is the lack of language for the phenomenon. I would describe it somewhat like an alcohol high without the disabling side effects of confusion, slurring, staggering and etc. The high never got any more intense than at that 30 minute point and with a noticeable drop in another hour, I took a 50 mg supplement. I enjoyed the high. I relaxed with the material. However, it did not seem to have the same qualities as MDMA, in that it was not as stimulating, and it had very little visual activity. I talked with others, but found it easy to lie down and relax. There was some jaw-clenching towards the end, and I had considerable nystagmus at the peak which I could control. After the experience, I did not want to drink alcohol very much (sell it as a substitute for EtOH!).â

(with 210 mg and a 70 mg supplement) âI begin to feel the rush at 20 minutes, increasing rapidly. Very much like MDMA, only more intense intoxication. Otherwise same symptoms: intense euphoria that I call a feeling of grace, soft skin, voices, youthful appearance, animated discussions, feelings of great closeness to others. I start to drop noticeably at less than an hour and a half into it, but I delayed a supplement until the hour and fifty minute point. It does not get me back to the original intoxication. However, it is very nice, very much like MDMA. Only difference is that there seems to be more quietness, less inclination to talk than with an MDMA supplement. My conclusion: Seems an excellent substitute for MDMA, Next time may try somewhat lower amount, supplement sooner.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The arguments that weigh the use of the code name of MBDB against the use of METHYL-J are present in the recipe for BDB (or J). But what is the source of this H, I, J, K naming thing that I have called the Muni Metro?

First, a little bit of local color. In San Francisco, there is a public transportation called the S.F. Municipal Metropolitan System complex that has integrated an underground street-car system that emerges above ground and connects with a bus network. A number of the street-car lines fan across the city to the outer reaches which are called the Avenues. These lines are named by sequential letters. There is the J Church Street line, the K Ingelside line, the L Taraval line, the M Ocean line, and the N Judah. And in the pharmacological complex that involved the lengthening of the aliphatic chain, there were two coincidental benchmarks in the names that were proposed. Those without an alpha-substituent (no carbon atoms at the position alpha to the amine group, the phenethylamines) were originally called the H compounds. H stood for âhomopiperonylamine.â And the first of those with the alpha-ethyl group there (two carbon atoms at the position alpha to the amine group) was familiarly called âJacobamineâ in recognition of a famous chemist who had set the synthetic wheels in motion.

It is quite obvious, that with one carbon atom lying on that alpha-position, you are precisely half-way between no carbons and two carbons. And there was one letter of the alphabet that lies precisely half-way between an H and a J. So, an natural naming pattern developed. The I compounds were already pretty well known by names such as MDA and MDMA and MDE, so I, and METHYL-I, and ETHYL-I, didnât have any appeal. But for the new, the alpha-ethyl compounds, why not call them the J-compounds? If it has a methyl on the nitrogen it will be METHYL-J and if it has an ethyl group it will be ETHYL-J. And in the next longer group, the 3-carbon propyl group on the alpha-position becomes the K family, and the 4-carbon butyl group located there, the L family. Each with its METHYL and ETHYL prefixes, if the nitrogen atoms are substituted with a methyl or and ethyl group. Vâla, comme on dit en FranÃ§ais. Le systiÃ¨me Muni Metro. Plus simple.

## Effects
MBDB is closely related to MDMA. It differs mainly in how well one's own feelings are perceived (entactogenic effect), how strong empathic understanding (empathic effect) and hallucinogenic effects occur.

## Dosage
1.3 mg per kg body weight (1.3 mg x 80 kg = 100 mg)

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Nausea to nausea, dry mouth, cramping of the jaw muscles, sweating, coordination disorders, sleep disorders and trembling.

### Long-term Risks
MDA is both neurotoxic (damaging to the nerves) and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver); regular use can lead to schizophrenia-like symptoms.

## Safer Use
- First test a third or half a pill.
- Wait two hours for the effect to take effect before adding more.
- Refrain from mixed consumption.
- Avoid alcohol, drink enough non-alcoholic beverages (0.3-0.5 L per hour).
- Take breaks from dancing at parties and get some fresh air in between.
- Take regular breaks from consumption. The body needs time to recover.
- People taking medication are advised to inform themselves about interactions.

MBDB, also known as N-methyl-1,3-benzodioxolylbutanamine or as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methyl-α-ethylphenylethylamine, is an entactogen of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and phenylisobutylamine families related to MDMA. It is known by the street names "Eden" and "Methyl-J".

## Use and effects

MBDB was first synthesized by pharmacologist and medicinal chemist David E. Nichols and later tested by Alexander Shulgin and described in his book, PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story. MBDB's dose, according to PiHKAL, is 180 to 210 mg; the proper dosage relative to body mass seems unknown. Its duration is 4 to 6 hours, with noticeable after-effects lasting for 1 to 3 hours.
MBDB was initially developed as a non-psychedelic entactogen. It has lower effects on the dopamine system in comparison to other entactogens such as MDMA. MBDB causes many mild, MDMA-like effects, in particular the lowering of social barriers and inhibitions, pronounced sense of empathy and compassion, and mild euphoria, all of which are present. MBDB tends to produce less euphoria, psychedelia, and stimulation in comparison to MDMA.
Clinical studies have found that MBDB produces similar entactogenic effects to MDMA, but lacks psychedelic and stimulant effects. It enhances mood similarly to MDMA, but lacks the pronounced euphoria of MDMA. MBDB produces prosocial effects similarly to MDMA, although it is said to be moderately less effective.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MBDB acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine releasing agent (SNRA). Its EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration values for induction of monoamine release are 540 nM for serotonin, 3,300 nM for norepinephrine (6.1-fold lower than for serotonin), and >100,000 for dopamine (>185-fold lower than for serotonin). However, it may still have slight dopamine-releasing actions. MBDB fully substitutes for MDMA in drug discrimination tests in rodents. It increases locomotor activity similarly to but less robustly than MDMA. Likewise, MBDB increases conditioned place preference (CPP) similarly but less efficaciously than MDMA. In contrast to MDMA, which produced hyperthermia, MBDB instead produced dose- and time-dependent hypothermia.
MBDB has similar affinities for the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors as MDMA. However, MBDB did not show the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, at any dose in rodents. In addition, MBDB (as well as MDMA) do not substitute for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in drug discrimination tests. The lack of apparent hallucinogenic effects with MBDB is analogous to the case of Ariadne, the α-ethyl homologue of DOM; (R)-Ariadne (BL-3912A) showed no psychedelic effects in humans at doses of up to 270 mg orally, whereas DOM is active as a hallucinogen at doses of 5 to 10 mg orally. This may be due to lower activational efficacy at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
MBDB is a serotonergic neurotoxin similarly to MDMA. However, MBDB appears to have reduced serotonergic neurotoxicity compared to MDMA at behaviorally equivalent doses. In addition, unlike MDMA, MBDB does not produce dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice.
MBDB and its individual enantiomers, (S)-MBDB and (R)-MBDB, show similar behavioral effects in animals.

### Pharmacokinetics

The metabolism of MBDB has been described in the scientific literature.

## Chemistry

MBDB is a ring substituted amphetamine and an analogue of MDMA. Like MDMA, it has a methylenedioxy substitution at the 3 and 4 position on the aromatic ring; this is perhaps the most distinctive feature that structurally define analogues of MDMA, in addition to their unique effects, and as a class they are often referred to as "entactogens" to differentiate between typical stimulant amphetamines that (as a general rule) are not ring substituted. MBDB differs from MDMA by having an ethyl group instead of a methyl group attached to the alpha carbon. Modification at the alpha carbon is uncommon for substituted amphetamines.

### Analogues

Analogues of MBDB (methyl-J) include BDB (J), EBDB (ethyl-J), BDP (K), MBDP (methyl-K), EBDP (ethyl-K), MPAP (PBDP; propyl-K), and UWA-101 (α-cyclopropyl-MDPEA), among others.

## History

MBDB was first described in the scientific literature by a group that included David E. Nichols, Robert A. Oberlender, Peyton Jacob III, and Alexander Shulgin in 1986.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

Unlike MDMA, MBDB is not internationally scheduled under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The thirty-second meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (September 2000) evaluated MBDB and recommended against scheduling. From the WHO Expert Committee assessment of MBDB: 

Although MBDB is both structurally and pharmacologically similar to MDMA, the limited available data indicate that its stimulant and euphoriant effects are less pronounced than those of MDMA. There have been no reports of adverse or toxic effects of MBDB in humans. Law enforcement data on illicit trafficking of MBDB in Europe suggest that its availability and abuse may now be declining after reaching a peak during the latter half of the 1990s. For these reasons, the Committee did not consider the abuse liability of MBDB would constitute a significant risk to public health, thereby warranting its placement under international control. Scheduling of MBDB was therefore not recommended.

#### Australia

MBDB is considered a Schedule 9 Prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

#### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market".

#### Russia

MBDB is included into  Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified MBDB as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Feb 25, 1999,  in their regulation SFS 1999:58 listed as "2-metylamino-1-(3,4-metylendioxifenyl)-butan (MBDB)", making it illegal to sell or possess.

## Research

MBDB is being assessed by PharmAla Biotech for potential medical use as a pharmaceutical drug, for instance to treat autism.
