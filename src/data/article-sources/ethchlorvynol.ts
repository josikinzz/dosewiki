## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ynones. These are organic compounds containing the ynone functional group, an alpha,beta unsaturated ketone group with the general structure  RC#C-C(=O)R' (R'  not H).

### Background

Ethchlorvynol is a sedative and hypnotic drug. It has been used to treat insomnia, but has been largely superseded and is only offered where an intolerance or allergy to other drugs exists.

### Indication

Used for short-term hypnotic therapy in the management of insomnia for periods of up to one week in duration; however, this medication generally has been replaced by other sedative-hypnotic agents.

### Pharmacodynamics

Ethchlorvynol is a sedative drug and schedule IV (USA) controlled substance. It produces cerebral depression, however the exact mechanism of action is not known.

### Mechanism of Action

GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator

### Absorption

Rapidly absorbed from gastrointestinal tract.

### Metabolism

About 90% of a dose is metabolized in the liver. Some ethchlorvynol may also be metabolized in the kidneys. Ethchlorvynol and metabolites undergo extensive enterohepatic recirculation.

### Half-life

Plasma half-life is approximately 10 to 20 hours, terminal half-life is 21-100 hours.

### Toxicity

Symptoms of overdose include thrombocytopenia.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Ethchlorvynol is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Acetazolamide
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Ethchlorvynol is combined with Acetazolamide.
Acetophenazine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Ethchlorvynol is combined with Acetophenazine.
Agomelatine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Ethchlorvynol is combined with Agomelatine.
Alfentanil
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Ethchlorvynol is combined with Alfentanil.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with food. Food reduces irritation.

### Mechanism of action

Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, ethchlorvynol appears to depress the central nervous system in a manner similar to that of barbiturates. Barbiturates bind at a distinct binding sites associated with a Cl
-
ionopore at the GABA
A
receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl
-
ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged.

### General Function

Beta subunit of the heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channel gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (PubMed:19763268, PubMed:27789573, PubMed:29950725, PubMed:8264558). GABA-gated chloride channels, also named GABA(A) receptors (GABAAR), consist of five subunits arranged around a central pore and contain GABA active binding site(s) located at the alpha and beta subunit interface(s) (PubMed:29950725). When activated by GABA, GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride anions across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (By similarity). Chloride influx into the postsynaptic neuron following GABAAR opening decreases the neuron ability to generate a new action potential, thereby reducing nerve transmission (By similarity). GABAARs containing alpha-1 and beta-2 or -3 subunits exhibit synaptogenic activity; the gamma-2 subunit being necessary but not sufficient to induce rapid synaptic contacts formation (PubMed:23909897, PubMed:25489750). Extrasynaptic beta-2 receptors contribute to the tonic GABAergic inhibition (By similarity). Beta-containing GABAARs can simultaneously bind GABA and histamine where histamine binds at the interface of two neighboring beta subunits, which may be involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness (By similarity)

  "wikipedia": `# Ethchlorvynol
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethchlorvynol*

Ethchlorvynol, sold under the brand name Placidyl, is a GABA receptor agonist and central nervous system depressant with anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotic developed by Pfizer in the 1950s. Originally identified in 1956 by research chemists at Abbott Laboratories in the United States, ethchlorvynol became FDA-approved drug The dosage form was always as a softgelcap, containing 200 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg. While the 500 mg and 750 mg strength capsules were for use in reducing sleep latency, the 200 mg strength capsules were intended to be used to re-induce sleep in case of early awakening. Abbott discontinued production in 1999 due to problems of the widespread abuse of the substance, and substances within benzodiazepine family (with drugs such as Librium and Valium); by the end of 2001, ethchlorvynol reserves had dried up in the United States.

## Uses

Ethchlorvynol was indicated to treat insomnia, and was widely prescribed in the 1960s and 1970s; prescriptions had fallen significantly by 1990, however, as other hypnotics that were considered safer and less dangerous in overdose became more common.

### Availability

Ethchlorvynol is no longer prescribed in the United States due to unavailability, but is still available in some countries, and would still be considered legal to possess and use with a valid prescription.

## Adverse effects

Along with expected sedative effects of relaxation and drowsiness, adverse reactions to ethchlorvynol include skin rash, faintness, restlessness, and euphoria. Early adjustment side effects may include nausea and vomiting, numbness, blurred vision, stomach pains, and temporary dizziness.
Occasional deaths would occur when addicted persons would try to inject the drug directly into a vein or an artery. Ethchlorvynol is not compatible with intravenous injection, and serious injury (including the loss of limbs due to vascular injury) or death can occur when it is used in this manner.

### Overdose

There are no specific antidotes available for ethchlorvynol, and treatment is supportive with protocols resembling those for the treatment of barbiturate overdose. Overdose may be marked by a variety of symptoms, including confusion, fever, peripheral numbness and weakness, reduced coordination and muscle control, slurred speech, reduced heartbeat, respiratory depression, and in extreme overdoses, coma and death.

### Withdrawal

Regular use of any GABAA receptor agonist can result in drug dependency and physical addiction; conversely, abrupt cessation of long-term of such substances can potentially cause lethal drug withdrawal effects resembling the effects of withdrawal from alcohol,  possible upon cessation, or barbiturate withdrawal, and the convulsions, hallucinations, and amnesia including convulsions, hallucinations, and amnesia. Placidyl is indicated for use in the treatment of insomnia for a short period of time, generally ranging from one week to one month. However, it was not uncommon for doctors to prescribe the medication for extended periods of time. In the late 1970s, ethchlorvynol was deemed responsible as one of the agents responsible for the death of Elvis Presley, and resulted in Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist as well as Steven Tyler of Aerosmith both being hospitalized for detox.

## Chemistry

Ethchlorvynol is a member of the class of sedative-hypnotic carbinols, which includes methylparafynol and tert-amyl alcohol. It is not a benzodiazepine, carbamate, or barbiturate, and its molecular structure is considerably simpler. The systematic name of ethchlorvynol is usually given as ethyl 2-chlorovinyl ethynyl carbinol or 1-chloro-3-ethylpent-1-en-4-yn-3-ol. Its empirical formula is C7H9ClO.
Ethchlorvynol is synthesized by an ethynylation reaction using lithium acetylide and 1-chloro-1-penten-3-one in liquid ammonia, followed by acidic work-up.

The analogous compound consisting of a carbamate derived from the hydroxy group was investigated and was shown to have a slower onset, longer duration, and increased potency, but was not developed commercially.
