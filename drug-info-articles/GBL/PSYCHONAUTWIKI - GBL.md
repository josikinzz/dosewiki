**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) or [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**gamma-Butyrolactone** (also known as **γ-butyrolactone** and commonly as **GBL** ) is a synthetic [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [lactone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lactone) chemical class that produces powerful [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) and [disinhibiting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) effects similar to that of alcohol intoxication. In humans it acts as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) , where 1ml is equivalent to 1.66 grams of the sodium salt of GHB (Sodium oxybate). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

GBL is a common solvent and reagent in chemistry and is also used as a flavoring, stain remover, wheel cleaner, superglue remover, paint stripper, and as a solvent in some wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It has also been found in some wine products, which suggests it may be a naturally occurring substance ( [see section below](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL#Natural_sources) ).

GBL, along with [1,4-butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-butanediol) , are known to dissolve most types of plastic over time. For this reason, it is recommended to only transport and store the drug using a glass container, standard gelatin capsules (not vegetarian), or high-density polyethylene plastic (also known as #2 recyclable plastic). To check the type of plastic used on a bottle, one can look at the bottom for a number in the triangle shaped recycling label. GBL reacts and breaks down various forms of plastic (including plastic lids) within seconds and will float to the bottom of a container while dissolved plastic moves up. It is currently unknown how far plastic can be broken down, but there may be serious consequences when ingesting microplastics. To avoid this, do not handle GBL at any stage with ordinary plastic, for example with plastic syringes or glass bottles with an ordinary plastic cap. The liquid should be perfectly clear and colorless.

GBL has reportedly been used as date rape drug (as a legal alternative to GHB), in which it is secretly put dropwise into drinks but there is little evidence to support it being widespread, especially compared to alcohol due to its strong taste. GBL and GHB are also referred to as "K.-o.-Tropfen" (K.-o.-drops) in German-speaking countries. Care should be taken when offered drinks from strangers.

## Chemistry

GBL (gamma-butyrolactone) is a cyclic ester of *gamma* -hydroxybutanoic acid. GBL can be synthesized from GHB through dehydration of the terminal hydroxy groups, forming a saturated lactone ring. Structurally, GBL is a five-membered ring with an oxygen substituent at R 1 , adjacent from the oxygen atom in the ring, forming a cyclic ester called a lactone.

Physically, it is a hygroscopic colorless oily liquid with a weak characteristic odor and is soluble in water.

GBL has been found in extracts from samples of unadulterated wines. This finding indicates that GBL is a naturally occurring component in some wines and may be present in similar products. The concentration detected was approximately 5 μg/mL and was easily observed using a simple extraction technique followed by GC/MS analysis.

It can also be found in cheese flavorings but typically results in a content of 0.0002% GBL in the final foodstuff.

Due to its chemical similarity, GBL can easily be converted into GHB by calendistine laboratories in a one-step synthesis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Pharmacology

GBL is presumably not active in its own right; its mechanism of action stems from its identity as a prodrug of [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) . Hoewever, GBL may display other effects on the body, unlike GHB, but it is currently not known. It is theorized to induce a state of metabolic acidosis, a significant medical condition, especially when used for longer periods of time.

It is rapidly converted into [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) by lactonase enzymes found in the blood. GBL is more lipophilic (fat soluble) than GHB, and so is absorbed faster and has higher bioavailability; paradoxically this can mean that GBL has a faster onset of effects than GHB itself, even though it is a prodrug.

The levels of lactonase enzyme can vary between individuals, meaning that first-time users can show unpredictable results, even from small doses. In many this manifests as slow onset of effects, followed by headaches, semi-consciousness which is distinct from GBL sleep in normal users. If the user decides to try again at a later date, they appear to be able to enjoy the effects normally. Because of these pharmacokinetic differences, GBL tends to be more potent and faster-acting than GHB, but has a shorter duration; whereas the related compound 1,4-butanediol (1,4-B) tends to be slightly less potent, slower to take effect but longer-acting than GHB.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

Reportedly, GBL is very similar to GHB. More muscle relaxing and less prone to give clonic muscle movements than GHB. Slightly longer acting, and has a more sedative feeling than GHB. May easily give gastrointestinal disturbances like nausea, diarrhoea and gas. Comment: It is not clear if ingesting butyrolactone is toxic or not. It is not cancerogenic as some sources say, but is probably not good for you. The taste is extremely disagreeable.
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - At lower dosages, GBL is physically stimulating, encouraging movement and wakefulness. At higher dosages, however, it becomes physically sedating, encouraging sleep and lethargy.
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - In cases of GBL overdoses, many report experiencing an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing, followed by a gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing called an apnea.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** - Muscle relaxation is reportedly more prevalent with GBL than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) and it is less prone to causing convulsions.
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** & **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Both numbing as well as enhancing tactile effects can be felt coincidingly.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect is more common than with [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) and may persist when GBL is used frequently.
- **[Stomach pain](/w/index.php?title=Stomach_pain&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Stomach discomfort or pain is more common with GBL than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) due to its properties as a mucous membrane irritant and/or solvent. The most effective way to reduce this is to dilute it with a large meal or drink.
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Neurotoxicity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity)** - GBL is metabolized into GHB, so it may also be linked with neurotoxicity. Lower dosages have been linked with higher degrees of neurotoxicity than high doses, although this claim can be debated.
- **[Skin flushing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Skin_flushing)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**

- - **[Visual noise](/w/index.php?title=Visual_noise&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Especially with extended use or during withdrawal, GBL greatly amplifies existing effects of visual noise for long periods of time, also including after images and tinnitus. This is presumably due to a state of excitation within the brain or metabolic acidosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This is far more prevalent with GBL than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) .
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**

- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)** - Geometry results along with visual noise, especially if the user has had experience with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) or has [HPPD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/HPPD) ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** & **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - At very low dosages, GBL can make one tired, while common doses are primarly wakefullness-promoting. High doses can lead to feelings of being extremely sleepy.
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - GBL is far more euphoric than [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , more akin to [Gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) .
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - Unlike [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) which merely increases sociability through [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , GBL presents strong [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects which are prominent and well defined although weaker than that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** or **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - Low to common doses are primarly stimulating and one finds themselves constantly generating thoughts.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Extended use of GBL can result in memory problems as well as forgetfulness and not being able to differentiate dreams from waking memories. 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Higher doses, especially when sleeping can lead to total amnesia.
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)** - Creativity enhancement is most apparent at low to common doses.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - This is somewhat prevalent due to its short duration.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - GBL can have a very pronounced effect on dream recall and vividness. Conversely, discontinuation can result in bad dreams or nightmares. Additionally, intoxication on GBL can lead to one seeing their own dream being manifested, similar to a [wake-induced lucid dream](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/WILD) (WILD) and simultaneous states of wakefulness and dreaming.
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)** & **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - As with other coinciding effects, common doses can lead to greater motivation whilst high doses generally result in lethargy.
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - This is a very pronounced and documented effect with GHB, when compared with most other depressants.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**

- - **[Tinnitus](/w/index.php?title=Tinnitus&action=edit&redlink=1)** - This is a distinct but significant ringing and/or buzzing in the ears which can sometimes persist for long amounts of time. It typically co-exists with visual noise during extended use or withdrawal. This is far more prevalent with GBL than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) .
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

GBL is not active in its own right; its mechanism of action stems from its identity as a prodrug of GHB, meaning that it is rapidly converted into GHB in the body.

GBL is not considered to be as safe as [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) used responsibly or medicinally, since it is theorized to display additional toxic effects on the body, unlike GHB. The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) is above the active dosage, and there is no danger of acute toxicity. However, it can become dangerous when used as a recreational drug or abused. There have been many negative reports from recreational users who have overdosed, combined GBL with alcohol or other drugs, or accidentally dosed themselves unexpectedly or way above the common dosage range.

To avoid a possible overdose of GBL, it is important to start with a low dose and work your way up slowly by increasing the dosage in small increments. One should best use a glass bottle with an integraded 1ml pipette to exactly measure their dosages.

Accidental ingestions of GBL have also occurred due to inadequate storage methods. If GBL is put into a clear liquid, glass, or bottle, it can be easily mistaken for water. It is recommended to clearly label your GBL in writing and dye the liquid with blue food coloring so it no longer resembles a drinkable beverage. It is also recommended to store your GBL in a container that no one would drink out of.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Neurotoxicity

GBL itself may also produce neurotoxic effects, in addition to the effects of [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) , to which it is converted to by the body.

In multiple studies, GHB has been found to impair spatial memory, working memory, learning and memory in rats with chronic administration. These effects are associated with decreased NMDA receptor expression in the cerebral cortex and possibly other areas as well.

One study found that repeated administration of GHB to rats for 15 days drastically reduced the number of neurons and non-neuronal cells within the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex. With once daily doses of 10 mg/kg of GHB, they were decreased by 61% in the hippocampus region and 32% in the prefrontal cortex, and with 100 mg/kg, they were decreased by 38% and 9%, respectively. This paper demonstrates contradicting effects on neuronal loss, with lower doses (10 mg/kg) producing the most neurotoxicity, and higher doses (100 mg/kg) producing less.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

GBL is possibly highly physically and moderately to highly psychologically addictive. The frequent use of GBL can cause withdrawal symptoms similar to those caused by other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) and [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) if abruptly discontinued, reportedly with a much faster onset and more severe symptoms when used frequently. Withdrawal effects from GBL build faster than with GHB. These symptoms seem to depend on the dosage and the length of time the drug was used for. Light to moderate users often experience anxiety, insomnia, sleep-related problems, and tremors whereas heavy use can cause severe withdrawal symptoms like delirium, psychosis, and hallucinations, which some anecdotal reports suggesting the effects to be more severe than other depressants.

GHB, when used medicinally (two medicinal doses per day, four hours apart), creates little to no dependance while the more frequent one uses GHB, it causes exponentially more dependance and withdrawal symptoms. It is though that GBL also shares this trait, although there is no medicinal dose for GBL that is safe.

Although there have been reported fatalities due to GHB/GBL withdrawal, reports are inconclusive and further research is needed.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within several days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few days or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction to minimize neurotoxicity from withdrawal. It is proposed that GHB and especially GBL can lead to dependence at a significantly faster rate than longer-acting depressants.

GBL presents cross-tolerance with [1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) and [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) , since GBL and 1,4-Butanediol act as [prodrugs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for GHB. Cross-tolerance with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) , [baclofen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Baclofen) and other GABA B -agonists is likely.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Nitrous** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely.
- **Amphetamines** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the sedative may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **MDMA** - Large amounts of GHB/GBL may overwhelm the effects of MDMA on the comedown.
- **Cocaine** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the sedative may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Ketamine** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MXE** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **DXM** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position. This combination is hard to predict.
- **PCP** - Details of this combination are not well understood but PCP generally interacts in an unpredictable manner.
- **Alcohol** - Even in very low doses this combination rapidly leads to memory loss, severe ataxia and unconsciousness. There is a high risk of vomit aspiration while unconscious.
- **Opioids** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.
- **Tramadol** - The sedative effects of this combination can lead to dangerous respiratory depression.
- **Benzodiazepines** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.
