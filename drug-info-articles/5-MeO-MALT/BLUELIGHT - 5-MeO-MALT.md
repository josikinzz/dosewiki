**Welcome to the Big & Dandy 5-MeO-MALT Thread**


![5-meo-malt_zps61272cbf.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi127.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fp145%2Fkazmon%2F5-meo-malt_zps61272cbf.jpg&hash=e1b6fa6add047ab278f6069d51156173)


Saw this one pop up from at a pretty respectable inventory recently, have read very short tid bits mentioning it in some articles but otherwise I can't seem to find any information about it. (Maybe I need to learn to UTSE but I cant find anything.)


Lists the IUPAC as **N-methyl-(2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)prop-2-en-1-amine**, searching this doesn't give much either, Also, it is the oxalate salt - which makes me wonder too, would oxalic acid, which is quite toxic and causes things such as kidney stones among other things, end up in vivo if one were to use this?


Any information is appreciated!

I would be worried about it being a oxalate as well..

So, analogous to a HCL salt compound releasing HCL as a byproduct (wish I knew more about biochem but working on it...), do you believe that this would release Oxalic Acid as a by product on consumption?

I saw it as well. Too bad it's not the non-methoxy version, MALT, I would be 10 times more interested in that one. 


I asume this is the structure?

HCl-Salts dont form HCl.

But oxalates should turn into oxalic acid in the stomach.

Some vegetables contain oxalic acid. So it propably doesnt do any damage if you ingest normal amounts of the Tryptamine.

I guess it would help to see some numbers. A quick gloogle suggests that it is not at all uncommon for a vegetable to contain 100 mg oxalic acid per 100 g veggy. It is healthy to eat 200 g of vegetables per day which would contain 200 mg oxalic acid each time. So an extra dosage/portion of some hundreds of milligrams of oxalate with your tryptamine would just be similar to that, seems fine to me especially when it is ingested incidentally.

What Sol said.....Oxalic acid is in a lot of things, and only becomes a problem with very  large amounts or chronic use of large amounts. I find it quite tasty....zingy. I wouldn't worry about it.

I remember reading somewhere that this is a recent Shulgin chemical that he synthesized with his assistant.. I think it said activity was starting around the 1-3mg mark which is in line with other 5-Methoxy tryptamines. 


Certainly something I'm extremely interested in.

I wonder if Shulgin purposely divulged 5-MeO-DALT with his own endorsement to send the RC community on a wild goose chase and is doing it again with 5-MeO-MALT. 5-MeO-DALT by virtually all accounts was a dud yet Shulgin had called it a gem. I hope 5-MeO-MALT doesn't turn out the same way. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Its not a remarkable substance and has a dark streak to it like most methoxylated tryptamines. It isn't exactly the most pleasant experience. I found it to be more anxiogenic than anything else and I'm not alone in that thinking. In my mind, that's enough to call it a dud.

15 mg was administered in capsules, later 25 mg nasally

Age.:20 +

Translated report from a Swedish forum:

"Male, 75kg 


Time: About 3 h.


Description: Very intensive and strong experience down, what I choose to call the MALT-hole. CEV and OEV:s were intensely colored, and very interesting. There was a presence of mindfuck re: perspective on time/space... one minute cold last forever, while next went with the speed of light.


Blood/heart pressure remained stable, not over 185/87, heartrate was at 115bpm during the three hour trip.


About the MALT-hole: Any conception of time and space disappeared, egoloss, and as I reached the bottom of the MALT-hole I didn't know who or what I - was I human, did i exist in this reality of beautiful CEV/OEV around me?


There was no panic or anxiety for the duration of the MALT-hole, but rather a mystical calm and mysterious harmony which enfolded me. This was a level 5, and that's why I call it the 5-meo-malt hole."

Sounds interesting although it appears it still has that tachycardic edge.


5-MeO-AMT didn't even give me a resting of 115 unless I way overdosed (we're talking over 20mg) so that's a huge red flag for me right there and the kiss of death for this substance if others report it.


I wonder how much the nasal dosing affected the heart rate. 185/87 BP isn't ideal either although I don't know the baseline BP for this person.


Sounds like it has a toxic streak like its DALT cousin.

He seems to maybe have started a little high, but the intensity at that dose sheds light on what lower doses could yield.


This is a spitting image of my experiences with insufflating too much 5-MeO-aMT, right down to experiencing a "hole" of sorts filled with fantastic imagery but with a much shorter duration. Which is appealing, considering the 5-MeO-aMT tends to last around 20 hours total and being such a stimulating compound it can be heavy on the body. 


I would bet insufflating between 5-20mg would be more manageable visually and would not affect the cardiovascular system so noticeably. I found minimizing my dose with 5-Meo-aMT made it much more rewarding, less chaotic and nearly negated any toxic response. I feel like this MALT could have similar quality and I'd love to taste it!

I agree, 5-meo-dalt was most definately a dud for me but does have it's followers so it's not really fair to call it a dud in general.

Plain old aMT has given me a resting rate of around 110-115 BPM towards the end of the trip but I'm rather sensitive to tachycardia, not to mention my rather poor diet lately so the HR issue can be pretty damn variable person to person. For all we know the tester was some 300lb kid who plays warcraft all day lol. If the substance has worth than elevated BP shouldn't be a deal breaker but IMO this chem sounds like another typical 5-meo with a high bodyload in which I think I will pass. Tbh I doubt I will ever find a 5-meo that will catch my interest. Also congrats on becoming a mod MK777, may you use your power wisely ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


@Bob_Arctor Do you know how long this person (assuming this isn't your report) waited before redosing and how effective it was? 3 hours seems rather short lived for two doses. Also intense visuals and no anxiety/paranoia from a 5-meo sounds a little out of character but I'll be honest and admit my experience with 5-subs is pretty lacking because of their tendency to cause a nasty bodyload that hijacks the trip.

Maybe AMT is just something that I don't get anxiety from much like pure MDMA. I suppose with it being such a potent triple releasing agent that it is very well possible my heart rate was elevated and I was just too euphoric to care. I highly doubt it put me over 110 though because I always feel it throughout my body no matter the substance (I notice it when I'm sober) if I pass 110. I'm prone to tachycardia as well ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


I know 5-MeO-DALT has its followers but at the same time, the people who have had their 5-MeO-DALT tested reported it was crap. I had to off-white sparkly shit that was supposedly amazing and was less than thrilled.


Time will tell how this one pans out but I think I'm with you Captain in that I believe I will pass. And thanks, I don't know why I never applied for mod before ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

How on earth were you able to tolerate insufflated 5-MeO-aMT? I tried it that way twice before I learned my lesson and stuck to high oral doses.

I've never had a problem, it produces no discomfort whatsoever in the nose. It's effect on the GI system makes me not want to throw it right in my guts anyway, I'd rather sniff a few milligrams. It still takes about an hour and some minutes to come on. What differences did you notice? that aside, it seems like there's virtually no other information on the 5-MeO-MALT other than it's a shulgin compound and aforementioned report. Trail runs dry.

The biggest issue was increased stimulation. It was a lot more like smoking it in that it felt like psychedelic speed as opposed to a speedy psychedelic. I'm not really much of one for stimulants outside of empathogens though and never have been too interested in them so maybe that's why. Smoked or snorted 5-MeO-aMT seemed to lack the euphoria and almost dreamy sedated yet physically stimulated quality that oral doses had and had a pure edgy strong stimulation all the way around. I certainly got far more paranoid.


I share some interest in hearing about 5-MeO-MALT but I honestly would be more interested in the non-methoxylated version.

I have had some experience with this chem and am actually mostly the reason it came into existence thanks to a favor from a Chinese supplier I have a huge history with! I havealways thought it would be a gem in my dreams, seriously haha but anyways since this thread exists now I will do a live  TRtonight I havealready taken it to 9mg with lil activity so I will be looking for an active dose tonight to give you guys something to read on it, btw its a slightly off white red tint powder (was bleach white when I received it) I was sent the mass spec ans nmr but I dont know how to post photos on a mobile device..

I'd suggest you write your trip report into a text file and save periodically when adding to it. Live reports are frowned upon if I remember correctly, it also means you have more time to format it and fix it up (rather than posting in an influenced state) before posting.

oh I didn't knowthat well I will format my experience into aclear report and post, because it was rather interesting. reminded me alot of 5-meo-mipt as far as its mental clarity and near complete lackof visuals on lower doses, and a touch ofexcitement and speedyness like what I feel people are describing when refering to 5-meo-dalt trip reports and to comment on the "MALT-hole" TR are you sure you have the same material this thread is on because, unless it acts as a totally different drug nasally, I couldn't see experiencing any type of hole at that dose and I'm 110Lbs soaking wet.. the only supplier that offers it didn't publicly list it on their site as available til this last week when the mass spec and everything came back. clean, and shipping takes quite whilr this time of year from those parts of the world.

ok so I won't have time to do a full write up, but I can without a doubt say that 5-meo-malt is most definitely active nasally.! 2x 5mg bumbs up the nose gave m a distinct +1 maybe +2 lasted 2-4hours for the mist part and was extremely energetic, very entactogenic for a tryptamine imo

I took too much DALT once, I'll admit it's not amazing but there are definitely effects there. The time I went overboard ended with me puking in the bathroom whole the room waved around me.


We can get better stuff though, aMT for example.

There is some additional info from the same user, but she/he does not really add much of importance except for emphasizing his/her enthusiasm for the substance in question:

"In addition I'd also like to add that I don't recommend intranasal administration of 5-MEO-MALT because of the burning sensation. However, to each his own, and I chose to go this route" [...] "effects start to kick in much faster this way, the burn is x2 of that you'd get from snorting 4-Me-MAPB." [...] "start low and slowly increase your dosage, because the effects of 5-MEO-MALT are powerful and intense. In my research I haven't felt any tolerance issues in relation to the substance and its effects".

Yes it is but he was rather cautious about calling it 5 meo MALT. Sounds more like a fucking milk shake. I think his fear was the ambiguity of these names for substances and with the RC market... he was right! If it's anything like 5 meo-dipt/mipt I'll be going nowhere near it.

It was talked about in the movie about the Shulgins "Dirty Pictures" (good documentary btw).  He was on camera talking about it in the lab with the assistant.

Do you have any source for this purported dosage? The one trip report I've seen (posted in this thread and elsewhere) seems to go far beyond 1-3mg, but there is not much information to be ascertained such as previous experience, tolerance, etc. and it almost sounds like the experience was overwhelming - though I have no idea why one would start with such relatively high doses in the first place.


Obviously one would want to do an allergy test and titrate up slowly from there, but would anyone who has tried this one be able to give a more precise estimate for threshold, low, common, strong, etc. dosages? I'm mostly curious if the doses would be more akin to 5-MeO-DALT or other 5-substituted tryptamines such as 5-MeO-MIPT or even 5-MeO-DIPT.

Hello guys sorry for my absence I have meant to post some detailed information but felt the bulk of my trials didn't deserve a write up yet... til recently! it has definitely proven to be similar to 5-meo-dalt from what I read I don't find much correlation with 5-meo-mipt tho and I have personally tried that.  My method was oral and or nasal found the nasal to be more effective but I am still not sure whether it was more pleasant. .. I can certainly say it takes at least 4-6mg oral 3-5mg nasal to notice basic effects I would recommend (after allergy testing and titration) a single oral dose of 10-20mg depending on weight to achieve a basic +\++  I would be wrong to comment further on higher doses as I don't have any experience with anything above 12mg yet but I am going to do another oral dose tomorrow of 18mg to hopefully get into a ++\+++  and see what it has to offer visual wise.

Been using 5 meo dalt for a year now and love it for what it is....a mild midweek great fun short lived trip which feel like ecstsy light.


25mg is nice for me but ive tried it up to 60mg which started to get tripper than I wanted.


Lovely stuff!

Going to share here as well as my usual forum because info is thin on the ground and information is power, right?


> After a preliminary, sub 1-mg allergy test 4 days ago decided to give 5-MeO-MALT a try. Based on loose information from a few fellow testers and a badly translated thread on a swedish forum, I jumped in at 10mg vaped (start LOWER!). I think I assumed that after vaping 5-MeO-DALT (20mg for a sort of headrush) and 4-AcO-DALT (40mg gave me some minor visuals and psych headspace for an hour or so) that this would be much the same.... wrong.

Basically about 5 minutes of acid-like visuals, some body load and a little confusion.


I haven't done a lot of psychedelics lately so what's intense for me may be mild to others, but either way there's a lot more to this compound than there is to the DALTs. Caution (but also cautious optimism) advised.

maybe in part but many liked it and I doubt it was just Brits; the UK is covered in psilocybin. 5DALT wasn't high ranking material so I am not going to defend it too much but if you like a short easy to handle thing it suited for some situations. There are other tryptamines that are available outside the UK that are no better frankly IMO but each to there own.

I think this is gonna be banned in the UK by the way, not only was 5-MeO-DALT listed explicitly but they are now going to prohibit alkylene substituted tryptamines which means that the AL (allyl) containing ones including the MALTs, EALTs, PALTs, iPALTs etc are not in legal loopholes anymore. Sorry guys.

I wanted to get my feet wet, thinking the insufflated dose was somewhere around 20mg from what some reports have stated. Insufflated 10mg, and it is extremely active. Unlike some psychedelics, it does not provide any easing mental support or warm blanket feel to perpetuate you into the environmental changes and skewing of the psyche. Now that I'm there, I do not feel anxious or anything, so don't take that the wrong way. I got some 5-MeO-MaLT on a whim, thinking it might not have gotten adequate attention. I was right. Sorry for no detailed report, but I just wanted to say that this is indeed very active in small insufflated doses, and shouldn't be written off. If you want to insufflate 20mg, without lots of cross tolerance or having any experience with this substance, be prepared to get lost.


I think this is will really shine as a combo though, with something that provides that blanket so your comfortable with where the MaLT is taking you. I have some 5-MAPB and will try that out. (Tonight maybe?)

Haven't posted in a long time. I have some 5-MeO-MALT on the way from a very reputable vendor. Trying to get up to speed on what I'm dealing with and doesn't seem to be much info available. I'm not a very wordy long winded person but I'll post general thoughts, effects and comparisons to other substances to help put some recent info out about this substance within a week.


I have a general idea of what to expect.

You know I am very glad this is starting to get some attention after suggesting its creation along with 5-meo-nipt to my overseas suppliers a while ago it seemed no one wanted anything to do with either of them and to my surprise they both turned out to be absolutely astonishing. 5-meo-malt is so euphoric it can for me substitute for MDX as far as its tactile and aphrodisiac qualities. And actually leave it and 2c-b in the dust. Also 5-meo-nipt has still to this day been the only compound to make me have a complete ++++ with clear as day hallucinations that were not actually present in the room. Or were they?... Anyways stop talking about these chemicals from a skewed pharmacological stand point cuz in this line of work your only expectations should be to be surprised at every turn. Dyou know how many people told me 5-meo-nipt would be an inactive useless  metabolite ? Too many and to them I say bah humbug where is your proof and have you eaten it yourself? No. Well then that is why you are over there and I am over here high trippy and happy as hell using the same gram of each compound that I have from 2 years ago!

Loaded approximately 25±10mg in vaporizer chamber with a small amount of weed and mullein as filler... by the 4th hit, the reality was evaporating very much like with 5-MeO-DMT. Managed to inhale one more hit and that brought on a ++++ that lasted for somewhere around 15 minutes (as with 5-MeO-DMT), with the comedown lasting about an hour. I'd call 5-MeO-MALT a lighter version of 5-MeO-DMT, but more visual and significantly less "disintegrative". It's not very similar to 5-MeO-MIPT. Will try nasal ROA next time, and then oral if enough material remains.


Would recommend if 5-MeO-DMT is not available.

5 meo malt success

Hey guys ! So ive had some 5 meo malt for a few months but circumstances havent permitted adequate testing time. So i gave 500mg to 2 friends A and B. A is more of a irresponsable person in nature doesnt know much about drugs. B is my best friend very experienced in ALL psychs.i told both to take 8-15mg orally than move up if needed. Well several trials snorted and oral in large doeses 20-70mg were prettyy dull and didnt do much. They told me it was a dud....fuck ! Well B was bored and smoked 10mg and he said it was akin to 5 meo dmt or dmt but of course its is own beast. . From what i witnessed 10-20mg is the doses he wa smoking. Although i own and use a scale we were just putting knife tips on foil bc its not super potent. Well the effects over 4 trials i witnessed lasted 30-60min . The first 5 min after you exhale. The world just melts aroud you and are experience ego death. My fiend loves it. He was saying its so close to dmt he couldn't really describe the differences and we have tried very tryptamine rc available for the past 10 years so he know whats up. ANYWAY ive been looking for info on malt forever and there isnt much. So i figured id share... so IME its pretty much a dud snorted and orally and is great smoked ! Any other experiences !


Also i have 5 meo malt oaxalate or something like that not sure on spelling. Which may be reason for low oral and snorted activity dont know much about oaxalates (sp?) Its from a major.chinese.vendor i assume most have this..


Also also lol my friend B gave some to 2 other people both very experienced and both liked it. He said one guy couldn't stop thanking him as he left.....

I just notced the big dandy is bumpes up feel free to merge....

No reason to use to it more than just a few times (say 100mg) for experience sake. It's a rare/unknown RC attached to oxalic acid (oxalate)... 5-MeO-DMT is tried and tested and a much stronger entheogen.

Hey ! My friends that tried it anyway but oral says its weak and unexciting. Now smoked is a diff. Story...my friends really likes moxy and tried this and loves it now. He says its like dmts lil  bro more so than 5 meo dmt. It just doesnt take u too "that" dmt place. He loves the visuals and said it gives ego loss also. Not fully tho. Ill b testing this weekend. We are planning  mdma + 2cb or 2ct2 and then smoking a moxy malt combo on peak. O yea i recomended he smoke moxy with malt. 10mg of each. Until then he would only take moxy orally like i told him to. He texted me " ill nver forget the day i smoked moxy " he will only smoke it now. I call it a M&M or taking M&Ms lol but yea malt really adds where the moxy is lacking in visuals and mindfuck. Good combo im told....

Hey Toltec. Nice to see you posting more often. Moxy is 5 Meo Mipt. Because 5 meo Dipt was known as Foxy first when 5 meo Mipt came out people naturally started calling it Moxy.

How is the body buzz on this compound compared to 5-MeO-DMT? Couldn't really enjoy tripping on 5-MeO-DMT because I had to puke and a strong feeling of beeing smashed in the chest. Had no problems with 5-MeO-DALT, but also less effects.

I'm very glad to hear this one sounds like a winner ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Will possibly be the next thing I get to add to my currently boring but about to get more interesting stash.

The comparison to 5-Meo-DMT really piqued my interest. I've wanted to try that one for so long, maybe I can get something of that nature from 5-Meo-MALT. In any case, it sounds like it should be fun just so long as you dose high enough (but I'll start low). I guess I will probably have something to report here in another couple of months ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Last time I read, it seemed everyone expected this to be a dud and if it were more like 5-Meo-DALT, I would not have any interest in it.

took 20mg around 3 hours ago feel barely stimulated, no head high, no visuals, not even close to 5-meo-mipt. I had taken benzos and kratom earlier in the day and ate a fairly large dinner, that may have had some effect, but at 20mg I would say that dosage is barely threshold, and i have no tryptamine nor phenethylamine tolerance whatsoever. maybe ill feel more effects in the next hour or 2 but otherwise i would say 20mg dosage is a complete dud, not even worth having gotten them for free ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) hehe. im very surprised about hearing that 20mg is a large dose, i was expecting a trip similar in strength to about 7mg of 5meo-mipt, but not even, more like 1mg if even that...i had high hopes for this one too, but ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) dissapointed. the vendor i got it from does GC/MS testing on all his chems too so it was definitely 5-meo-malt. I'll chalk it up to the benzos and large dinner I ate but other than that I wouldn't ever try this one again unless it was given (again) for free to me...


edit: i'll add that the effects are so mild they could be completely placebo, it may have no activity at all.

Dissolved about 15mg 5-meo-malt (assuming oxalate, but  I don't actually know. It is a slightly clumpy tan powder) into 5ml room temperature water and plugged using oral syringe.  I fear I lost some, this was my first time attempting this ROA. (I chose this method due to having what I suspect is a sinus infection and thus blocked passages, and also because I hadn't read anything about others attempting plugging this substance) I was worried I wouldn't trip at all, but this seems silly in retrospect.


I put on The Nightmare Before Christmas and within ten minutes of administration I knew something was happening. At about fifteen minutes I got this intense warm fuzzy body high, mostly centered in the chest and belly. This lasted maybe another fifteen minutes before fading gradually. I marked this period as the peak, other effects seemed not to wax and wane along with the body high. There was some slight nausea but this could possibly be attributed to the meal I had just eaten. I felt some tension in the jaw that I suspect could develop into bruxism at a higher dose. 


All the while, I had been getting sucked into the film, an engagement I rarely feel anymore. This seemed to be good for emotional enhancement, especially prominent when watching an episode of Mushi-shi after the movie. There was much warping and twisting in my peripheral vision as I watched the television, yet even when looking away from it the distortions remained only peripheral. I noticed this as well with nasal administration at 10mg. 


My usual visual static was more colorful and patterned, but I had to look for it. After the movie finished I spent a couple minutes in front of a very colorful and detailed mandala tapestry, simply letting my vision focus on the center and watching the pattern morph and rearrange itself into a Nautilus spiral, with colorful energy coursing along the pathways. Curiously, I even felt some difficulty breaking away from it, feeling slightly dazed for a moment.


I enjoyed this experience very much and am planning on trying again tomorrow or later in the week with a higher dose.


Edit: I am posting this at about 2:45 after administration. I feel mostly at baseline mentally, but there are some slight residual visual effects, but I have to look for them.

Is there any reason to suspect that taking syrian rue first would be either dangerous or worthwhile with this stuff? I find the duration to be rather too short and I happen to have rue but I don't want to do anything stupid.

I am glad you asked. This is how harm reduction sites keep drug users healthy. You should start with extremely low doses and slowly increase the dose. This is the normal responsible procedure with your first experience using any drugs and drug combinations. Others have observed [combining the similarly structured drug 5-MeO-DMT with MAOIs resulted in potentiation](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_5MeODMT.shtml). The link is from Erowid, they have multiple experience reports there.

This is a long-quiet thread and probably a long-disappeared substance but I thought I would add back in....


5-MeO-MALT was 5-6 times more potent than 5-MeO-DALT in my experience and that of a few friends. For me it had some real OEV when vaped which DALT lacked. Shame it got banned so fast. I have not tried all that many tryptamines but it had a lot of what I was looking for in a tryptamine- fast-on, fast-off again, visual and relatively lightweight/fun.


15mg was ++ but no further, I hope this one gets added to the annals of interesting chemicals in this family.

It seems like there are chemists who can and who cant synth it. I got some from Eastern-Eu vendor and this chem does nothing for me, tried 20-30mg orally severl times.

I would be delighted if it were like 4-aco-dmt as someone earlier said in this thread.

Where in this thread did someone say that? I can't find that claim anywhere, and I don't believe I've ever heard anyone say that about 5-MeO-MALT anywhere else either.


I have heard people say things like "DMT lite", but only when using it through vaporization, or sometimes insufflation. From what I've heard, oral dosing is largely ineffective.

Just got a small sample of 5-Meo-MALT oxalate, seems to be something right up my alley, is this vapeable or will insufflation help me better? Dose information is a bit scarce on this one, so anything would be nice.

Trying a 10mg bump tonight, though may go a bit deeper if I want to. Really interested in the vaping route, does anyone have any experience vaping oxalates or should I turn it in to a freebase? Don't have a lot of material but wanna experiment with what I have, might be a keeper.

I vaporized 10mg of malt and experienced complete ego death, I forgot everything etc. I only took one hit and held it for as long as I could. I was incapable of taking another hit because I had already completely lost my grip on reality. There was probably 30-40% of vapor I never inhaled. This was very similar to my ego loss (don't think it was quite death) on 300ug of LSD where I saw and touched the white light. I looked for the white light on malt, and could almost feel its presence but never found it. It was almost fully back in reality after 3hrs, but I wasn't able to sleep that night, kept losing my grip on reality while I layer in bed. By far most profound and life changing that I've had on a phsychedlic. Don't know why it had such a strong effect on me at such a low dose, but you should start smaller than 10mg if you plan to vaporize unless you want to get vaporized.

Was this 5 meo malt or just malt freebase if it is just malt freebase please either start a new thead or erite a trip report. I have heard great things about 5 meo malt smoked and how its simlar to dmt so n-malt sounds even better.

You said it lasted 3 hours is that much longer than dmt?

This stuff sounds great (not just from this recent mention of what may or may not be the 5-MeO, but also from every other report I've read of it).  Interestingly and significantly different from 5-MeO-DALT.

Well I would have thought it odd if it were very like 5MeO-DALT; that's one of the most sensual psyches - 5MeO-MALT I would say is the same or less potent orally - not nice as far as I took it where as 5MeO-DALT very pleasant if your not after any depth; vaping 5MeO-MALT 10mg or is plenty in my book - 1000mph rocket fuel

Would the tolerance to 5-meo-malt be similar to DMT when smoked, or would it be comparable to other tryptamines?

I do not think it would effect dmt tolerance. I would guess that it would effect other tryptamines like lsd. After breaking through on dmt, I can say that these experiences are not very alike. The only similarity between the two is ego death and massive consciousness expansion. 5-meo-malt offers a quick 4 hour ego death similar to other tryptamines. Dmt is ego death with other dimensions.

Have you tried snorting it MrJoldman?

Have you tried 5-MeO-DMT? How does it compare if so?

I have not tried snorting it. However I do microdose with it occasionally. It is probably my favorite phsychedlic to microdose. At low doses, 5-10mg subliminally, it provides a nice functional euphoria and body high. I have not used 5-meo-dmt (it's on the bucket list) but from what I have read it doesn't seem very similar. 5-meo-malt unlike 5-meo-dmt has obvious visuals. There is something special about malt though. I believe I experienced the logos flowing from things which Terrence McKenna spoke about. I have only experienced this one other time for about 10mins on a DOM trip. Sorry for rambling haha

I just got some 5-MeO-MALT. I vaporized about 4mg in a freebase pipe and it had me tripping pretty hard. My experience was pretty much in line with other people's reports. It feels a lot like 5-MeO-DMT, but maybe slightly less intense, more comfortable physically, and more visual.


I have also tried MALT before, and I can see the similarity. However, I would describe 5-MeO-MALT as being primarily a 5-MeO-DMT type trip, but with a floaty, detached quality reminiscent of MALT.


I think the 5-MeO tryptamines are not for me, but I did find 5-MeO-MALT to be pretty interesting. If you enjoy 5-MeO-DMT, this one is definitely worth trying.


BTW, it's crazy how much this stuff smells like grape flavored candy.

4mg made you trip hard?


The concentrations that I have to vaporize in the e-cig are 75mg/ml of 5-Meo-Malt. I do not know how to measure the dose of each puff so I'll have to be very careful. It is really powerful.


By the way, what has been the duration?

Spot on description, cj187.


In retrospect me starting with 20mg was not the smartest idea but it sure was a fun time, anyways. I wouldn't be surprised if there was the potential for toxicity from serotonergic overstimulation because of the raw emotion amplifying power of this drug. But really, do we know if we are actually experiencing intense emotion physically? Or is our conscious perception of it just distorted? Is there a limit to emotion, where the neuron burns out? Or maybe it is capped by some physical limits like wavelength reaching Planck's constant.


On reddit fractal-fruit described the visuals as oily and I think that description fits perfectly. It was a bit too intense for me to recall the visual effects during the peak but initially everything looked like it had become slick with oil, shortly after digitizing into voxels.


I didn't write down the duration for some reason, but I think it would be not more than an hour to baseline (with a rather extreme afterglow...)

I don't know exactly how much I smoked, but I weighed out 10mg and it looked like more than half was left afterwards. I was tripping fairly hard, but not to the point of leaving reality or anything like that. The main effects were about an hour but I experienced some residual stimulation for quite a while afterwards. I think it was 5 or 6 hours later that I was able to sleep.

This are good news.


In a Swedish forum they commented that the duration for vaporized 5-meo-malt was similar to DMT. It seems that there are different versions about this.

A week ago I insufflated 5mg of 5-meo-malt hcl.


I have been a bluelight lurker for many years, and know others will find this to be valuable new information, so that's why I finally joined to share this.


On tripsit, insufflated is listed as:

5-10 light

10-20 common

20+ strong


But as far as I can see on what has been reported in this thread, I believe that's most likely based on the freebase and/or oxalate.

The dosage listed could be correct, but judging by what I experienced I have a feeling it might possibly be a bit more potent.


I went in thinking I would experience light bodily effects, and nothing visual.

But I was very pleasantly surprised, as I got a good amount of visuals, creeping and crawling, enough to believe 10mg may very well be pretty strong.

Slight bodily tension in legs and neck was present, like one can experience with phenethylamines, or dare I say 5-meo-mipt, but didn't notice much else.

Music was really immersive, can't imagine what it's like on a higher dosage, guess I'll have to find out.


I was peaking in half an hour, visuals were gone in one and a half, with bodily sensations lingering on for a bit longer.

Felt really good and revitalized, if the bodily effects don't dominate like they supposedly do on 5-meo-dmt (scared to try it) then I'm sure this one is going to be perfect for me.


I felt a tiny bit of pressure in my nose during the come up, and a miniscule amount of drip, so the route of administration, at least at this dosage, was perfect.


Next time (maybe tomorrow) I'm going for 10mg insufflated, and see where that leads me (With no tolerance of any kind).

Nice! I hear good things. I tried vaping a little bit once and I got major body tension, so I figured it wasn't for me.

You can eat it, but generally yeah you can turn it into freebase.  Don't see why baking soda wouldn't be basic enough to do it, but I can't confirm for sure.

Just logged in after a while since I saw this was available and check if a lot of people were talking about it. Don't sleep on this one, I once got this as a free sample since no one was buying it at the time and so far my most ridiculous experience has been on a combination of this and 3-MeO-PCE and 5-MeO-MiPT. I cannot really explain and it's been far too long, but just the fact that I come back after all these years just to share this should tell you something ![:laughing:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/data/assets/smilies/2C4ABD00-8F23-449C-92AE-671EF6317C80.gif) One of my favorite experiences ever, though it was a bit much at the time because I was out partying lol. I must insist though that this combination is **not** recommended, given the potential for serotonin syndrome but I was dissociated and did not care about any harm to myself at the time. Dodget a bullet there.


But this material even on it's own does very unique things, like not time dilation but things actually moving in slow motion, heavy trailing, glowing/breathing effect. It's also a very colorful substance, good body high too but tension does indeed occur. Insane CEVs at higher dosages. I do not remember my exact dosages but I didn't need a lot for sure. Also don't remember what salt it was, so maybe my info wouldn't be relevant anyway. At any rate, this is IME a top tier substance and I've been looking for it ever since my few experiences with it. I've definitely purchased some again and will compare to my memories if it's even remotely as good. I must say 5-subs favor me well, so ymmv of course.


Also can confirm oral is very much a viable ROA and my preferred method for all 5-subs that are active in this way. Though 5-MeO-DMT through the nose is a thing of beauty, but given the tension and cramps you can get with 5-MeO-MALT I'm more wary trying it that way. Same goes for most other 5-subs, which I do like a lot.


EDIT: The info I was missing was right in the thread one page back, it was oxalate. Apparently I did insufflate 10mg? Well I definitely remember doing it oral and it being potent too. And the weird bitter/sour taste, though that could have been the drip. At least it was a keeper but I never reported back on that either. Ugh, should've kept some notes since it's a pretty obscure material and Shulgin himself was interested in developing the MALT line further than he had I've heard, so there's definitely something there. The reason my memories fail me and I never reported must be because I was blasted away in awe of my experiences and needed some time to recover.

As promised, a day ago I went in using 10mg of 5-meo-malt hcl nasally without any tolerance for reliable results (last was my experience with 5mg).


15 minutes in I noticed my heart rate was starting to increase, and the visuals where building pretty fast, fast enough to get the feeling I might have just dosed way too high.

Ultimately this didn't prove to be the case, although my heartrate did climb to a, at the time, uncomfortably high of 127, while laying in bed!


Does anybody have experience with this?

It was my second time using a HR monitor, the first was during the 5.

So don't know if psychdelics usually increases your heart rate like that, maybe being aware of my heart rate made me notice it..?


I was too distracted to really look at the visuals, I just wanted to look away from them while hoping it wasn't going to get worse.

I anticipated it was going to get a lot worse indeed, so I went into a state of alert calmness, to be as relaxed as possible to try and slow down my heart.

If I wasn't focused so much on staying relaxed I imagine the visuals would have been pretty cool, I remember in between me trying not to lose my composure catching a glimpse of square segments of my vision individually twisting in on themselves.


Even when I knew I was alright I didn't look to see what the visuals looked like, because I already was busy doing something else any way:

I love watching epic series on psychedelics, often hold off watching season finales for when I've dosed, this time it felt appropriate Van Helsing should finally be enjoyed.

So even though I was preparing myself to have to cling on for dear life, I wasn't going to let some bad experience ruin this moment!


One word, Beautiful!


I do not remember experiencing any bodily sensations, apart from the increased HR it was all visual and emotional as far as I could tell.

It did bring me to a state of what I would call psychedelic empathy, where you experience really seeing your own and someone elses perspective in a profoundly companionate and realistic way, a higher state of consciousness you might say ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

That's why movies and series are so great on psychedelics in my opinion!

So that helped me quite a bit in a team effort I'm engaged in at the moment.


The duration was about the same, but I didn't take notes so I don't know for sure.

I remember getting to half an hour in and I was relieved to know it should have reached it peak.


I'll be revisiting this substance again, to see what the visuals are like..

Maybe if you have some suggestions or even requests I'm open to it, just let me know.


@ Mr Kid, I stopped using dissociatives so won't be trying that combo! But did you mean to say the main combo was 5-meo-mipt and 5-meo-malt?

If so I might try a low dosage of those two!

I only do 5-meo-mipt orally and that substance is pretty visual for me, although it get's very boringly 2-dimensional on high doses in my experience, so hopefully 5-meo-malt is better!


Maybe I'll do oral next and see if it's different for me, or just a lower dosage nasally, but good to hear you had some wonderful times, and I hope you have more!

Thanks for the report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Would you consider posting this in Trip Reports as well?  We have very few reports on this substance.   Actually both of your reports would be good to submit as it would add to the body of knowledge.  I mean you posted here too, but trip reports is in the process of being turned into a database similar to Erowid's so will be more accessible for some and easier to find for those looking.

That hear rate is particularly high, generally stimulating-style [psychedelics will increase my heart rate some, but maybe to 90, 100 max.  My guess is that nasal dosing produces more stimulation, and oral dosing may prove more comfortable.

Thanks! I'll have to see if a different route of administration will make a difference.

And I'll certainly post it over there then, minus the stuff that was meant for this forum.


Tonight I will try 15 mg orally, I'll just have to see for myself what the dosage is going to lead to, and report back.

Hopefully it will be a bit easier on the body!

I could do 10 mg for comparison, but I imagine that will be a bit too weak for my liking tonight.


By the way, 20 mg insufflated listed on tripsit as being 'strong', more like 'dying'...

Can't imagine double of what I experienced, even if the dose response curve is linear!

I decided to try 15mg 5-meo-malt hcl orally, which turned out to be weaker than 5mg insufflated, I did it first thing in the morning, and after an hour and a half I was making breakfast.


4 days later I rather impulsively went ahead and did 27mg orally even though I anticipated to experience some tolerance, but I really felt in the mood so I just accepted it.

It was weird, not the effects themselves, but the fact that they didn't kick in until more than an hour had past.


I had a bit of yoghurt 3/4 hours before, maybe that had something to do with it, I imagine it could have caused the capsule to improperly dissolve or something.


The visuals were just a bit more prominent and colorful than my 5mg insufflated and my heart rate remained below 80.

So I probably have to dose even higher orally to achieve decent effects.


What followed might be considered a bit irresponsible, but I did not experience any side effects afterwards:

2 days later I decided to insufflate 10 in about 15 minutes devided by 6 piles, 3 for each nostril to see if it was the fast comeup that made my heart go racing like crazy.


It was very good! Heart rate stayed pretty normal, and could properly enjoy the psychedelic headspace it gave.

The visuals I would describe as being rather dark and sinister, with a relaxed and gentle euphoria accompanying the experience.

Both the headspace, the visuals and the euphoria where consistently present, on 7 consecutive evenings!

I dosed 10 each time and experienced zero tolerance, absolutely great experience every time, very psychedelic!

No hangover whatsoever, and just felt great just like you normally would feel waking up after a night of tripping.


Normally I like long acting substances, because I enjoy binge watching series on a higher state of consciousness, but this actually is a good alternative.

Just watch 1 or 2 episodes, and save the rest for another day, not having to worry about tolerance.

Quite a game changer if you ask me.


Oh and the music, my lord it's good! Reminds me a bit of 2ce!


Because I waited 5 minutes in between doses, I can definitely say 3mg is very active on it's own, you quite immediately get propelled into a psychedelic state of mind with light visuals.


It has been a week since I've last indulged, and I'm planning on doing 4-ho-met in a few days ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

And then dose 5-meo-malt the day after to check if it has any cross-tolerance.

My guess is it doesn't ^^

I have yet to try any 5 sub tryptamines.  I do like sub 4s probably 4 aco dmt is number one.  4 ho mipt was first one a decade ago.  These two are only sub 4 s done. 


How would this compare to say magic mushrooms or say 4 aco dmt?
