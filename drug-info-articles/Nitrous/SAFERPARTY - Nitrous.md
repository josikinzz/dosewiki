## Effects
Relaxation, euphoria, optical and acoustic changes in perception, loss of the sense of time.

## Dosage
Mild nausea, headache; in case of excessive and improper consumption, unconsciousness, drop in blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmia, in the worst case death by respiratory paralysis. Danger of suffocation if oxygen supply is insufficient, increased risk of injury from falling when "stepping away".

## Risks

### Long-term Risks
Continuous use of nitrous oxide stresses the nervous system and leads to vitamin B12 deficiency (risk of disturbed cell function and temporary infertility). Dependence with psychological symptoms is possible.

## Safer Use
- Never inhale nitrous oxide directly from the capsule or gas cylinder (risk of frostbite in the larynx and bronchi!).
- Consume nitrous oxide while sitting or lying down (less risk of injury).
- Take breaks to avoid too high a concentration of nitrous oxide.
- Refrain from mixed consumption, especially with alcohol.
- Persons with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases should not consume nitrous oxide, nor should persons suffering from epilepsy or otitis media. People with broken ribs or who have suffered a diving accident should also refrain from using nitrous oxide.
