## Subjective Experience

In its native Africa, sceletium tortuosum has traditionally been chewed as a “vision-
inducing entheogen and inebriant” (ref: Erowid), notably by the Hotentot tribe. It
can, however, also be smoked or consumed as tea.

I sampled it a handful on a handful of occasions, circa 2014/15, with perhaps a
couple of months between each session. The forum reports below were written
contemporaneously.

\`\`\`
INSUFFLATION TEST 1
The package arrived in the post this morning. It contained 10g of brown
powdered plant matter, almost sawdust in constitution, with a distinctive but
not particularly pleasant odour.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I set about testing by insufflating a single line. Wallop! It was awful, and
brought tears to my eyes. Fortunately, this wasn’t in vain.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Despite harbouring doubts as to whether there would be anything to it there
was a fairly immediate effect. Within seconds I felt a changing of headspace,
and I was becoming strangely inebriated.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
It was intoxicating in the sense of feeling slightly disorientated and a little
drunk, but without the loss of clarity. The onset was rapid, and as it took hold
I wondered how far it would go. However, the inebriation settled and it
stabilised at the same level for approximately 20 minutes.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It then tapered into the promised sedation. The depth of this was difficult to
measure as I was already quite chilled, but I was left feeling positively relaxed
for some hours.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
INSUFFLATION TEST 2
This sample was sold as ‘Sceletium Tortuosum 40x extract’, and was procured
from the same source as the regular kanna I had tested earlier. I broadly
followed the instructions printed on the packet: “Serving size 10mg micros
scoop, to be insufflated 1-3 times in divided doses”. As stated, there was a cute
little scoop enclosed, which I piled high, thus reaching about 15mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A nice surprise was that there was no discomfort or serious sting, contrary to
the excessive pain I had suffered when I snorted the raw leaves.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I experienced a very clean inebriating effect, perhaps lasting about 10 minutes.
This then morphed into a distant sedation, but with a strange visual clarity.
Overall it was quite pleasant.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This wasn’t very long lasting, so I repeated the exercise, inducing a similar or
perhaps stronger response. There was no nausea, and no body load.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As this does seem to be a nice way to fill a couple of hours, it is difficult to
understand why this plant isn't more widely known and used.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Note that I was completely detoxed whilst undertaking these experiments.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
ORAL TEST
I added half a teaspoon of plain kanna to a cup of coffee this morning,
swigging it down quickly to avoid any unpleasant taste.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It certainly had a psychoactive effect, with the next few hours passing with a
nice positive vibe. I spent much of the time enjoying the sort of ambient music
I wouldn't normally listen to, whilst working on trivial tasks.
\`\`\`
Overall this was a pleasant surprise. It was effective via each RoA I tested and in both
its natural and extract form. Indeed, I would echo my earlier comment in wondering
why this is not more popular.

One further aspect: there are a variety of credible reports stating that this has
interesting synergistic properties with other psychoactives, including cannabis. This
may well be another area worthy of study.

Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum) is a plant that’s been used in South Africa for hundreds of years. It contains substances (e.g. Mesembrine and Mesembrenone) which offer depressant and anxiolytic effects. The drug also seems to enhance the effects of cannabis, particularly its euphoria.

Anxiolytic and stress-reducing effects are seen with Kanna. And, it may improve cognitive performance, particularly in those who have anxiety or stress issues.

The effects primarily come from SRI (serotonin reuptake inhibition) and PDE4 inhibition actions.

Common doses have not been connected to any clear negative effects, at least in the short-term. It appears relatively safe when normal amounts are used.

## Summary
Mesembryanthemum tortuosum or Sceletium tortuosum, commonly known as kanna, kougoed, or Namaqua skeletonfig, is a succulent plant in the family Aizoaceae, native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa. Traditionally, it has been fermented and chewed as kougoed—an Afrikaans term meaning 'chewable thing'—by the indigenous Khoisan peoples for its psychoactive effects. The plant contains several active alkaloids, particularly mesembrine.
It has likely been used by South African pastoralists and hunter-gatherers for thousands of years. The first written account of its use dates to 1662, recorded by Jan van Riebeeck. The dried plant was traditionally chewed with the saliva swallowed. It has also been prepared in various forms, including gel caps, teas, tinctures, snuff, and smoked. In traditional medicine, it is primarily used to alleviate stress, depression, pain, and hunger. It is currently classified as a species of least concern, though wild populations face pressure from overharvesting.
Kanna has gained global attention for its stress-relieving and mood-enhancing properties, with modern research focusing on the potential of its bioactive alkaloids to support mental health. Preliminary studies using kanna extract Zembrin suggest it may have benefits for mood, anxiety, stress, sleep, and cognitive function. However, it showed no significant effect on reducing anxiety symptoms compared to placebo in a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. Clinical data are currently insufficient to support the use of kanna for any specific medical indication. Kanna shows potent inhibition of the serotonin transporter and PDE4. It promotes monoamine release through vesicular monoamine transporter-2 upregulation, with serotonin reuptake inhibition as a secondary action. It is used as a party drug for its euphoric  effects.

## Botany
Sceletium tortuosum is a perennial succulent plant native to South Africa. It features pale-colored sessile flowers about 20–30 mm wide with 4–5 sepals. Its recurved leaves contain distinctive water cells, and the stems become woody as the plant ages.
Raphides have been found in its petals and filaments.

## History
Plants of the genus Sceletium have likely been used for millennia by San and Khoi peoples as masticatories and traditional medicines for thirst, hunger, fatigue, and social and spiritual purposes; this knowledge from oral tradition of how it was used has declined over the past three centuries due to colonization, conflict, and cultural disruption. Along with dagga, kanna constituted an important element in southern Africa's precolonial exchange economy. The first known written account of the plant's use was in 1662 by Jan van Riebeeck, although the English East India Company official in Hirado Richard Cocks explained kanna's properties by likening it to those of ginseng as early as 1616. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European writers like Peter Kolb and Guy Tachard incorrectly hypothesized that kanna may be the same plant as East Asian ginseng, on account of its stimulant properties. The traditionally prepared dried plant was often chewed and the saliva swallowed, but it has also been made into gel caps, teas and tinctures. It has also been used as a snuff and smoked. 
Its name relates to the skeletal appearance of its dried leaves. It was highly valued and traded, sometimes combined with cannabis to enhance effects.  Today, it is sold commercially, especially to boost sexual performance.

## Uses
Kanna has been consumed for its mood-altering and medicinal properties by pastoralists and hunter-gatherers since historic times. The earliest recorded use dates back to 1662. It is consumed in various forms—chewed, fermented, made into tinctures, teas, tablets, snuff, or smoked. Traditionally, it serves as a narcotic, sedative, analgesic (relieving mouth pain), and suppresses hunger and thirst during hunting. It has been used to treat toothache, abdominal pain, and digestive issues, especially in pregnant women for constipation, nausea, uterine contractions, and post-birth recovery. An oil made from the plant mixed with sheep's tail is used to relieve colic in babies.
It is used as a party drug for its euphoric  effects. It has been described as producing MDMA-like effects.
It has been studied to alleviate excessive nocturnal barking in dogs or meowing in cats.

## Research
Preliminary studies using kanna extract Zembrin suggest it may have benefits for mood, anxiety, stress, sleep, and cognitive function.
A meta-analysis of four randomized clinical trials involving 117 adults (including one parallel-group and three cross-over studies) found no significant difference in anxiety outcomes between those treated with Sceletium tortuosum and those given a placebo (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.56–1.83; p = 0.98). Based on this evidence, the plant's effectiveness in reducing anxiety symptoms remains unproven.

## Cultivation
M. tortuosum can be grown from seeds and be propagated from cuttings. Its cultivation and care are similar to cactaceae like Echinopsis. The optimal temperature is at least 16 °C and it does not tolerate frost.

## Chemistry
It contains several alkaloids, with mesembrine being the most active and prominent. Although unfermented preparations contain more alkaloids, traditional fermentation enhances psychoactivity by transforming mesembrine into delta-7 mesembrenone, reducing mesembrine content and harmful oxalates. Fermented extracts exhibit greater bioavailability and efficacy, particularly through mucosal absorption, and show synergistic effects among alkaloids in inhibiting CB1 receptors and acetylcholinesterase—activities stronger than those of mesembrine alone. Seasonal and geographic variations affect alkaloid levels. The psychoactive compounds, including mesembrone, mesembrenol, and turtuosamine, were patented in 1997.

## Pharmacology
Hans Zwicky (1914) was the first to report the presence of alkaloids in Sceletium tortuosum, identifying mesembrine and mesembrenine, though their chemical structures were later corrected. Subsequent research confirmed the structure of mesembrine and noted additional unidentified alkaloids. Studies of fermentation processes revealed that mesembrine transforms into mesembrenone when exposed to sunlight and aqueous conditions, while remaining stable in methanol or darkness.
To date, more than 25 alkaloids from four main structural classes—mesembrine, Sceletium A4, joubertiamine, and tortuosamine—have been identified in Sceletium species, with mesembrine-types predominating. Recent advances include the structural characterization of new alkaloids such as channaine and sceletorines A and B, with evidence indicating sceletorine B may be a biosynthetic precursor to channaine. These discoveries deepen understanding of the chemical diversity and transformation of alkaloids in Sceletium tortuosum, which are key to its pharmacological properties.
M. tortuosum contains about 1–1.5% total alkaloids. A standardised ethanolic extract of dried M. tortuosum had an IC50 for SERT of 4.3 μg/ml and for PDE4 inhibition of 8.5 μg/ml.
Kanna inhibits serotonin reuptake by downregulating the serotonin transporter (SERT) and also promote monoamine release by upregulating VMAT-2. It shows mild inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase-A. The primary mechanism of kanna's mood effects appears to be monoamine release, with serotonin reuptake inhibition as a secondary action.
It exhibits multiple pharmacological activities, including phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, CB1 receptor blocker, and CYP17A1 inhibitor.

### Mesembrine
Mesembrine is a major alkaloid present in M. tortuosum. There is about 0.3% mesembrine in the roots and 0.86% in the leaves, stems, and flowers of the plant.

## Toxicology
Toxicology data for Sceletium tortuosum in humans is limited. However, animal studies suggest a favorable safety profile. In dogs and cats, daily oral doses of 10 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg respectively showed no toxic effects, with all body systems functioning normally. In Wistar rats, a 90-day oral study using a proprietary extract at doses of 17.85, 35.7, and 71.4 mg/kg revealed no toxic effects, establishing a no-observed-adverse-effect level at 71.4 mg/kg. Additional studies administering higher doses—up to 5,000 mg/kg daily for 14 days and up to 600 mg/kg daily for 90 days—also reported no mortality or signs of toxicity. These findings indicate a high margin of safety in animal models.
Traditional and contemporary methods of preparation serve to reduce levels of potentially harmful oxalates found in M. tortuosum. An analysis indicated levels of 3.6–5.1% oxalate, which falls within the median range for crop plants, just like spinach or kale.

## Distribution and habitat
M. tortuosum is found in 50 subpopulations in the Cape provinces from Namaqualand to Montagu and Aberdeen; in karroid habitat.

## Conservation status
M. tortuosum is listed as least concern in the Red List of South African Plants, though it is facing a slow decline in population numbers due to harvesting for medicinal use.
