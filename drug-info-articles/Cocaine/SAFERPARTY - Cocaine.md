## Effects
The increased release and additional reuptake inhibition of the body's own neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline lead to the suppression of tiredness, hunger and thirst, euphoria, feelings of increased performance, greatly increased self-confidence, urge to move, restlessness, talkativeness, elimination of inhibitions and fears, suppressed sense of pain, as well as increased willingness to take risks.

Coca leaves are known as "Mate de Coca" or dried leaves. These dried leaves contain about 0.5 to 2.5 % alkaloids, of which up to three quarters consist of cocaine. The leaves are chewed or drunk as tea. However, a psychoactive effect only occurs when they are taken in combination with a basic substance (e.g. lime or plant ash). This combination activates a hydrolysis, resulting in the alkaloid ecgonine. Ecgonine can be absorbed by the body and a slightly stimulating effect sets in. In contrast to cocaine, ecgonine has no dependence potential. If coca leaves are chewed without alkaline additives, they only have a numbing effect on the tongue. Coca leaves are used in South America mainly for medicinal purposes, e.g. to combat nausea or altitude sickness.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Sleep disturbances, irritability, aggressiveness, exaggerated egocentrism up to "megalomania", decrease in critical and judgemental ability, anxiety and delusions, depression, memory/concentration disorders, shortness of breath, hyperactivity, nervous twitching, muscle cramps and tremors, high stress on the cardiovascular system due to constriction of the blood vessels, increase in heart rate, increased blood pressure and hypertensive crises. In extreme cases, overdose can lead to a heart attack or stroke.
When the effect wears off: exhaustion, depressive moods, irritability, feelings of anxiety and a strong urge to take the drug again ("craving").

### Long-term Risks
Chronic use: psychological dependence. "Craving" (irresistible and uncontrollable desire to consume) can be triggered quickly by so-called trigger effects (situations, memories, people, etc., which are associated with consumption). Other long-term risks are anxiety disorders, personality changes such as reduced empathy, emotional coldness, exaggerated mistrust, depression, mental disorders with paranoid delusions and hallucinations, alteration of thought processes, permanent disturbances of short-term memory and intellectual abilities. Nerve damage, nervous twitching, seizures, alteration of movement patterns, damage to: Heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, skin, blood vessels and teeth. General weakening of the immune system, in extreme cases with necrosis (death of skin cells), liver damage due to the breakdown of toxins and the risk of kidney damage due to extender.
Chronic inflammation and damage to the nasal mucous membranes and nasal septum, which is difficult to heal. When smoking freebase and crack, damage to the lungs and respiratory tract is possible due to the deposition of combustion residues (ash residues). When injecting or smoking (freebase), the phenomenon of "dermatozoan madness" (the idea that there are worms or insects under the skin, perception of a tingling sensation under the skin) is known. Colloquially also called "cocaine worms/bugs"). This delusion leads to excessive scratching of the arms and/or legs, up to open injuries, which can lead to abscesses if hygiene is poor.

## Safer Use
- Attention, very high risk of psychological dependence! Take breaks from using, especially if it is difficult for you.
- Keep the dosage low and avoid frequent refilling!
- Drink enough soft drinks and take breaks in the fresh air.
- Eat healthy before and after consumption and do not consume on an empty stomach.
- Follow the safer sniffing and safer sex rules.
- Snorting is the lowest-risk form of use. Smoking crack and freebase as well as injecting increase the risks (no syringe exchange!).
- People with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, asthma, liver disease, hyperthyroidism and pregnant women should not use cocaine.
- Do not combine cocaine with other stimulants or drugs that increase blood pressure.
- Do not use cocaine if you have used ecstasy; this will cancel out the ecstasy effect.
- Do not mix cocaine with alcohol; the mixture makes you aggressive and you risk alcohol poisoning.

## Adulterants & Extenders

### Common Adulterants

**Dimethylterephthalate**
Dimethyl terephthalate is a basic material for the technical production of polyesters, for example polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). It is also used in the production of polyester resins for films, lacquers and adhesives and of 1,4-dimethylolcyclohexane. The abbreviation for dimethyl terephthalate is DMT; it is possible that there is confusion here with dimethyl triytamine, whose abbreviation is also DMT.

**Buflomedil**
Buflomedil is a drug for the supportive treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD). This disease causes pain in the legs, for example when walking, because the arteries are narrowed by deposits in their lumen and therefore less blood with nutrients reaches the muscle tissue in the legs. The drug promotes blood flow in medium and small arterial blood vessels. It is an antagonist at α-adrenoreceptors.

**Hydroxyzine**
The effects are based, among other things, on antagonism at histamine H1 receptors and anticholinergic properties. The drug hydroxyzine acts at several sites in the body: It influences different messenger systems in the brain and the rest of the body. As a result, it has a calming effect, relieves tension and anxiety, soothes nausea and relieves itching. Hydroxyzine has a strong calming effect and promotes sleeping through the night. It is particularly suitable for night-time relief of severe itching in allergies and neurodermatitis.

**Lidocaine**
Lidocaine is an amide-type local anaesthetic that is also used as a class Ib antiarrhythmic.

**Piracetam**
Piracetam is a cyclic derivative (γ-lactam) of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and a drug from the group of anti-dementia drugs (nootropics).

**Procaine**
Procaine is now rarely used for local anaesthesia, as more effective substances, such as lidocaine, are available for this purpose.

**Levamisole**
S)-6-phenyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydroimidazo(2,1-b)(1,3)thiazole. Levamisole was originally used as an agent against threadworms (anthelmintic), but has not been used in human medicine since 2004 because of undesirable drug effects.

**Diltiazem**
Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that has a vasodilatory effect and delays conduction in the AV node of the heart.
Possible side effects: Swelling of the lymph nodes, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhoea, feeling of weakness, oedema.

**Tetracaine**
Tetracaine is used as a surface anaesthetic of mucous membranes - for example for minor procedures in the mouth or nose.

**Phenacetin**
Phenacetin is an active substance from the group of analgesics with analgesic and antipyretic effects. A large proportion of the active substance is converted into paracetamol in the body. Due to its toxicity to the kidneys and the risk of carcinogenesis in the urinary tract, phenacetin is no longer on the market.
