Dichloropane ((−)-2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)tropane, RTI-111, O-401) is a stimulant of the phenyltropane class that acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI) with IC50 values of 3.13, 18, and 0.79 nM, respectively. In animal studies, dichloropane had a slower onset and longer duration of action compared to cocaine.
Methylecgonidine is the direct precursor to this compound.

## Trans -CO2Me group

The thermodynamic isomer with a trans -CO2Me group is still active. This isomer was used by Neurosearch to make three different phenyltropanes which were tested in clinical trials.
