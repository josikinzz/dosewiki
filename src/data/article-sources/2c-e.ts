2C-E (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine) is a psychedelic and phenethylamine of the 2C family. Its chemical synthesis was first published in 1991 within the book PiHKaL: A Chemical Love Story by Dr. Alexander Shulgin and Ann Shulgin. This was a groundbreaking book that included detailed synthesis instructions for over 200 psychedelic compounds (most of which Shulgin discovered himself) including bioassays, dosages, and other commentary. For those who are interested, 2C-E’s specific entry, synthesis, and qualitative commentary can be found [here](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal024.shtml).

The mechanism that produces the psychedelic effects of 2C-E is a direct result from its action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain. It is a mechanism of action shared by all other hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines.

Many people have reported that the general effects of 2C-E are similar to those of the other psychedelic phenethylamines, but far more intense in terms of its physical body load and visual effects. The experience is often described as similar in appearance to LSD, and many reports indicate that the effects of this particular chemical may be overly intense for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics.

The 2C-E experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-E can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of 2C-E is manifested as one of the most proportionally intense in comparison to almost all of the classical psychedelics. This is something which is only beaten in terms of its overwhelming forcefulness by high dose AMT and 5-MeO-DMT experiences. The sensation itself can be described as an intense and slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. Alongside of this, many users commonly report that the body high can be particularly uncomfortable and sometimes accompanied by urges to shift the position of one’s body and prolonged tensing of unusual combinations of muscle groups.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 2C-E is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of MDMA.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch**
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Loss of temperature regulation**

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of 2C-E is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Sexual arousal**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

2C-E presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, the effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance, and unrealistic/cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT or ayahuasca than that of LSD, 2C-B, or 2C-I. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp in their edges, and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

2C-E produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, 2C-E is extremely high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-E are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 2C-E use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2C-E is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 2C-E within the psychedelic community suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

The biggest danger with this substance seems to be confusing it with other more potent psychedelics such as Bromo-DragonFLY as 2C-E which is active in the 200 - 800 microgram range. This means that it is roughly as potent as LSD and extremely dangerous if taken in place of 2C-E, which has resulted in fatal overdoses on multiple separate occasions thanks to the accidental mislabelling of bags from research chemical vendors. There are cases in the media of people ordering 2-CE, among other research chemicals, from online vendors, and receiving Bromo-DragonFLY instead.

2C-E does not seem to physically addictive but could potentially become habit-forming as there is no real tolerance attributed to this drug– meaning that it could potentially be used multiple days in a row if somebody chose to do so. This can be prevented by manually limiting your usage of the drug and is practically unheard of, with most users noting that the desire to use them can actually decrease with use thanks to its powerfully introspective and mentally therapeutic effects.

**Legal Issues:**

- As of July 9, 2012, 2C-E is a Schedule I substance under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, making possession, distribution and manufacture illegal in the United States.
- As of April 8, 2007, Denmark added 2C-E to the list of Schedule I controlled substances.
- New Zealand has a catch-all Analogues section in Schedule 3 / Class C of their drug laws that makes 2C-E a Schedule 3 compound.
- In Sweden, 2C-E has been controlled since Oct 1, 2004.
- As of 2002, 2C-E is illegal in the United Kingdom and a Class A controlled substance under The Misuse of Drugs Act.

Elsewhere in the world, it is completely legal. If you want to try 2C-E despite full knowledge of the legal risks it can be purchased online through various research chemical vendors of which I cannot legally mention the names of. This means that if you want to do this, you will have to find a source for yourself using the power of Google search.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, I was extremely impressed with 2C-E and it exceeded my expectations many times over. I was originally expecting a poor man’s LSD with psychedelic visuals but no true hallucinatory states. Instead I found myself with a substance that is more comparable to mushrooms and extremely useful for both psychonautical exploration *and* recreational activities such as raves, festivals, and parties (for those who are already experienced with the substance). It is even useful when taken at very low sub threshold dosages as a motivating background stimulant as I actually wrote this entire article on approximately 0.07mg and it genuinely helped me keep the words flowing and maintain a strong sense of focus.
 Alexander Shulgin has been quoted as saying *“Someday, the full character of 2C-E will be understood, but for the moment, let it rest as being a difficult and worth-while material. A very much worth-while material.”*

This is a statement which I completely agree with and I genuinely hope that this article has contributed to increasing the psychedelic community’s understanding of this fascinating substance.

Over the upcoming months I will definitely be slowly working my way through Shulgin’s magical half-dozen (which can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PiHKAL#Magical_Half-Dozen)) and documenting each of their subjective effects in as much detail as human English will possibly allow me to.

## Subjective Experience

2C-E was first synthesised by Alexander Shulgin, and was documented in PiHKAL in

1991. He rated it as one of the most important phenethylamine compounds, which he
referred to as his magical half-dozen. For the record, these comprised mescaline,
and six of his own inventions: DOM, 2C-B, 2C-E, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7.

Recreationally, it became increasingly popular from the early 2000s. However, it was
classified in the UK in 2002 and scheduled in the United States in July 2012.

2C-E is often considered to invoke a deeply meaningful experience, with references
to this effect present across Internet forums and in a number of books. A good
example of the latter is Myron J. Stolaroff’s ‘Thanatos to Eros: 35 Years of
Psychedelic Exploration Ethnomedicien and the Study of Consciousness’, which can
be found on the MAPS website.

My 18mg sample was allegedly produced by a Chinese lab, and pressed into pill form
in the UK. On the face of it, this seems to be a good dose, but further research leads
me to exercise additional caution.

One factor is that for many users 2C-E produces a high body load. Another is that
reports across the harm reduction forums repeatedly stress a steep response curve
and high intensity low-dose experiences. The following comments, from respected
posters on the BlueLight forum, are fairly typical:

\`\`\`
“This one has a VERY steep dose/response curve and I'd imagine every half-
milligram can produce a noticeable jump in intensity.” ~ Morninggloryseed
“I tried 12mgs of 2C-E for the first time tonite. Wow! It was really damn
intense.” ~ Piper methysticum
“The 2C-E dose-reponse curve is probably the sharpest I've ever experienced.
I have seen a full freakout on 15mg.” ~ Fizzacyst
“ Yes it can knock your socks off at 12mg or be almost irrelevant at 16mg
weird that.” ~ B9
\`\`\`
In the ideal circumstance I would perhaps plump for 15mg, but today is far from
ideal, and a full freakout is out of the question. I therefore go for 9mg, but still with a
little trepidation.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I weigh the pill, break it up, and measure half. It is just over, so the
dose is somewhere between 9mg and 10mg. I swallow this with a glass of
water. [3:20pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:20 A mild headspace is developing, with perhaps enhanced visible
colouration, but all is minimal. I wonder if I have taken enough.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:35 The headiness has intensified, and a tingly body feeling has emerged,
which is particularly evident in my hands. A familiar psychedelic sheen to my
vision is also developing. In terms of mood, there may be a little elevation. All
these effects are quite mild, but are now very clear.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+ 1:00 Little has changed. I resist the temptation to swallow the other half of
the pill largely on the basis of a couple of outlier trip reports which claimed a
two hour onset.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This is in fact reasonably agreeable. The headiness has a drifting quality, as
does vision unless I specifically focus. There is definitely an introspective edge
here, which flows quite strongly if I take that direction.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 The effects I described on the hour mark have strengthened and
stabilised. It is a pleasant enough high, with psychedelic edges, and clear
scope for introspection. The headiness is of a slightly different nature to the
other 2C psychedelics I have experienced. It has a more hypnotic feel to it,
with a sense of falling into an internal state of reverie.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
The mind play is the predominant feature, with the tingly body sensation
playing alongside. The light visual sheen is still present, but there are no real
CEVs or OEVs. Clearly, these emerge with higher doses.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 There is no significant euphoria or mood lift. There is, however, a
great deal of thought and

Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**2C-E**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Controlled Substance
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I
 
2C-E is currently in Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license. 
 
 In July, 2012, the US signed into Federal law a long list of new substances added to Schedule I including 4-methylmethcathinone (Mephedrone); 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV); 2-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylphenyl)ethanamine (2C-E); 2-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)ethanamine (2C-D); 2-(4-Chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine (2C-C); 2-(4-Iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine (2C-I); 2-[4-(Ethylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]ethanamine (2C-T-2); 2-[4-(Isopropylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]ethanamine (2C-T-4); 2-(2,5-Dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine (2C-H); 2-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-nitro-phenyl)ethanamine (2C-N); (28) 2-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-(n)-propylphenyl)ethanamine (2C-P). 
 
 See [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3187/text](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3187/text) . 
 
 
There are currently [several cases](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems_info1.shtml) pending in U.S. federal court against online vendors for selling research chemicals. These cases may address the question of whether this chemical could be legally defined as an analog of a scheduled substance. We are unaware of any cases against individuals for possession alone (7/24/04).

## SYNTHESIS
In a round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a take-off adapter, an immersion thermometer, and a magnetic stirrer, there was placed 100 g 2,5-dimethoxyacetophenone, 71 g 85% KOH pellets, 500 mL of triethylene glycol, and 125 mL 65% hydrazine. The mixture was brought up to a boil by heating with an electric mantle, and the distillate was removed, allowing the temperature of the pot contents to continuously increase. When the pot temperature had reached 210 Â°C, reflux was established and maintained for an additional 3 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture and the distillate were combined, poured into 3 L water, and extracted with 3Ã100 mL hexane. After washing the pooled extracts with water, the solvent was removed yielding 22.0 g of a pale straw-colored liquid that was free of both hydroxy and carbonyl groups by infrared. This was distilled at 120â140 Â°C at the water pump to give 2,5-dimethoxy-1-ethylbenzene as a white fluid product. Acidification of the spent aqueous phase with concentrated HCl produced a heavy black oil which was extracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2. Removal of the solvent on the rotary evaporator yielded 78 g.of a black residue that was distilled at 90â105 Â°C at 0.5 mm/Hg to provide 67.4 g of an orange-amber oil that was largely 2-ethyl-4-methoxyphenol. This material could eventually be used as a starting material for ethoxy homologues. However, remethylation (with CH3I and KOH in methanol) provided some 28 g additional 2,5-dimethoxyethylbenzene.

A solution of 8.16 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-1-ethylbenzene in 30 mL CH2Cl2 was cooled to 0 Â°C with good stirring and under an inert atmosphere of He. There was then added 11.7 mL anhydrous stannic chloride, followed by 3.95 mL dichloromethyl methyl ether dropwise over the course of 0.5 h. The stirred reaction mixture was allowed to come up to room temperature, then held on the steam bath for 1 h. The reaction mixture was poured into 1 L water, extracted with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2, and the pooled extracts washed with dilute HCl. The organic phase was stripped under vacuum yielding 10.8 g of a dark viscous oil. This was distilled at 90â110 Â°C at 0.2 mm/Hg to yield a colorless oil that, on cooling, set to white crystals. The yield of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylbenzaldehyde was 5.9 g of material that had a mp of 46â47 Â°C. After purification through the bisulfite complex, the mp increased to 47â48 Â°C. The use of the Vilsmeier aldehyde synthesis (with POCl3 and N-methylformanilide) gave results that were totally unpredictable. The malononitrile derivative (from 0.3 g of this aldehyde and 0.3 g malononitrile in 5 mL EtOH and a drop of triethylamine) formed red crystals which, on recrystallization from toluene, had a mp of 123â124 Â°C.

A solution of 21.0 g of the unrecrystallized 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylbenzaldehyde in 75 g nitromethane was treated with 4 g of anhydrous ammonium acetate and heated on the steam bath for about 2 h. The progress of the reaction was best followed by TLC analysis of the crude reaction mixture on silica gel plates with CH2Cl2 as the developing solvent. The excess solvent/reagent was removed under vacuum yielding granular orange solids that were recrystallized from seven volumes of boiling MeOH. After cooling in external ice-water for 1 h, the yellow crystalline product was removed by filtration, washed with cold MeOH and air dried to give 13.4 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-Î²-nitrostyrene. The mp was 96â98 Â°C which improved to 99â100 Â°C after a second recrystallization from MeOH.

A total of 120 mL of 1.0 M solution of LAH in THF (120 mL of 1.0 M) was transferred to a 3 neck 500 mL flask, under an inert atmosphere with good magnetic stirring. This solution was cooled to Â°C with an external ice-water bath, and there was then added 3.0 mL of 100% H2SO4 over the course of 0.5 h. This was followed by a solution of 5.85 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-Î²-nitrostyrene, in 40 mL of warm THF. The reaction mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, brought to room temperature, heated on the steam bath for 0.5 h, and then returned to room temperature. The addition of IPA dropwise destroyed the excess hydride, and some 4.5 mL of 5% NaOH produce a white cottage cheese, in a basic organic medium. This mixture was filtered, washed with THF, and the filtrate evaporated to produce 2.8 g of an almost white oil. The filter cake was resuspended in THF, made more basic with additional 15 mL of 5% NaOH, again filtered, and the filtrate removed to provide an additional 2.8 g of crude product. These residues were combined and distilled at 90â100 Â°C at 0.25 mm/Hg to give a colorless oil. This was dissolved in 30 mL IPA, neutralized with concentrated HCl, and diluted with 50 mL anhydrous Et2O to provide, after spontaneous crystallization, filtration, washing with Et2O, and air drying, 3.87 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-E) as magnificent white crystals. A similar yield can be obtained from the reduction of the nitrostyrene in a suspension of LAH in THF, without the use of H2SO4. With 11.3 g of LAH in 300 mL dry THF, there was added, dropwise, a solution of 13.4 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-Î²-nitrostyrene in 75 mL THF over the course of 2 h. The mixture was kept at reflux for an additional 8 h, and killed by the careful addition of 11 mL H2O, followed with 11 mL 15% NaOH, and finally another 33 mL of H2O. This mass was filtered, washed with THF, and the combined filtrates and washes evaporated to a residue under vacuum The approximately 15 mL of residue was dissolved in 300 mL CH2Cl2 and treated with 200 mL H2O containing 20 mL concentrated HCl. On shaking the mixture, there was deposited a mass of the hydrochloride salt which was diluted with a quantity of additional H2O. The organic phase was extracted with additional dilute HCl, and these aqueous phases were combined. After being made basic with 25% NaOH, this phase was again extracted with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2 and after the removal of the solvent, yielded 12.6 g of a colorless oil. This was dissolved in 75 mL of IPA and neutralized with concentrated HCl. The solidified mass that formed was loosened with another 50 mL IPA, and then filtered. After Et2O washing and air drying there was obtained 7.7 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-E) as lustrous white crystals. Anal. (C12H20ClNO2) C,H.

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 20 mg) âThe view out of the window was unreal. The garden was painted on the window, and every petal of flower and tuft of grass and leaf of tree was carefully sculptured in fine strokes of oil paint on the surface of the glass. It was not out there; it was right here in front of me. The woman who was watering the plants was completely frozen, immobilized by Vermeer. And when I looked again, she was in a different place, but again frozen. I was destined to become the eternal museum viewer.â

(with 25 mg) âI have a picture in my living room that is a stylized German scene with a man on horseback riding through the woods, and a young girl coming out to meet him from the nearby trees. But she was not just âcoming out.â  He was not just riding through the woods. The wind was blowing, and his horse was at full gallop, and his cape was flapping in the storm, and she was bearing down upon him at full bore. The action never ceased. I became exhausted.â

(with 25 mg) âWithin minutes I was anxious and sweaty. Each person has his own brand of toxic psychosisâmine always starts with the voices in my head talking to me, about all my worst fears, a jumble of warnings and deep fears spinning faster. Twenty minutes later this complex chaos passed as quickly as it had come. At lower dosages 2C-E has been a truly enjoyable esthetic enhancer. But it really has a steep dose/response curve.â

**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine** (also known as **2C-E** , or colloquially as **"Aquarust"** and **"Eternity"** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, which are closely related to the classical psychedelic [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . Like other psychedelics, it is thought to produce its effects by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain, although the precise mechanism is poorly understood.

2C-E was first synthesized and tested for human activity by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in 1977, who documented his findings in the 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). It began to appear in drug seizures around 2004. While primarily distributed online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) , it is also sometimes distributed on the street as 'mescaline' or 'synthetic mescaline'.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . User reports characterize 2C-E as a highly unpredictable, dose-sensitive psychedelic that is capable of producing strong visual distortions along with a significant "body load", which includes nausea and bodily discomfort.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-E, and it has a limited history of human use. Many reports indicate that the safe use of this substance may be overly difficult for those who are not already experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

2C-E was first synthesized and tested for human activity by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in 1977, who documented his findings in the 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). It is a member of the so-called "magical half-dozen" which refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) -derived compounds, all of which except [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) , and are as follows: [Mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , 2C-E, [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) .

## Chemistry

2C-E or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine is a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-E contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 and an ethyl chain bound to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. 2C-E belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-E's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience remains the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 2C-E is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is comparable to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , although it is 'encouraged' instead of 'forced' according to many users.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-E is manifested as one of the most proportionally intense in comparison to almost all of the classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as an intense and slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person's entire body. It is usually felt over the surface of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting, tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in intermittent waves. This skin tingling is much more pronounced than with other psychedelics. Alongside this, many users report uncomfortable body feelings characterized by dysphoric aches and urges to shift the position of one's body and prolonged tensing of unusual combinations of muscle groups. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Feelings of frequent but unpredictable rushes of warm physical euphoria are extremely common and very pleasurable. These move from the top of the head downwards before enveloping one's whole body.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high doses and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of entactogenic stimulants like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rarely observed effect but is believed to be a risk in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued, undernourished, or overheated. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**

- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is produced by this substance can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. It gives off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
2C-E produces a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This particularly holds true in comparison to other substances within the family of psychedelic phenethylamines. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 2C-E is extremely reliable at producing hallucinations embedded within visual [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, and concepts. They are more likely to present themselves within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 2C-E is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively unaltered in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. Some users suggest that 2C-E may be even more clearheaded than [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-C) especially at higher dosages. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This component is [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant and consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings are a little weaker and less sharp than those produced by substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but still often prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**

- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. However, many reports indicate that this substance is relatively reliable at inducing synaesthetic states.{citation needed### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - When used in combination with cannabis, both the visual and cognitive effects of 2C-E can be intensified and extended with extreme efficiency. This should be used with extreme caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics as this can also amplify the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) producing aspects of cannabis significantly.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When used in combination with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of 2C-E have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone present, and more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , and corresponding [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) which can spontaneously manifest as [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - When used in conjunction with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of MDMA are amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of 2C-E are also intensified with an overwhelming euphoric pleasure manifested through uniquely pleasurable body highs and headspaces, and uniquely colorful and awe-inspiring visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with markedly lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually. **Additionally, users should be aware that there are reasons to believe that this combination may result in unforeseen neurotoxic effects, so a strong sense of caution and independent research are highly advised if one decides to experiment with this combination.** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively affect a trip if taken in moderate to high dosages. This combination is, however, typically considered to be safe in low doses and can often "take the edge off" a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, albeit in a more physically distressing manner.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of an 2C-E trip. They are very efficient at stopping ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to the very high addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. **The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised.** If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

### Experience reports

Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) include:

- [Experience: 25mg 2C-E (oral) - A mindblowing experience](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience:_25mg_2C-E_(oral)_-_A_mindblowing_experience)
- [Experience:2C-E (20mg, insufflated) - Mind=Blown](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience:2C-E_(20mg,_insufflated)_-_Mind%3DBlown)

Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 2C-E](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CE.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-E use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-E is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a limited history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be conducted to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance so as to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that like psychedelics in general, 2C-E is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-E is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 1-2 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2-4 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-E presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) but not evenly, meaning that after the consumption of 2C-E, some psychedelics will have significant reduced effects while some others will only be slighly affected.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-E. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

2C-E is a psychedelic phenethylamine which also has some entactogen effects. It’s a member of the 2C family ( [2C-B](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-b/) , 2C-P, [2C-I](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-i/) , etc) and is a very energetic and stimulating psychedelic.

When you’re in a social setting, it’s possible for some empathy and love effects to appear, though they are not as intense or notable as MDMA’s.

The drug is often harder to handle than 2C-B due to intense psychological and physical effects.

Its LD50 is not known and while a couple deaths have been attributed to it, it’s not clear what amount should be considered dangerous. Due to the lack of information, it’s wise to minimize your use, take the smallest possible dose, and avoid combinations.

  "tripsit-wiki": `# 2C-E

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-E*

**2C-E** is a chemical of the [2C-X](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X) series which is characterised by its particularly intense visuals and higher potency when compared with other members of the family.

## History

2C-E, like many of its close analogues, was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and published in PiHKAL. He was quite fond of it, granting it a place in his "Magical Half Dozen" alongside of [DOM](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM), [2C-B](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-B), [2C-T-2](/index.php?title=2C-T-2&action=edit&redlink=1) & 7 and [mescaline](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Mescaline). 

## Usage

2C-E is mainly a recreational entheogen. It can be quite introspective in appropriate doses and settings. It doesn't lend itself well to intense party-like surroundings, much like LSD or similarly intense psychedelics.

## Dosage

{{#tdose: 2ce }}

## Duration

Note: Duration can be significantly longer with higher doses.

Anecdotal evidence has shown the oral onset of 2C-E may vary wildly for some users, taking up to three hours before first effects in some cases. 

| Onset | 60-90 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Total | 9-14 hours |

| Onset | 20-40 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Total | 6-9 hours |

## Effects

2C-E is a psychedelic phenethylamine and as such has psychedelic and stimulant effects. As with all psychedelics, different users are likely to experience different sets of effects, which usually include some however very rarely would include all of the following effects.

Compared to other members of the 2C-X family, 2C-E is generally considered to have a heavier body load and to be more visual than its counterparts.

Note: The prevalence of negative effects increases with higher doses.

### Positive

- Mood lift, euphoria, sense of well-being

- Enhanced sensory perception

- Increase in associative & creative thinking; introspection

- Life-changing 'spiritual' experiences

- Closed and Open eye visuals, patterning, tracers, color-enhancement, etc.

- Enhanced appreciation of music

- Increase in energy

### Neutral

- Time dilation

- Slight increase in heart-rate and body temperature

- Inability to focus or difficulty focusing

### Negative

- Tension

- Anxiety, restlessness, confusion

- Dizziness

- Nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, possible vomiting

- Over-sensitivity to music or other sensory stimuli

- Unwanted 'spiritual' experiences

- Racing thoughts

## Harm Reduction

- As with all psychedelic drugs 2C-E carries with it the potential for a  very powerful experience, and as such has the potential to create a very  difficult experience ('bad' trip). Mindset and setting play important  roles in governing the nature of a psychedelic experience, among other  things.

See [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for more information.

- As with all stimulants, care should be taken when dosing via different ROAs. The oral route has a much lower bioavailabity than those that bypass first pass metabolism i.e. Insufflated, rectal, intramuscular, intravenous and subcutaneous.

See [Stimulant Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Stimulants#Harm_Reduction) for more information.

### Interactions

See the [Drug combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations) chart for more information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

### Chemistry

2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine is a colorless oil and analogue of mescaline. Similarly it is classified as a psychedelic phenethylamine. It shares the substituted amphetamine core found in the structure of many entactogens. Crystalline forms are obtained as the amine salt by reacting the free base with a mineral acid, typically HCl. It is soluble in both water and ethanol. Maximum concentration in H2O is reported at ~50mg/ml and it is said to be relatively stable in solution. A drop below normal ambient temperatures can cause particles to crystalize out. 

Shulgin does not report an exact boiling point for the free base, stating only that during one synthesis the fraction boiling between 90-100 °C at 0.25 mmHg pressure was collected and converted to the hydrochloride salt. Shulgin reports the melting point of the hydrochloride salt as 208.5-210.5 °C. 

A full write up on Shulgin's synthesis for 2C-E can be found [here](https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal024.shtml).

### Pharmacology

Like most psychedelic drugs, 2C-E is a 5-HT2a Agonist; from that, we can presume the concurrent or pre-administration of SSRIs may reduce the effects of 2C-E. 2C-E is one of the most potent of the 2C-X family, behind only 2C-P and 2C-T-4. The 2C-X family, specifically, 2C-E, 2C-I, and 2C-C all stimulated G protein binding, suggesting more of an activity similar to tryptamines such as 5-MeO-DMT and, interestingly, DPT. G Proteins are membrane proteins that effectively mediate interaction between hormone receptors and enzymes responsible for changes of metabolism as a result of hormonal changes.

In rats, Stage I metabolism involved deamination and O-Demthylation, which are related to the Monoamine oxidase (MAO) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. For virtually all the 2C’s, (B,I,D,E,T-2, and T-7), MAO-A and MAO-B were reacted upon; interestingly, ½ of the molecules in Shulgin’s Magical Half Dozen (2C-E, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, with the addition of 2C-D) also act to  a small extent on the CYP2D6 enzyme. Because of the commonality of these receptors, the 2C-X family is likely to be more reactive with other concurrently administered chemicals.

### LD50

The LD50 in humans is not currently known. Use caution when exploring high doses of this compound. 

## Legal status

- In Australia, 2C-E was added to the 'Dangerous Drugs' list of the 'Drugs Misuse Amendment Act 2008.

- In Denmark, 2C-E has been added to the list of Schedule B controlled substances.

- In New Zealand, 2C-E is illegal under the Analogues section of Schedule 3 / Class C, along with 2C-I, DOI, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.

- In Sweden, 2C-E has been made illegal to sell or possess under their Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health (*lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor*).

- In the UK, 2C-E is a Class A controlled Substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act's 2002 amendments and as such is illegal to possess to supply.

- In Germany, 2C-E is a Schedule I drug as of late 2014.

- In the USA, 2C-E is a Schedule I substance under the FDA Safety and Innovation act of 2012, and is illegal to possess, distribute or manufacture.

  "wikipedia": `# 2C-E
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-E*

2C-E, also known as 4-ethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is taken orally.
2C-E was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1977 and was documented in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists 2C-E's dose range as 10 to 25 mg orally and its duration as 8 to 12 hours. He describes 2C-E as having a steep dose–response curve, such that a small increase in dose can result in an unexpectedly large increase in effects. While a dose of 10 mg is often experienced as rich and well-tolerated, doses of 25 to 30 mg have been described as too much and as very frightening. The onset of 2C-E was not described.
2C-E's effects are often described as "neutral", in comparison with other psychedelics and even other 2C drugs. In PiHKAL, Shulgin states:

"Here is another of the magical half-dozen. The range is purposefully broad. At 10 milligrams there have been some pretty rich +++ experiences, and yet I have had the report from one young lady of a 30 milligram trial that was very frightening. My first experience with 2C-E was really profound, and it is the substance of a chapter within the story. Several people have said, about 2C-E, "I don't think I like it, since it isn't that much fun. But I intend to explore it again." There is something here that will reward the experimenter. Someday, the full character of 2C-E will be understood, but for the moment, let it rest as being a difficult and worth-while material. A very much worth-while material."
The effects of 2C-E have been formally clinically studied. Its effects included altered perceptions, hallucinations, and euphoria, among others. The onset was within 2 hours and its duration was more than 6 hours, although these parameters were not precisely measured.

## Side effects

Adverse effects of 2C-E include tachycardia, hypertension,  agitation, delirium, and hallucinations.  At least two deaths have been attributed to a 2C-E overdose.

## Interactions

2C-E is metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C-E. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-E acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist. Activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is thought to be responsible for its psychedelic effects.
It is inactive as a monoamine releasing agent and has negligible activity as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor.

## Chemistry

### Properties

2C-E is a colorless oil.  Crystalline forms are obtained as the amine salt by reacting the free base with a mineral acid, typically hydrochloric acid (HCl).
Shulgin does not report an exact boiling point for the free base, stating only that during one synthesis the fraction boiling between 90 and 100 °C at 0.25 mmHg pressure was collected and converted to the hydrochloride salt. Shulgin reports the melting point of the hydrochloride salt as 208.5–210.5 °C.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-E has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 2C-E include 2C-H (2,5-DMPEA), 2C-D, 2C-P, DOM, DOET, 2C-E-FLY, and 25E-NBOMe, among others.

## History

2C-E was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1977. It was described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Australia

In Queensland, 2C-E was added to the 'Dangerous Drugs' list of the 'Drugs Misuse Act 1986' by the 'Drugs Misuse Amendment Act 2008'.  Making it illegal to produce, supply or possess.

#### Canada

As of October 31, 2016, 2C-E is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

#### China

As of October 2015, 2C-E is a controlled substance in China.

#### Denmark

2C-E is added to the list of Schedule B controlled substances.

#### Finland

Scheduled in "government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market".

#### Germany

2C-E is an Anlage I controlled drug.

#### New Zealand

New Zealand has a catch-all Analogues section in Schedule 3 / Class C of their drug laws that would make 2C-I, 2C-E, DOI, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine Schedule 3 compounds in New Zealand.

#### Portugal

Portugal has decriminalized possession of all recreational drugs in quantities no more than a ten-day supply of that substance. However production and distribution (buying/selling) are a criminal offense.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 2C-E as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Oct 1, 2004,  in their regulation SFS 2004:696 listed as 2,5-dimetoxi-4-etylfenetylamin (2C-E), making it illegal to sell or possess.

#### United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, 2C-E is a Class A controlled substance. The UK has the strictest laws in the EU on designer drugs. The Misuse Of Drugs Act was amended in 2002 to include a "catch most" clause outlawing every drug, and possible future drug, from the LSD (ergoline) and MDMA (phenethylamine) chemical families (including 2C-E). The amendment is a near verbatim quote from the books of the American biochemist Alexander Shulgin, who obtained a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Shulgin, a former research chemist at the Dow Chemical Company, re-discovered the synthesis for MDMA in 1976 and published the syntheses for more than 200 phenethylamine compounds of his own invention, and 55 tryptamine compounds many of which were also his own invention. The Shulgins were motivated to release the synthesis information as a way to protect the public's access to information about psychedelic compounds, a goal Alexander Shulgin has noted many times.

#### United States

As of July 9, 2012, in the United States 2C-E is a Schedule I substance under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, making possession, distribution and manufacture illegal.
