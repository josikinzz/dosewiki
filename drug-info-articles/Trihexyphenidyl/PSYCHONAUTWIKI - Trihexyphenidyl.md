# Trihexyphenidyl
*Source: https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trihexyphenidyl*
**Deliriant use is associated with highly uncomfortable and/or dangerous experiences.**
 
[Deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) are highly unpredictable and may result in erratic behaviors, self-injury, hospitalization, or death. It should be noted that most individuals do not choose to repeat the experience due to its unpleasant nature.
 
Please use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) if using this substance (e.g. starting with a low dose and always having a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) ). Refer to [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**Trihexyphenidyl** ( **THP** , **benzhexol** , **trihex** , **Artane** , and others) is an [anticholinergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticholinergic) substance of the [antimuscarinic](/w/index.php?title=Antimuscarinic&action=edit&redlink=1) class used to treat stiffness, tremors, spasms, and poor muscle control. In high doses, it has been reported to act as a [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) .

Trihexyphenidyl has been used for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease as approved by the FDA in the United States since 2003. It is also used for the treatment of drug-induced movement disorders such as essential tremors and akathisia, commonly caused by [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) .

## History and culture

Neurologist and author Dr. [Oliver Sacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Sacks) reported using the drug recreationally in the 1960s, he recalled taking "a large dose" knowing full well the drug was intended for people with Parkinson's.

During the 1970s, THP (trade name **Parkan** ) was the most popular recreational prescription drug in Hungary. In 2008, a news report mentioned that trihexyphenidyl was seen to be used for recreational purposes among Iraqi soldiers and police, stating that the drugs were taken to relieve combat stress reaction. While that was the case for some, others used it as a substitute or more intense version of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This was especially prevalent in the 1960s, according to a report in *"The New Yorker"* . Similarly to those in Iraqi forces, some of the appeal was that the individual may retain partial control while under the influence.
