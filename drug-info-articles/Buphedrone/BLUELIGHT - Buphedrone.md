1-Phenyl-2-methylaminobutan-1-one (Buphedrone, α-Ethylmethcathinone, 1-phenyl-2-methylamino-1-butanone) is a stimulant drug first synthesised in 1928.[1] It has similar effects to methcathinone but is several times more potent by weight.

Based of the safety profile of other related compounds, I'd say its a disaster waiting to happen. Look at mephedrone/methedrone...

^^^

i dont know, this does not look anywhere as threatening as 4MMC, in fact its something i would be more than willing to try! i think the issue is with the para-substitution not with all beta ketons, CAT, MCAT, BKMDMA, EthCAT and DiEthCAT all have long and relatively clean histories and alpha-ethylation usually increases potency and abolishes affinity for 5ht2a receptor (too aplanar ive heard) could be a nice general stimulant - hopefully we will find out soon...

So this is going to be more of a stimulant in the classic sense of the word than an entactogen/empathogen?

Whoa, I just saw this one for sale...it's dirt cheap from thailand...this stuff is really several times more potent than MCAT by weight??


Isn't a dose of MCAT like 20-30mg for someone with no tolerance?


So are we talking like JWH018-esque doses to get high off this stuff? (1-5mg)

> Its about 2-3x the potency of Methcath with a dosage of 10-30mg p.o..But its more like between Methylphenidat/amphetamine than Methcath in its subjective effects.Btw potency INCREASES with alpha-homologation in bk-PEA's!

I wouldn't mind if it was a straight stimulant, maybe it could help my ADD. But then again non toxic mephedrone would be amazing

Based on what, exactly?


Posts like this go against everything BL stands for.


Were you guesstimating? 


So what if LSD were never known before and it just showed up on the RC market, would you recommend a dose of 1 - 5mgs based on the activity of DOI...etc?

Im guessing he is referring to this post [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showpost.php?p=7657751&postcount=314](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showpost.php?p=7657751&postcount=314)

This chemical has been discussed before.

relax this is probably going to be a hell of a lot less serotnergic and much more like methcathinone. it might be shit but it sounds a lot better than mephedrone and 5ht2b heart issues![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


maybe a weaning process for beta cathinones towards a more speed like audience and a slow digresssion with more real mdma in the future

I'm with Jamshyd on this - 5mg is reckless, particularly since this is a stimulant. If someone took 5mg of LSD (30 hits or so?) they'd trip balls and probably not enjoy it, but they'd live. If someone took 30x the recreational dose of a stimulant, they'd probably be dead. 


I would definately start a lot lower than 5mg, seeing as there's damned near no information on this.


I've got a gram coming in the mail (since i buy every RC i have a chance to >.>), and i plan to start tests in the sub-milligram range. 


My normal protocol is 1/100th what i think the dosage is (confirm no effects at all), 1/10th what i think the dosage will be (confirm only threshold effects), 1/5th, 1/2, full dose.


I am inclined to be similarly cautious with new batches as well, because RC vendors are not immune to human error, and have on occasion shipped the wrong thing. New chemicals just warrant increased caution, because we have four things to guard against (individual sensitivity, possibility of a highly potent material shipped instead of a less potent one, lack of information about correct dosage, and presence of synthesis contaminants is more likely since this may be their first batch) instead of just the first two.

Would it be concieavble to cut buphedrone into dimethocaine and make it into snorting powder that is in reasonable sized rails.  FOr example if 200mg is a good dose of dimethocaine and buphedrone has a good dose of like... 20 mg could you mix in the right poportions so that a rail would be like 100mg dimethocaine 10 mg buphedrone.  I think that it would be a conceivable way to dose accurately.

I think it would be very reckless to mix two unknown chemicals together just for the purpose of getting a correct dosage or a desired high. I would start out with 0.5mg and go from there you can always take more. I would hate someone to rail up or bomb a 130mg dose and have there heart explode, considering this is related to meph, and we have all heard some of the horror stories of that.

Not to accuse, but you deserve a punch in the face if you are going to stick piles of two very obscure research chems together and sell it as coke.


How about you weigh out the bumps of buphedrone by mixing it with something that doesn't get you high or resemble a pricy street drug?

Ya definately not in the plans.  300mg lines just sound painful to me, or am I wrong?


Initially when i read that buphedrone was x times potent than methcathinon i mistook methcathinon as dimethocaine and i assumed that buphedrone would have numbing effects. If it was potent dimethocaine, and dimethocaine is weak cocaine, i thought maybe some strong stuff plus some week stuff could resemble the real thing. I have no intention of selling, just that coke is more rare these days and i'd like an alternative

If you compare methcat and buphedrone molecule structures, you'll exactly know how a lawyer will be thinking.

Well, maybe not a TR, but I for one like to see a summary of each new simple stimulants with comparison to the traditional measuring-rule (plain amphetamine), even though I don't have too much interest in trying them.


How "loopy" is it?


Does it have significant peripheral action?


Is it very vasoconstrictive? (probably - taking the b-ketone -> ephedrine hypothesis into consideration).


Would you say it is more or less euphoric than amphetamine?


Would it make a good study aid?


...etc.


Your input is definitely appreciated though, especially the dose/duration info.

Hey, hey egor what up man this is your buddy in Detroit I might be coming out for the holidays. 


Call me; 


Yea I Agree this looks like more nasty tweak drugs out there. Man they need to make some good opiate analogs clearly this company offering this right now who is legit and very proud and balzy. They really are pushing the bar to new limits I just want them to jump on the opiate train. Something around 100mg and very nice and of course being me I have a fascination with shoving needles in my arms water soluble of course. They did every other door cola! Meth! & X.  Come on give us opiate freaks a minute to bask in the glory of research chems and stop catering to all the burnt out ravers and dirty meth freaks and hook it up with some good blo man! I want to see some crazy morphine or codeine analogs there is much room for alteration with out really sacrificing quality or dose range.

Trouble is opiates are, generally speaking, more dangerous than stims.


Look at Mephedrone; people snort their way through week long binges, taking far more than what would be considered a safe dose.

Now imagine that was an RC opiate, for a start you've got the addiction problems which would undoubtedly arise, as well as the fact that it's much easier to OD on opis than stims.

An opiate RC would all but kill off the scene atm ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Dosed roughly 3-5mg 15 mins ago. Insuffulated.


Slight energy increase, bit of a mood lift. Feels like MDPV but without the 'jitteriness' to it. 


So far so good.

Ahh yes. Potent stuff this seems to be. In an effort to maintain caution and personal safety, I should probably test an IV shot of 50 milligrams on my baby cousin. Maybe she'll give you guys an articulate trip report as well.

My gram arrived yesterday. I have no scales, but by using basic dividing methods, the dose of approximately 10mg (initially) didn't do me any harm. Neither did the later amounts of 20/30/40mg(ish). I'd agree with Luude about the lack of 'jitteriness' compared with MDPV. Also agree with the guy from the other forum's post about it being closer to amphetamine than meph. Unfortunately not close enough. I mostly agree with hugo24...... Just a plain stim. Doesn't really require a trip report. I'll not be buying again.

Sorry xaenima - when you say "plain" stim, what stimulant would you say it comes closest to in character? Would this be appropriate for studying?


Dose of roughly 10mg oral to start seems to be consensus, duration of (?) 3-4 hours?


edit: from your description of doses, I assume there is a desire to redose? How significant would you rank this effect in comparison to other known materials?


Sorry for chattering at you - I'm curious! Thanks for any help.

Agreed. It's a bit lacklustre, it starts to take effect and the energy/mood lift hits but then it grinds to a halt, doesn't really *go* anywhere.


I won't buy again.

Agreed.


20mg insuffated - Mood lift and energy within 5 mins - its good noone can disagree, but to compare to something would be a stronger mood lift than nicotine (if you dont smoke, it feels pretty good).  And doesnt get better... Better than any MDPV for me (but never tried tan).  I would say, one can use this for studying.  Will try chasing on foil sometime...

This is a plain stimulant.


0.05g dose insuffated creates just a feeling of well being for 10-20 mins, followed by energy (a coupla energy drinks) for 2-3 hours, followed by a bit of tiredness and slight unrest.  Could be useful as a study aid, or social performance enhancement (interviews/dates).  Doesnt cause anorexia, or very mininal.


Nothing interessting.

exactly. drugs need to be reviewed like movies, that is, compared against other works in their (pharmacological) genera. *the jerk* is one of the best comedies ever made, but you wouldn't rate it against *2001* because thats a great movie of a **different genera**. thusly rate buphedrone against MPH, AMP, MCAT, MDPV, MDPPP, Desoxypipradrol etc.

I think the main reason for people drawing comparisons to Mephedrone is the naming, which is very illogical and was probably done simply to cash in on Mephedrone's popularity. 


The xdrone naming actually follows a pattern, and that is specifically 4-substituted methcathinones. 


Mephedrone is 4-Methylmethcathinone

Methadrone is 4-Methoxymethcathinone

Flephedrone is 4-Fluoromethcathinone

Brephedrone is 4-Bromomethcathinone


Yet


Buphedrone is alpha-Ethylmethcathinone

To be honest the naming conventions for these Cathinones are a bit useless as there is nothing in the to suggest they are para-substituted. 4MMC and alpha-EMC would make more sense.

No, but the word "methcathinone" (or "methamphetamine") in no way suggests that the methyl is in the N- position, for example. People make these names because they are easier to remember than an alphabet soup.

Less jittery than MDPV, double dosage, lasts 2-3 hours, little crash, little hypersexuality, redose works fine without problems (just dosage rises ~25%), less euphoria and energy than MDPV.


You decide.  I found MDPV not to my taste, I chased the euphoria that wasnt there.  Same with this.

Well, MDPV made me extremely paranoid for some reason, if this stuff isnt as bad i would like it.

May go well with MDAI. A gram would also last a long time with this chemical.

will post a report later today, im on selegiline so im going to start low (although it barely potentiates stimulants the way it used to - now it does not even make MPH 10% stronger) a friend insufflated 20mg and said that it was painless and produced a nice effect, she also said it made her have to shit. she was not very articulate in describing the effects.


more later...

I been researching methcathinone and have seen reports of people taking up to 200mg and getting good results, not that I'm recommemding this, but it may be that buphedrone full effects will be felt at higher dosage, someone suggested the 30-50mg mark in another thread. Best to start off low though.


I also have a friend who has the same effect from coke. GHB does that for me.

Well I'll soon be obtaining 500mg Buphedrone and 1g MDAI, if the above reports are correct then the combination of these two could actually be MDMA-esque territory!


Reasoning behind this many seem to feel MDAI is euphoric and quite MDMA-like but lacks the push or stimulation of it (even to the point of being sedating). So if Buphedrone is more of a stimulant but with not many negative effects (?) then they could work very nicely together. Can't wait to try the combo! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

ok, quick summery of effects i find it less vanilla than expected - it has a euphoric component which is stronger than MPH without question, although i have not attempted to work on it yet i would imagine the euphoria could get in the way as it is causing a bit of "spacyness" (MCAT is notoriously ineffective for ADHD) it also seems to have a surprising lack of anorexic effects - i ate and enjoyed a large slice of pizza during the peak effects. 20mg is comfortable on the body and heart, no tachycardia, no anxiety, mild sweating. in no way is it comparable to MDPV other than it is a stimulant. it is more like amphetamine than anything else, probably could not distinguish the two - im not sure how it will effect a night of socializing - will find out soon. 


thus far i give it good marks, up with MDPPP and Desoxypipradrol in terms of side effect free euphoric stimulants. more trials must be made before i can really judge it accurately though, caffeine would also have many of the qualities i described ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Well, after about 45 minutes I wasn't feeling much off baseline.  Weighed out another 20 mg, dissolved it in a small amount of saline, and shot it up my nose w/ a (needle-less) syringe.


I was previously very tired.. I slept very fitfully last night. Now I feel reasonably awake.  Very little peripheral stimulation -- much smoother than d-amp.  My experience with methylphenidate is limited, but to me this feels closer to MPH than d-amp.


I am merely feel more wakeful and lucid.  No particular desire to talk or clean or do any of the other things that I do when I'm all spun.  Maybe a slight mood-lift.


*shrug*  I suspect it will feel different taken when I'm already wakeful.  Start low -- I might be something of an anomaly.

In my experience, all the previously listed experiences are dead on accurate.  This is an entirely unremarkable stim. Remarkable only in how boring it is. For about 45 minutes to one hour, one gets a very mild and clean feeling of stimulation, completely lacking in euphoria as well as side effects. Then one slowly realizes one is back at baseline.

I'm going to tentatively second the above.


I tried 20 mg this morning before heading to the office and found the stimulation rather useless.  It's more spacey than focused.  Monotonous tasks were less interesting than usual, and I didn't even feel motivated to do the things I generally find interesting.


It has a couple things going for it -- The lack of anorexia is nice, and there doesn't seem to be much insomnia at the tail.  I was able to sleep last night with no trouble.


I'm not sure that I quite *get* this substance.  Is there something I'm missing?

Am I correct in assuming this is a dopamine releaser? If so would combining it with methylphenidate improve it? Since its a dopamine re uptake inhibitor...

just wondering, and hoping I didn't just buy a useless chem. O well maybe my plants will like it haha

yup, the lack of anorexia is pretty remarkable but it has little else going for it. the last nail in the coffin for me is how it does not act as a social lubricant of any kind, one the most asocial stimulants i have ever encountered. too bad, i have now used this several times as well so i feel more validated in my observations. 


i think these simple cathinone subs may still yield something worthwhile but im not sure why bicyclic MPH type structures are not being explored further. off the top of my head i can think of about 15 MPH analogs which would probably be fantastic but these RC vendors are so stubborn about their 'simple' cathinones. if N-ethyl buphedrone came out i would probably give it a taste out of curiosity, but its times like these that i want to give ritalin a big hug and a sloppy kiss.

Ok I'll ask the other so far, to my knowledge, unanswered question: what about IV administration?


And...I'll take a stab at answering it. I just mixed 5mg buphedrone with 115mg desmethyltramadol in 1cc of water and shot it. It burned the inside of my vein quite badly -- this is not something I will do again. I experienced the standard mediocre desmethyltramadol rush, along with that same boring sense of stimulation the buphedrone gives. Have to say that mephedrone provided a better rush IV, but also burned the inside of the vein quite badly and is not an experience I will repeat either.


I'm done with this one, that was the last of my stash fortunately.

So no one has tried pushing the dose above 30mg? I really hope I didn't waste all that money on a useless chem. Anyway to potentiate it/improve it if it is lackluster? Im not looking for the next mephedrone, learned my lesson there, just looking for a straight amphetime type high.

So yeah, after trying 30mg and being generally unimpressed, then trying 60mg (30mg 1h spaced each) and still wondering, WTF this 4x-5x stronger than mcat? I came to this conclusion. I've never tried mcat before, so I can't compare it to buph. But I find that buph is very similar to meph, without the slap. Typical stim crash too.


Maybe I just got low quality material, or we all just got too used to the meph, but this one is nothing special. And I'm not going to be the one to be first to report a 100mg exp or something ridiculous. You may as well buy fucking meph then--or at least methylone if you're concerned about toxicity. This simply and unrighteously is misnamed as a -edrone substance.


Regardless of suggested dosages, always start low with an unfamiliar substance batch. Harm-reduction folks.

It was named buphedrone long before anyone ever thought about making mephedrone...


If it confuses the mephheads then we can call it bk-methaephetamine

I'd agree with the other posters with a few exceptions.


On its own, it's a rather quiet stimulant. Bit of a mild rush at the start (20-30mg insufflated) that has a "flavour" similar to mephedrone, feels nice to go for a walk outdoors and look around. Conversation does feel a bit mechanical, rather than the easy flow of some stimulants.


Mixing with (low) doses of cannabis increases the euphoria.


Mxing with mephedrone provides an interesting experience - a 1:9 mix was used (20 mg buphedrone to 180 mg mephedrone, in ~5-10 rails). Feels very similar to mephedrone, but lasts much longer before the "fiendishness" sets in and the desire to redose is more easily resisted.


I find it fairly interesting but not a huge standout. It's not going to replace mephedrone, but I think it will gain some fans.

I think perhaps everyone is dosing way to low, I tried 30mg originally and got the same type of effects with little euphoria and it wearing off quickly.


Today I've used a total of 380mg spread apart and it's definitely stimulating, and euphoric - perhaps not as much as people were expecting though. I might be biased though as I hardly find anything euphoric at all anymore.


Side effects include: dry mouth, sweaty hands and feet, elevated body temperature, higher resting heart rate (80 BPM), tremor in my hands at a fairly constant frequency, vasoconstriction though I have no way of measuring my BP, no pupil dilation for me


Doesn't feel like it has a big push to it, but I haven't tried moving around at all.


I have some MDAI as well, which I want to try together sometime, bit reluctant to try this until someone else does. 

Body temperature would likely go up even further with a serotonin releaser and I'm already pretty hot in only boxers on a 66F day.


Edit: Don't dose too much, intense vasoconstriction will follow ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I justed this today as my wakeup shot. 20mg Iv

Nothing really interesting there is some stimulation but nothing special at all.


Yesterday when i finished work i tryed some lower dosages (10&15mg) smoked ,snorted and Iv. I was really tyred because i did not sleep well this week (stoped smoking weed for a while).

And it made my a little less sleepy but really nothing special.


I don't really like this chem. I find MDPV much better.

[edit]


This stuff really is not worth your money AT ALL.

It's not worth trying ,i know it's new and we all like to try new stuff but this stuff is wack really wack.

hmmm they began at 20mg lines and snowballed into a two day 1gram binge. i have a heavy tolerance to stims and the binge progam has burned into my reward pathway- it was like coke i kept dosing every five minutes. i get almost nothing desirable from amphetamines unless i have a lot in a binge pattern (otherwise no euphoria/irritability, loss of appetite and bad comedown). 


i just love getting spun and will go for it with anything stim like and have since i was younger- ritalin/cocaine/amphetamine/methylone/coffee/mephedrone/coca tea/etc. this one was nothing new

Getting a 1000mg sample of this. After looking at reports I'd say it looks like people are dosing this too low, but it's always good to start low, and if no, or minor effects are found, then try increasing slowly from there. 


I have 500mg's of MDAI too, might try a combination of it, but not before I've tried each on it's own. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It seems like this drug has a "ceiling effect" where you keep doing more and more, because your not quite where you would like to be, but you just don't get much higher.. I probably went through 80mg last night total (20-30mg snorted each time), and had no problem getting to sleep after a few hours..  also tolerance goes way up way fast so each redose just doesn't seem to do much.


Maybe it doesn't have much of an anorexic effect because its just not that stimulating? Its weird stuff..

Why synth a drug that ends in "-drone"? Because it will sell by the bucketload and make a lotta money I would imagine. Sounds like just yet another shit ketone that only sells cos people are desperate to find a mephedrone replacement that's less toxic to me.

Perhaps try it on its own before combining an unresearched chemical with something else? Who knows what interactions it has? We barely even know what effects it has used alone yet without adding something else into the mix.

I rather liked the stuff - i think the reason people are so down on it is that they were hoping for another mephedrone, which ain't what this is. 


I find it quite a nice, clean stimulant. I normally avoid stims because they feel physically unhealthy, but i don't get that with buphedrone. Granted, i'm taking low doses still, but i think this stuff was definitely worth buying.

My thoughts fall along this line that in conjunction there could be much positive effect. Tbh I'm not going to mention the test combo I'm going to try till I've assessed safety factors and done a test run. Remember this is an rc so be safe with it and any combos

So, what are you bioassayers guessing? Does it feel like dopamine release and adrenergic agonism? Is some monoamine reuptake inhibition expected?

I know guessing is quite worthless but IME different effects on neurotransmitters are to some extent noticeable although of course not truly accurately predictable. Sorry if this is ADD territory...

From my one time free sample experience, I would rank it just above 1,3 DMAA if that tells anyone anything. Feels clean at around 30mg's for about an hour, then turns south rather quickly leaving you basically at baseline by the 2.5 hour mark. Not too much more effect than some quality coffee at the dose I tried.

Research has begun, John doe has just plugged 25mg of buph followed by 15mg bumps every45-1hr and says that is the way to go,very smooth,some euphoria.And this is after a night of consuming 1.5 g of coke,with a full stomach! Friend is very exp in rc s and says it is much smoother than mdpv and has the effect of   mild meph/coke.It is different from meph but it certainly is not worthless!!So if you have been reading the reports don t worry when used correctly it works ,stronger than any coffee my friend has ever drank![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).possible combos is the next ????

Just weighing in on this interesting chemical. Heres a mini trip report:


Plugged 80mg at 8 30 and had a shower. Took about 10 minutes to feel effects, no rush sadly, it just kind of "hit" me. Small amounts of euphoria, primarily just stimulation. Decided to snort 30mg 15 minutes later. No burn, drip has almost no taste, one of the most pleasant chemicals I have ever snorted. Quite stimulated now, not sure if this would be a useful study aid or not though, in my previous trials the effects seemed to fade within an hour or so. This is most certanly active and not a worthless chem, though I am unsure if I would purchase it again. The fact that there is no anorexia is very appealing to me. Going to try combining it with methylphenidate later, im hoping this combination will kick things up a notch. Haha on a funny side note I decided to trim the hedges and became very obsessed, ended up shaving all the hair from my privates, hope the girlfriend likes it haha.

I've been experimenting with my 500mg of Buph. I've found doses of 50mg-100mg insufflated to produce the best effects. I find it very similar to Amphetamine, as amphetamine itself doesn't give any profound euphoria or stimulation but still present.

I've found the best way to use this chem is by snorting a bump every 30 minutes. It can be quite fiendish this way though, went through about 400-500 mg last night. Very reckless of me, however I was fine the entire time. Had some trouble sleeping, though it wasnt to bad, was asleep within two hours of my last dose. Very nice in combination with JWH-018, quite a nice body high.

Totally agree,islander. 30-50mg bumps after initial dose works well.Defintley fiendish though,oh well.I noticed once over the 300-400mg range-this chem comes alive-I like this chem over 200mg range,with thc,gives a nice speedball effect for me=)

Looks like this one is more of a combo drug then something to take on its own, cannibinoids are reported to be great with it i wonder how it would be in combination with MDAI.

Here is my TR from the previous combo which I mentioned being MDAI 100mg , 40 mg Tianeptine and 5 mg Buphedrone. However I staggered the dose of buphedrone so frist ingested MDAI and Tianeptine then half an hour into it ingested Buphedrone. please dont shoot me down over this TR Ive tried to keep it as informative as possible.


everything here was weighted 


0.15 starting to feel effects of Mdai not unlike a 180 mg dose 

0.30 effects are now at their full intensity same as MDAI on its own 

ingested 5 mg Buphedrone 

0.50 no noticeable effects made decision to increase buphedrone effect by another 15 mg 

1.10 effects starting to become pronounced no eye wobbles , just an increase empathy and a big grin. 

1.30 decided to re dose again at 10 MG buphedrone


Effects lasted a total of 4 hours before starting a journey to baseline. Overall the effects were similar to MDMA minus any nasty kickers etc etc . Lots of euphoria , lots of empathy , tactile sensations were increased, the clarity was one thing I have to comment on everything was sharp and clear but not displeasing to the eye, musical appreciation was also heightened. 


Another interesting point for this is that there was no pupil dialation and no gurning in fact no dry mouth as with mephedrone and Mdai combos


I think if you were looking for the dirty Ekkie effect you will be disappointed this is a combo that you can get up and dance to or lax out have those deep and meaningful convos. 


There was some desire to redose but not a "feinding" effect


Come down was very minimal if any, sleep was some what difficult. Another note to mention is that mental tiredness was non existant two days on from my experience and I am still surprised that I havent had a "Crash" will see if there is a wacky wednesday tho. 


Friends who were with me did comment that they thought you could increase the Buphedrone dosage 10 - 20 mg they also par took of this combination


have also posted this in mdai thread

thanks for the report.I agree that it s defintley a combo chem. It s also  combo s well with certain party pills,have had excellent results combining.Basically 30-60mg lines every 30-45min. totally added a nice euphoric rush that lasted . on top of the already speedy/euphoric pill buzz=)It was just one of those unplanned successful events, I didn t think would be that NICE.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Worth repeating with latest 'party pill'- r.d

Some people participating this thread have taken doses near 100mg and seem to have been more disapointed than buzzed in an amphetamine like way. Others get stim effects on doses inbetween 5-20mg. This confuses me a lot.


I usually take 70mg Dexedrine or inject 150mg racemic amphetamine sulphate (purified street amp.) to catch a nice amphetamine buzz.


How much buphedrone would one need to get this level of stimulation?


Wikipedia claims this compound to be more potent than MCAT but reading through this read makes me seriously doubt that. It wouldn't be the first time the "facts" in wiki are not so on point.


I also have an amount of this stuff on the way to me and am anxious to get it so i can judge it's potency on my own.

this chem is fantastic!


its alright on its own but with MDAI it really shines.


just dosed:


120 mg MDAI - oral (T:0) - 2 hours ago

1 ml GBL - oral on empty stomach (T:20)

45 mg buphedrone - insufflated (T:30)

and just did another 20 mg insufflated


i am very pleasantly buzzed right now and quite shocked at how potent this combo is.  no jitters, no anxiety, no peripheral stimulation or gastric side effects (which MDPV cripples me with) - just a nice, smooth euphoric high.


i highly recommend this combo.

very similar to MDMA in all respects.

See my earlier trip report for what it would be like on it's own the dosage range was set low because I was using tianeptine as a potentiator. 


At some point I will be attempting an mdai and buph combo on it's own. It's been a couple of weeks since my report and out of all our experiences this I think is my fab but there are many more tests to come ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I have already posted this in an ADD thread, but this combination is so good (and cheap) that I feel compelled to share it in this thread too:


Mixing [Geranamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylhexanamine), which has primarily CNS NE releasing\reuptaking inhibiting effects with a relatively low PNS profile, with buphedrone which seems to be more of a mild DARI lacking the NE 'push', in a 3:2 ratio (30mg buphedrone : 20mg Geranamine, etc) is WONDERFUL.


It feels very similar to cocaine, but less edgy, and with much less fiending. Also, it seems to last a good deal longer (You get a nice plateau for around an hour).


Geranamine is fucking CHEAP too, I picked up 2 grams(2000mg) from a site I quickly found on google for $5 shipping included... 0_0


This is an excellent way to stretch out the buphedrone, and honestly the high from 50mg buphedrone and ~30mg geranamine is WAY better than the buzz from sniffing 100mg buphedrone by itself...you're not only stretching it out and saving money you're getting a better drug-experience.


Their durations are also both very similar. I took all of my remaining buphedrone and combined it with geranamine in a 3:2 mix, there's really no reason to do it by itself. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


EDIT: All doses in this post are for insufflation. I've come to the conclusion that although buphedrone has a nice rush smoked, it's very inefficient and I feel like a good amount is probably wasted because after 10 minutes you just feel slow and stupid. Sniffing it with geranamine produces a nice euphoria with ample stimulation but very little "jitteryness". I'm on a few fat rails right now ^_^


Also, geranamine burns like HELL snorted. It only hurts for 10 seconds tops though, but it is absolutely excruciating. Still a very nice combo though!

^I don't know, I always felt that geranamine was like the bodily part of ethcat, so I don't believe geranamine has primarily CNS NE releasing/reuptake inhibiting abilities. I wonder how it mixes with ethcathinone though?

According to wikipedia, 1,3 DMAA is a central NE releaser\reuptake inhibitor. Solo trials with it have confirmed to me that it has a relatively small effect on the heart in contrast with the mental stimulation and energy until you get to pretty high doses.


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylhexanamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylhexanamine)


Also, searching through body building forums (which is primarily the field geranamine is utilized) show that most people find it mentally clarifying and stimulating but physically benign.

Geranamine is also one of the main ingredients (along with piperazines) in many "herbal ecstasy" pills and other legal high concoctions. Not generally held in high regard even by legal high standards.

Wiki also states that "Geranamine itself has not been researched intensively, with its pharmacological profile not looked at since Eli Lilly filed its patent in 1944, stating that the stimulant effects on the CNS are less than that of amphetamine or ephedrine.[5]"


Ephedrine hasn't a good cns/pns ratio and geranamine is even worse.

I think those claims were made on a weight(mg) basis, I.E: Geranamine is less potent a stimulant in general than ephedrine or amphetamine.  


I agree that ephedrine has a terrible ratio of central : peripheral effects, but 1,3 DMAA is not worse in this regard by any means. I have a 2 gram bag of the stuff and I've already done several bioassays,mostly with buphedrone but a few times by itself; I also have plenty of experience using 25mg "Bronkaid" ephedrine tablets over the past few years for energy.


I have found that, in agreement with the literature and experiences out there, 1,3 DMAA is DEFINITELY less PNS-oriented than ephedrine.

I'm aware of that, and I agree that there is very little recreational effect to be gotten from 1,3 DMAA alone, but in combination with buphedrone it is a GREAT complement.

So are there any neurotoxicity issues with this chemical, any guesses? Does it feel like it might have some issues like with mephedrone (havent tried it but so I've heard)? Also how long it will last, and which doses you should start with? Can you boost it or will it be pointless after few boosts (like with 4-FA or methylone, ie. leaving you with headache and spaced out) and is it compulsive? How about sife-effects, any anxiety, paranoias or depression during or after use (comedown)?


I'd like to try this alternative to amphetamine or is this more like MDMA?


Thanks for answers.

I must say, i love this stuff... I can still eat on it, it doesn't cause heart-racing/discomfort, and it gets euphoric with a little repeated dosing, and adding weed increases the euphoria greatly.

This imo would not get much out of the chemical. Buphedrone is a straight stimulant selective for DA. 


methylone already has plenty of DA and NE action, and it is seen as deficient in that it's serotonin release is weaker than many would like, so it's more stimulant and less entactogen (compared to MDMA, which seems to be the standard). 


The logic of many of the combinations with buphedrone + MDAI + etc is that the MDAI will provide serotonin release, while the stimulant/methylone contributing the DA/NE component. 


Also... BUPHEDRONE IS NOT ALPHA ETHYL METHCATHINONE! 


If you add an ethyl to the alpha carbon, you still have the methyl there. Buphedrone replaces the alpha methyl with an ethyl group.

This substance seems to have a reverse tolerance. First trial was nothing interesting, second trial got euphoric in very high doses, and last trial worked great after just 1 line (cant say the exact dose).


Anyone else noticed this?

Yep, I do but that goes for any stimulant that are not too serotonergic. I don't believe that reverse tolerance theory, at least not for stims, more like learning the high (controlling your mind) It is like there are knobs inside my head which I can adjust different feelings.


It's an amazing stimulant though that lasts long and gets you highly productive. Been grinding music production 6 hours straight. I still get a weird feeling like the bodys got surrounded by some soft wooly aura, which I don't find too pleasant. Maybe it's me sweating?


But meh, still miss MDPV, it's illegal where I live.

I think its more then just learning the high, in my first trial it didnt even work for my anhedonia. I think its just sensitization occuring, something that has been well demonstrated to happen in rodents with amphetamine and other stims.

I think I am sold. It looks promising anyway. I am still a little warry of things that are new and unresearched. Even a few small scale experiments, or bodies of anecdotal evidence would make me more confident. It looks like a potential winner though.

**Buphedrone and Geranamine**


Hi,


It's been a couple months, any side effects to note?


Has anyone else found a similar combo?

I've come to the conclusion that although buphedrone has a nice rush smoked, it's very inefficient and I feel like a good amount is probably wasted because after 10 minutes you just feel slow and stupid. Sniffing it with geranamine produces a nice euphoria with ample stimulation but very little "jitteryness". I'm on a few fat rails right now ^_^

swim have did(oral) 40mg geranamine and 100mg mephedrone (she still not tried buphedrone yet)  and it felt nice. but she was under influance of other chems so cant tell exactly how much geranium changed the experience. but it was deffo felt, the effect was much better than from just 100mg meph.

I have given this a few tries now and I would say that its a very plain stim.


I'm not sure if you can actually refer to the effects as being high. I would say it makes you feel awake, alert and a bit more talkative, but doesn't seem to give that "in your face" high feeling that other stims does.


That being said I still like it as a booster when drinking or smoking weed and I haven't noticed any come down or any other negative after effects at all.

**Info**


Hiya, ive been using this devious powder for a bit now. Pure, is very strong be careful not to go over the top. a small line lasts a good 2 hours. i find its a good idea to mix it with something like creatine about 70:30 (30 being the creatine) makes it very easy to take. Make sure you know when to say "enough!" because its far to easy to continue for days on end. Better than meph, more bang for your buck than coke and a very clean comedown. i rate it.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Whats the differences betweeen real amphetamine amd buphedrone? 


Or are the effects something like more meph/meth/mdma style?


Sounds interesting if it is feels like real speed.

The buphedrone i have is active. (it doesn't came from uk... if it does change something...)

50 mg give a nice awake feeling for... 1 hours and half. meph give me the same things during 4 to 5 hours but needs more quantity though.

Then i still get some boring stimulation, which reminds me butylone.

The high is too short.

it doesn't feel like amph.

At 10mg:

I definitely find a mood-lift action from buphedrone. I could even call it an anti-depressant with a stimulant aspect.

for me it's not like amph, mph or 2-dpmp. Totally different: it's not pushy at all.

I'm not a fan of it, but it can help to have a good time without feeling tired.

It's pretty much like strong caffeine if u snort like 30mg. Not that great.

Any novel combo ideas for this one? Doesn't shine at all on it's own - a bit boring stimulation and as other mention after comedown there is some lingering fatigue and stress reminding of the negative aspects of butylone. Thinking that lower doses could add some oomph to other compounds instead?

To my surprise I just got 0.1g sample of this in an mdpv/alpha-ppp order...


Not really looking forward to it loads, but free things are always good ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Will report if I get around to trying it.

I just got some buphedrone and don't know what to expect still after reading this.


I was happy to about the geranmine mix. Finally! Maybe I can put some of this useless DMAA around here to some good experimenting!

And doesnt get better... Better than any MDPV for me (but never tried tan).  I would say, one can use this for studying.  Will try chasing on foil sometime...

I vaporised ~50mg buphedrone sourced from the now-defunct BTM when this compound first was available from them.


I got a FAT rush initially.


In further experiments, I was never able to replicate that initial rush. Not even close.


This is really an odd chem. My combo stands though, buph+DMAA 3:2 is a dirt cheap way to really max this one out.

Have just been binging on this for the last 24 hours, was stupid enough to convince myself that I could just take one dose then go to sleep, but that never happened. Feel horrible now, last dose was around 3 hours ago, still feel very stimmed. I got up to taking 100mg doses as the smaller doses weren't doing much anymore. Have a feeling that it will be had to sleep tonight.


Has anyone else had any problems sleeping after a bit of a buphedrone binge? I have some diazepam so will be taking about 30mg of that to help, really wish that I had stopped sooner, don't think I will be in a fit state for work tomorrow. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


edit - does anyone have any tips for reducing the comedown tomorrow, am going to force some food into me in a bit so that should help, gonna drink plenty of water and have a shower tonight and tomorrow morning. Really want to be able to go to work tomorrow but am not going if I have a hellish comedown. The sleep dep comedown will be bad enough if my diaz doesn't help me sleep.

Yup, this is a very strange little chemical. Just got some for the first time today. So far I don't know what to make of it. Started off this morning with 20mg orally, barely felt anything, just felt a tiny bit of a mood lift. An hour later decided to go for broke and took another 80mg orally. Still barely felt anything, just a tiny bit stimulated, nothing more.


I let another hour pass and insufflated 100mg. A bit of a burn but a fairly sweet taste to it, very similar to ethcathinone (which I have only had in the form of a legal high called 'white columbia' but was told it was of above 98% purity) and also similar in taste and texture to the legal high 'Gogaine' currently on sale in British head shops (Was on hols there recently and it was all I could get my hands on, no idea what's in it, which goes against my ethos, possibly dmc? Just pure stimulation, a bit cokey, not very nice). Anyway began to feel much more stimulated but unfortunately began to feel fairly anxious. I then read that orally, this chem is much smoother so after another hour and a half, I took another 100mg, in a gelcap this time rather than in water. Am currently waiting to feel the full effects of that one but can report that I am starting to feel slightly more motivated to do things. I need to cut the lawn, something I hate doing due to the monotony of it (it's a big lawn), I now feel no sense of dread about it which I was feeling earlier, I actually kind of want to do it! We shall see how I feel when I am actually doing it. Anxiety has died down a good bit strangely enough, mood has improved nicely although I don't feel the need to talk and communicate more like i do with m1 or any entactogen/stim. Then again this should not be compared to an entactogen because it lacks them qualities - not completely though, I do now feel a lot more relaxed, and motivated as I mentioned earlier. Come to think of it I would also really like to just chill and watch some entourage or 30 rock, something light, definitely not six feet under!


As I write I am starting to feel better. 300mg thus far today and am not feeling overly stimulated or overly anxious at all. Orally is without a doubt the way to go if you want to feel in any way good on this chem, I did not like the way I felt after insufflating. As far as the doses go, I always tend to need higher doses of almost everything I take than everyone else but from what I can gather, higher doses are definitely required for this chem in order to feel any of the positive effects. When I say positive effects, I don't mean that it's very euphoric, nor do I mean that it provides coke or d-amp stimulation. It is very subtle. A 'background high' as somebody previously stated would best describe it. As rc's go, definitely not one of the more interesting ones out there, but seeing as it has lifted my mood, which has been very low as of late, I am somewhat happy with it. Also it's all I have. I am also admittedly at the same time somewhat disappointed as I would have much preferred more euphoria. Heart rate hasn't increased either, it does rise a bit with exertion though.


I am not recommending this to anybody looking for something to equal the likes of meph, m1, mdpv, (even) 4-fmc, or any euphoric stimulant. Realistically all this has going for it is the price of it and the bit of a mood lift it gives. Also the very manageable and smooth/subtle stimulation, if one finds that desirable. Honestly the only reason I bought this is because it was ridiculously cheap (can I say how much it cost?, it was sooo cheap!) and my vendor was out of m1. Probably a good thing, gives my serotonin levels a chance to level out, went on a bit of a methylone binge about a month and a half back, went through 10 g's of it on my own over the space of a couple weeks. Christ I really over-did that, in the end my tolerance had risen so much that I was needing doses in excess of 750mg to get any effects. In the beginning all I needed was a maximum of 150 - 200mg for some beautiful euphoria. God I love methylone! Has one of the best come-up feelings ever and when you reach the peak it is just plain gorgeous. I'm sure any of you will tell me how ridiculously high a dosage that is and I am fully aware of it. I do have a rather addictive personality and seeing how addicting that m1 can be, perhaps I should avoid it for a while longer and in the future, if ordering, only order small amounts. 


As far as the addictive qualities of buphedrone go, I would say it is not very addicting. With insufflation however I could see it becoming increasingly more-ish with each dose, especially for the people who are used to the constant impulse to re-dose on meph or people who just enjoy that very stimulated feeling as they will keep chasing a high that isn't really there. People may also try to chase euphoria that just isn't there. No matter how much you re-dose, it's just not going to happen from what I can gather. Compulsive re-dosing intranasally will only lead to what I would imagine to be very uncomfortable stimulation that only a xanax or a valium will counteract. Buph has actually proven to be the most clear-headed high I have ever experienced and nobody will know you are on it, unless you are sniffling from snorting, which is inevitable with this, I almost gave myself away after the line I took.


I have a good bit of this in my possession and I have a feeling that it will be in my possession for quite a long time as I do not have much interest in doing this very often. Will definitely be combining this with other chems as I feel doing this will give the most rewarding results. I have some 4-FMC and 4-MEC on the way so I will begin experimentation then. Haven't tried 4-MEC yet, but from what I have heard I think I am going to like it. Heard it gives a great chill out buzz and is fairly euphoric, although nowhere near as euphoric as meph. That doesn't bother me as all I want is to be good and chilled out yet motivated at the same time, sociable, nothing getting me down, forget my problems, having a good time, you know, the usual expectations that come along with a euphoric stim. I just hope it isn't as hard on serotonin as m1 or 6-apb, I highly doubt it. Will write reports after the combo's if they are in any way interesting. Here's hoping!


I stated earlier that buph hasn't made me more chatty or sociable, which it hasn't done, but I have been typing and thinking about what to type for well over an hour now which is something I can usually never do recently due to inability to concentrate for any prolonged period of time which is due to my high anxiety levels as of late. So I would guess from this that buph at higher doses could very well be used as a study aid. Honestly, recently, I can't even concentrate on writing a text message, or read an article in a newspaper without completely zoning out! Or maybe this is just the closest I can get to human interaction today, being out of work and home alone during the day. Who knows!


Quick question, has anybody taken buph on top of alcohol? Wondering if it would increase sociability. I remember naphyrone on its own just gave me stimulation and jaw clenching but on top of a few pints it proved to be quite the social lubricant. Thinking buph at a high dose after a few drinks might do the same. Then again it could very well just negate the effects of the alcohol. We shall see this weekend.


Apologies if I have been rambling and getting off-point at times but hope you enjoy the read, I have actually enjoyed typing this. Now I am off to cut the lawn! Peace.

^^wow, long stim post, I can relate to the buphedrone induced ramblings. Had some previous experience with buphedrone myself, good and bad. Be carefull with the repeated doses, and try and get some food inside you don't stay up too long or stim psychosis can be a very real possibility.

Just wanted to summarise my own experiences with this chem from the past few months:


1) On its own, agree it doesnt do much. I thought I had a dud on my hands.

2) Now agree this is an 'icing on the cake' chem. Adding it to my favourites (that have worn off their magic a bit) makes it my birthday all over again ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

3) Highly recommended mixes  a) 200mg Mephedrone + 20-25mg Buphedrone ;  b) 180mg bk-MDMA + 20-25mg Buphedrone ;


Party safe and n-joy

I've used buph a couple times since my last super long-winded post and have come to the conclusion after experimenting with lots of different doses, this has little to no recreational value. It either made me not feel anything at all or overly-aware and paranoid, there is nothing nice about buph, waste of time and money. I did combine with 4-mec once and that just added some stimulation nothing spectacular. I just do not like this chem. Don't know what happened with my earlier post.

I've recently experimented with buphedrone in doses ranging from 5-30 mg (insuff.) and 5-60 (oral). At best, the effects feel like a toned-down amphetamine or caffeine stimulation, with mild to negligble euphoria. It does increase alertness, and at high oral doses it seems to enhance spontaneity and creative thought processes, but at more moderate doses it does not promote sociability, unlike other stims. The stimulation of ones body does not feel synchronized with the thought process, and thus it does not appear to greatly increase focus in doses below 45-50 mg (oral). I find that it is most effective orally, and while its effects  have a slightly unrefined quality, it definitely has potential as a utiliatrian/study drug.

Not to experianced with cathinones.. but here's something I found interesting 

"20-25MG nasally produces a pretty good rush, pretty much the most enjoyfull thing about this compound is the music enhancement during the come up, then like everyone else states it's more so just levels out into energy with a slight mood elevation. Kind of makes me think of what I feel like cathine would be like, except a lot less potent and dirty. Also slightly compulsive redosing, definitaly was a helping hand during a long work day but woulden't invest to much into it, or to harm yourself by doing it to much ."

Yes, any ideas of buphedrone's self life?


Reading all the experiences most were negative. I am not surprised... 


But... Has anyone here used a low dose buphedrone in the gym?? I always want to keep my body in a relatively good shape, but I ll start and quit the gym all to often... 


Buphedrone is AMAZING for energy and motivation for exercise/weight lifting and I have tried more than a few commercial products. No comparison, seriously...! 


Any feedback at all on this? Also any ideas on the toxicity of buphedrone, I read a post from some self described "toxicologist" claiming that buphedrone is toxic, when I contact him for further information I never got a reply.

i also asked about shelf-life over in Advanced Drug Discussion, and got this response:

I find this stim to be pretty functional, pretty light in the euphoria department though, easier going on the body too compared to other stims. But nothing to write home about at all. I find 18-25mg bumps every 30-60 minutes to be a decent amount to keep a mild stimulation going. Weed blends with it alright but still no blast of impressive euphoria. Just a question, are there different looking batches around I've read of a few different descriptions, mine is a clumpyish white fine powder. Not that it makes seems to be making any difference if there is as all the reports are basically the same. And surprisingly compulsive considering the mild effects.

I'd have to say N-Ethyl-Buphedrone was much gentler and euphoric than regular Buphedrone for me.

Keep in mind that we combine a releaser with an reuptake inhibitor. 


My guess:  If the NRI effect of the buphedrone is not negligible, combined with the NR effect of the geranamine could lead to heart overload


If the Dopamine releasing effect of the geranamine is not negligible, combined with the DARI effect of the buphedrone, could also lead to heart overload.


The ratio of 3/1  : geranam/buphed  seems ok for functional purposes


Someone must try a combo of 30 mg geranamine + 10 mg buphedrone orally  ..
