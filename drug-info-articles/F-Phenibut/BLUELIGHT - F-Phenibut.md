I'd say that's fascinating, but you stopped at only 2.5 hours.  I figure it must have taken at least 2.5 hours to measure 350-400mg with your mg scoop, but then the irony at that imprecision can't be an exaggeration.

He is probably using one of those 0.15cc scoops (1/32th ish of a teaspoon) that tend to get packaged with a lot of "nootropics" these days. Or something similar.


Those spoons are widely inaccurate, as scrofula alluded to. It even says so on the packaging mine came with: it says the scoop can measure anywhere between 20-90mg per scoop. This can depend on things like density of the powder, lunar cycles, whether you had Wheaties or lucky Charms for breakfast, how many people are currently farting in a 100 mile radius of you, etc


I found f-phenibut to be more around x7.5 times stronger than phenibut mg per mg. Everyone's different though.


I also found f-phenibut didn't have quite the same magic that large doses of phenibut provide. It's similar just not as recreational for me. Less of a next day afterglow too. F-phenibut also kicked in much quicker and didn't last nearly as long.

Phenibut is extremely fun for me. Perfect for a relaxed Saturday  or Sunday. I take a teaspoon in my mouth and wash it down!! I was using it once a week for awhile but started getting tolerance longer hangovers so I haven't done it in awhile.

I have been experimenting with F-Phenibut for a while now at doses ranging from 250mgs--1,000mgs and know all about how it effects me personally.


My favorite dosage is 1,000mgs personally but it leaves me knocked out for like 15 hours the night after and is very sedating and the tub suggests no more than 250mgs but that dosage is just SUCH a mild high.


I WAY WAY prefer it to regular Phenibut, I mean there's no comparison whatsoever.


The more I take the longer it lasts and I've felt 1,000mgs for up to 30 hours at a time and it routinely lasts that long, but lower dosages may last more like 16 hours or so.


I regularly work out on it and that provides a great effect and have mixed it with Kratom, alcohol, weed, nitrous and caffeine.


It gives me great dreams as well.


Doses ranging from 250mg (which is really too light for a great effect but gives a nice extra "buzz" to the day to 550mgs are good to be functional and not knocked out forever that night.


I have actually written several posts about this substance on this forum if you want to look them up, where I go into more detail, and my guess is that I'm about as experienced as anyone on this forum with this stuff.


I have never had any WD symptoms and I know I can keep it that way cause if I ever use 1,000mg doses I won't use it more than twice a week, (NEVER 2 days in a row at that dose), but I've done doses ranging from 250--450 mgs 3-4 times in a week, which I think is too often and won't do again...but the most I got was one day I had mild social anxiety the day after, but I have social anxiety anyway so it might or might not have been mild rebound effect.


It's really good stuff...WAY better IMO than regular Phenibut for reasons I could go into if asked.


I hope it's not significantly more dangerous, which I tend to doubt it is so far as I've experienced so few side effects, but it most certainly is stronger there's no question about that.


If done sporadically and spaced out at least like I have, at least FOR ME, it seems not to produce dependence, but it would if I did it too often so it's ESSENTIAL no one does.


I've learned the ropes with it well enough so far that I'm confident I can continue to be fine with the stuff if not used more frequently or in higher doses than I have so far.


If anyone has any questions then just ask.

I hope everyone did see the problem with using scoops to measure mass?  A scoop measures volume.  So let's say I have a 15 gram scoop, aka a Tablesppon (15mL).  It can measure 15 grams just fine (it came from a factory with specs tighter than for the LHC, coated with a water-repellent substance from beyond the solar system).  As long as what you want is 15 grams of ultra-pure* water*.  At 4C, 1atm.


How much does 15mL of aqueous uranium oxide weigh?  Or 15mL of hydrogen gas?


Anyway, this is about whether that counts as a trip report or not.  


For all the comparisons being made, the proper reference is *not phenibut.  *This is *baclofen*, with a fluorine atom where the chlorine is, on *baclofen*.  My question then is how this compares to *baclofen*, and can anyone share a theory for producing differential effects by swapping one halogen with another?  Presumably they at least still target the same receptors?

I've never done baclofen so I don't know how they compare, only how it compares to regular Phenibut.


I'd definitely tell everyone to use a milligram scale like I do and not a scoop as it is much more accurate.

lol @ paint-chips... does one dip or just dive in? hahaha <-sorry but had a good laugh: Wife asked what I am laughing at. I tell her paint-chips. anyway....

I just got a tub of phenibut and the package says dosage is 250mg (~Half of scoop). Just broke it out and put it to the scale (leveled scoop weight varies between .40-.45 grams). Digitals are in need if there is gonna be experimentation with *any* bulk product if there be any attempt at control/caution: This is of course my own opinion and we all have them.

That being said: I am new to it and have dosed twice... yesterday afternoon @ 250 (weighed) and this morning about 800-900 (scooped) before work. I know when it hits me as a big-ass grin spreads across my face for a few seconds... hilarious.                       .

Hello BL'ers, long time no see. Sorry in advance for the length & lack of TLDR.


I had quite a history with phenibut HCl back in the day ([my whole story on that affair is here](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/705198-My-Phenibut-Affair-(Really-F-n-Long))) but it's been a long, long, long time since I've used any of that and really any drugs at all in fact.


Please note during this following ordeal in particular I was 100% drug abstinent with the exception of very occasional Etizolam use (like once/month).


This involves F-Phenibut, also known as Fluorophenibut. I saw it for sale about 6 months ago at a popular vendor and thought it may bring back the original magic of the phenibut experience so I ordered it. Prior to that I hadn't touched phenibut (HCl, FAA or otherwise) for at least a year since it brought me nothing but negative effects. As an aside the vendor in question has purity tests which are always upwards of 99.7% pure so I am certain it was the real deal.


My first time taking this new f-phenibut I orally ingested 100mg dose and it gave me a very light-headed, dizzy & borderline scary come-up followed by many of the typical symptoms such as uplifted mood, motivation, social anxiolysis and deep sleep on queue (with occasional yet scary sleep paralysis episodes). One thing I should note is the first time I took it I fell asleep on a couch while eating and someone tried waking me and apparently I was totally out, they were playing cymbals, loud music, anything to wake me and I wouldn't budge. Scary, but not enough to get me to stop at the time. I experimented with the potential for physical addiction by using a few days in a row and jumping off cold turkey -- each time I experienced no withdrawal symptoms other than taking an extra 30 minutes to fall asleep the first night.


Thus began my use of f-phenibut daily every day for the next 3 months with doses ranging from 300mg-1gram/day. The one thing I love about the phenibut class is that it gets me really, really motivated & gives an ultra-enhanced appreciation of music so I was hitting the gym daily and never felt better.


However one day 6 weeks ago there was a sign that something may be wrong which came toward the tail end of my routine morning 3-mile run. I'd begin having a dull-to-sharp pain in my chest, specifically in the area of my heart. At that point I'd stop my run and all would be well after a few minutes of cooling down. I am prone to anxiety especially anything related to my heart or breathing so it was extremely disconcerting at the time so I decided I should cut back on the f-phenibut. While cutting back I was still doing my morning runs and still having the pain that would go away afterwards. One day (about a month ago now) everything changed.


I got off the treadmill and instead of cooling down my heart continued racing like I was still on the treadmill -- upwards of 185 beats/minute (my normal running rate is 155 beats/minutes) which culminated in a minor panic attack at the gym which went away on the ride home. However this time the chest pain remained. I finished my morning routine getting ready and went to work. Chest still hurting, like a dull aching pain. With each ache my heart would pound faster. I tried dosing f-phenibut in hopes it would relax me, instead it had a paradoxical effect which had my heart racing 190 beats/minute culminating in a full-blown panic attack. I told my boss I needed to go to the hospital because I think I'm having a heart attack -- it was surreal. 


Arriving at the hospital they immediately do an EKG since I'm only 30 they thought it could be serious. The EKG came back "no heart attack" but my heart was still hurting and racing intermittently. They did blood work and everything was good so they discharged me with a referral to see a cardiologist.


Fast forward one month today and I haven't touched f-phenibut (or any phenibut) since the trip to the ER. My heart is still hurting with a nearly constant dull pain with intermittent palpitations and "shooting" pains. I am still having panic attacks daily (prior to all this my last full-blown panic attack was during a bad mushroom trip in high school over 10 years ago) and there seems to be no end in sight. Even a single sip of caffeinated coffee will send my heart racing to red zone levels. I can't do my morning runs anymore either because I'll get sharp chest pains and my heartbeat skyrockets way past normal levels so I'm naturally terrified of what would happen if I attempted one of my 3-mile runs. I don't know what this drug did to me but it is nothing to take lightly. I'd trade this for the worst phenibut HCl withdrawal you can imagine any day and trust me I've had plenty of them but they were over by the 5th or 6th day. I'm starting to think I've done long-term damage with this research chamical and thanks to the fact that it's not been through clinical trials there's no real technical literature outside the guys over on the advanced drug discussion forum here on BL. 


The one saving grace which makes me think it may be some serious anxiety and not truly my heart is that when I take 2MG of Etizolam the pain disappears completely as well as the accompanying panic attacks. 


I'm supposed to find out either way next week when I see a cardiologist for stress test and a 72-hour halter monitor. I'll keep you guys posted. 

Not to mods: if you need a question in this post to keep it in OD then I'd like to ask if anyone has experienced and heart-related issues specifically from the phenibut class.


EDIT: as fucked up as it sounds part of me typed this out so that on the off chance that I seriously damaged myself and I die hopefully my family and friends will know the truth of what happened.

That sounds really unpleasant OP. I hope everything works out for you. I also had some weird issues with my heart a few years ago that no doctor was able to diagnose, and that no medication relieved. I was like you, I couldn't have a sip of coffee or even a bite of chocolate without my heart exploding out of my chest. Eventually it did go away, thank god. 


I would definitely take it easy on the physical exertion and all stimulants until you figure out the issue. Flouro-phenibut is too new for us to really have a good idea of its long term effects... A doctor would know better than us anyway.


Good luck!

Are you sure this is the F-baclofen, OP?  The only med you still take is the etizolam, and it's the only thing that takes the pain away.  


A lot like I used to be with booze, the only thing that could take my pain away . . . .  I know etizolam is said to be less prone to dependence, but it's still a substantial risk, and people can get hooked on anything.

have you considered the possibility that the shorter half life could cause interdose WD much more readily than traditional phen? you were using daily for months ... 'heart pain', tight chest, panic attacks, trouble breathing are all classic gaba withdrawal symptoms, IME.

Whoa, just realized, I mean, it's probably the etizolam at this point--since taking more relieves your symptoms--but you were taking an enormous dose of your f-baclofen.


Cl-phenibut, aka, baclofen, has a FDA rec. maximum daily dose of 80mg, divided.  It seems clear that swapping a chlorine for a fluorine actually just makes it a slightly weaker version of regular baclofen, but even if it was only half the potency of regular baclofen, that would mean you shouldn't exceed 160mg/day.  You claim you were taking up to a gram, which almost certainly would have caused major side effects and a serious withdrawal syndrome.


You're lucky to have escaped your "F-Phenibut" experience without a hangover.


Don't believe me?  Pick the F-baclofen from the F-phenibut:

What to do?


As advised by others in previous thread I tried the 'road well travelled' route first of trying baclofen. The effect seemed very much in the right direction but it felt dirty in terms of body load not the psychoactive effect and not just a subliminal thing I had a load of junk on my tonsils which I never usually get after a day or two after I took it. Tried it 2 times and same dirty feeling on the body. I cannot abid an anxiolytic (or any drug) if it feels uneasy in the body and I can't wait for it to clear out of my system.


I would like to try the flouro version especially since I recall how I used to think regular amphetamine was so dirty and vile then I tried 2-fa and that baby was clean as a whistle; I could hardly believe it.


A few years ago I was less cautious and I rationalised that if other are taking a substance and doing ok then no probs why I shouldn't try. 


But now I am alot more anxious about trying anything new but especially unresearched things. I almost made an order. I had ordered but just didn't end up paying as my anxiety spiked at the thought.


On the other hand it does sound like it could be a boon to one's life for the positive benefits it could offer.


It surely can't be that risky to take it riiiight? considering how much crap alot of the more reckless rc sceners shovel into themselves constantly. I mean there are serious problems now and then but for the amount of stuff people take it is very rare isn't it in comparison.


Look at all the thousands of kids who were taking mephedrone when it was legal or when mdma first came around in the 90s millions probably. Not to say that just cos alot of people are doing it is a good idea of course ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) but maybe just that everything is unresearched at some point and the question is whether or not you should have to wait around for the pharma industry to catch up if something arrives which seems more promising than their offerings.


And it isn't like a total outlier drug eh? so far the consensus from the gathered subjective experiences is that it behaves just as expected. 


I mean if flouro substitution is such a common practice in the pharma industry why is this any different. I mean if it has been done 100 times in pharma industry and the result was just as expected can we not infer with a good amount of confidence that this being 101 that it will behave like the other times?


I am trying to figure what is hypochondria vs real risk.


Tons of the rcers are taking rc benzoes all the time aren't they without incident? not to mention all the other sustitutions for all the other classes.

So you are trying to justify your use of F phenibut by saying that other people use it and other RC's? 


If there is no research or history of use on the substance then there is no research or history of use. While most drugs have an implied "use at your own risk" disclaimer, the RC market has an additional loophole that most of these drugs are brand new and have not ever been used in humans.


I suggest doing your own in depth research before you pull the trigger and not just falling prey to the "other people do it, can't be that bad" mentality.

Please be careful with F-Phenibut! 

It seems a lot more euphoric and moreish than regular Phenibut and obviously Baclofen but since its very new and unresearched it might posses some dangers. I have seen a person who took too much F-Phenibut with alcohol over a course of night and the person woke up with swollen patches of skin all over head and neck - it looked pretty alarming to me. I do not take more than 100mg of it and only rarely but damn it feels good paired with a stimulant or psychedelic...

Hello BL thanks for the responses, wanted to update to let you all know I'm still alive and what a hell of a couple months that was. It was indeed GABA withdrawal from the F-Phenibut causing these heart issues.. I HIGHLY recommend avoiding this stuff altogether if you're considering it although admittedly I was using the f-phenibut for 5 months straight. I have been through all sorts of hellish withdrawal with regular phenibut HCl but nothing compared to this especially when it came to duration. This withdrawal made me truly think I was dying of heart complications for roughly two months (end of February til the end of last month). I was getting "episodes" of very real heart pain, palpitations & tachycardia that would usually culminate in a massive panic attack. This was daily, every day for 2 months. I am still not 100% right but the episodes have disappeared and I'm left with a more manageable form of generalized anxiety. I still can't drink more than a small cup of coffee per day and I'm still too afraid to resume my morning runs. 


Several thousand dollars later all my tests (stress test, holter monitor, EKG, etc) came back negative for actual heart issues so it's all related to GABA withdrawal which is why etizolam would (temporarily) cure my episodes. As much as I tried to tell myself it was withdrawal this truly made you think it was something more, like some kind of irrational psychosis. So yeah, avoid this compound, stick to regular phenibut HCl.

I was dosing multiple times per day 100-200MG each dose due to the short half life. I made the mistake of assuming the short half life would lead to a short withdrawal like they do with opioids. I was able to jump off without withdrawal for the few couple weeks of using and felt "safe" using more regularly and time just flies when you're on this drug. The one benefit is that I was able to make nice gains at the gym while on this and those still remain but overall not worth it.

Just a thought.... I never really had a bad withdrawal from gabaergics until I had been mixing benzos and phenibut for a bit. Together they really compound the pain of coming off either. I can do a bunch of either alone and come out unscathed but if I mix them, even just a little bit, I'm going crazy afterwards. I don't know if that's what you were doing but just a weird interaction effect I noticed.

Man I'm really sorry to hear you went through this.


However, and I want to be clear that I'm sympathetic, I've enjoyed using F-Phenibut 1-2 days a week on and off for the past 5 months with none of these issues and I think clearly it's how much you used, every day for 3 months, that was the problem, and not so much the drug.


I was glad both for your sake and everyone who wants to take it that your heart showed up fine and these were just withdrawal symptoms.


I mean with it being stronger than regular Phenibut and that already being so strong its obvious this stuff is not to be abused or taken more than 1-2 days a week.


Of course, none of us knows if even moderate use does or doesn't have bad long term effects but we do know that using it that often is going to lead to problems.

Once again OP, I've been a hypochondriac in the past, but I've actually overcome a lot of it and I can see in you more of how I used to be.


I'm on 700mgs of Fluro-Phenibut right now and it feels great, but I never use it more than once or twice a week, and as others have said, and as I have realized (though I foresee myself doing this possible "talking myself into using" with other drugs I want to try and might end up doing it again on here in the future..), I'll say the following:


Especially with these RCs, we don't know the risk, and even with a lot of the other drugs we talk about like Kratom, we don't know the risk as fully as well known drugs, so using these substances is not a place for us hypochondriacs unless we decide we aren't going to obsess over it LOL (easier said than done).


I ended up using it the first time without realizing it was an untested RC, just thinking it was like regular Phenibut, so in that sense I'd consumed it before I had time to worry.


But I know damn well I'm taking a risk using it, and to some extent with Kratom, or regular Phenibut, or Prolintane, which are the new drugs I've tried since joining bluelight, and while it's really not a risk worth taking, if you are going to do it then just fucking do it and don't worry, or else abstain.


Abstaining is better, and who the fuck knows whats in this shit.


I hope it's not cancerous, I hope it doesn't cause heart damage, but who the fuck knows with this shit, and I know I'm better off abstaining.


If I start to worry about the damage I might be doing myself with it (or anything) then I'll just stop but any damage from using would already be done, but I doubt so far I've done much (I can't be sure though).


If I'm not that worried (and for some reason I'm not right now), I'll use it ocassionally.


No logic from anyone else will convince you it's safe when it's untested, and no logic can convince you it's unsafe if you are truly worried.


All these substances are a gamble, so what I've done so far, is I read what there is to read, and then I just go with my some combination of my gut instinct as to the dangers, and just my general curiosity.


There's nothing more to say on it, none of us know the dangers of these drugs.


But so far, I feel this stuff can be used ocassionally once or twice weekly in dosages up to 1,000mgs (that knocks me out for 14 hours though) and I feel safe on it.


I don't agree with the former poster saying you should never use more than 100mgs and that dose does nothing for me.


It's very euphoric, and I've combined it with alcohol, weed, nitrous, Kratom and Klonopin without ill effects but I would not suggest mixing it with CNS depressants like booze or Klonopin.


Use at your own risk or don't use, and I DON'T think it's good therapeutically cause using it regularly would get you addicted.  It's more of a fun "once or twice a week" or less drug.

I have extreme sensitivity to all GABAergic drugs. A gram of Phenibut would make me pretty sick and 1mg of Etizolam would send me to blackout... I'm sure there are other people like me out there who are sensitive to depressant drugs so that why I post my warnings.

Its not about just an empty hedonistic high for me. I need relief from soul crushing despair. Kratom helps but I don't want to take it every day and I don't want to take any drug every day (ie antidepressants) which is why I am desperate to find some other drugs to cycle between the kratom because I get relief for one day with the kratom then sink lower in the two days off I give myself and I am going down at a faster rate then kratom is bringing me up.

Doesn't this fellow's tests showing up all clear after a long stint of continuous and heavy use bode well for its toxicity profile indicating that it is probably in line with its parent compounds baclofen and phenibut?

It does make me feel somewhat less concerned about my sporadic usage of it knowing he used it EXACTLY in the way I would think would be the absolute WORST to use it and even though he THOUGHT he was having a heart attack he wasn't and was ok and I guess is no longer dependent on it.

Well in my personal opinion then you are not going to get what you want with Fluro-Phenibut or Phenibut and for me I'd strongly suggest trying Klonopin instead cause that has REALLY helped my anxiety beyond belief and I've never had WD from it though I know it can be bad for some.


To be honest, I really don't understand your insane fear of trying benzos but not having as much fear of Phenibut which I think is worse.


Keep in mind I am talking about Klonopin and NOT Xanax as I have never taken the latter, but I think you should give Klonopin a shot for anxiety relief.


Maybe benzo use is more stigmatized in the U.K. than here in the U.S. and that's why you are so worried?


I'm not sure, but I don't think you need to be so concerned about trying Klonopin in particular rather than Xanax.


But I'm telling you as someone with anxiety and experience with F-Phenibut that F-Phenibut is more addictve than regular Phenibut so if you are sensitive to GABA drugs that's NOT the route to go down and you should NOT use it regularly.


I'm not sure why my telling you so many times I DON'T believe this will help your anxiety is something you aren't taking note of, or that I think Klonopin could help you.


I'm telling you, for treatment of your issues and NOT hedonistic pleasure Klonopin is the way to go FOR ME PERSONALLY.


Klonopin CANNOT get me high, like literally, I don't understand how it gets ANYONE high but I know it does for some.


For ME, all I get is excellent anxiety relief, no WD symptoms (again I know I am VERY rare in that regard), but the Phenibuts are HIGHLY abusive potentially and my experience is they are NOT to be abused.

I am happy to read you are doing well pinpoint. I enjoyed reading your first post about your experience with phenibut and this one was also interesting to read. I haven't heard much about f-phenibut. Never really had a desire to try it as regular phenibut hcl works just fine for all intent and purposes.


It seems as though after reading these reports as well as many others and taking my own experience with phenibut into account, although it no doubt wreaks havoc on GABA receptors, it is still just as safe for the body as a whole as any other gabaergic drug.

Here is Pinpoint's account on F-phenibut that I just read. 


[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/842657-F-Phenibut-Possible-Heart-Damage?p=14332167](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/842657-F-Phenibut-Possible-Heart-Damage?p=14332167)


I didn't realize the fluoridated version was more euphoric. Interesting but good ole phenibut hcl is good enough for me in all honesty.


Mycophile I know we talked about it yesterday and although I agree with you klonopin is an amazing drug for anxiety it also is highly addictive and you are a very special case as most people have a hellish time attempting to get off of it. Stevie Nicks has talked about how horrible she thinks klonopin is and that it took her three years to get over that addiction. Klonopin made one of my friends suicidal while he was on it. Everyone reacts differently to different kinds of drugs.


Also personally I don't find Xanax to be any more or less insidious as both drugs are benzodiazepines.

Yeah I know I've been an exception, but I still think from having talked a lot to Deioflaje that if he wants anxiety relief he's better off with Klonopin than Phenibut or F-Phenibut.


He wants something he can use regularly or semi-regularly and is more interested in anxiety relief than euphoria and I think he's better off with Klonopin for that.


Plus, it's more widely understood and if you get into trouble with it doctors know what it is whereas few doctors know about Phenibut.


It was weird though cause I did once go to an out-patient mental hospital for it cause I was cut off by my doctor (I got a new one) 5 years back, and they barely even gave me a taper.


The doctor told me something (I now think it's probably bullshit and feel he was negligent, but somehow his advice worked for me) that Klonopin (tapers itself) if you cut down slowly due to it's long half life, and basically he kind of was like: yeah, just cut your dose in half for 5 days or so, then cut that in half for 5 days or so, then stop, and somehow it worked.


I don't know why, or that it would work again though.


I also don't believe long term use is all that dangerous and have seen few negative side effects for basically being on it most of the time now for 15 years.


I mean I'm not ALWAYS on it, but I am not sure I believe people who think it causes dementia.  I mean maybe it COULD be I'm not sure it's going to happen to most people who use it and I HATE doctors just cutting patients off and telling them they can't use it more than a few months.


For me it has a been a LIFE SAVER.


Someday I do hope to get off of it though.


And Pinpoints account of F-Phenibut was cause he used it everyday for months which is just crazy and abusive.


I'd NEVER use it like that and never use it more than twice a week max, and usually not more than once or even every single week.

Thank you for your post. This came up when I searched for fluorophenibut and heart. I was born with an extra electrical pathway on my heart (just recently discovered at the age of 32, it's called WPW and is associated with a type of tachycardia called supraventricular tachycardia) and sometimes on this substance I noticed a kind of pressure in my chest, around the heart region. I've used loads of stimulants but mostly benzos and opioids, I'm clean now thank god (not really god but you know...) but I'm still dabbling in some of these variants I've never tried before.


This morning I had my milligram scale put on oz instead and didn't really notice at first, I did thought it was more powder than I normally mix in with my water (it tasted horrible by the way ![:sick:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f922.png)). But before I drank it I realized that it was almost 1.3 grams which is way more than I'm currently on daily, which is roughly 400-600 mg. So I saved it for later in the evening, it's maybe 2 hours ago now since I drank it and I was recently biking to the store to buy some groceries and noticed this pressure in the heart region. But while writing this the pain or whatever to call it, the "feeling" had subsided almost completely.


So it checks out with your timeline as well and also with the physical activity. And when you wrote how horrible the withdrawal was for your heart and that you got tachycardia (my heart abnormality is associated with a type of tachycardia called supraventricular tachycardia) I got quite the scare. I'm getting off this now. I only ordered a total of 20 grams and it should be the end of it soon. So I'm going to use the last powder to taper down, I'm going to use some whenever I feel 'weird'. I'm completely drug free otherwise so it'll be easy to feel when somethings off.

I picked up 10 grams recently, and have had one decent session with it so far. 


Started with 200mg, and redosed another 200mg about an hour and a half later. I have a bit of tolerance to Gabapentinoids, as I take 600mg-1.2g gabapentin daily, 40mg Baclofen every other day, and usually 1.5g phenibut every other day or every 3rd day. 


This day I skipped my usual phenibut dose and dosed the f-phenibut around ~10am. I found it definitely potentiated my usual dose of 16mg Suboxone. Found it hard to get super motivated, but it was my day off and I definitely enjoyed the lounging about that I did. 


All in all it was pretty much as typically described, quite similar to phenibut, but more sedating and less stimulating, shorter duration and shorter time to kick in. Felt like the effects started quickly, within maybe 30 - 60 minutes, and peaked for maybe 2-4 hours with a gentle and slow comedown. 


Anybody else had any experiences with this substance? There are very few reports on it online, but after my one trial with it I have found it quite worthwhile, with possibly more utility than regular phenibut due to the duration of effects. I still definitely don't plan on dosing it every day, and will likely in the future try little bit higher doses, or experiment with combos with phenibut to see what kind of effects there are.

Shit I got a tub off faa for backup. Tried it to compare it to the hcl and wasn't anything much different for me. Of course everyone being the same but different will get different effects. I tried it as I heard so much about it it was basically the same IME. Continued use of hcl.

So there's phenibut, which is **β-Phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid... **and then there's f-phenibut which is *β-(4-flourophenyl)-GABA... *not a chemistry wiz.. but basically f-phenibut is baclofen with the chlorine replaced by a fluorine. 


Either one can be FAA or HCL depending on how it's made. Yep, totally different substance, although similar. Shorter duration, faster onset, more potent by mg, and imo more sedating.

I do like phenibut, but my first impressions of f-phenibut have been really positive... I might prefer it I'm just not sure yet. Definitely helped with anxiety and relaxation, was nice not having to wait 4 hours for it to kick in too.

f-phenibut is pretty similar to phenibut, quite similar in fact.  Just a lot more potent and shorter acting and quicker onset.  Also I find it less euphoric and like it less overall.

It is more sedating than regular phenibut, more baclofen like, with more selective action as a GABA-B agonist than phenibut.


I don't find phenibut euphoric, but it does have a mania that can be enjoyable (which f-phenibut doesn't really produce). This most likely is a result of phenibut's more prominent action on VDCC's, which underlies the mania that pregabalin can produce. Stronger and more preferential action as a GABA-B agonist generally makes these compounds less recreational and increases side-effects like nausea and increases sedation.


It is fast acting though, and can actually be used on the spot as a sleep aid (especially when f-phenibut FAA is used sublingually). Don't try f-phenibut hcl sublingually, it will burn you (i know from experience).

I feel it could definitely potentially be a little more habit forming. I didn't get any great compulsion from it or anything, but yeah, once I realized I wasn't quite where I wanted to be with it, it was pretty easy to convince myself to redose. Once it plateaued I was pretty satisfied with it and just let it roll through. I enjoyed it personally. I also don't have any desire to redose with phenibut particularly. I think I'm gonna try it again tomorrow for work, so I'll see how that goes.

It can be a little more compulsive on account of its quicker onset but it still takes a couple of hours to come on so it's not very compulsive.  I also get no compulsion to redose (or to dose in the first place) from phenibut even though I love it, and have been addicted to it).  I have had some for quite some time and generally when I want the phenibut state I just go with phenibut.  I prefer it.

Takes a while for me but phenibut also takes about 4 or 5 hours to come on fully for me, don't even get a hint of effect for 2 hours or so.  I have read of people coming up from phenibut in a much shorter time.  I suspect we're all a bit different in this regard.

yeah I have effects the next day from f-phenibut.  Honestly it's not that much shorter than phenibut for me, even though it is shorter.

I would like to update a bit. In my last post I wrote that I would never use fluorophenibut ever again.


But stupid little me bought 10 gram a while ago. And I don't know whats up but I had to use high doses immediately to get effect. And then tolerance builds quickly.

I was using at least 1 gram a day and that is way too much.


Anyhow, when I was about to run out I did a quick taper in like 2 days, decreased the dosages by A LOT.

The last day I had 400mg left that I took that day. Early morning my congenital heart defect was triggered. I couldn't relax to get it to beat normal like I usually can.


After 3 hours I decided to go to the ER where they found out it was atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. I've never had AF before.

I was in the hospital for 10 hours before they decided they had to put me to sleep to restart my heart with defibrillators.

It went well.


I'm a 100% certain this happened because of the fluorophenibut. Probably in combination with my heart defect.

I read somewhere that phenibut and/or fluorophenibut helps regulate the heart rhythm. That tells me that when you then quit, the heart rhythm might get a bit messed up.


I have since had my heart defect corrected but I will never touch this stuff again, for once and all.

It seems clear that swapping a chlorine for a fluorine actually just makes it a slightly weaker version of regular baclofen, but even if it was only half the potency of regular baclofen, that would mean you shouldn't exceed 160mg/day.  You claim you were taking up to a gram, which almost certainly would have caused major side effects and a serious withdrawal syndrome.

As far as the name "f-baclofen" as an alternate name for f-phenibut, perhaps more accurate would be something like deschloro(4-fluorophenyl) baclofen since f-baclofen sort of suggests that the chlorine is still there but with an added fluorine somewhere ![🤯](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f92f.png)

Too heady for my poor head! I recently got some more, been dosing roughly 350mg at a time. It's effective enough but I've got such a tolerance to gabapentinoids at this point. Have dosed 700mg today. Feeling solid it's definitely effective for anxiety and chilling.

I know this is an older thread, I haven't been around BL for many many years, but I wanted to add a few things here in case anyone is still browsing for info on these substances...  I'm quite clueless when it comes to chemistry or the molecular make up of drugs, but I'm very familiar with pharmaceuticals, nootropics, RC's, and their effects, simply from dedicating 15 years of my life to being the "best" poly-sub addict I could be.  When it comes to Phenibut, I haven't had experience with it for roughly 10 years, and I remember enjoying it, but replacing it quickly with 1,4 BDO, which I loved.  Until, I blacked out, nearly emptied my bank account with a few tweakers I hardly knew, let them borrow my car, stay at my place etc, and on the next occasion, OD'd, and never touched the stuff again.  But that stuff, IMO, was incredible.  I was also on suboxone, klonopin, and IV meth at the time.  Anyways, I've been experimenting with "f-phenibut" FAA off and on for the last month or 2, but haven't been stable enough on/off of everything else I take to do some solid research or even an effective trip report.  But the discussion over whether this stuff is essentially, literally, or effectively f-baclofen, interests me quite a bit.  And in my experience, there may be subjective similarities to regular baclofen and this f-phen/bac, but I have extensive experience with Rx baclofen, and I don't think we should be using it as way to compare dosage, tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, etc.  I'll speak mainly to baclofen (Rx), but I was prescribed 80mg/day, have taken well over 200mg, as well as overdosed on it.  I got good anxiety relief, social and generalized, from 80-100mg of baclofen, but even at high doses, I never felt the same type of effects as I have on f-phen, although it seems to be much more hit or miss, dose dependent, etc.  Baclofen has very little dependence and tolerance issues even at daily 80mg+ doses, it also, IME, doesn't have a compulsive or redosing element to it much at all.  It has been used by medical professionals, in the 100mg+ /day range to treat and "cure" alcoholism, and in my experience, I essentially forgot about drinking, had no cravings, and that wasn't even my intent, just a positive bonus effect.  I will also add that I did legit OD on baclofen, but, I didn't get carried away in the traditional manner.  I was withdrawaling from H, Meth, and probably alcohol as well, and have partial-complex seizure disorder, and mid WD, I began to feel like I was going to have some type of seizure, and the last thing I remember was looking for something to prevent it/help the WD, etc... turns out, I swallowed my entire bottle of baclofen, so at least  4000mg (yes 4 GRAMS or more).  I have no memory of it, but I basically amplified the seizure activity and went into an overdose induced seizure and psychosis and I wound up with 7 paramedics needed to get me into an ambulance, and according to the hospital, I came in as the most extreme case they'd ever seen, and attempted to treat.  I was not unconscious but apparently they assumed i was on "bathsalts", PCP, etc, and it took them several hours to even succeed at RSI (intubation), and they eventually got me down and on a fentanyl,versed, and ketamine drip, in a medically induced coma, but that only lasted a few days and I came to while intubated, with no memory or clue where I was or what was happening, basically the worst thing I've ever experienced.  But, now I'm telling war stories so I digress.  Point is, while the molecular structures of baclofen and f-phenibut are essentially the same, I do not believe they should be compared or considered to be essentially the same in any other definitive way.  Sorry for the long rant, Hope this helps.  

TLDR;  I have considerable experience with Baclofen, and gaba-ergics in general, and as I am currently researching f-phenibut, I just wanted to add to this discussion by saying I do not think comparing f-phenibut to baclofen for the purposes of dosing, effect profile, side effects, tolerance/dependence, or any other objective comparison measures.  And from my experience, there does not seem to be any point at which the 2 are indistinguishable from each other.  I think it is only safe to treat f-phenibut (f-baclofen, whatever you want to call it) as it's own substance with it's own properties.  I'd love to hear any further experiences from recent years, if anyone is still researching or using this chem in any way.  It's good to be back on BL!

Yeah agreed welcome back. 


Going through benzo withdrawals, baclofen was the only thing that would stop my shakes, but they were giving me minor doses. It helped a lot. I never really noticed much effect beyond a relief of physical anxiety and shakes. 


Now my poor ass is using gabapentin, f-phenibut, AND benzos (only temporarily for the the moment though).

I just ordered a little of this. I found phenibut to be quite pleasant and good for anxiety, but never recreational. To be honest I'm not really looking for recreation or euphoria, more just relief without using benzos. I'll report once I've tried a couple of doses... hold your breath everyone! xxx

Soooo true. Here’s a laugh of stupidity for the day. I tried to correct this girl & begged her not to repeat what she said because she’d embarrass herself. She legitimately believes that the coating on the original OxyContin (when the first ones came out around 2000) was literally fentanyl. ![🤦🏻‍♀️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f926-1f3fb-2640.png) I mean the girl would not let up. She swore on ppl she loved that what we wiped off or scraped off of the (specifically the 80mg) pills was the drug fentanyl. I tried telling her that back then, fentanyl was expensive & is not an ingredient in OxyContin. Not only that, I really don’t see fentanyl being used as a time release coating. And unfortunately, this girl does drugs. Scary.

So would mixing this with bicarb help with the acidity as with regular phenibut? It's not going to synthesise bleach or something by mixing the two?? I find this to be about as hard on the stomach as regular phenibut and not really much better in effects tbh...

No kidding. This girl goes to my dddddrumroll methadone clinic & I have given her rides a few times since her car got totaled (first in the clinic parking lot & now I hear her telling it as it happened at Amazon, ugh) but I swear I honestly didn’t want her sweating that shit up & down to someone else. It took a bit for me to FORCE MYSELF to drop it or a fight born of nothing personally important broke out. But I can see someone refusing to let up, that enjoys being right & in this case knows they are & she’s gonna keep running that stupid incorrect statement over & over w/zero to back it up with other than she knows “for sure”. ![🤦🏻‍♀️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f926-1f3fb-2640.png)


I should be more informative here. There is nothing opiate based (or drug based at all whatsoever) on or within the time release coating that was specifically on the 80mg OxyContin from when they first came out , like yr.2000. It’s just crap made from edible plastic & blue dye that ruined many a fine Tshirt. And yes I’m extremely glad I sucked that crap off, spit it out & wiped it off my wet(ish) pill to prepare for my route. 


The reformulated stuff w/the time release all throughout the pill…… I cannot speak for that as I’ve never even looked at one. They are a bastardized version of my lovely D.O.C. Bastards!


Take care ppl! Do not mix methadone & benzos!!!!!!

Oooohhh my my yes!!! You are very correct. Thanks for the catch. A lady never reveals her true age but if you know I was hitting up pain mgmt in my early 20s when the real OxyContin “wonder drug” was released by Pfizer….you can do the math. I wonder if I’d ever become as hard of a user if I was just getting hooked w/what’s around now ![🤔](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png)?? Or I’d simply die. One or the other. I have not been on a drug forum in YEARS!!!, like back when we had to hide that we “the poster” were actually the person doing the drug. Lol


So is there a parent company afoot here that’s linked to a drug rehab or psychological study? I’m only interested. There’s enough unbiased info here that I am sticking around.


* I’ve discovered that I get high on paint chips  the same as I do on tortilla chips…..with tons of hot as hell salsa!!! And obviously ur gonna wanna snort anything involving salsa (JK). Lol

It was indeed GABA withdrawal from the F-Phenibut causing these heart issues.. I HIGHLY recommend avoiding this stuff altogether if you're considering it although admittedly I was using the f-phenibut for 5 months straight. I have been through all sorts of hellish withdrawal with regular phenibut HCl but nothing compared to this especially when it came to duration. This withdrawal made me truly think I was dying of heart complications for roughly two months (end of February til the end of last month). I was getting "episodes" of very real heart pain, palpitations & tachycardia that would usually culminate in a massive panic attack. This was daily, every day for 2 months. I am still not 100% right but the episodes have disappeared and I'm left with a more manageable form of generalized anxiety. I still can't drink more than a small cup of coffee per day and I'm still too afraid to resume my morning runs.

> 
> 
> Several thousand dollars later all my tests (stress test, holter monitor, EKG, etc) came back negative for actual heart issues so it's all related to GABA withdrawal which is why etizolam would (temporarily) cure my episodes. As much as I tried to tell myself it was withdrawal this truly made you think it was something more, like some kind of irrational psychosis. So yeah, avoid this compound, stick to regular phenibut HCl.

I’m gonna have to look this up so I know to avoid it. I take benzos correctly (no shit you guys… I do nowadays!!) & have since I received a real diagnosis from more than 1 type of doctor more than 10 years ago. When you have a moment, would you mind telling me what type of drug this is & what it helped you with? It might be a safer/easier alt for me as everyone is in my face about my Xanax. 


Thanks!

If I were you I'd just stick with regular phenibut as f-phenibut is pretty meth and the thought of the withdrawal terrifies me.

Neither are particularly amazing though, they're like a much milder version of pregabalin of you've ever had that. About on par with gabapentin IMO but probably with more side effects if you accidentally take too much.

Our very own [@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) does a good writeup of it on erowid (yeah, I looked you up, Xorky!)

I recently discovered quite a bit of F-phenibut. From looking at the molecular structures, f-phen is basically baclofen with a fluorine molecule instead of a chlorine molecule positioned in the same fourth carbon. From what I recall regular phen hcl is much more longer lasting, takes 2 hours to peak, provides much more energy and a sort of hypomania. I.tried F-Phen a few days ago and although it has some positives such as s quicker onset, but it’s quite sedating and short lasting. And the lack some of the special qualities that I associate with phen hcl, such as the energy and mood lift I get from it. 


There’s definitely some utility in F-Phen so it’s not all bad
