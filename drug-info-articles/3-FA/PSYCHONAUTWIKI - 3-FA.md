**3-Fluoroamphetamine** ( **3-FA** ) is a synthetic ring-substituted fluorinated [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) compound that produces potent classical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects that has been claimed to be "almost equipotent" with [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . It is one part of a series of [designer fluorinated amphetamine analogs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) such as [2-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) , [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) , [3-FEA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-FEA) , and [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) that are known for their [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) and [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects and growing popularity as [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) substitutes for classical street [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) .

3-FA is rarely found on the streets, and only sometimes sold as a grey market [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) through online vendors.

## Chemistry

3-FA, or 3-Fluoroamphetamine, is a synthetic molecule of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α (i.e. amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines). 3-FA does not contain a methyl group bound to the terminal amine R N of the amphetamine core, which renders it structurally and functionally similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . 3-FA is the 3-fluorinated analogue of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .

## Pharmacology

Although 3-FA has not been formally studied on the same level as traditional [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) , it is not unreasonable to assume that just like other [substituted amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) with substitutions at similar positions (with the notable exception of [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) ), it most likely acts primarily as both a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) , with modest selectivity for [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . This means it effectively increases the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally clear and reuptake those molecules from the synaptic cleft for future reuse. This allows dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within the brain to extra-endogenous degrees, which is known to produce stimulating, motivatory and euphoric effects in humans.

## Subjective effects

3-FA is considered to be a potent and complex stimulant with mild entactogenic undertones when compared to other substances its class, like [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) . However, it does not have the productivity and focus-enhancing effects often claimed by users of [2-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) or [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) which has had the effect of limiting its appeal.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - This component primarily tends to happen at higher doses only and is rarely observed lower to medium doses
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) as well as [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) . ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**

- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** - This component primarily tends to happen at higher doses only, as low to medium doses of 3-FA are more focused and productivity-oriented.
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3-FA use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 3-FA has an extremely short history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 3-FA within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is perhaps worth noting that in the field of medicinal chemistry, the fluorine substitution is sometimes seen as desirable in central nervous system pharmaceutical agents, and is a common practice due to the corresponding increase in lipophilicity granted by the substitute.

Regardless, due to its novelty and unstudied nature, it is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) if experimenting with this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of 3-FA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among a certain population of users. When dependence or addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 3-FA develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 10 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3-FA presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 3-FA all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect (especially including atypical stimulants one might not expect, like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) due to its reliance on dopamine and norepinephrine to exert its full euphoric effect).

Given its claimed equipotency to methamphetamine it may be similarly difficult to dose. 3-FA has not been studied to the same degree as other amphetamines, so its toxicity profile in humans is subject to speculation and has yet to be scientifically validated. Thus, it is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the amphetamine chemical class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, dextro [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

## Legal status

3-FA is currently a grey area compound within all parts of the world, meaning its regulation lies in a legal grey area and that it is not known to be specifically illegal ("scheduled") within any country. However, people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with intent to sell or consume.

- **China** : As of October 2015 3-FA is a controlled substance in China.
- **France** : As of december 2024, 3-FA is not explicitly scheduled. It is thus legal to possess, although in a grey area.
- **Germany** : 3-FA is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **New Zealand** : 3-FA is an amphetamine analogue, so is a Schedule 3 controlled substance in New Zealand.
- **Switzerland** : 3-FA is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **Turkey:** 3-FA is classed as a drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom** : 3-FA is considered a Class A drug as a result of the amphetamine analogue clause of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
- **United States** : 3-FA may be considered to be an analog of amphetamine, thus falling under the Federal Analogue Act. The Federal Analogue Act, 21 U.S.C. § 813, is a section of the United States Controlled Substances Act, allowing any chemical "substantially similar" to an illegal drug (in Schedule I or II) to be treated as if it were also in Schedule I or II, but only if it is intended for human consumption.
