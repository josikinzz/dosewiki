I realized we don't have a thread for this substance yet.  I recently obtained a dose of it and sometime this year I will arrange a meeting with my receptors.  I was hoping though that someone else had tried this.  Or at least had some information.


So, please share. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm not sure when I'll try it... I haven't tripped since the new year and I don't want to start doing it a lot again.  But I will certainly make this one of my priorities. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


What are the dosage levels for this?  PiHKAL says 5-10mg, and then goes on to say it's very variable (as is to be expected with sulphur-containing phenethylamines).  I received 26mg (I believe that's correct, without being near the vial).  I wonder if anyone has any recommendations for me as to dosage?  I am unlikely to ever be able to receive more.  I would prefer to err on the high side, but I would most prefer to be physically safe.


[This](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal003.shtml) is the correct PiHKAL entry, correct?


If anyone has any experience with it at all, even if it was totally unexciting, please post it in here.

One important recommendation - treat it with caution as it has clinically significant inhibition of MAO. That's the reason I haven't got around to trying it yet - I want to be 100% certain I don't have anything dodgy in my system beforehand

incredible, i wont ask if this has entered the market...

of all the alephs this one has the most appealing report, the intense intellectual stimulation and pages of written notes, it sounds perfect. 

Also form a chemical standpoint how could this not be a winner? the methyl group is always a favorite with phens (2C-D, DOM) 2C-T sounds a bit inconsistent, but i wouldent be half surprised if it tickled my fancy. 

And then Aleph looks like the porridge that was just right, the methyl group and then that warm sulfur. wow.

A 2C-T with an alpha-methyl group? No thanks, I'll pass on this one. 


I am, however, keen on reading any reports on this substance since its been saught-after by many over the years and now it has finally materialized.

do you guys think a 3mg trial would produce much? Would one still be able to go about one's daily work (nothing serious just some reading and grading) you think?


I might trial that level to get it done so I can be ready for a larger dose come party time.

ok, took 2mg of it now its ~3 hours later. I was not expecting much and did not get a knock you over the head trip. I'm feeling good still, I understand where the PIHKAL comment in the 5mg entry where the guy said afterward he felt empathetic/very nice. Here is a PIHKAL entry for comparison's sake:


> (with 5 mg) The initial hints of action were physical--warming of first the legs, and then a comfortable warmth spread over the entire body.  Intense intellectual stimulation, one that inspired the scribbling of some 14 pages of handwritten notes. Which is a pretty good record for an experience that is almost entirely non-verbal.  The afterglow was benign and rich in empathy for everything.  And by the sixth hour I was quite hungry.
> 		
> Click to expand...


I will say it came on quickly, by about 30 minutes I was feeling effects. I felt spaced out and happy and for a moment thought it was going to develop into something stronger (it had that feeling like coming onto a good MDMA roll). It did not though. It felt a lot like AMT around 10-15mg oral minus ANY jitteriness. The effects were entirely consistent of EUPHORIA. I told a friend as I was coming onto it that this chemical is like a euphoria pill, clean and simple and honest euphoria.


I took a walk in the sunshine and found a bench eventually to watch the sunset and think my little happy thoughts about life. As I was sitting along a cat meandered up to me and sat down beside me while I petted it. It kept purring while I petted it. Eventually it jumped down and meandered away. I thought about my life and crystalized an insight I've been working through recently (I think thanks to the Aleph-1's positive push).


Minus were ANY visual effects or weird psychedelic thoughts, etc. Just euphoria. I honestly won't be surprised if this one comes out to not be very psychedelic at all in the classical sense and more like MDMA.


I simply cannot wait until I get a chance to try 5mg soon! This drug felt so wonderful that I was tempted an hour in to redose and go higher, but I decided for the sake of the experiment not to.


A +/++ on the Shulgin scale.


Peace!

samadhi


ps I will add that ~three hours before dosing this I took my usual gram of piracetam with coffee. Also, I had taken a large dose of fentanyl/xanax the night before and had woken up the morning STILL miraculously being effected by it (pinned pupils). I'm almost positive by the late afternoon when I took the Aleph-1 that these factors were negligible if at all.

lol this was just a tester, barely a +2. I'm gonna do 5mg soon and see if this tease extrapolates into a +3.


Maybe next month we can make Aleph-1 the compound of the month?

It can be a very transcendental experience,but be aware of the potentially very variable nature,I tried this two times:

I'd dose a tad below the recommended dosage just to see how your body takes to it. Be safe!

What was the duration, S_S (and/or hugo)?


Reading your report, hugo, it looks like a 6 hour duration... but I had thought this was very long like the other DOXs.  If it's only a few hours I might try this sooner than later.

from me, I will wait until I get another trial at what I hope to be +3.


I will say however that by T+7 or 8ish I was still noticing some residual activity and it took a bit of time falling asleep (a tiny bit restless).


Hugo seems to think that this one is erratic in its effects and Shulgin also thinks this. Its something to keep in mind when dosing it (don't dose expecting to be baseline by 5-6 hours bc maybe you will but maybe you won't).

The 4-thio-PEAs are a strange bunch.  


2C-T-7 seems to be highly variable as well ... 2C-T-2 maybe slightly less so.  There is a report of 5 mg IV T-7 being overdose territory, whereas 30 mg orally can be disappointing for some.  T-7 seems to have the poorest/most erratic absorption, which is eliminated with intranasal or rectal admin.  There's another report of 1 mg IV T-2, which is said to be more intense than 20 mg oral.  When I get around to trying DOT, I'll probably try insufflating 1 mg, and repeating to desired level.

Alright, thanks for the duration comments... I had it in my mind that this one's duration was similar to the other DOXs, but it seems as if it's most likely going to be quite a bit shorter.

I have never tried DOT / Aleph-1 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylthiophenylisopropylamine), but I have enjoyed 2ct2 more than once; however, I think 3-methoxy-4-methylthiophenylisopropylamine (2-des-MeO-DOT) would give a better high than DOT.


Just my 2 cents.

Have you tried it? If not, do you have any reason to believe this ? I believe that certain 4-alkoxy-3-methoxy-phenylisopropylamines are active in man.

Anyways, this discussion is not relevant to the thread.

Active as psychedelics?  That would require something at the 2 or 3 then I believe to be a 5-HT2 agonist i.e. mescaline-like effects.

That is likely to be an even more potent inhibitor of MAO (consider 4-MTA's structure); a 3,4-substituted PEA/amphetamine is going to fit very snugly into the active site of the enzyme & 4-alkylthio groups seem to prevent the enzyme achieving active conformation. The addition of the two methoxyls at positions 2 & 5 to the structure of 4-MTA considerably reduces it's MAO inhibitor activity (yet it's still clinically significant). 3-methoxy-4-methylthioamphetamine seems (to me at least) to be just asking for trouble


> 2C-T-7 seems to be highly variable as well ... 2C-T-2 maybe slightly less so. There is a report of 5 mg IV T-7 being overdose territory, whereas 30 mg orally can be disappointing for some. T-7 seems to have the poorest/most erratic absorption, which is eliminated with intranasal or rectal admin

Again, 5mg of 2C-T-7 via the IV route is going to give a very rapid, high plasma level of the drug if the intestinal absorbtion is as erratic as is being claimed and I'm sure that's what's lead to fatalities with it in the past when administered nasally (the hyperthermia & convulsions seem pretty good indicators of that). I honestly think people should think very carefully before considering any route other than oral for DOT or any of the 2,5-dimethoxy-4-alkylthio compounds

I've always been sketched out by the thio-amphetamines and thio-PEAs--it seems like they have a higher potential for toxicity than their oxygenated brothers.  As F&B mentioned above, there is the significant potential for MAO inhibition.  As such, I don't think that any thio-PEA would be safe for me to take (I wouldn't want to risk serotonin syndrome or hypertension).

Don't dose too high,take it orally,and with nothing else and you should be fine with these Sulfides.The second trial was the only one I ever had some problems with T's.

Season to taste.


I'm not fond of fish (other than in my aquariums) but others love to eat cold blooded animals and bugs of the sea.


In my playbook 2C-T-7 ranks highest in its class (still have not tried mescaline) and I find a common warm glow in 2 out of 3 of the 2C-Ts I've tried.


I admit I've never really dreamed too much of the ALEPHs the way I have about 2C-T, 2C-T-21, and a few others....but it's not the usual 36 hour DO*x* experience...that it is short certainly warrents further exploration in my book.  And certainly the reports don't sound generic....just erratic.  I do hope to be blessed with the chance to to try!

^ Different tastes, for sure. Its just that there is also an unnerving aspect about the 2C-Ts and other sulphur containing phens (4-MTA, anyone?) in that they all seem to be far more likely to be toxic than other phens. We have reports of people snorting 200mgs of 2C-E and living to tell the tale, but we have stories of people snorting 30mg (was it?) of T-7 and dying. 


I'll tell you this though - between T7, T2, and T21, the latter is the most interesting and least irritating for me. I am sure you'll find it as enigmatic as most of us do ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

While I only take chemicals orally, not snorted, I am still a little sketched about the fact that there are confirmed deaths at relatively low doses of the thio-PEAs, particularly 4-MTA and 2C-T7.  Contrasted with other psychedelics, like LSD, psilocin and mescaline, where it is virtually impossible to have a fatal overdose, the risk of T-PEA just doesn't sit right.

^ Indulged in the same night of madness/sillyness at 4mg. It's an aesthetic enhancer with an action unlike any other psychedelic I've experienced. Still at a loss to categorize it's effects (it is utterly unique in it's action - a real weird little fucker!), but I can say that I'd try it again without any qualms, given the right circumstances.


Later on, when it'd had a chance for plasma levels to decrease (it has some competetive MAOI properties), I tried a little ketamine on top of the DOT - it amplified ketamine's actions by a fair degree, so care needs to be exercised to avoid lapsing into fuckwittery.

did you both get euphoria like I got? And no visual/psychedelic effects?


I felt the same way, I was so excited to try it again! I haven't yet.


I would try some but unfortunately I seem to be getting a little mild opiate withdrawl right now (shaking/tremors, lethargy, visual disturbances, irritablness).

That sums up what I got from it & an strange ability to get lost in small details/fascination with reading etc.


  I felt both normal & "on a drug" at the same time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


I became bored after 4 hours & thus started on other substances 8) 


I would however try it again - it's very difficult to nail down anything similar - the nearest tag I could put on it would be a little like methylone with the stimulation removed - bear in mind this is making the best of a bad job with the comparatives I have available. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Got euphoria, which waxed and waned throughout the experience, but I did get some visuals, although they were quite fleeting and difficult to pin down, unlike normal psychedelics & their electric neon kalidescope sideshow (although they were consistant with phenethylamine style of visual patterning). 


The euphoric effects were linked to a cascaded sequence of internal emotional states; during that phase I became quite introspective at times and gregarious & outgoing at others. I can understand the intellectual enhancement sort of thing Shulgin mentions in PIHKAL, it's just that I wasn't actively focusing on anything, which is how I think the emotional variability occurred. While none of it was overwhelming on it's own, the way it enhanced other drugs (ketamine - B9 had some cannabis, but I declined) definitely produced an overwhelming effect, quite taking me by surprise.


One more thing, after going to the toilet leter on today, the bathroom afterwards  smelled like Satan himself had opened his bowels. I have a suspicion that the DOT had some role in that, but I couldn't be certain ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I couldn't tell if the euphoria was from monoamine release or MAOI effects (both of which could sum to produce subjective effects similar in nature - ie felt euphoria).


Ahh more experimentation required ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Today would be a perfect day to dose but alas I dont want to push my luck with my current uncomfortable physical state from recent drug abuse.


Anyways, I'm excited ya'll are trying it now...please report anything else you find in subsequent trials (and everybody else who tries it).

I may try some of this tonight.  I'm not sure if I will, but it sounds like a nice, easy substance that could provide some entertainment.  If I try it, I will write a full TR.  I have a friend coming over for dinner... seems like a good time to give it a try... test it against irregular activities in a social setting.

3.2mg taken orally in a bit of alcohol around, oh, maybe half an hour ago.  I'm feeling twinges of activity.  The smell and taste reminded me of the other DOXs I have tasted and smelled.  The powder I made the solution out of is ultra-fine.


Feeling twinges of solar-plexus stimulation, in a good way so far.  About to spend an evening at home relaxing.  I'll report back tomorrow... hopefully this level will be enough for a full report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Most of the descriptions so far make DOT sound like a lowish dose of aMT in subjective effects.  It would be really fascinating if DOT maintained its purely euphoric characteristics at slightly higher doses without going too far into body stimulation or psychedelia.  I'll be interested in hearing how you think it might combine with some of the chems that aMT goes so well with Xorkoth.  Have a good time!

^ well at low doses it most reminded me of AMT I have to say. MINUS the stimulation that AMT gives me. DOT was very smooth.

Btw, I just rememebered something that might give a name to what all you Aleph-fiends have experienced: The shulgins call it "Beth State" (Beth being the second letter of the hebrew, preceded by Aleph).

Hmm, the Beth state... I forgot about that.  I was just thinking that I am in some sort of transitional state, not there but not where I was either.  Interesting... I certainly can't sleep yet.  I haven't been alone until now so perhaps something will develop.

I got to sleep around 3:30am (my last post above was 1:04am my time).  I had a nice time overall just browsing Bluelight and drifting around with my eyes closed.  Didn't really go anywhere though.  I might describe it as the "Beth state".  It wasn't bad, and it wasn't particularly interesting.  I have a nice afterglow today, however... I feel pretty great!  So far that has been my favorite aspect of the experience.  Whenever I try it again I will go higher.  I did get a faint headache at times though... there was something a bit uncomfortable about the whole experience, but it could just be that I haven't tripped for some time and I am no longer used to the bodyload from phenethylamines, so it took me by surprise.  Basically, not much happened but I'm glad to have experienced it.  I will surely try it again at a higher dose sometime, at least 5mg.


Of note is that I could barely feel kratom while on it.  I took some earlier in the experience, and also took another dose at around 3am to see if I could put a dent in the light stimulation I was feeling that was preventing my sleep.  I felt it a little bit, but actually threw up from it, which I have not done in a very long time with kratom.  So I must have had an awful lot, but it really just barely got through the DOT cloud mentally.

some say it ressembles low dose amt, but those descriptions seem very similar to 2c-t-21...as in "I felt both normal & "on a drug" at the same time. " and with a positive touch

even though i haven't indulged in higher dosages of t21 most reports seem very similar to my experience of it

i might try this one in the future

Being a lover of AMT, I would say this did not resemble AMT to me at all.  But I will have to have a few more trials before I can really have a solid opinion on it... a single try with a psychedelic is never a reliable way to determine its properties, especially when that trial might just be below the necessary dosage level for full effects.

While AMT or 2C-T-21 might be the closest for comparison, they're still not that close (eg describing psilocybin as being like mescaline if you'd not experienced any other psychedelics). I found it to be a unique subset of the psychedelic experience in the same way that say MDA or MMDA are psychedelic, but unlike any other drug described as being psychedelic in action


BTW - on reading that back, I'm horrified I used the phrase 'subset of the psychedelic experience', but I'm rather tired and geekspeak just seemed the easiest way to express myself ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

you must have got the wrong compound in pihkal then. Here's DOT:

Intense intellectual stimulation, one that inspired the scribbling of some 14 pages of handwritten notes. Which is a pretty good record for an experience that is almost entirely non-verbal. The afterglow was benign and rich in empathy for everything. And by the sixth hour I was quite hungry.”

I happened to catch the eyes of Pretty Baby, the cat, at the same moment she looked at me, and she turned and fled. I am able to interact with people on the telephone quite well but mechanical things, such as arranging flowers or alphabetizing names, are beyond me. Driving would be impossible.”

> 
> 
> EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY: This specific compound is probably the first sulfur-containing phenethylamine to have been evaluated as a potentially active CNS stimulant or psychedelic. It was a complete, total, absolute unknown. The first trials were made at the sub-microgram level, specifically at 0.25 micrograms, at 11:30 a.m. on September 3, 1975. Part of this extreme precaution was due to the uniqueness of a new heteroatom in a phenethylamine system. But part was due to the strange manic excitement that occurred at the time of the isolation and characterizing of the final product in the laboratory. Although it was certainly all placebo response, I was jumpy and unable to stay in the lab for more than a few minutes at a time. Maybe dust in the air? Maybe some skin contact with the free base? Now, I know there was nothing, but the possibility of extraordinary potency was real, and I did indeed wash everything down anyway. In fact, it took a total of 18 trials to work the experimental dosage up to as much as a single milligram. In retrospect, overly cautious. But retrospection, as they say, is cheap.
> 
> 
> 
> The 5 milligram experiment, briefly quoted from above, is the stuff of Chapter 14 of this book, important in that it gives an interesting example of some thought processes associated with psychedelic intoxication, ego-inflation, and what might be thought of as bits of mania. As is always the case with peak experiences that happen to be catalyzed by drugs, this extraordinary event could not be duplicated. At 7 milligrams there was an uneventful +1, and some 10 milligrams was needed to generate a full +3 experience. The first clue of the erratic nature of the Aleph family came from an independent assay by a colleague of mine, one who was very familiar with such states of consciousness, but for whom this was not a time for peak experiences. At 10 milligrams he told me that he had had only mild effects which he found relatively uninteresting.

> As it stands, ALEPH remains relatively unexplored. Its two positional isomers are entered here as ORTHO-DOT and META-DOT. Three higher homologues have been more thoroughly looked at, and the generic name ALEPH (the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet) was given this group on the basis that they might have extraordinary properties in common. But the real treasure came in the exploring of the 2-carbon homologues, the compounds that make up the 2C-T family. Here, there proved to be much less uncertainty as to reasonable dosages, and much more richness in the subjective nature of the experience.

As for DOT,my 7.5mg trial wasn't particularly strong,it only lasted weeks (if I wouldn't have aborted it).10mg will give you a decent experience I guess.I wouldn't try 20mg right on,with the variance of the Alephs!

Man, I just checked out my DOT vial and the solution has turned a dirty yellowish color.  That means degradation, doesn't it?  Does anyone suppose it would still be safe to consume?  I'll post a picture sometime if necessary.  It sure would be a shame if this rarity became useless because I didn't experiment beyond my first.  It's just too long and strange a chemical to try very often.

im sure its still safe to consume.

if it degraded it probably just got weaker rather than turning into a more dangerous chemical.


if u see some sort of mold or something swimming around than id avoid it.

Distilled water with a bit of alcohol.  Either that or vodka.  I can't remember and it's not handy at the moment.  It's possible it's just water but I never do that so I doubt it.

no do not put on blotter tabs...WHY


so somebody can get confused and take it thinking its acid and have a really shitty first acid trip? ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


man just don't do it...even if your intentions are good it will somehow likely get distributed and be called acid at some point.


Aleph is a cool drug (toy-like sorta from the low doses I've taken although I'm sure this changes with high doses), its NOTHING LIKE LSD AND WILL NEVER SUBSTITUTE FOR LSD.


If you're looking for a LSD substitute then KEEP LOOKING BECAUSE THIS IS NOT IT.

It's dangerous to put this on blotter, as it's likely a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.  Aside from that, dosing with blotter paper is rather inaccurate.

Thioethers are likely to become sulfones via hydrolysis in H2O -- but sulfones are usually colourless so I doubt that's the final product, perhaps something intermediate to the coloured compound.  In the presence of chloride ions in the solution, it could possibly follow through to the sulfonyl chloride, which could be yellow.  Another possibility is the transient production of the sulfene, which would be yellow too.  These compounds would probably be very toxic in large amounts, but I'm not certain they would be in the tiny amounts you would ingest.

Well, in the event of the generation of the sulfonyl chloride (I guess two Cl- ions could attack the sulfone and pop off chloromethane and leave the sulfonyl chloride) it would react immediately with the amine of the molecule to form a very stable and nonreactive dimer-like sulfonamide product.  Perhaps this is also the cause of the yellowing, and this would not be toxic.  So maybe it's nothing to worry about at all.

Sorry, for personal use and responsible adults, the best thing to do is take the solution you have and put it on blotter paper. Cut it up into ~1mg squares and keep them in an amber vial labeled "ALEPH-1" just in case the kiddies get into your locked safe. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Well to be honest I was planning on printing it on 4 way squares that has a picture of one of lucky's charms. That way the 5th graders will be more inclined to try it. I sell to fifth graders cause they are up for new things seeing that they are about to move on to middle school and they are very willing to prove themselves 'cool'. Its an easy sell and a life time customer......


LOL...j/k i sell to the high schoolers.

ODB, I think the best thing to do is keep it in its powder form, and when it's time to dose, use volumetric measurement just for the amounts you need, as you need.

My aleph-1 has turned a nasty dirty brownish-yellow color in solution... it doesn't have anything floating in it (I previously thought it did). Anyone have a guess as to whether it's safe to use?  I'd love to try it out a few more times.  I had 3.5mg the first time and it was a bit weird, definitely not a full effect.  Any suggestions for what I should try next?  I suspect it could be slightly degraded.

might want to think about drying it out or something (evaporating on a dish).


just a thought, but it might halt whatever sort of bacteria is growing in there (did you sterilize the vial in boiling water before adding the solution?).

No, he didn't I don't think. I'm pretty sure this is coming from that recent "interview" with him where he mentioned the story behind ALEPH-1 (which is talked about in the first half of PiHKAL). His actual known favorite is 2C-B. Behind any chem he hasn't discovered yet of course.

I got a sample of this a while back.  I took 3.5mg.  I didn't like it a lot, and I love DOC, DOM, and DOI.  It wasn't bad, just kind of dissociating and uneventful.  There's a good chance a higher dosage would have done more.  Unfortunately my sample has been in liquid quite a while and the water has turned brown.  So I can't try it again. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Yeah.  3.5mg was too low so I think 5mg is a good place to start.  It's a bit shorter than the other DOXs I've tried (B, C, M, and I), but still pretty long of course.


I'd love to try it again at a higher dose.  Maybe I'll try evaporating the liquid in my solution as our smiling friend suggested to me last year in this thread... perhaps it hasn't been destroyed but has just been partially degraded or something?  I received either 15 or 20mg if I recall and I only used 3.5... it would be a damn shame if something so rare was gone without being used. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Thanks for the info guys.  So aleph and aleph-1 are the same?  Interesting this one.  Will give a go at 5mg next weekend.


Please stop pm'ing for a source, I wont give it.

Is ALEPH worth making? If you've tried it, did you enjoy it? How does it compare to 2C-T (the methylthio)?

Never tried 2C-T... I did try aleph-1 one time.  I tried it at I think 3.5mg, which is apparently a pretty low dose.  At that level I found it... strange (and I love DOXs).  The state was not enjoyable, it felt very bland and slightly uncomfortable, but not physically.  It was what I think of as the "Beth state" mentioned in PIHKAL.  I felt unmotivated, unemotional, uninterested, and flat-lined.  It's possible this was a function of the dose and that a higher dose would bring out desirable characteristics but considering I enjoy low doses of DOC or DOM, I am not sure that's the case.  And unfortunately the remainder of the sample I had received to test degraded in solution since I didn't try to use it again for a long time after my first trial.


Either way I have no desire to try it again.

Im very intrigued by this compound after reading its entry in pihkal. So naturally I was happy to see that its on the market again, what I wonder is if anyone here tried the new batch that is available? Would be a shame if it wasnt legit.


I also saw some tma-6 but DOT is higher on my todo list.

I have only hade the chance to sample this once at 2.7mg and i found it to be a very clean, clear euphoria for about 5-7H. Maybe not exactly baseline after 7h ut enough to sleep.


I will defiantly get some more!!! 


Insufflated 1mg until desired dosage is reached as some mention is that a good ide? anyone tried this?

When i tested this it was mentioned to me that with somewhat higher dosage it would turn more psychedelic.

So if you for example you make a nose spray with 0.5mg concentration it whould be easy to tapper up it. (Or maybe 2mg making it a perfect Euphoric journey to explore.)


I personally HATE aMT and cant for the love of god understand how anyone can compare it to that???? 


Well well next year we will start experimenting with this one if I'm of some bad habits. Looking forward to that moment

1 more note about the aMT is is a Tryptamine with a very strong body component to it and DOT was almost the opposite.

Just thought I’d throw in a few notes on Aleph-1/DOT with combinations as there isn’t much info available. I’ve taken it 3-4 times at about 4-9 mg. First 2 or 3 trials were about 4-5 years ago. It’s always been good to me, maybe some slight nausea and some muscle stiffness first time, but well within acceptable limits. It has a certain “drunkenness” to it that I do recognize from other sulphur containing phenethylamines, and a bit more of it than I get from 2C-T-2/7/21. Aleph-1/DOT share the same heartwarming and tactile enhancement I get from 2C-T-2/7/21, but than my psycho-physiology seem to appreciate the same characteristics in molecules as Shulgin did – and not everyone does.


Anyhow, this is a “dirty” mini report, today I insufflated 5-7 mg of Aleph-1/DOT divided in to 4 very small piles, with about 20 min in between. Fasting for 6 h before. I’ve insufflated Aleph-1/DOT before and expected it to be about twice as strong as orally. Not much of a burn snorting it. I did have quite a tolerance from plenty of 2C-B yesterday and 100 mcg ALD-52 a few days ago, so bear that in mind.


To anyone considering insufflating Aleph-1/DOT – be aware of the deaths from insufflating 2C-T-7 (- and 2C-T-21) and tread carefully considering that Aleph-1/DOT may have MAOI properties.

To complicate things I’d had 500 mg of pramiracetam, 100 mg of phenylracetam, 500 mg ALCAR, 400 mg of citicoline 8 h before and, 17 mg 3-MeO-PCE 3 hours before and about 5 mg THC an hour before. Hence my calling it a “dirty” report :^).


The effects were stronger than anticipated – though I had hoped for the pramiracetam, 3-MeO-PCE and THC to potentiate the Aleph-1/DOT. Still, less effect than without tolerance. I had zero bodyload and got in to a very positive mode – hadn’t even really been aware of that I was a bit low before. Music was wonderful as was touch. Got some energy to do things, did some yoga (really need to do yoga more often!), had a lovely forest walk up a hill to watch the sunset, colors were more saturated and looking at patterns in my Persian carpet it felt like they were just about to start moving – but they never did. Similar to what 10-12 mg of 2C-T-21 does in many ways. I find Aleph-1/DOT pro-social and with empathogenic qualities similar to 2C-T-2.


So with this very positive experience I may go for 10 mg orally without tolerance next time. I do wonder what it is that makes Aleph-1/DOT so “erratic” in the words of Shulgin, i.e. that the effect varies so much from time to time or person to person…


Hope it will become available again so more people get to try it! Love, wonder and wisdom to ya’all!
